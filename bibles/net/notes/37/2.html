<A NAME="21"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=33><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;In the seventh [month], on the twenty-first day of the month.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The <i>seventh month</i> was the month Tishri, according to the modern (Julian) calendar October 17, 520 <sc>b.c. The twenty-first day of Tishri marked the seventh day of the Feast of Tabernacles (Num 29:32-34). It also coincided with the date 440 years earlier (960 <sc>b.c.) when Solomon finished building his temple (1 Kgs 6:38; 8:2).</p>
<A NAME="22"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=34><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the word of the <sc>Lord came by the hand of Haggai the prophet, saying.&#8221; The MT has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1497;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿyad</font>, &#8220;by the hand of&#8221; = &#8220;through&#8221; [so NAB, NIV, NLT] as in 1:1, 3); the Murabba&#8217;at Dead Sea text reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>, &#8220;to&#8221;), perhaps because the following command is given to the prophet.</p>
<A NAME="23"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=35><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;say to&#8221;; NAB &#8220;Tell this to.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="24"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=36><b>tn</b> Many English versions have &#8220;Joshua (the) son of Jehozadak the high priest,&#8221; but this is subject to misunderstanding. See the note on the name &#8220;Jehozadak&#8221; at the end of v. 1.</p>
<A NAME="25"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=37><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;this house in its earlier splendor&#8221;; NAB, NIV, NRSV &#8220;in its former glory.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Solomon&#8217;s temple was demolished in 586 <sc>b.c., 66 years prior to Haggai&#8217;s time. There surely would have been some older people who remembered <i>the former splendor</i> of that magnificent structure and who lamented the contrast to the small, unimpressive temple they were building (see Ezra 3:8-13).</p>
<A NAME="26"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=38><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and take heart.&#8221; Although emphatic, the repetition of the verb is redundant in contemporary English style and has been left untranslated.</p>
<A NAME="27"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=39><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the people of the land&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1501; &#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">am ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arets</font>); this is a technical term referring to free citizens as opposed to slaves.</p>
<A NAME="28"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=40><b>sn</b> <i>My spirit</i>. It is theologically anachronistic to understand &#8220;spirit&#8221; here in the NT sense as a reference to the Holy Spirit, the third person of the Trinity; nevertheless during this postexilic period the conceptual groundwork was being laid for the doctrine of the Holy Spirit later revealed in the NT.</p>
<A NAME="29"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=41><b>tc</b> The MT of v. 5 reads &#8220;with the word which I cut with you when you went out from Egypt and my spirit [which] stands in your midst, do not fear.&#8221; <i>BHS</i> proposes emending &#8220;with the word&#8221; to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1465;&#1488;&#1514; &#1492;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">t habbÿrit</font>, &#8220;this is the covenant&#8221;) at the beginning of the verse. The proposed emendation makes excellent sense and is expected with the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">karat</font>, &#8220;cut&#8221; or &#8220;make&#8221; a covenant), but it has no textual support. Most English versions (including the present translation) therefore follow the MT here.</p>
<A NAME="210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=42><b>tc</b> The difficult MT reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491; &#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514; &#1502;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1496; &#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">od </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akhat mÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">at hi</font>&#8217;, &#8220;yet once, it is little&#8221;; cf. NAB &#8220;One moment yet, a little while&#8221;) appears as &#8220;yet once&#8221; in the LXX, omitting the last two Hebrew words. However, the point being made is that the anticipated action is imminent; thus the repetition provides emphasis.</p>
<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=43><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the heavens.&#8221; The same Hebrew word, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shamayim</font>), may be translated &#8220;sky&#8221; or &#8220;heavens&#8221; depending on the context. Although many English versions translate the term as &#8220;heavens&#8221; here, the other three elements present in this context (earth, sea, dry ground) suggest &#8220;sky&#8221; is in view.</p>
<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=44><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all the nations.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=45><b>tn</b> Though the subject here is singular (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1502;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khemdah</font>; &#8220;desire&#8221;), the preceding plural predicate mandates a collective subject, &#8220;desired (things)&#8221; or, better, an emendation to a plural form, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1458;&#1502;&#1467;&#1491;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khamudot</font>, &#8220;desirable [things],&#8221; hence &#8220;treasures&#8221;). Cf. ASV &#8220;the precious things&#8221;; NASB &#8220;the wealth&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;the treasure.&#8221; In the OT context this has no direct reference to the coming of the Messiah.</p>
<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=46><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;greater will be the latter splendor of this house than the former&#8221;; NAB &#8220;greater will be the future glory.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=47><b>tn</b> In the Hebrew text there is an implicit play on words in the clause &#8220;in this place [i.e., Jerusalem] I will give peace&#8221;: in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿrushalayim</font>) there will be <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shalom</font>).</p>
<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=48><b>sn</b> The <i>twenty-fourth day of the ninth month of Darius&#8217; second year</i> was Kislev 24 or December 18, 520 <sc>b.c.</p>
<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=49><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the word of the <sc>Lord came to Haggai the prophet, saying.&#8221; This Hebrew expression is slightly different from the one in 1:1, 3; 2:1.</p>
<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=50><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Ask the priests a torah, saying&#8221;; KJV &#8220;concerning the law&#8221;; NAB &#8220;for a decision&#8221;; NCV &#8220;for a teaching&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;for a ruling.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=51><b>sn</b> This is probably not an appeal to the Torah (i.e., the Pentateuch) as such but to a priestly ruling (known in postbiblical Judaism as a <font face="Scholar">pÿsaq din</font>). There is, however, a Mosaic law that provides the basis for the priestly ruling (Lev 6:27).</p>
<A NAME="220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=52><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;unclean of a person,&#8221; a euphemism for &#8220;unclean because of a dead person&#8221;; see Lev 21:11; Num 6:6. Cf. NAB &#8220;unclean from contact with a corpse.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=53><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;so this people, and so this nation before me.&#8221; In this context &#8220;people&#8221; and &#8220;nation&#8221; refer to the same set of individuals; the repetition is emphatic. Cf. CEV &#8220;this entire nation.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=54><b>sn</b> The point here is that the Jews cannot be made holy by unholy fellowship with their pagan neighbors; instead, they and their worship will become corrupted by such associations.</p>
<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=55><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and now set your heart from this day and upward.&#8221; The juxtaposition of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1506;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ma</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">lah</font>, &#8220;upward&#8221;) with the following <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1496;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mitterem</font>, &#8220;before&#8221;) demands a look to the past. Cf. ASV &#8220;consider from this day and backward.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=56><b>sn</b> <i>Before one stone was laid on another in the <sc>Lord&#8217;s temple</i> is best taken as referring to the laying of the present temple&#8217;s foundation, sixteen years earlier (536 <sc>b.c.; see Ezra 3:8). Cf. NCV &#8220;before you started laying stones&#8221;; TEV &#8220;before you started to rebuild&#8221;; NLT &#8220;before you began to lay (started laying CEV) the foundation.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=57><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from their being,&#8221; idiomatic for &#8220;from the time they were then,&#8221; or &#8220;since the time.&#8221; Cf. KJV &#8220;Since those days were.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=58><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you, all the work of your hands&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;you and all the products of your toil&#8221;; NIV &#8220;all the work of your hands.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=59><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and there was not with you.&#8221; The context favors the idea that the harvests were so poor that the people took care of only themselves, leaving no offering for the <sc>Lord. Cf. KJV and many English versions &#8220;yet ye turned not to me,&#8221; understanding the phrase to refer to the people&#8217;s repentance rather than their failure to bring offerings.</p>
<A NAME="228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=60><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;set your heart.&#8221; A similar expression occurs in v. 15.</p>
<A NAME="229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=61><b>sn</b> The <i>twenty-fourth day of the ninth month</i> was Kislev 24 or December 18, 520. See v. 10. Here the reference is to &#8220;today,&#8221; the day the oracle is being delivered.</p>
<A NAME="230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=62><b>sn</b> <i>The day work&#8230;was resumed</i>. This does not refer to the initial founding of the Jerusalem temple in 536 <sc>b.c. but to the renewal of construction three months earlier (see 1:15). This is clear from the situation described in v. 19 which accords with the food scarcities of that time already detailed in Hag 1:10-11.</p>
<A NAME="231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=63><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;set your heart.&#8221; A similar expression occurs in v. 15 and at the beginning of this verse.</p>
<A NAME="232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=64><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the word of the <sc>Lord came a second time to Haggai.&#8221; This Hebrew expression is like the one in 2:10 and is slightly different from the one in 1:1, 3; 2:1.</p>
<A NAME="233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=65><b>sn</b> Again, <i>the twenty-fourth day of the month</i> was Kislev 24 or December 18, 520 <sc>b.c. See v. 10.</p>
<A NAME="234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=66><b>tn</b> The participle here suggests an imminent undertaking of action (cf. NRSV, TEV, NLT &#8220;I am about to&#8221;). The overall language of the passage is eschatological, but eschatology finds its roots in the present.</p>
<A NAME="235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=67><b>tn</b> See the note on the word &#8220;sky&#8221; in 2:6. Most English translations render the Hebrew term as &#8220;heavens&#8221; here.</p>
<A NAME="236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=68><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the kingdoms of the nations.&#8221; Cf. KJV &#8220;the kingdoms of the heathen&#8221;; NIV, NLT &#8220;foreign kingdoms.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=69><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and horses and their riders will go down, a man with a sword his brother&#8221;; KJV &#8220;every one by the sword of his brother.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=70><b>sn</b> The expression <i>on that day</i> appears as a technical eschatological term in a number of other OT passages (cf., e.g., Isa 2:11, 17, 20; 3:7, 18; Amos 8:3, 9; Hos 2:18, 21).</p>
<A NAME="239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=71><b>sn</b> <i>My servant</i>. The collocation of &#8220;servant&#8221; and &#8220;chosen&#8221; bears strong messianic overtones. See the so-called &#8220;Servant Songs&#8221; and other messianic texts in Isaiah (Isa 41:8; 42:1; 44:4; 49:7).</p>
<A NAME="240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=72><b>sn</b> The noun <i>signet ring</i>, used also to describe Jehoiachin (Jer 22:24-30), refers to a ring seal worn by a king or other important person and used as his signature. Zerubbabel was a grandson of King Jehoiachin (1 Chr 3:17-19; Matt 1:12); God once pronounced that none of Jehoiachin&#8217;s immediate descendants would rule (Jer 22:24-30), but here he reverses that judgment. Zerubbabel never ascended to such a lofty position of rulership; he is rather a prototype of the Messiah who would sit on David&#8217;s throne.</p>
<A NAME="241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=73><b>tn</b> The repetition of the formula &#8220;says the <sc>Lord who rules over all&#8221; in v. 23 emphasizes the solemn and divine nature of the promise.</p>
