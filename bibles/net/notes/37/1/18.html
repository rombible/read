<a name="18"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=8><b>sn</b> <i>Richly paneled houses</i>. Paneling is otherwise known in the OT only in connection with the temple (1 Kgs 6:9) and the royal palace (2 Kgs 7:3, 7). It implies decoration and luxury (cf. NCV &#8220;fancy houses&#8221;; TEV &#8220;well-built houses&#8221;; NLT &#8220;luxurious houses&#8221;). The impropriety of the people living in such lavish accommodations while the temple lay unfinished is striking.</p>
