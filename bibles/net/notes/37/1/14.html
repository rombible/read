<a name="14"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4><b>tn</b> The typical translation &#8220;Joshua (the) son of Jehozadak, the high priest&#8221; (cf. ASV, NASB, NIV, NRSV) can be understood to mean that Jehozadak was high priest. However, Zech 3:1, 8 clearly indicates that Joshua was high priest (see also Ezra 5:1-2; cf. NAB). The same potential misunderstanding occurs in Hag 1:12, 14 and 2:2, where the same solution has been employed in the translation.</p>
