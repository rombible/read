<A NAME="63"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=456><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the Hellenists,&#8221; but this descriptive term is largely unknown to the modern English reader. The translation &#8220;Greek-speaking Jews&#8221; attempts to convey something of who these were, but it was more than a matter of language spoken; it involved a degree of adoption of Greek culture as well.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The Greek-speaking Jews</i> were the Hellenists, Jews who to a greater or lesser extent had adopted Greek thought, customs, and lifestyle, as well as the Greek language. The city of Alexandria in Egypt was a focal point for them, but they were scattered throughout the Roman Empire.</p>
<A NAME="64"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=457><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;against the Hebrews,&#8221; but as with &#8220;Hellenists&#8221; this needs further explanation for the modern reader.</p>
<A NAME="65"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=458><b>sn</b> The care of <i>widows</i> is a major biblical theme: Deut 10:18; 16:11, 14; 24:17, 19-21; 26:12-13; 27:19; Isa 1:17-23; Jer 7:6; Mal 3:5.</p>

<A NAME="67"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=460><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;in the daily serving.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The daily distribution of food.</i> The early church saw it as a responsibility to meet the basic needs of people in their group.</p>
<A NAME="68"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=461><b>sn</b> <i>The twelve</i> refers to the twelve apostles.</p>
<A NAME="69"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=462><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;calling the whole group&#8230;together, said.&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#963;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">proskalesamenoi</font>) has been translated as a finite verb due to requirements of contemporary English style.</p>
<A NAME="610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=463><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the multitude.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=465><b>tn</b> It is not clear from a historical standpoint (but it is unlikely) that women would have been involved in the selection process too. For this reason the translation &#8220;brothers&#8221; has been retained, rather than &#8220;brothers and sisters&#8221; (used in contexts where both male and female believers are clearly addressed).</p>
<A NAME="613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=466><b>sn</b><i> Seven.</i> Jewish town councils often had seven members (Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 4.18.14 [4.214]).</p>

<A NAME="617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=470><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And the.&#8221; Because of the difference between Greek style, which often begins sentences or clauses with &#8220;and,&#8221; and English style, which generally does not, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has not been translated here.</p>
<A NAME="618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=471><b>tn</b> The translation &#8220;so&#8221; has been used to indicate the logical sequence in English.</p>
<A NAME="619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=472><b>tn</b> &#8220;With&#8221; is smoother English style for an addition like this. Because of differences between Greek and English style, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>), which occurs between each name in the list, has not been translated except preceding the last element.</p>
<A NAME="620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=473><b>sn</b> <i>Philip.</i> Note how many of the names in this list are Greek. This suggests that Hellenists were chosen to solve the problem they had been so sensitive about fixing (cf. 6:1).</p>
<A NAME="621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=474><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;a proselyte.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=476><b>tn</b> Literally this is a participle in the Greek text (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#949;&#965;&#958;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</font>, <font face="Greektl">proseuxamenoi</font>). It could be translated as a finite verb (&#8220;and they prayed and placed their hands on them&#8221;) but much smoother English results if the entire coordinate clause is converted to a relative clause that refers back to the apostles.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Who prayed.</i> The prayer indicates their acceptance and commissioning for ministry (cf. Deut 34:9).</p>
<A NAME="624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=477><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;laid.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="625"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=478><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;kept on spreading&#8221;; the verb has been translated as a progressive imperfect.</p>
<A NAME="626"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=479><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="627"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=480><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;a great multitude.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>A large group.</i> Many Jews, even some religious leaders, were responding.</p>
<A NAME="628"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=481><b>tn</b> The miraculous nature of these signs is implied in the context. Here the work of miracles extends beyond the Twelve for the first time.</p>
<A NAME="629"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=482><b>sn</b> A s<i>ynagogue</i> was a place for Jewish prayer and worship, with recognized leadership (cf. Luke 8:41). Though the origin of the synagogue is not entirely clear, it seems to have arisen in the postexilic community during the intertestamental period. A town could establish a synagogue if there were at least ten men. In normative Judaism of the NT period, the OT scripture was read and discussed in the synagogue by the men who were present (see the Mishnah, <i>m. Megillah</i> 3-4; <i>m. Berakhot</i> 2).</p>
<A NAME="630"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=483><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the so-called Synagogue of the Freedmen.&#8221; The translation of the participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#949;&#947;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">legomenh&quot;</font>) by the phrase &#8220;as it was called&#8221; is given by L&amp;N 87.86. &#8220;Freedmen&#8221; would be slaves who had gained their freedom, or the descendants of such people (BDAG 594-95 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#923;&#953;&#946;&#949;&#961;&#964;&#8150;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font>).</p>
<A NAME="631"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=484><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;Asia&#8221;; in the NT this always refers to the Roman province of Asia, made up of about one-third of the west and southwest end of modern Asia Minor. Asia lay to the west of the region of Phrygia and Galatia. The words &#8220;the province of&#8221; are supplied to indicate to the modern reader that this does not refer to the continent of Asia.</p>
<A NAME="632"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=485><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;and.&#8221; The context, however, indicates that the conjunction carries an adversative force.</p>
<A NAME="633"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=486><b>sn</b> <i>They were not able to resist.</i> This represents another fulfillment of Luke 12:11-12; 21:15.</p>
<A NAME="634"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=487><b>tn</b> Another translation would be &#8220;they suborned&#8221; (but this term is not in common usage). &#8220;<i>Instigate (secretly), suborn</i>&#8221; is given by BDAG 1036 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#960;&#959;&#946;&#940;&#955;&#955;&#969;</font>.</p>
<A NAME="635"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=488><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;heard him&#8221;; but since this is direct discourse, it is more natural (and clearer) to specify the referent (Stephen) as &#8220;this man.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="636"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=489><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;and the,&#8221; but <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has not been translated since English normally uses a coordinating conjunction only between the last two elements in a series of three or more.</p>
<A NAME="637"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=490><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;and the scribes.&#8221; See the note on the phrase &#8220;experts in the law&#8221; in 4:5.</p>
<A NAME="638"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=491><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;approaching, they seized him&#8221;; the referent (Stephen) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="639"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=492><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the Sanhedrin&#8221; (the highest legal, legislative, and judicial body among the Jews). Stephen suffers just as Peter and John did.</p>
<A NAME="640"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=493><b>sn</b> <i>This holy place</i> is a reference to the temple.</p>
<A NAME="641"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=494><b>sn</b> <i>The law</i> refers to the law of Moses. It elaborates the nature of the blasphemy in v. 11. To speak against God&#8217;s law in Torah was to blaspheme God (Deut 28:15-19). On the Jewish view of false witnesses, see Exod 19:16-18; 20:16; <i>m. Sanhedrin</i> 3.6; 5.1-5. Stephen&#8217;s speech in Acts 7 may indicate why the temple was mentioned.</p>
<A NAME="642"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=495><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;practices.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Will destroy this place and change the customs.</i> Stephen appears to view the temple as a less central place in light of Christ&#8217;s work, an important challenge to Jewish religion, since it was at this time a temple-centered state and religion. Unlike Acts 3-4, the issue here is more than Jesus and his resurrection. Now the impact of his resurrection and the temple&#8217;s centrality has also become an issue. The &#8220;falseness&#8221; of the charge may not be that the witnesses were lying, but that they falsely read the truth of Stephen&#8217;s remarks.</p>
<A NAME="643"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=496><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And all.&#8221; Because of the difference between Greek style, which often begins sentences or clauses with &#8220;and,&#8221; and English style, which generally does not, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has not been translated here.</p>
<A NAME="644"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=497><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Sanhedrin&#8221; (the highest legal, legislative, and judicial body among the Jews).</p>
<A NAME="645"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=498><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;at him&#8221;; the referent (Stephen) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="646"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=499><b>sn</b> <i>His face was like the face of an angel.</i> This narrative description of Stephen&#8217;s <i>face</i> adds to the mood of the passage. He had the appearance of a supernatural, heavenly messenger.</p>
