<A NAME="19140"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">140</span><note=2129><b>sn</b> <i>Nor blasphemers of our goddess. </i>There was no formal crime with which Paul could be charged. He had the right to his religion as long as he did not act physically against the temple. Since no overt act had taken place, the official wanted the community to maintain the status quo on these religious matters. The remarks suggest Paul was innocent of any civil crime.</p>
