<A NAME="1953"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=2042><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;and beating them all into submission.&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#954;&#965;&#961;&#953;&#949;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">katakurieusa&quot;</font>) has been translated as a finite verb due to requirements of contemporary English style. According to W. Foerster, <i>TDNT</i> 3:1098, the word means &#8220;the exercise of dominion against someone, i.e., to one&#8217;s own advantage.&#8221; These exorcists were shown to be powerless in comparison to Jesus who was working through Paul.</p>
