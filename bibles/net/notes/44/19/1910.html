<A NAME="1910"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1999><b>tn</b> This use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#940;</font> (<font face="Greektl">alla</font>) is ascensive and involves an ellipsis (BDAG 45 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#940;</font> 3): &#8220;No, [not only did we not receive the Spirit,] but also we have not heard that there is a Holy Spirit.&#8221; However, this is lengthy and somewhat awkward in English, and the ascensive meaning can be much more easily represented by including the word &#8220;even&#8221; after the negation. Apparently these disciples were unaware of the provision of the Spirit that is represented in baptism. The language sounds like they did not know about a Holy Spirit, but this seems to be only linguistic shorthand for not knowing about the Spirit&#8217;s presence (Luke 3:15-18). The situation is parallel to that of Apollos. Apollos and these disciples represent those who &#8220;complete&#8221; their transition to messianic faith as Jews.</p>
