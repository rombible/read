<A NAME="1934"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2023><b>tn</b> The &#8220;lecture hall&#8221; was a place where teachers and pupils met. The term is a NT <i>hapax legomenon </i>(BDAG 982 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#967;&#959;&#955;&#8053;</font>). L&amp;N 7.14 notes, &#8220;it is better to use a translation such as &#8216;lecture hall&#8217; rather than &#8216;school,&#8217; since one does not wish to give the impression of the typical classroom situation characteristic of present-day schools.&#8221;</p>
