<A NAME="2395"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">95</span><note=2660><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;writing.&#8221; Due to the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was begun here in the translation, supplying &#8220;he&#8221; (referring to the commanding officer, Claudius Lysias) as subject. The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#961;&#940;&#968;&#945;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">grayas</font>) has been translated as a finite verb due to requirements of contemporary English style.</p>
