<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;produced,&#8221; <i>Grk</i> &#8220;made.&#8221;</p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;first.&#8221; The translation &#8220;former&#8221; is preferred because &#8220;first&#8221; could imply to the modern English reader that the author means that his previous account was the first one to be written down. The Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#8182;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">prwtos</font>) does not necessarily mean &#8220;first&#8221; in an absolute sense, but can refer to the first in a set or series. That is what is intended here &#8211; the first account (known as the Gospel of Luke) as compared to the second one (known as Acts).</p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3><b>tn</b> The Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">logos</font>) is sometimes translated &#8220;book&#8221; (NRSV, NIV) or &#8220;treatise&#8221; (KJV). A formal, systematic treatment of a subject is implied, but the word &#8220;book&#8221; may be too specific and slightly misleading to the modern reader, so &#8220;account&#8221; has been used.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The former account</i> refers to the Gospel of Luke, which was &#8220;volume one&#8221; of the two-volume work Luke-Acts.</p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;O Theophilus,&#8221; but the usage of the vocative in Acts with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8038;</font> (<font face="Greektl">w</font>) is unemphatic, following more the classical idiom (see <i>ExSyn</i> 69).</p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;to heaven&#8221; are not in the Greek text, but are supplied from v. 11. Several modern translations (NIV, NRSV) supply the words &#8220;to heaven&#8221; after &#8220;taken up&#8221; to specify the destination explicitly mentioned later in 1:11.</p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=6><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;commands.&#8221; Although some modern translations render <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#955;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">enteilameno&quot;</font>) as &#8220;instructions&#8221; (NIV, NRSV), the word implies authority or official sanction (G. Schrenk, <i>TDNT</i> 2:545), so that a word like &#8220;orders&#8221; conveys the idea more effectively. The action of the temporal participle is antecedent (prior) to the action of the verb it modifies (&#8220;taken up&#8221;).</p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=7><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;through.&#8221;</p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=8><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;to them&#8221;; the referent (the apostles) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=9><b>sn</b> <i>After his suffering</i> is a reference to Jesus&#8217; crucifixion and the abuse which preceded it.</p>
<a name="110"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=10><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;during forty days.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;over a forty-day period&#8221; is used rather than &#8220;during forty days&#8221; because (as the other NT accounts of Jesus&#8217; appearances make clear) Jesus was not continually visible to the apostles during the forty days, but appeared to them on various occasions.</p>
<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;While he was assembling with them,&#8221; or &#8220;while he was sharing a meal with them.&#8221; There are three basic options for translating the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#955;&#943;&#950;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">sunalizw</font>): (1) &#8220;Eat (salt) with, share a meal with&#8221;; (2) &#8220;bring together, assemble&#8221;; (3) &#8220;spend the night with, stay with&#8221; (see BDAG 964 s.v.). The difficulty with the first option is that it does not fit the context, and this meaning is not found elsewhere. The second option is difficult because of the singular number and the present tense. The third option is based on a spelling variation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#965;&#955;&#953;&#950;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">sunaulizomeno&quot;</font>), which some minuscules actually read here. The difference in meaning between (2) and (3) is not great, but (3) seems to fit the context somewhat better here.</p>
<a name="112"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=12><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;ordered them&#8221;; the command &#8220;Do not leave&#8221; is not in Greek but is an indirect quotation in the original (see note at end of the verse for explanation).</p>
<a name="113"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=13><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<a name="114"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=14><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;there&#8221; is not in the Greek text (direct objects in Greek were frequently omitted when clear from the context).</p>
<a name="115"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=15><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the,&#8221; with the article used as a possessive pronoun (<i>ExSyn</i> 215).</p>
<a name="116"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=16><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;for the promise of the Father.&#8221; Jesus is referring to the promised gift of the Holy Spirit (see the following verse).</p>
<a name="117"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=17><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;While he was with them, he ordered them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait there for &#8216;what my Father promised, which you heard about from me.&#8217;&#8221; This verse moves from indirect to direct discourse. This abrupt change is very awkward, so the entire quotation has been rendered as direct discourse in the translation.</p>
<a name="118"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=18><b>tn</b> In the Greek text v. 5 is a continuation of the previous sentence, which is long and complicated. In keeping with the tendency of contemporary English to use shorter sentences, a new sentence was started here in the translation.</p>
<a name="119"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=19><b>tn</b> The pronoun is plural in Greek.</p>

The imperfect tense of the Greek verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7968;&#961;&#8061;&#964;&#969;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">hrwtwn</font>) has been translated as an ingressive imperfect.</p>

<a name="127"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=27><b>tc</b> Codex Bezae (D) and several other witnesses lack the words <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#959;&#8016;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#972;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ei&quot; ton ouranon</font>, &#8220;into heaven&#8221;) here, most likely by way of accidental deletion. In any event, it is hardly correct to suppose that the Western text has intentionally suppressed references to the ascension of Christ here, for the phrase is solidly attested in the final clause of the verse.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;into the sky.&#8221; The Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ouranos</font>) may be translated &#8220;sky&#8221; (vv. 10, 11a) or &#8220;heaven&#8221; (twice in v. 11b) depending on the context.</p>
