A trial would now be needed to resolve the matter. The Roman authorities&#8217; hesitation to render a judgment in the case occurs repeatedly: Acts 22:30; 23:28-29; 24:22; 25:20, 26-27. The legal process begun here would take the rest of Acts and will be unresolved at the end. The process itself took four years of Paul&#8217;s life.</p>
