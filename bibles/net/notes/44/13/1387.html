<A NAME="1387"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">87</span><note=1298><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;about whom.&#8221; The relative pronoun (&#8220;whom&#8221;) was replaced by the pronoun &#8220;him&#8221; and a new sentence was begun in the translation at this point to improve the English style, due to the length of the sentence in Greek. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">eipen</font>) has not been translated (literally &#8220;he said testifying&#8221;) because it is redundant when combined with the participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#965;&#961;&#8053;&#963;&#945;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">marturhsa&quot;</font>, &#8220;testifying&#8221;). Instead the construction of verb plus participle has been translated as a single English verb (&#8220;testified&#8221;).</p>
