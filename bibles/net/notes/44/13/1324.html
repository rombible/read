<A NAME="1324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1235><b>sn</b> <i>Named Bar-Jesus.</i> &#8220;Jesus&#8221; is the Latin form of the name &#8220;Joshua.&#8221; The Aramaic &#8220;<i>bar</i>&#8221; means &#8220;son of,&#8221; so this man was surnamed &#8220;son of Joshua.&#8221; The scene depicts the conflict between Judaism and the emerging new faith at a cosmic level, much like the Simon Magus incident in Acts 8:9-24. Paul&#8217;s ministry looks like Philip&#8217;s and Peter&#8217;s here.</p>
