<A NAME="1386"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">86</span><note=1297><b>sn</b> The expression <i>raised up</i> refers here to making someone king. There is a wordplay here: &#8220;raising up&#8221; refers to bringing someone onto the scene of history, but it echoes with the parallel to Jesus&#8217; resurrection.</p>
