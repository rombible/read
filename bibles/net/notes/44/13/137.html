<A NAME="137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1218><b>tn</b> This term is frequently used in the LXX of the service performed by priests and Levites in the tabernacle (Exod 28:35, 43; 29:30; 30:20; 35:19; 39:26; Num 1:50; 3:6, 31) and the temple (2 Chr 31:2; 35:3; Joel 1:9, 13; 2:17, and many more examples). According to BDAG 591 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#949;&#953;&#964;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#947;&#941;&#969;</font> 1.b it is used &#8220;of other expression of religious devotion.&#8221; Since the previous verse described the prophets and teachers in the church at Antioch, it is probable that the term here describes two of them (Barnabas and Saul) as they were serving in that capacity. Since they were not in Jerusalem where the temple was located, general religious service is referred to here.</p>
