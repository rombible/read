<A NAME="1358"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=1269><b>tn</b> Normally <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#953;&#963;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#947;&#969;&#947;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">arcisunagwgo&quot;</font>) refers to the &#8220;<i>president of a synagogue</i>&#8221; (so BDAG 139 s.v. and L&amp;N 53.93). Since the term is plural here, however, and it would sound strange to the English reader to speak of &#8220;the presidents of the synagogue,&#8221; the alternative translation &#8220;leaders&#8221; is used. &#8220;Rulers&#8221; would also be acceptable, but does not convey quite the same idea.</p>
