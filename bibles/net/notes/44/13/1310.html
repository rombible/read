<A NAME="1310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1221><b>tn</b> Normally English style, which uses a coordinating conjunction between only the last two elements of a series of three or more, would call for omission of &#8220;and&#8221; here. However, since the terms &#8220;fasting and prayer&#8221; are something of a unit, often linked together, the conjunction has been retained here.</p>
