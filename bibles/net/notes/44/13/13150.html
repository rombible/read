<A NAME="13150"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">150</span><note=1361><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;from everything from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses.&#8221; The passive construction has been converted to an active one in the translation, with &#8220;by the law of Moses&#8221; becoming the subject of the final clause. The words &#8220;from everything from which the law of Moses could not justify you&#8221; are part of v. 38 in the Greek text, but due to English style and word order must be placed in v. 39 in the translation.</p>
