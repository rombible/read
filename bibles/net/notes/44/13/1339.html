<A NAME="1339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1250><b>sn</b> The term translated <i>mistiness</i> here appears in the writings of the physician Galen as a medical technical description of a person who is blind. The picture of judgment to darkness is symbolic as well. Whatever power Elymas had, it represented darkness. Magic will again be an issue in Acts 19:18-19. This judgment is like that of Ananias and his wife in Acts 5:1-11.</p>
