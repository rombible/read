<A NAME="13162"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">162</span><note=1373><b>tn</b> Normally the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#949;&#946;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#952;&#949;&#972;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">sebomenoi ton qeon</font>) refers to Gentiles (&#8220;God-fearers&#8221;) who believed in God, attended the synagogue, and followed the Mosaic law to some extent, but stopped short of undergoing circumcision. BDAG 918 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#941;&#946;&#969;</font> 1.b lists in this category references in Acts 16:14; 18:7; with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#949;&#946;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</font> alone, Acts 13:50; 17:4, 17; the phrase is also found in Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 14.7.2 (14.110). Unique to this particular verse is the combination <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#949;&#946;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#951;&#955;&#973;&#964;&#969;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">sebomenoi proshlutwn</font>). Later rabbinic discussion suggests that to be regarded as a proper proselyte, a Gentile male had to submit to circumcision. If that is the case here, these Gentiles in the synagogue at Pisidian Antioch should be regarded as full proselytes who had converted completely to Judaism and undergone circumcision. It is probably more likely, however, that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#951;&#955;&#973;&#964;&#969;&#957;</font> is used here in a somewhat looser sense (note the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#949;&#946;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#945;&#962;</font> [<font face="Greektl">sebomena&quot;</font>] alone to refer to women in Acts 13:50) and that these Gentiles were still in the category commonly called &#8220;God-fearers&#8221; without being full, technical proselytes to Judaism. See further K. G. Kuhn, <i>TDNT</i> 6:732-34, 743-44. Regardless, the point is that many Gentiles, as well as Jews, came to faith.</p>
