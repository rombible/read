<A NAME="13170"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">170</span><note=1381><b>tn</b> The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#946;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#966;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#8166;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">blasfhmounte&quot;</font>) has been regarded as indicating the means of the action of the main verb. It could also be translated as a finite verb (&#8220;and reviled him&#8221;) in keeping with contemporary English style. The direct object (&#8220;him&#8221;) is implied rather than expressed and could be impersonal (&#8220;it,&#8221; referring to what Paul was saying rather than Paul himself), but the verb occurs more often in contexts involving defamation or slander against personal beings (not always God). For a very similar context to this one, compare Acts 18:6. The translation &#8220;blaspheme&#8221; is not used because in contemporary English its meaning is more narrowly defined and normally refers to blasphemy against God (not what Paul&#8217;s opponents were doing here). The modern term &#8220;slandering&#8221; comes close to what was being done to Paul here.</p>
