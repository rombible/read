<A NAME="13130"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">130</span><note=1341><b>tn</b> Although <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#951;&#954;&#941;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">mhketi</font>) can mean &#8220;no longer&#8221; or &#8220;no more,&#8221; the latter is more appropriate here, since to translate &#8220;no longer&#8221; in this context could give the reader the impression that Jesus did experience decay before his resurrection. Since the phrase &#8220;no more again to be&#8221; is somewhat awkward in English, the simpler phrase &#8220;never again to be&#8221; was used instead.</p>
