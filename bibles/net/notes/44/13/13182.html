<A NAME="13182"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">182</span><note=1393><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;glorify.&#8221; Although &#8220;honor&#8221; is given by BDAG 258 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#958;&#940;&#950;&#969;</font> as a translation, it would be misleading here, because the meaning is &#8220;to honor in the sense of attributing worth to something,&#8221; while in contemporary English usage one speaks of &#8220;honoring&#8221; a contract in the sense of keeping its stipulations. It is not a synonym for &#8220;obey&#8221; in this context (&#8220;obey the word of the Lord&#8221;), but that is how many English readers would understand it.</p>
