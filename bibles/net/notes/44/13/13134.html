<A NAME="13134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">134</span><note=1345><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the trustworthy decrees made by God to David.&#8221; The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8048; &#8005;&#963;&#953;&#945; &#916;&#945;&#965;&#8054;&#948; &#964;&#8048; &#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#940;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ta Josia Dauid ta pista</font>) is &#8220;compressed,&#8221; that is, in a very compact or condensed form. It could be expanded in several different ways. BDAG 728 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#962;</font> 3 understands it to refer to divine decrees: &#8220;I will grant you the sure decrees of God relating to David.&#8221; BDAG then states that this quotation from Isa 55:3 is intended to show that the following quotation from Ps 16:10 could not refer to David himself, but must refer to his messianic descendant (Jesus). L&amp;N 33.290 render the phrase &#8220;I will give to you the divine promises made to David, promises that can be trusted,&#8221; although they also note that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8048; &#8005;&#963;&#953;&#945;</font> in Acts 13:34 can mean &#8220;divine decrees&#8221; or &#8220;decrees made by God.&#8221; In contemporary English it is less awkward to translate <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#940;</font> as an adjective (&#8220;trustworthy&#8221;). The concept of &#8220;divine decrees,&#8221; not very understandable to the modern reader, has been replaced by &#8220;promises,&#8221; and since God is the implied speaker in the context, it is clear that these promises were made by God.</p>
