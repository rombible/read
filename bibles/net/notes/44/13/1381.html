<A NAME="1381"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">81</span><note=1292><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;all this took&#8221; are not in the Greek text, but are supplied to make a complete statement in English. There is debate over where this period of 450 years fits and what it includes: (1) It could include the years in Egypt, the conquest of Canaan, and the distribution of the land; (2) some connect it with the following period of the judges. This latter approach seems to conflict with 1 Kgs 6:1; see also Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 8.3.1 (8.61).</p>
