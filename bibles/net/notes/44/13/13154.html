<A NAME="13154"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">154</span><note=1365><b>sn</b> A quotation from Hab 1:5. The irony in the phrase <i>even if someone tells you</i>, of course, is that Paul has now told them. So the call in the warning is to believe or else face the peril of being scoffers whom God will judge. The parallel from Habakkuk is that the nation failed to see how Babylon&#8217;s rising to power meant perilous judgment for Israel.</p>
