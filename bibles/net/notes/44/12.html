<A NAME="121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1123><b>sn</b> <i>King Herod</i> was Herod Agrippa I, the grandson of Herod I (Herod the Great). His mediocre career is summarized in Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 18-19. This event took place in <sc>a.d. 42 or 43.</p>
<A NAME="122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1124><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;King Herod had some from the church arrested.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1125><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;to cause them injury.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1126><b>sn</b> The expression <i>executed with a sword</i> probably refers to a beheading. James was the first known apostolic martyr (Eusebius, <i>Eccl. Hist.</i> 2.9.1-3). On James, not the Lord&#8217;s brother, see Luke 5:10; 6:14. This death ended a short period of peace noted in Acts 9:31 after the persecution mentioned in 8:1-3.</p>
<A NAME="125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1127><b>tn</b> This could be a reference to the Jewish people (so CEV) or to the Jewish leaders (so NLT). The statement in v. 4 that Herod intended to bring Peter &#8220;out to the people&#8221; (i.e., for a public trial) may suggest the former is somewhat more likely.</p>
<A NAME="126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1128><b>sn</b> This is a parenthetical note by the author.</p>
<A NAME="127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1129><b>sn</b> <i>Four squads of soldiers.</i> Each <i>squad</i> was a detachment of four soldiers.</p>
<A NAME="128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1130><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;guard him, planning to bring him out.&#8221; The Greek construction continues with a participle (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">boulomeno&quot;</font>) and an infinitive (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#947;&#945;&#947;&#949;&#8150;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">anagagein</font>), but this creates an awkward and lengthy sentence in English. Thus a reference to Herod was introduced as subject and the participle translated as a finite verb (&#8220;Herod planned&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1131><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;intended&#8221;; <i>Grk</i> &#8220;wanted.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1132><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;to bring him out to the people,&#8221; but in this context a public trial (with certain condemnation as the result) is doubtless what Herod planned. L&amp;N 15.176 translates this phrase &#8220;planning to bring him up for a public trial after the Passover.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1133><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;constantly.&#8221; This term also appears in Luke 22:14 and Acts 26:7.</p>
<A NAME="1212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1134><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;but earnest prayer was being made by the church to God for him.&#8221; The order of the clauses has been rearranged to follow English style, and the somewhat awkward passive &#8220;prayer was being made&#8221; has been changed to the simpler active verb &#8220;were praying.&#8221; Luke portrays what follows as an answer to prayer.</p>
<A NAME="1213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1135><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;was going to bring him out,&#8221; but the upcoming trial is implied. See Acts 12:4.</p>
<A NAME="1214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1136><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;two chains, and.&#8221; Logically it makes better sense to translate this as a temporal clause, although technically it is a coordinate clause in Greek.</p>
<A NAME="1215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1137><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;were guarding.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1138><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And behold.&#8221; Because of the difference between Greek style, which often begins sentences or clauses with &#8220;and,&#8221; and English style, which generally does not, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has not been translated here. The interjection <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7984;&#948;&#959;&#973; </font>(<font face="Greektl">idou</font>), often difficult to translate into English, expresses the suddenness of the angel&#8217;s appearance.</p>
<A NAME="1217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1139><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the angel of the Lord.&#8221; See the note on the word &#8220;Lord&#8221; in 5:19. </p>
<A NAME="1218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1140><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;striking the side of Peter, he awoke him saying.&#8221; The term refers to a push or a light tap (BDAG 786 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#964;&#940;&#963;&#963;&#969;</font> 1.a). The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#964;&#940;&#958;&#945;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pataxa&quot;</font>) has been translated as a finite verb due to requirements of contemporary English style.</p>

More likely he had merely removed his belt or sash, which the angel now told him to replace. The translation &#8220;put on your belt&#8221; is given by L&amp;N 49.14 for this verse. The archaic English &#8220;girdle&#8221; for the sash or belt has an entirely different meaning today.</p>

The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#945;&#943;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">mainomai</font>) can have the idea of being &#8220;raving mad&#8221; or &#8220;totally irrational&#8221; (BDAG 610 s.v.).

Most translations supply a less awkward English phrase like &#8220;it was so&#8221;; the force of her insistence, however, is that &#8220;it was Peter,&#8221; which was the point under dispute.</p>

Although it is possible that the pronoun was deleted because it was seen as superfluous, it is also possible that it was added as a natural expansion on the text, strengthening the connection between Peter and his listeners. Although a decision is difficult, the shorter reading is slightly preferred. NA<sup>27 </sup>puts the pronoun in brackets, indicating some doubts as to its authenticity.</p>

Since Herod has been the subject of the preceding material, and the circumstances of his death are the subject of the following verses (20-23), it is best to understand Herod as the subject here. This is especially true since according to Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 19.8.2 [19.343-352], Herod Agrippa I died at Caesarea in <sc>a.d. 44, and vv. 20-23 here describe his death. Thus the end of v. 19 provides Luke&#8217;s transition to explain how Herod got from Jerusalem to Caesarea where he died. In spite of all this evidence, the NRSV translates this phrase &#8220;Then Peter went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there,&#8221; understanding the referent to be Peter rather than Herod Agrippa I.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>King Herod</i> was Herod Agrippa I, the grandson of Herod I (Herod the Great), who died at Caesarea in <sc>a.d. 44 according to Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 19.8.2 [19.343-352].</p>

The account by Josephus, while not identical to Luke&#8217;s account, is similar in many respects: On the second day of a festival, Herod Agrippa appeared in the theater with a robe made of silver. When it sparkled in the sun, the people cried out flatteries and declared him to be a god. The king, carried away by the flattery, saw an owl (an omen of death) sitting on a nearby rope, and immediately was struck with severe stomach pains. He was carried off to his house and died five days later. The two accounts can be reconciled without difficulty, since while Luke states that Herod was immediately struck down by an angel, his death could have come several days later. The mention of <i>worms</i> with death adds a humiliating note to the scene. The formerly powerful ruler had been thoroughly reduced to nothing (cf. Jdt 16:17; 2 Macc 9:9; cf. also Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 17.6.5 [17.168-170], which details the sickness which led to Herod the Great&#8217;s death). </p>

<A NAME="1285"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">85</span><note=1207><b>tc</b> There are a number of variants at this point in the text: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">eis</font>, &#8220;to&#8221;) in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> sa<sup>ms</sup> sy<sup>hmg</sup>; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#972;</font> (<font face="Greektl">apo</font>, &#8220;from&#8221;) in D E <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 36 323 453 614 1175 <i>al</i>; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#958;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ex</font>, &#8220;from&#8221;) in <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>74</sup> A 33 945 1739 <i>al</i>; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#958; &#8127;&#921;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#945;&#955;&#8053;&#956; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#8127;&#913;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#972;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#945;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ex Ierousalhm ei&quot; Antioceian</font>, &#8220;from Jerusalem to Antioch&#8221;) in {a few later manuscripts and part of the Itala}. A decision on this problem is very difficult, but for several reasons <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</font> can be preferred. It is the most difficult reading by far in light of the context, since Paul and Barnabas were going to Jerusalem in 11:30. It is found in better witnesses, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> and B being very strong evidence. The other readings, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#958;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#972;</font>, are different from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</font> yet bear essentially the same meaning as each other; this seems to suggest that scribes had problems with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</font> and tried to choose an acceptable revision. If <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962; </font>is the earliest reading, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#972; </font>may be a clarification of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#958;</font>, and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#958;</font> could have arisen through confusion of letters. Or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#958; </font>and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#972;</font> could both have independently arisen from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962; </font>as a more acceptable preposition. Despite such arguments, however, the case for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</font> is not airtight: either <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#958;</font> or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#972;</font> could be preferred on other lines of reasoning. The reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#958; </font>enjoys the earliest support, and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</font> could have arisen through the same confusion of letters mentioned above. The immediate and wider context seems to mitigate against <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</font> as the original reading: The aorist participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#8061;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">plhrwsante&quot;</font>, &#8220;when they had completed&#8221;) seems to signal the end of the mission to Jerusalem with the famine relief, so it would make sense in the context for the team to be coming <i>from</i> Jerusalem (to Antioch) rather than <i>to</i> Jerusalem, and 13:1 certainly presents the scene at Antioch. The later addition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#8127;&#913;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#972;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#945;&#957;</font> after <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#945;&#955;&#8053;&#956; </font>in some <sc>mss seems to be a clarification in light of 13:1 (notice that some of the <sc>mss that read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#958;</font> add <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#8127;&#913;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#972;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#945;&#957; </font>[945 1739], and some that read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#972;</font> also add <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#8127;&#913;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#972;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#945;&#957;</font> [E 323 1175]). Thus, the idea of spatial separation from Jerusalem is strongly implied by the context. This problem is so difficult that some scholars resort to conjectural emendation to determine the original reading. All in all, the reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</font> should be preferred as original, recognizing that there is a good measure of uncertainty with this solution.
