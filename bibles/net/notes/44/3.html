The idea is that of money given as a gift to someone who was poor. Giving alms was viewed as honorable in Judaism (Tob 1:3, 16; 12:8-9; <i>m. Pe&#8217;ah</i> 1:1). See also Luke 11:41; 12:33; Acts 9:36; 10:2, 4, 31; 24:17.</p>

The &#8216;Beautiful Gate&#8217; referred either to the Nicanor Gate (which led from the Court of the Gentiles into the Court of Women) or the Shushan Gate at the eastern wall.</p>

<A NAME="314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=186><b>sn</b> <i>In the name.</i> Note the authority <i>in the name</i> of Jesus the Messiah. His presence and power are at work for the man. The reference to &#8220;the name&#8221; is not like a magical incantation, but is designed to indicate the agent who performs the healing. The theme is quite frequent in Acts (2:38 plus 21 other times).</p>
<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=187><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Messiah&#8221;; both &#8220;Christ&#8221; (Greek) and &#8220;Messiah&#8221; (Hebrew and Aramaic) mean &#8220;one who has been anointed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=188><b>tc</b> The words &#8220;stand up and&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#949; &#954;&#945;&#943;</font>, <font face="Greektl">egeire kai</font>) are not in a few <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B D sa), but are included in A C E <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 095 33 1739 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat sy mae bo. The external testimony is thus fairly evenly divided, with few but important representatives of the Alexandrian and Western texttypes supporting the shorter reading. Internally, the words look like a standard scribal emendation, and may have been motivated by other healing passages where Jesus gave a similar double command (cf. Matt 9:5; Mark 2:9, [11]; Luke 5:23; [6:8]; John 5:8). On the other hand, there is some motivation for deleting <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#949; &#954;&#945;&#943;</font> here, namely, unlike Jesus&#8217; healing miracles, Peter raises (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7972;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#949;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">hgeiren</font>) the man to his feet (v. 7) rather than the man rising on his own. In light of the scribal tendency to harmonize, especially in immediate context, the longer reading is slightly preferred.</p>
<A NAME="317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=189><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;Then&#8221; to reflect the sequence of events.</p>
<A NAME="318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=190><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Peter) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=191><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Peter taking hold of him&#8230;raised him up.&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#940;&#963;&#945;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">piasas</font>) has been translated as a finite verb due to requirements of contemporary English style.</p>

<A NAME="321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=193><b>sn</b> <i>At once the man&#8217;s feet and ankles were made strong. </i>Note that despite the past lameness, the man is immediately able to walk. The restoration of his ability to walk pictures the presence of a renewed walk, a fresh start at life; this was far more than money would have given him.</p>
<A NAME="322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=194><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And he.&#8221; Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, the conjunction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has not been translated here. Instead a new English sentence is begun.</p>
<A NAME="323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=195><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Jumping up, he stood.&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#958;&#945;&#955;&#955;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">exallomeno&quot;</font>) has been translated as a finite verb due to requirements of contemporary English style. It is possible that the paralyzed man actually jumped off the ground, but more probably this term simply refers to the speed with which he stood up. See L&amp;N 15.240.</p>
<A NAME="324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=196><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the temple.&#8221; This is actually a reference to the courts surrounding the temple proper, and has been translated accordingly.</p>
<A NAME="325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=197><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And all.&#8221; Because of the difference between Greek style, which often begins sentences or clauses with &#8220;and,&#8221; and English style, which generally does not, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has not been translated here.</p>

<A NAME="327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=199><b>sn</b> <i>Amazement</i> is a frequent response to miracles of Jesus or the apostles. These took the ancients by as much surprise as they would people today. But in terms of response to what God is doing, amazement does not equal faith (Luke 4:36; 5:9, 26; 7:16).</p>
<A NAME="328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=200><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (the man) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>

However, the more technical term &#8220;portico&#8221; was retained in the actual name that follows.</p>
<A NAME="330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=202><b>sn</b> <i>Solomon</i>&#8217;<i>s Portico</i> was a covered walkway formed by rows of columns supporting a roof and open on the inner side facing the center of the temple complex. It was located on the east side of the temple (Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 15.11.3-5 [15.391-420], 20.9.7 [20.221]) and was a place of commerce and conversation.</p>

Scribes would be prone to conform the wording here to the LXX; the longer reading is thus most likely not authentic. NA<sup>27</sup> has the words in brackets, indicating doubts as to their authenticity.</p>

The phrase <i>God of our forefathers </i>is from the Hebrew scriptures (Exod 3:6, 15-16; 4:5; see also the Jewish prayer known as &#8220;The Eighteen Benedictions&#8221;). Once again, event has led to explanation, or what is called the &#8220;sign and speech&#8221; pattern.</p>
<A NAME="336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=208><b>sn</b> <i>Has glorified.</i> Jesus is alive, raised and active, as the healing illustrates so dramatically how God honors him.</p>
<A NAME="337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=209><b>sn</b> <i>His servant.</i> The term <i>servant</i> has messianic connotations given the context of the promise, the note of suffering, and the titles and functions noted in vv. 14-15.</p>

To appeal to the name is to point to the person. It is not clear that the man expressed faith before the miracle. This could well be a &#8220;grace-faith miracle&#8221; where God grants power through the apostles to picture how much a gift life is (Luke 17:11-19). Christology and grace are emphasized here.</p>

<A NAME="355"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=227><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;so that&#8230;Lord&#8221; are traditionally placed in v. 19 by most English translations, but in the present translation the verse division follows the standard critical editions of the Greek text (NA<sup>27</sup>, UBS<sup>4</sup>).</p>

<A NAME="367"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=239><b>sn</b> A quotation from Deut 18:19, also Lev 23:29. The OT context of Lev 23:29 discusses what happened when one failed to honor atonement. One ignored the required sacrifice of God at one&#8217;s peril.</p>
<A NAME="368"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=240><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;proclaimed.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>All the prophets&#8230;have spoken about and announced. </i>What Peter preaches is rooted in basic biblical and Jewish hope as expressed in the OT scriptures.</p>
<A NAME="369"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=241><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;forefathers&#8221;; <i>Grk</i> &#8220;fathers.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="370"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=242><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;in your offspring&#8221;; <i>Grk</i> &#8220;in your seed.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>In your descendants </i>(<i>Grk</i> &#8220;in your seed&#8221;). <i>Seed</i> has an important ambiguity in this verse. The blessing comes from the servant (v. 26), who in turn blesses the responsive children of the covenant as the scripture promised. Jesus is the seed who blesses the seed.</p>
<A NAME="371"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=243><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;families.&#8221; The Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#940;</font> (<font face="Greektl">patria</font>) can indicate persons of succeeding generations who are related by birth (&#8220;lineage,&#8221; &#8220;family&#8221;) but it can also indicate a relatively large unit of people who make up a sociopolitical group and who share a presumed biological descent. In many contexts <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#940;</font> is very similar to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#952;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">eqnos</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#945;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">laos</font>). In light of the context of the OT quotation, it is better to translate <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#940;</font> as &#8220;nations&#8221; here.</p>
<A NAME="372"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=244><b>sn</b> A quotation from Gen 22:18.</p>
<A NAME="373"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=245><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;God raising up his servant, sent him.&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#8053;&#963;&#945;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anasthsa&quot;</font>) has been translated as a finite verb due to requirements of contemporary English style. Some translations (e.g., NIV, NRSV) render this participle as temporal (&#8220;when God raised up his servant&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="374"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=246><b>sn</b> The picture of <i>turning</i> is again seen as the appropriate response to the message. See v. 19 above. In v. 19 it was &#8220;turning to,&#8221; here it is &#8220;turning away from.&#8221; The direction of the two metaphors is important.</p>
<A NAME="375"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">75</span><note=247><b>tn</b> For the translation of plural <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#957;&#951;&#961;&#943;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ponhria</font>) as &#8220;iniquities,&#8221; see G. Harder, <i>TDNT</i> 6:565. The plural is important, since for Luke turning to Jesus means turning away from sins, not just the sin of rejecting Jesus.</p>
