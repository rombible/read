<A NAME="2548"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=2848><b>sn</b> <i>King Agrippa</i> was Herod Agrippa II (<sc>a.d. 27-92/93), son of Herod Agrippa I (see Acts 12:1). He ruled over parts of Palestine from <sc>a.d. 53 until his death. His sister Bernice was widowed when her second husband, Herod King of Chalcis, died in <sc>a.d. 48. From then she lived with her brother. In an attempt to quiet rumors of an incestuous relationship between them, she resolved to marry Polemo of Cilicia, but she soon left him and returned to Herod Agrippa II. Their incestuous relationship became the gossip of Rome according to Josephus (<i>Ant.</i> 20.7.3 [20.145-147]). The visit of Agrippa and Bernice gave Festus the opportunity to get some internal Jewish advice. Herod Agrippa II was a trusted adviser because he was known to be very loyal to Rome (Josephus, <i>J. W.</i> 2.16.4 [2.345-401]).</p>
