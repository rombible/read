<A NAME="2686"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">86</span><note=2991><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;In a short time you will make me a Christian.&#8221; On the difficulty of the precise nuances of Agrippa&#8217;s reply in this passage, see BDAG 791 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#949;&#943;&#952;&#969;</font> 1.b. The idiom is like 1 Kgs 21:7 LXX. The point is that Paul was trying to persuade Agrippa to accept his message. If Agrippa had let Paul persuade him, he would have converted to Christianity.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The question &#8220;<i>In such a short time are you persuading me to become a Christian?</i>&#8221; was probably a ploy on Agrippa&#8217;s part to deflect Paul from his call for a decision. Note also how the tables have turned: Agrippa was brought in to hear Paul&#8217;s defense, and now ends up defending himself. The questioner is now being questioned.</p>
