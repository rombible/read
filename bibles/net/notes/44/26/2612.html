<A NAME="2612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2917><b>tn</b> These words are repeated from v. 4 (&#8220;all the Jews know&#8221;). Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, it was necessary to begin a new sentence at the beginning of v. 5 in the translation, but for this to make sense, the main verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#963;&#945;&#963;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">{isasi</font>) has to be repeated to connect with the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) clause (indirect discourse) in v. 5.</p>
