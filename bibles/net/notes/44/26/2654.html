<A NAME="2654"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=2959><b>sn</b> <i>To open their eyes so that they turn&#8230; </i>Here is Luke&#8217;s most comprehensive report of Paul&#8217;s divine calling. His role was to call humanity to change their position before God and experience God&#8217;s forgiveness as a part of God&#8217;s family. The image of turning is a key one in the NT: Luke 1:79; Rom 2:19; 13:12; 2 Cor 4:6; 6:14; Eph 5:8; Col 1:12; 1 Thess 5:5. See also Luke 1:77-79; 3:3; 24:47.</p>
