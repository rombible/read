This is a decidedly stronger focus on obedience to the Law. As well, D expands vv. 1-5 in various places with the overall effect of being &#8220;more sympathetic to the local tradition of the church at Jerusalem&#8221; while the Alexandrian witnesses are more sympathetic to Paul (<i>TCGNT</i> 377). Codex D is well known for having a significantly longer text in Acts, but modern scholarship is generally of the opinion that the text of D expands on the original wording of Acts, with a theological viewpoint that especially puts Peter in a more authoritarian light. The expansion in these five verses is in keeping with that motif even though Peter is not explicitly in view.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Unless you are circumcised.</i> These teachers from Judea were teaching that Gentiles could not be saved unless they kept the law of Moses in regard to circumcision. Thus according to them a Gentile had first to become a proselyte to Judaism, including circumcision, before one could become a Christian. This party is sometimes known (collectively) as Judaizers. They did not question that Gentiles could come into the community, but disagreed with Paul and Barnabas on what basis they could do so.</p>

<A NAME="1515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1506><b>sn</b> The Greek word used here (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#949;&#8150;</font>, <font face="Greektl">dei</font>) is a strong term that expresses divine necessity. The claim is that God commanded the circumcision of Gentiles.</p>

<A NAME="1518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1509><b>tn</b> The translation for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7984;&#948;&#949;&#8150;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">idein</font>) in this verse is given by BDAG 279-80 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#957;</font> 3 as &#8220;<i>deliberate concerning this matter</i>.&#8221; A contemporary idiom would be to &#8220;look into&#8221; a matter.</p>
<A NAME="1519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1510><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;discussion.&#8221; This term is repeated from v. 2.</p>
<A NAME="1520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1511><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;long ago&#8221; (an idiom, literally &#8220;from ancient days&#8221;). According to L&amp;N 67.26, &#8220;this reference to Peter having been chosen by God sometime before to bring the gospel to the Gentiles can hardly be regarded as a reference to ancient times, though some persons understand this to mean that God&#8217;s decision was made at the beginning of time. The usage of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#966;&#8127; &#7969;&#956;&#949;&#961;&#8182;&#957; &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#943;&#969;&#957;</font> is probably designed to emphasize the established nature of God&#8217;s decision for Peter to take the gospel to the Gentiles beginning with the centurion Cornelius. The fact that this was relatively early in the development of the church may also serve to explain the use of the idiom.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1512><b>sn</b> <i>God chose.</i> The theme of God&#8217;s sovereign choice is an important point, because 1st century Jews believed Israel&#8217;s unique position and customs were a reflection of God&#8217;s choice.</p>
<A NAME="1522"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1513><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;word.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1514><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;of the good news.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1515><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;God chose among you from my mouth the Gentiles to hear the message of the gospel and to believe.&#8221; The sense of this sentence in Greek is difficult to render in English. The Greek verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#955;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">eklegomai</font>, &#8220;choose&#8221;) normally takes a person or thing as a direct object; in this verse the verb has neither clearly stated. The translation understands the phrase &#8220;from my mouth,&#8221; referring to Peter, as a description of both who God chose and the task to be done. This coupled with the following statement about Gentiles hearing the message of the gospel leads to the more dynamic rendering in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="1525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1516><b>sn</b> The expression <i>who knows the heart</i> means &#8220;who knows what people think.&#8221;</p>

Here it is used figuratively of the restriction that some in the early church wanted to place on Gentile converts to Christianity of observing the law of Moses and having males circumcised. The <i>yoke</i> is a decidedly negative image: Matt 23:4, but cf. Matt 11:29-30.</p>

<A NAME="1557"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=1548><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I have decided,&#8221; &#8220;I think.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#961;&#943;&#957;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">krinw</font>) has a far broader range of meaning than the often-used English verb &#8220;judge.&#8221; BDAG 568 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#961;&#943;&#957;&#969;</font> 3 places this use in Acts 15:19 in the category &#8220;<i>judge, think, consider, look upon</i>&#8221; followed by double accusative of object and predicate. However, many modern translations give the impression that a binding decision is being handed down by James: &#8220;it is my judgment&#8221; (NASB, NIV); &#8220;I have reached the decision&#8221; (NRSV). L&amp;N 22.25, on the other hand, translate the phrase here &#8220;I think that we should not cause extra difficulty for those among the Gentiles.&#8221; This gives more the impression of an opinion than a binding decision. The resolution of this lies not so much in the lexical data as in how one conceives James&#8217; role in the leadership of the Jerusalem church, plus the dynamics of the specific situation where the issue of Gentile inclusion in the church was being discussed. The major possibilities are: (1) James is handing down a binding decision to the rest of the church as the one who has ultimate authority to decide this matter; (2) James is offering his own personal opinion in the matter, which is not binding on the church; (3) James is voicing a consensus opinion of all the apostles and elders, although phrasing it as if it were his own; (4) James is making a suggestion to the rest of the leadership as to what course they should follow. In light of the difficulty in reconstructing the historical situation in detail, it is best to use a translation which maintains as many of the various options as possible. For this reason the translation &#8220;Therefore I conclude&#8221; has been used, leaving open the question whether in reaching this conclusion James is speaking only for himself or for the rest of the leadership.</p>
