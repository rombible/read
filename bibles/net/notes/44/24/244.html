<A NAME="244"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2702><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;who&#8221; (plural). Because in English the relative pronoun &#8220;who&#8221; could be understood to refer only to the attorney Tertullus and not to the entire group, it has been replaced with the third person plural pronoun &#8220;they.&#8221; &#8220;And&#8221; has been supplied to provide the connection to the preceding clause.</p>
