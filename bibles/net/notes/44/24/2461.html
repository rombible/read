<A NAME="2461"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=2759><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;sacrifices.&#8221; BDAG 887 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#966;&#959;&#961;&#940;</font> 1 has &#8220;<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#966;&#959;&#961;&#940;&#962; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#949;&#8150;&#957;</font> <i>have sacrifices made</i> Ac 24:17,&#8221; but this may be overly specific. It is not clear from the immediate context whether the offering of sacrificial animals (so BDAG assumes) or offerings of some other sort (such as financial gifts) are in view. The combination with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#955;&#949;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#963;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">elehmosuna&quot;</font>) in the preceding clause may suggest monetary offerings. Some have suggested this is an allusion to the payments made by Paul on behalf of the four other men mentioned in Acts 21:23-26, but the text here seems to suggest something Paul had planned to do before he came, while the decision to pay for the expenses of the men in 21:23ff. was made at the suggestion of the Jerusalem leadership after he arrived. In either case, Paul was portraying himself as a pious worshiper of his God.</p>
