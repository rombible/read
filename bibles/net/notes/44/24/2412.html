<A NAME="2412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2710><b>sn</b> References to peaceful <i>rule</i>, <i>reforms</i>, and the governor&#8217;s <i>foresight</i> in the opening address by Tertullus represent an attempt to praise the governor and thus make him favorable to the case. Actual descriptions of his rule portray him as inept (Tacitus, <i>Annals</i> 12.54; Josephus, <i>J. W.</i> 2.13.2-7 [2.253-270]).</p>
