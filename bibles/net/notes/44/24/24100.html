<A NAME="24100"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">100</span><note=2798><b>sn</b> <i>Porcius Festus</i> was the procurator of Palestine who succeeded Felix; neither the beginning nor the end of his rule (at his death) can be determined with certainty, although he appears to have died in office after about two years. Nero recalled Felix in <sc>a.d. 57 or 58, and Festus was appointed to his vacant office in <sc>a.d. 57, 58, or 59. According to Josephus (<i>Ant. </i>20.8.9-10 [20.182-188]; <i>J. W.</i> 2.14.1 [2.271-272]), his administration was better than that of his predecessor Felix or his successor Albinus, but Luke in Acts portrays him in a less favorable light: He was willing to sacrifice Paul to court Jewish favor by taking him to Jerusalem for trial (v. 9), regardless of Paul&#8217;s guilt or innocence. The one characteristic for which Festus was noted is that he dealt harshly with those who disturbed the peace.</p>
