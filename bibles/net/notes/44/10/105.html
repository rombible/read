<A NAME="105"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=904><b>sn</b> The description of Cornelius as <i>a devout, God-fearing man</i> probably means that he belonged to the category called &#8220;God-fearers,&#8221; Gentiles who worshiped the God of Israel and in many cases kept the Mosaic law, but did not take the final step of circumcision necessary to become a proselyte to Judaism. See further K. G. Kuhn, <i>TDNT</i> 6:732-34, 43-44, and Sir 11:17; 27:11; 39:27.</p>
