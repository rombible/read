<A NAME="10136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">136</span><note=1035><b>tn</b> The Greek construction (passive infinitive with accusative subject) could be translated either &#8220;he ordered them to be baptized&#8221; or &#8220;he ordered that they be baptized,&#8221; but the implication in English in either case is that Peter was giving orders to the Gentiles in Cornelius&#8217; house, telling them to get baptized. It is much more likely in the context that Peter was ordering those Jewish Christians who accompanied him to baptize the new Gentile converts. They would doubtless have still had misgivings even after witnessing the outpouring of the Spirit and hearing the tongues. It took Peter&#8217;s apostolic authority (&#8220;ordered&#8221;) to convince them to perform the baptisms.</p>
