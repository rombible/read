<A NAME="10123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">123</span><note=1022><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;All the prophets testify about him.&#8221; Although modern English translations tend to place &#8220;about him&#8221; after &#8220;testify&#8221; (so NIV, NRSV) the phrase &#8220;about him&#8221; has been left at the beginning of v. 43 for emphatic reasons.</p>
