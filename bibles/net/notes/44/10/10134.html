<A NAME="10134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">134</span><note=1033><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;just as also we.&#8221; The auxiliary verb in English must be supplied. This could be either &#8220;have&#8221; (NIV, NRSV) or &#8220;did&#8221; (NASB). &#8220;Did&#8221; is preferred here because the comparison Peter is making concerns not just the fact of the present possession of the Spirit (&#8220;they received the Spirit we now possess&#8221;), but the <i>manner</i> in which the Gentiles in Cornelius&#8217; house received the Spirit (&#8220;they received the Spirit in the same manner we did [on the day of Pentecost]&#8221;).</p>
