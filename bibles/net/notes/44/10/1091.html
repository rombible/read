<A NAME="1091"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">91</span><note=990><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;God is not one who is a respecter of persons,&#8221; that is, &#8220;God is not one to show partiality&#8221; (cf. BDAG 887 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#955;&#8053;&#956;&#960;&#964;&#951;&#962;</font>). L&amp;N 88.239 translates this verse &#8220;I realize that God does not show favoritism (in dealing with people).&#8221; The underlying Hebrew idiom includes the personal element (&#8220;respecter of persons&#8221;) so the phrase &#8220;in dealing with people&#8221; is included in the present translation. It fits very well with the following context and serves to emphasize the relational component of God&#8217;s lack of partiality. The latter is a major theme in the NT: Rom 2:11; Eph 2:11-22; Col 3:25; Jas 2:1; 1 Pet 1:17. This was the lesson of Peter&#8217;s vision.</p>
