<A NAME="1021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=920><b>tn</b> The meaning of the genitive participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#973;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">proskarterountwn</font>) could either be &#8220;a soldier from the ranks of those who served him&#8221; (referring to his entire command) or &#8220;a soldier from among his personal staff&#8221; (referring to a group of soldiers who were his personal attendants). The translation &#8220;from among those who served him&#8221; is general enough to cover either possibility.</p>
