<A NAME="1456"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=1457><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;satisfying [filling] your hearts with food and joy.&#8221; This is an idiomatic expression; it strikes the English reader as strange to speak of &#8220;filling one&#8217;s heart with food.&#8221; Thus the additional direct object &#8220;you&#8221; has been supplied, separating the two expressions somewhat: &#8220;satisfying <i>you</i> with food and your hearts with joy.&#8221;</p>
