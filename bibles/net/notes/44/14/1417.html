<A NAME="1417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1418><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;learning about it, fled.&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#953;&#948;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">sunidonte&quot;</font>) has been translated as a finite verb due to requirements of contemporary English style. It could also be taken temporally (&#8220;when they learned about it&#8221;) as long as opening clause of v. 5 is not translated as a temporal clause too, which results in a redundancy.</p>
