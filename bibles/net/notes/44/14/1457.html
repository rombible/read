<A NAME="1457"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=1458><b>sn</b> God&#8217;s general sovereignty and gracious care in the creation are the way Paul introduces the theme of the goodness of God. He was trying to establish monotheism here. It is an OT theme (Gen 8:22; Ps 4:7; 145:15-16; 147:8-9; Isa 25:6; Jer 5:24) which also appears in the NT (Luke 12:22-34).</p>
