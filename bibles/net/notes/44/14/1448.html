<A NAME="1448"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1449><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;in order that you should turn,&#8221; with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#941;&#966;&#949;&#953;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">epistrefein</font>) as an infinitive of purpose, but this is somewhat awkward contemporary English. To translate the infinitive construction &#8220;proclaim the good news, that you should turn,&#8221; which is much smoother English, could give the impression that the infinitive clause is actually the content of the good news, which it is not. The somewhat less formal &#8220;to get you to turn&#8221; would work, but might convey to some readers manipulativeness on the part of the apostles. Thus &#8220;proclaim the good news, so that you should turn,&#8221; is used, to convey that the purpose of the proclamation of good news is the response by the hearers. The emphasis here is like 1 Thess 1:9-10.</p>
