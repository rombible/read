<A NAME="289"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=3152><b>tn</b> That is, the goddess Justice has not allowed him to live. BDAG 250 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#943;&#954;&#951;</font> 2 states, &#8220;<i>Justice</i> personified as a deity Ac 28:4&#8221;; L&amp;N 12.27, &#8220;a goddess who personifies justice in seeking out and punishing the guilty &#8211; &#8216;the goddess Justice.&#8217; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969; &#948;&#943;&#954;&#951; &#950;&#8134;&#957; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#949;&#7988;&#945;&#963;&#949;&#957;</font> &#8216;the goddess Justice would not let him live&#8217; Ac 28:4.&#8221; Although a number of modern English translations have rendered <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#943;&#954;&#951;</font> (<font face="Greektl">dikh</font>) &#8220;justice,&#8221; preferring to use an abstraction, in the original setting it is almost certainly a reference to a pagan deity. In the translation, the noun &#8220;justice&#8221; was capitalized and the reflexive pronoun &#8220;herself&#8221; was supplied to make the personification clear. This was considered preferable to supplying a word like &#8216;goddess&#8217; in connection with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#943;&#954;&#951;</font>.</p>
