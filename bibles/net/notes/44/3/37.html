<A NAME="37"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=179><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;alms.&#8221; The term &#8220;alms&#8221; is not in common use today, so what the man expected, &#8220;money,&#8221; is used in the translation instead. The idea is that of money given as a gift to someone who was poor. Giving alms was viewed as honorable in Judaism (Tob 1:3, 16; 12:8-9; <i>m. Pe&#8217;ah</i> 1:1). See also Luke 11:41; 12:33; Acts 9:36; 10:2, 4, 31; 24:17.</p>
