<A NAME="348"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=220><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;him&#8221;; the referent (Jesus) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The faith that is through Jesus.</i> Note how this verse explains how the claim to &#8220;faith in Jesus&#8217; name&#8221; works and what it means. To appeal to the name is to point to the person. It is not clear that the man expressed faith before the miracle. This could well be a &#8220;grace-faith miracle&#8221; where God grants power through the apostles to picture how much a gift life is (Luke 17:11-19). Christology and grace are emphasized here.</p>
