<A NAME="316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=188><b>tc</b> The words &#8220;stand up and&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#949; &#954;&#945;&#943;</font>, <font face="Greektl">egeire kai</font>) are not in a few <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B D sa), but are included in A C E <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 095 33 1739 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat sy mae bo. The external testimony is thus fairly evenly divided, with few but important representatives of the Alexandrian and Western texttypes supporting the shorter reading. Internally, the words look like a standard scribal emendation, and may have been motivated by other healing passages where Jesus gave a similar double command (cf. Matt 9:5; Mark 2:9, [11]; Luke 5:23; [6:8]; John 5:8). On the other hand, there is some motivation for deleting <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#949; &#954;&#945;&#943;</font> here, namely, unlike Jesus&#8217; healing miracles, Peter raises (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7972;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#949;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">hgeiren</font>) the man to his feet (v. 7) rather than the man rising on his own. In light of the scribal tendency to harmonize, especially in immediate context, the longer reading is slightly preferred.</p>
