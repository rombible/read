<A NAME="323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=195><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Jumping up, he stood.&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#958;&#945;&#955;&#955;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">exallomeno&quot;</font>) has been translated as a finite verb due to requirements of contemporary English style. It is possible that the paralyzed man actually jumped off the ground, but more probably this term simply refers to the speed with which he stood up. See L&amp;N 15.240.</p>
