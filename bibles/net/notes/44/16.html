<A NAME="1672"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=1682><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;a way.&#8221; The grammar of this phrase is a bit ambiguous. The phrase in Greek is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001;&#948;&#8056;&#957; &#963;&#969;&#964;&#951;&#961;&#943;&#945;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jodon swthria&quot;</font>). Neither the head noun nor the genitive noun has the article; this is in keeping with Apollonius&#8217; Canon (see <i>ExSyn</i> 239-40). Since both nouns are anarthrous, this construction also fits Apollonius&#8217; Corollary (see <i>ExSyn</i> 250-54); since the genitive noun is abstract it is most naturally qualitative, so the head noun could either be definite or indefinite without being unusual as far as the grammar is concerned. Luke&#8217;s usage of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001;&#948;&#972;&#962;</font> elsewhere is indecisive as far as this passage is concerned. However, when one looks at the historical background it is clear that (1) the woman is shut up (via exorcism) not because her testimony is false but because of its source (analogous to Jesus&#8217; treatment of demons perhaps), and (b) &#8220;the way&#8221; is a par excellence description of the new faith throughout Acts. It thus seems that at least in Luke&#8217;s presentation &#8220;the way of salvation&#8221; is the preferred translation.</p>
