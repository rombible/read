He had a grandson of the same name and is referred to as &#8220;Gamaliel the Elder&#8221; to avoid confusion. He is quoted a number of times in the Mishnah, was given the highest possible title for Jewish teachers, <i>Rabba</i> (cf. John 20:16), and was highly regarded in later rabbinic tradition.</p>
