<A NAME="572"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=412><b>tc</b> &#8225; The majority of <sc>mss, including a few important witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> D E [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font>] 1739 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> sy sa), have the negative particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ou</font>) here, effectively turning the high priest&#8217;s words into a question: &#8220;Did we not give you strict orders not to teach in this name?&#8221; But the earliest and most important <sc>mss, along with some others (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>74 </sup><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* A B 1175 lat bo), lack the particle, making this a strong statement rather than a question. Scribes may have been tempted to omit the particle to strengthen the contrast between official Judaism and the new faith, but the fact that v. 27 introduces the quotation with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#951;&#961;&#8061;&#964;&#951;&#963;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ephrwthsen</font>, &#8220;he questioned&#8221;) may well have prompted scribes to add <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016;</font> to convert the rebuke into a question. Further, that excellent witnesses affirm the shorter reading is sufficient ground for accepting it as most probably authentic. NA<sup>27</sup> includes the particle in brackets, indicating some doubt as to its authenticity.</p>
