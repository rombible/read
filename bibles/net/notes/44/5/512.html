<A NAME="512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=352><b>tn</b> The translation &#8220;wrapped up&#8221; for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#941;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#955;&#945;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">sunesteilan</font>) is suggested by L&amp;N 79.119, but another interpretation is possible. The same verb could also be translated &#8220;removed&#8221; (see L&amp;N 15.200), although that sense appears somewhat redundant and out of sequence with the following verb and participle (&#8220;carried him out and buried him&#8221;).</p>
