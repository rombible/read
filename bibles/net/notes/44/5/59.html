<A NAME="59"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=349><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;to men.&#8221; If Peter&#8217;s remark refers only to the apostles, the translation &#8220;to men&#8221; would be appropriate. But if (as is likely) the action was taken to impress the entire congregation (who would presumably have witnessed the donation or been aware of it) then the more general &#8220;to people&#8221; is more appropriate, since the audience would have included both men and women.</p>
