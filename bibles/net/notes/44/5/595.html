<A NAME="595"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">95</span><note=435><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Israelite men,&#8221; although this is less natural English. The Greek term here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#8053;&#961;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anhr</font>), which only exceptionally is used in a generic sense of both males and females. In this context, it is highly unlikely that this is a generic usage, since Gamaliel was addressing the Sanhedrin, the Jewish high council, which would have been exclusively male. </p>
