Thus the second reading is preferred both externally because of better ms evidence and internally because it is hard to see how a copyist finding the reading &#8220;God&#8221; would change it to &#8220;house,&#8221; while it is easy to see how (given the LXX of Ps 132:5) a copyist might assimilate the reading and change &#8220;house&#8221; to &#8220;God.&#8221; However, some scholars think the reading &#8220;house&#8221; is <i>so</i> difficult as to be unacceptable. Others (like Lachmann and Hort) resorted to conjectural emendation at this point. Others (Ropes) sought an answer in an underlying Aramaic expression. Not everyone thinks the reading &#8220;house&#8221; is too difficult to be accepted as original (see Lake and Cadbury). A. F. J. Klijn, &#8220;Stephen&#8217;s Speech &#8211; Acts vii.2-53,&#8221; <i>NTS</i> 4 (1957): 25-31, compared the idea of a &#8220;house within the house of Israel&#8221; with the<i> Manual of Discipline</i> from Qumran, a possible parallel that seems to support the reading &#8220;house&#8221; as authentic. (For the more detailed discussion from which this note was derived, see <i>TCGNT</i> 308-9.)</p>
