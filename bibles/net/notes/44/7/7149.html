<A NAME="7149"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">149</span><note=648><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>made by human hands</i> is negative in the NT: Mark 14:58; Acts 17:24; Eph 2:11; Heb 9:11, 24. It suggests &#8220;man-made&#8221; or &#8220;impermanent.&#8221; The rebuke is like parts of the Hebrew scripture where the rebuke is not of the temple, but for making too much of it (1 Kgs 8:27; Isa 57:15; 1 Chr 6:8; Jer 7:1-34).</p>
