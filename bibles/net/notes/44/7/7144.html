<A NAME="7144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">144</span><note=643><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;that he could&#8221; are not in the Greek text, but are implied as the (understood) subject of the infinitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8017;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jeurein</font>). This understands David&#8217;s request as asking that he might find the dwelling place. The other possibility would be to supply &#8220;that God&#8221; as the subject of the infinitive: &#8220;and asked that God find a dwelling place.&#8221; Unfortunately this problem is complicated by the extremely difficult problem with the Greek text in the following phrase (&#8220;house of Jacob&#8221; vs. &#8220;God of Jacob&#8221;).</p>
