<A NAME="732"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=531><b>sn</b> <i>Our.</i> Stephen spoke of &#8220;<i>our</i>&#8221; ancestors (<i>Grk</i> &#8220;fathers&#8221;) in an inclusive sense throughout the speech until his rebuke in v. 51, where the nation does what &#8220;your&#8221; ancestors did, at which point an exclusive pronoun is used. This serves to emphasize the rebuke.</p>
