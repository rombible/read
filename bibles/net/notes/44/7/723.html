<A NAME="723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=522><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;circumcised him on the eighth day,&#8221; but many modern readers will not understand that this procedure was done on the eighth day after birth. The temporal clause &#8220;when he was eight days old&#8221; conveys this idea more clearly. See Gen 17:11-12.</p>
