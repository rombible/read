<A NAME="7109"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">109</span><note=608><b>tc</b> &#8225; The first person pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jhmin</font>, &#8220;to us&#8221;) is read by A C D E <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 33 1739 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat sy, while the second person pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jumin</font>, &#8220;to you&#8221;) is read by <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>74</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B 36 453 <i>al</i> co<i>.</i> The second person pronoun thus has significantly better external support. As well, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</font> is a harder reading in this context, both because it is surrounded by first person pronouns and because Stephen perhaps &#8220;does not wish to disassociate himself from those who received God&#8217;s revelation in the past, but only from those who misinterpreted and disobeyed that revelation&#8221; (<i>TCGNT</i> 307). At the same time, Stephen does associate himself to some degree with his disobedient ancestors in v. 39, suggesting that the decisive break does not really come until v. 51 (where both his present audience and their ancestors are viewed as rebellious). Thus, both externally and internally <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</font> is the preferred reading.</p>
