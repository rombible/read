<A NAME="779"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">79</span><note=578><b>tn</b> The Greek construction anticipates a negative reply which is indicated in the translation by the &#8216;tag&#8217; at the end, &#8220;do you?&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> A quotation from Exod 2:14. Even though a negative reply was expected, the question still frightened Moses enough to flee, because he knew his deed had become known. This understanding is based on the Greek text, not the Hebrew of the original setting. Yet the negative here expresses the fact that Moses did not want to kill the other man. Once again the people have badly misunderstood the situation.</p>
