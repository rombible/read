<A NAME="795"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">95</span><note=594><b>sn</b> A quotation from Exod 2:14 (see Acts 7:27). God saw Moses very differently than the people of the nation did. The reference to <i>a ruler and a judge</i> suggests that Stephen set up a comparison between Moses and Jesus, but he never finished his speech to make the point. The reader of Acts, however, knowing the other sermons in the book, recognizes that the rejection of Jesus is the counterpoint.</p>
