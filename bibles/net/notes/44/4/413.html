<A NAME="413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=260><b>tn</b> In the historical setting it is likely that only men are referred to here. The Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#8053;&#961;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anhr</font>) usually refers to males or husbands rather than people in general. Thus to translate &#8220;of the people&#8221; would give a false impression of the number, since any women and children were apparently not included in the count.</p>
