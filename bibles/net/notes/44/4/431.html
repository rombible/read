<A NAME="431"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=278><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;you&#8221; is inserted into the quotation because Peter is making a direct application of Ps 118:22 to his hearers. Because it is not in the OT, it has been left as normal type (rather than bold italic). The remarks are like Acts 2:22-24 and 3:12-15.</p>
