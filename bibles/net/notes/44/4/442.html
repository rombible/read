<A NAME="442"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=289><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#951;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">shmeion</font>) has been translated as &#8220;miraculous sign&#8221; rather than simply &#8220;sign&#8221; or &#8220;miracle&#8221; since both components appear to be present in the context. It is clear that the healing of the lame man was a miracle, but for the Sanhedrin it was the value of the miraculous healing as a sign that concerned them because it gave attestation to the message of Peter and John. The sign &#8220;speaks&#8221; as Peter claimed in 3:11-16.</p>
