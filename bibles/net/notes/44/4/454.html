<A NAME="454"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=301><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;to their own [people].&#8221; In context this phrase is most likely a reference to other believers rather than simply their own families and/or homes, since the group appears to act with one accord in the prayer that follows in v. 24. At the literary level, this phrase suggests how Jews were now splitting into two camps, pro-Jesus and anti-Jesus.</p>
