<A NAME="1132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1068><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;gave us when we believed&#8221;; or &#8220;gave us after we believed&#8221;; or &#8220;gave us who believed&#8221;; or &#8220;gave them when they believed the same gift as he also gave us.&#8221; The aorist dative plural participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pisteusasin</font>) can be understood in several different ways: (1) It could modify <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jhmin</font>, &#8220;us&#8221;) or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">autois</font>, &#8220;them&#8221;). Proximity (it immediately follows <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</font>) would suggest that it belongs with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</font>, so the last option (&#8220;gave them when they believed the same gift he also gave us&#8221;) is less likely. (2) The participle could be either adverbial or adjectival, modifying <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</font>. This decision is primarily a contextual one. The point Peter made is not whether or not the Gentiles believed, since both groups (&#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;they&#8221;) had believed in the Lord Jesus Christ. The point was whether or not the Gentiles received the Spirit when they believed, just as Jewish Christians had received the Spirit on the day of Pentecost when they believed. Translated as an adjectival participle, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#957;</font> only affirms the fact of belief, however, and raises somewhat of a theological problem if one realizes, &#8220;Would God have given the Gentiles the Spirit if they had <i>not</i> believed?&#8221; (In other words, belief in itself is a theological prerequisite for receiving the Spirit. As such, in the case of the Gentiles, it is <i>assumed.</i>) Thus in context it makes more sense to understand the participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#957;</font> as adverbial, related to the <i>time</i> of belief in connection with the giving of the Spirit. (3) The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#957;</font> as a temporal participle can refer to action <i>antecedent</i> to the action of the main verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#948;&#969;&#954;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">edwken</font>) or <i>contemporaneous</i> with it. Logically, at least, the gift of the Spirit <i>followed</i> belief in the case of the original Christians, who had believed before the day of Pentecost. In the case of Cornelius and his household, belief and the reception of the Spirit were virtually simultaneous. One can argue that Peter is &#8220;summarizing&#8221; the experience of Jewish Christians, and therefore the actions of belief and reception of the Spirit, while historically separate, have been &#8220;telescoped&#8221; into one (&#8220;gave them the same gift as he gave us when we believed&#8221;), but to be technically accurate the participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#957;</font> should be translated &#8220;gave them the same gift as he also gave us after we believed.&#8221; A number of these problems can be avoided, however, by using a translation in English that maintains some of the ambiguity of the Greek original. Thus &#8220;if God gave them the same gift as he also gave us after believing&#8221; is used, where the phrase &#8220;after believing&#8221; can refer either to &#8220;them&#8221; or to &#8220;us,&#8221; or both.</p>
