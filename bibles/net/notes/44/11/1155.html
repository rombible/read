<A NAME="1155"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=1091><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;was heard in the ears,&#8221; an idiom. L&amp;N 24.67 states that the idiom means &#8220;to hear in secret&#8221; (which it certainly does in Matt 10:27), but secrecy does not seem to be part of the context here, and there is no particular reason to suggest the report was made in secret.</p>
