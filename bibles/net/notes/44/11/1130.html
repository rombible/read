<A NAME="1130"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1066><b>tc</b> Codex Bezae (D) and {a few other Western witnesses} here lack <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jo qeo&quot;</font>, &#8220;God&#8221;), perhaps because these scribes considered the Holy Spirit to be the gift of Christ rather than the gift of God; thus leaving the subject implicit would naturally draw the reader back to v. 16 to see the Lord Jesus as the bestower of the Spirit.</p>
