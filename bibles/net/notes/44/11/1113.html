<A NAME="1113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1049><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;snakes.&#8221; <i>Grk</i> &#8220;creeping things.&#8221; According to L&amp;N 4.51, in most biblical contexts the term (due to the influence of Hebrew classifications such as Gen 1:25-26, 30) included small four-footed animals like rats, mice, frogs, toads, salamanders, and lizards. In this context, however, where &#8220;creeping things&#8221; are contrasted with &#8220;four-footed animals,&#8221; the English word &#8220;reptiles,&#8221; which primarily but not exclusively designates snakes, is probably more appropriate.</p>
