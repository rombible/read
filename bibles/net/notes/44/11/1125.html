<A NAME="1125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1061><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;he did&#8221; are not in the Greek text but are implied. They form an ellipsis which must be supplied for the modern English reader. Some modern translations supply &#8220;it&#8221; rather than &#8220;he&#8221; because the gender of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#957;&#949;&#8166;&#956;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pneuma</font>) in Greek is neuter, but there are sufficient NT contexts that use masculine pronouns to refer to the Spirit to justify the use of a masculine pronoun here in the translation.</p>
