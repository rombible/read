<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;While he was assembling with them,&#8221; or &#8220;while he was sharing a meal with them.&#8221; There are three basic options for translating the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#955;&#943;&#950;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">sunalizw</font>): (1) &#8220;Eat (salt) with, share a meal with&#8221;; (2) &#8220;bring together, assemble&#8221;; (3) &#8220;spend the night with, stay with&#8221; (see BDAG 964 s.v.). The difficulty with the first option is that it does not fit the context, and this meaning is not found elsewhere. The second option is difficult because of the singular number and the present tense. The third option is based on a spelling variation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#965;&#955;&#953;&#950;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">sunaulizomeno&quot;</font>), which some minuscules actually read here. The difference in meaning between (2) and (3) is not great, but (3) seems to fit the context somewhat better here.</p>
