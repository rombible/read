<A NAME="86"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=670><b>sn</b> The picture of Jesus<i> standing</i> (rather than seated) probably indicates his rising to receive his child.

<A NAME="826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=690><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;began to harm [the church] severely.&#8221; If the nuance of this verb is &#8220;destroy,&#8221; then the imperfect verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#955;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#943;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#959;</font> (<font face="Greektl">elumaineto</font>) is best translated as a conative imperfect as in the translation above. If instead the verb is taken to mean &#8220;injure severely&#8221; (as L&amp;N 20.24), it should be translated in context as an ingressive imperfect (&#8220;began to harm the church severely&#8221;). Either option does not significantly alter the overall meaning, since it is clear from the stated actions of Saul in the second half of the verse that he intended to destroy or ravage the church.</p>

This is the best option if the article before &#8220;city&#8221; is taken as original. If the reading without the article is taken as original, then another city may be in view: Gitta, the hometown of Simon Magus according to Justin Martyr (cf. C. K.

The literal phrase does not convey this to the modern reader, and in fact some modern translations have simply rendered the phrase as involving bitterness, which misses the point of the envy on Simon&#8217;s part. See L&amp;N 88.166. The OT images come from Deut 29:17-18 and Isa 58:6.</p>

The Mosaic law excluded eunuchs from Israel (Deut 23:1), although God certainly accepted them (Isa 56:3-5; Wis 3:14). This individual was a high official, since he was said to be <i>in charge of all her treasury</i>. He may or may not have been a eunuch physically.
