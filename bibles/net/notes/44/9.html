<A NAME="91"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=783><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Saul, making dire threats.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="92"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=784><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;breathing out threats and murder&#8221; is an idiomatic expression for &#8220;making threats to murder&#8221; (see L&amp;N 33.293). Although the two terms &#8220;threats&#8221; and &#8220;murder&#8221; are syntactically coordinate, the second is semantically subordinate to the first. In other words, the content of the threats is to murder the disciples.</p>

<A NAME="94"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=786><b>sn</b> The expression &#8220;the way&#8221; in ancient religious literature refers at times to &#8220;the whole way of life fr. a moral and spiritual viewpoint&#8221; (BDAG 692 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001;&#948;&#972;&#962;</font> 3.c), and it has been so used of Christianity and its teachings in the book of Acts (see also 19:9, 23; 22:4; 24:14, 22). It is a variation of Judaism&#8217;s idea of two ways, the true and the false, where &#8220;<i>the Way</i>&#8221; is the true one (<i>1 En.</i> 91:18; <i>2 En.</i> 30:15).</p>
<A NAME="95"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=787><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;bring them bound&#8221;; the translation &#8220;<i>bring someone as prisoner</i>&#8221; for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#949;&#948;&#949;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#7940;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#964;&#953;&#957;&#940;</font> (<font face="Greektl">dedemenon agein tina</font>) is given by BDAG 221 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;&#969;</font> 1.b.</p>

The light was more brilliant than the sun according to Acts 26:13.</p>
<A NAME="99"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=791><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;and he.&#8221; Because of the length of the Greek sentence, the conjunction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has not been translated here.

In the historical setting here, Paul&#8217;s traveling companions were almost certainly all males.</p>

<A NAME="916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=798><b>sn</b> This is a parenthetical note by the author. Acts 22:9 appears to indicate that they saw the light but did not hear a voice. They were &#8220;witnesses&#8221; that something happened.</p>

<A NAME="918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=800><b>sn</b> <i>He could see nothing.</i> This sign of blindness, which was temporary until v. 18, is like the sign of deafness experienced by Zechariah in Luke 1. It allowed some time for Saul (Paul) to reflect on what had happened without distractions.</p>
<A NAME="919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=801><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;they&#8221;; the referents (Saul&#8217;s companions) have been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>

<A NAME="921"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=803><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;anything&#8221; is not in the Greek text, but is implied. Direct objects were often omitted in Greek when clear from the context, but must be supplied for the modern English reader. The fasting might indicate an initial realization of Luke 5:33-39. Fasting was usually accompanied by reflective thought.</p>
<A NAME="922"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=804><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And the.&#8221; Because of the difference between Greek style, which often begins sentences or clauses with &#8220;and,&#8221; and English style, which generally does not, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has not been translated here.</p>
<A NAME="923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=805><b>sn</b> <i>The Lord</i> is directing all the events leading to the expansion of the gospel as he works on both sides of the meeting between Paul and Ananias. &#8220;The Lord&#8221; here refers to Jesus (see v. 17).</p>
<A NAME="924"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=806><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;behold, I,&#8221; but this construction often means &#8220;here is/there is&#8221; (cf. BDAG 468 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7984;&#948;&#959;&#973;</font> 2).</p>
<A NAME="925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=807><b>sn</b> The noting of the detail of the locale, ironically <i>called</i> <i>&#8216;Straight&#8217;</i> Street, shows how directive and specific the Lord was.</p>
<A NAME="926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=808><b>tc</b> &#8225; The words <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#8000;&#961;&#940;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en oramati</font>, &#8220;in a vision&#8221;) are not found in some of the earliest and best <sc>mss (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>74</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A 81 <i>pc </i>lat sa bo), but are implied from the context. The phrase is included, although sometimes in a different order with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">andra</font>, &#8220;man&#8221;) or omitting <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#945;</font> altogether, by B C E <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 33 1175 1739 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>. The order of words in NA<sup>27</sup>, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#945; &#7952;&#957; &#8001;&#961;&#940;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font>, is supported only by B C 1175. Generally speaking, when there are three or more variants, with one an omission and the others involving rearrangements, the longer readings are later scribal additions. Further, the reading looks like a clarifying note, for an earlier vision is explicitly mentioned in v. 10. On the other hand, it is possible that some scribes deleted the words because of perceived repetition, though this is unlikely since it is a different vision two verses back. It is also possible that some scribes could have confused <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001;&#961;&#940;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font> with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8000;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">onomati</font>, &#8220;name&#8221;); <i>TCGNT</i> 319 notes that several <sc>mss place <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font> before <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#913;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#943;&#945;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Ananian</font>, &#8220;Ananias&#8221;) while a few others drop <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8000;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font> altogether. The Sahidic <sc>mss are among those that drop the word, however, and they also lack <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#8001;&#961;&#940;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font>; all that is left is one version and father that drops <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8000;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font>. Perhaps the best argument for the authenticity of the phrase is that B C 1175 preserve a rare, distinctively Lukan word order, but this is not nearly as harsh or unusual as what Luke does elsewhere. A decision is difficult in this case, but on balance the omission of the phrase seems to be authentic. The words are nevertheless added in the translation because of contextual considerations. NA<sup>27</sup> places the words in brackets, indicating doubts as to their authenticity. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Apparently while in Damascus Paul had a subsequent <i>vision</i> in the midst of his blindness, fulfilling the prediction in 9:6.</p>

One alternative to introducing mention of the opening is to translate Acts 9:25 &#8220;they let him down over the wall,&#8221; as suggested in L&amp;N 7.61. This option is not employed by many translations, however, because for the English reader it creates an (apparent) contradiction between Acts 9:25 and 2 Cor 11:33. In reality the account here is simply more general, omitting the detail about the window.</p>
