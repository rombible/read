<A NAME="27103"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">103</span><note=3102><b>tn</b> BDAG 417 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8020;&#967;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</font> 2 states, &#8220;<i>wish</i>&#8230;<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8054;</font> <i>for someth.</i>&#8230;Foll. by acc. and inf&#8230;.Ac 27:29.&#8221; The other possible meaning for this term, &#8220;pray,&#8221; is given in BDAG 417 s.v. 1 and employed by a number of translations (NAB, NRSV, NIV). If this meaning is adopted here, then &#8220;prayed for day to come&#8221; must be understood metaphorically to mean &#8220;prayed that they would live to see the day,&#8221; or &#8220;prayed that it would soon be day.&#8221;</p>
