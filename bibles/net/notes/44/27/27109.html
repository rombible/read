<A NAME="27109"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">109</span><note=3108><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;let it fall away.&#8221; According to BDAG 308 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#960;&#943;&#960;&#964;&#969;</font> 1 and 2 the meaning of the verb in this verse could be either &#8220;fall away&#8221; or &#8220;drift away.&#8221; Either meaning is acceptable, and the choice between them depends almost entirely on how one reconstructs the scene. Since cutting the boat loose would in any case result in it drifting away (whether capsized or not), the meaning &#8220;drift away&#8221; as a nautical technical term has been used here.</p>
