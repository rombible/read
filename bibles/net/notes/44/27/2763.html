<A NAME="2763"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=3062><b>sn</b> The<i> ship</i>&#8217;<i>s boat</i> was a small rowboat, normally towed behind a ship in good weather rather than stowed on board. It was used for landings, to maneuver the ship for tacking, and to lay anchors (not a lifeboat in the modern sense, although it could have served as a means of escape for some of the sailors; see v. 30). See L. Casson, <i>Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World</i>, 248f.</p>
