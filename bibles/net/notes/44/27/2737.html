<A NAME="2737"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=3036><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Paul advised, saying to them.&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#969;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">legwn</font>) is redundant in English and has not been translated. On the term translated &#8220;advised,&#8221; see BDAG 764 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#941;&#969;</font>, which usually refers to recommendations.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Paul advised them.</i> A literary theme surfaces here: Though Paul is under arrest, he will be the one to guide them all through the dangers of the storm and shipwreck, showing clearly God&#8217;s presence and protection of him. The story is told in great detail. This literary effect of slowing down the passage of time and narrating with many details serves to add a sense of drama to the events described.</p>
