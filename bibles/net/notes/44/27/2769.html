<A NAME="2769"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=3068><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;mainsail.&#8221; The meaning of this word is uncertain. BDAG 927 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#954;&#949;&#8166;&#959;&#962;</font> 1 has &#8220;<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8056; &#963;&#954;&#949;&#8166;&#959;&#962;</font> Ac 27:17 seems to be the <i>kedge</i> or <i>driving anchor</i>&#8221; while C. Maurer (<i>TDNT </i>7:362) notes, &#8220;The meaning in Ac. 27:17: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#967;&#945;&#955;&#940;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#964;&#8056; &#963;&#954;&#949;&#8166;&#959;&#962;</font>, is uncertain. Prob. the ref. is not so much to taking down the sails as to throwing the draganchor overboard to lessen the speed of the ship.&#8221; In spite of this L&amp;N 6.1 states, &#8220;In Ac 27:17, for example, the reference of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#954;&#949;&#8166;&#959;&#962;</font> is generally understood to be the mainsail.&#8221; A reference to the sail is highly unlikely because in a storm of the force described in Ac 27:14, the sail would have been taken down and reefed immediately, to prevent its being ripped to shreds or torn away by the gale.</p>
