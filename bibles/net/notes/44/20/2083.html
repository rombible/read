Although the inclusion is supported by many earlier and better <sc>mss, internal evidence is on the side of the omission: In Acts, both &#8220;Lord Jesus&#8221; and &#8220;Lord Jesus Christ&#8221; occur, though between 16:31 and the end of the book &#8220;Lord Jesus Christ&#8221; appears only in 28:31, perhaps as a kind of climactic assertion. Thus, the shorter reading is to be preferred.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus. </i>Note the twofold description of the message.
