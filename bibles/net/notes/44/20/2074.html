<A NAME="2074"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=2217><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;You yourselves know, from the first day I set foot in Asia, how I was with you the whole time.&#8221; This could be understood to mean &#8220;how I stayed with you the whole time,&#8221; but the following verses make it clear that Paul&#8217;s lifestyle while with the Ephesians is in view here. Thus the translation &#8220;how I lived the whole time I was with you&#8221; makes this clear.</p>
