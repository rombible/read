<A NAME="2012"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2155><b>tn</b> BDAG 62 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#940;&#947;&#969;</font> 4 gives &#8220;<i>put out to sea</i>&#8221; here (as a nautical technical term). However, since the English expression &#8220;put out to sea&#8221; could be understood to mean Paul was already aboard the ship (which is not clear from the context), the simpler expression &#8220;sail&#8221; is used at this point in the translation.</p>
