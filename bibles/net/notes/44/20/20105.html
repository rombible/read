<A NAME="20105"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">105</span><note=2248><b>tn</b> That is, &#8220;that if any of you should be lost, I am not responsible&#8221; (an idiom). According to L&amp;N 33.223, the meaning of the phrase &#8220;that I am innocent of the blood of all of you&#8221; is &#8220;that if any of you should be lost, I am not responsible.&#8221; However, due to the length of this phrase and its familiarity to many modern English readers, the translation was kept closer to formal equivalence in this case. The word &#8220;you&#8221; is not in the Greek text, but is implied; Paul is addressing the Ephesian congregation (in the person of its elders) in both v. 25 and 27. </p>
