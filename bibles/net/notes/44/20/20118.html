<A NAME="20118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">118</span><note=2261><b>tn</b> The Greek term here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#8053;&#961; </font>(<font face="Greektl">anhr</font>), which only rarely is used in a generic sense to refer to both males and females. Since Paul is speaking to the Ephesian elders at this point and there is nothing in the context to suggest women were included in that group (&#8220;from among your own group&#8221;), it is most likely Paul was not predicting that these false teachers would include women.</p>
