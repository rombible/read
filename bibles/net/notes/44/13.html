<A NAME="132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1213><b>sn</b> <i>Simeon</i> may well have been from North Africa, since the Latin loanword <i>Niger</i> refers to someone as &#8220;dark-complexioned.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1214><b>sn</b> <i>The Cyrenian</i> refers to a native of the city of Cyrene, on the coast of northern Africa west of Egypt.</p>
<A NAME="134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1215><b>sn</b> <i>Herod</i> is generally taken as a reference to Herod Antipas, who governed Galilee from 4 <sc>b.c. to <sc>a.d. 39, who had John the Baptist beheaded, and who is mentioned a number of times in the gospels.</p>
<A NAME="135"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1216><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the governor.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> A <i>tetrarch</i> was a ruler with rank and authority lower than a king, who ruled only with the approval of the Roman authorities. This was roughly equivalent to being governor of a region. Several times in the NT, Herod tetrarch of Galilee is called a king (Matt 14:9, Mark 6:14-29), reflecting popular usage.</p>
<A NAME="136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1217><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;(a foster brother of Herod the tetrarch).&#8221; The meaning &#8220;close friend from childhood&#8221; is given by L&amp;N 34.15, but the word can also mean &#8220;foster brother&#8221; (L&amp;N 10.51). BDAG 976 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#973;&#957;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#945;&#962;</font> states, &#8220;pert. to being brought up with someone, either as a foster-brother or as a companion/friend,&#8221; which covers both alternatives. Context does not given enough information to be certain which is the case here, although many modern translations prefer the meaning &#8220;close friend from childhood.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1218><b>tn</b> This term is frequently used in the LXX of the service performed by priests and Levites in the tabernacle (Exod 28:35, 43; 29:30; 30:20; 35:19; 39:26; Num 1:50; 3:6, 31) and the temple (2 Chr 31:2; 35:3; Joel 1:9, 13; 2:17, and many more examples). According to BDAG 591 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#949;&#953;&#964;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#947;&#941;&#969;</font> 1.b it is used &#8220;of other expression of religious devotion.&#8221; Since the previous verse described the prophets and teachers in the church at Antioch, it is probable that the term here describes two of them (Barnabas and Saul) as they were serving in that capacity. Since they were not in Jerusalem where the temple was located, general religious service is referred to here.</p>
<A NAME="138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1219><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Appoint.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="139"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1220><b>tn</b> The three aorist participles <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#957;&#951;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">nhsteusante&quot;</font>),<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#949;&#965;&#958;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">proseuxamenoi</font>), and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">epiqente&quot;</font>) are translated as temporal participles. Although they could indicate contemporaneous time when used with an aorist main verb, logically here they are antecedent. On fasting and prayer, see Matt 6:5, 16; Luke 2:37; 5:33; Acts 14:23.</p>
<A NAME="1310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1221><b>tn</b> Normally English style, which uses a coordinating conjunction between only the last two elements of a series of three or more, would call for omission of &#8220;and&#8221; here. However, since the terms &#8220;fasting and prayer&#8221; are something of a unit, often linked together, the conjunction has been retained here.</p>
<A NAME="1311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1222><b>sn</b> The placing of <i>hands</i> on Barnabas and Saul (traditionally known as &#8220;the laying on of hands&#8221;) refers to an act picturing the commission of God and the church for the task at hand.</p>
<A NAME="1312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1223><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;they&#8221;; the referents (Barnabas and Saul) have been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>

<A NAME="1321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1232><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#960;&#951;&#961;&#941;&#964;&#951;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Juphreth&quot;</font>) usually has the meaning &#8220;servant,&#8221; but it is doubtful John Mark fulfilled that capacity for Barnabas and Saul. He was more likely an apprentice or assistant to them.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This is a parenthetical note by the author.</p>

<A NAME="1324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1235><b>sn</b> <i>Named Bar-Jesus.</i> &#8220;Jesus&#8221; is the Latin form of the name &#8220;Joshua.&#8221; The Aramaic &#8220;<i>bar</i>&#8221; means &#8220;son of,&#8221; so this man was surnamed &#8220;son of Joshua.&#8221; The scene depicts the conflict between Judaism and the emerging new faith at a cosmic level, much like the Simon Magus incident in Acts 8:9-24. Paul&#8217;s ministry looks like Philip&#8217;s and Peter&#8217;s here.</p>
<A NAME="1325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1236><b>sn</b> <i>The proconsul</i> was the Roman official who ruled over a province traditionally under the control of the Roman senate.</p>

<A NAME="1328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1239><b>sn</b> <i>The proconsul&#8230;wanted to hear the word of God. </i>This description of Sergius Paulus portrays him as a sensitive, secular Gentile leader.</p>

Five separate remarks indicate the magician&#8217;s failings. The closing rhetorical question of v. 10 (&#8220;<i>will you not stop&#8230;?</i>&#8221;) shows how opposed he is to the way of God.</p>

<A NAME="1339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1250><b>sn</b> The term translated <i>mistiness</i> here appears in the writings of the physician Galen as a medical technical description of a person who is blind. The picture of judgment to darkness is symbolic as well. Whatever power Elymas had, it represented darkness. Magic will again be an issue in Acts 19:18-19. This judgment is like that of Ananias and his wife in Acts 5:1-11.</p>

Since the term is plural here, however, and it would sound strange to the English reader to speak of &#8220;the presidents of the synagogue,&#8221; the alternative translation &#8220;leaders&#8221; is used. &#8220;Rulers&#8221; would also be acceptable, but does not convey quite the same idea.</p>

BDAG 918 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#941;&#946;&#969;</font> 1.b lists in this category references in Acts 16:14; 18:7; with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#949;&#946;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</font> alone, Acts 13:50; 17:4, 17; the phrase is also found in Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 14.7.2 (14.110). Unique to this particular verse is the combination <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#949;&#946;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#951;&#955;&#973;&#964;&#969;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">sebomenoi proshlutwn</font>). Later rabbinic discussion suggests that to be regarded as a proper proselyte, a Gentile male had to submit to circumcision. If that is the case here, these Gentiles in the synagogue at Pisidian Antioch should be regarded as full proselytes who had converted completely to Judaism and undergone circumcision. It is probably more likely, however, that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#951;&#955;&#973;&#964;&#969;&#957;</font> is used here in a somewhat looser sense (note the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#949;&#946;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#945;&#962;</font> [<font face="Greektl">sebomena&quot;</font>] alone to refer to women in Acts 13:50) and that these Gentiles were still in the category commonly called &#8220;God-fearers&#8221; without being full, technical proselytes to Judaism. See further K. G. Kuhn, <i>TDNT</i> 6:732-34, 743-44. Regardless, the point is that many Gentiles, as well as Jews, came to faith.</p>

It could also be translated as a finite verb (&#8220;and reviled him&#8221;) in keeping with contemporary English style. The direct object (&#8220;him&#8221;) is implied rather than expressed and could be impersonal (&#8220;it,&#8221; referring to what Paul was saying rather than Paul himself), but the verb occurs more often in contexts involving defamation or slander against personal beings (not always God). For a very similar context to this one, compare Acts 18:6. The translation &#8220;blaspheme&#8221; is not used because in contemporary English its meaning is more narrowly defined and normally refers to blasphemy against God (not what Paul&#8217;s opponents were doing here).
