<A NAME="1849"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1927><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;worship God contrary to.&#8221; BDAG 758 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#940;</font> C.6 has &#8220;<i>against, contrary to</i>&#8221; for Acts 18:13. The words &#8220;in a way&#8221; are not in the Greek text, but are a necessary clarification to prevent the misunderstanding in the English translation that worshiping God was in itself contrary to the law. What is under dispute is the <i>manner</i> in which God was being worshiped, that is, whether Gentiles were being required to follow all aspects of the Mosaic law, including male circumcision. There is a hint of creating public chaos or disturbing Jewish custom here since Jews were the ones making the complaint. Luke often portrays the dispute between Christians and Jews as within Judaism.</p>
