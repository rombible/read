<A NAME="1888"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">88</span><note=1966><b>sn</b> <i>Went down to Antioch.</i> The city of <i>Antioch</i> in Syria lies due north of Jerusalem. In Western languages it is common to speak of north as &#8220;up&#8221; and south as &#8220;down,&#8221; but the NT maintains the Hebrew idiom which speaks of <i>any</i> direction away from Jerusalem as down (since Mount Zion was thought of in terms of altitude). This marks the end of the second missionary journey which began in Acts 15:36. From Caesarea to Antioch is a journey of 280 mi (450 km).</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see JP1-F2; JP2-F2; JP3-F2; JP4-F2.</p>
