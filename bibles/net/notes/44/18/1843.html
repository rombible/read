<A NAME="1843"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1921><b>sn</b> <i>Gallio</i> was proconsul of Achaia from <sc>a.d. 51-52. This date is one of the firmly established dates in Acts. Lucius Junius Gallio was the son of the rhetorician Seneca and the brother of Seneca the philosopher. The date of Gallio&#8217;s rule is established from an inscription (W. Dittenberger, ed., <i>Sylloge Inscriptionum Graecarum</i> 2.3 no. 8). Thus the event mentioned here is probably to be dated July-October <sc>a.d. 51.</p>
