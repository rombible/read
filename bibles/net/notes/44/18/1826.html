<A NAME="1826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1904><b>tn</b> The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#946;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#966;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#973;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">blasfhmountwn</font>) has been taken temporally. The direct object (&#8220;him&#8221;) is implied rather than expressed and could be impersonal (&#8220;it,&#8221; referring to what Paul was saying rather than Paul himself), but the verb occurs more often in contexts involving defamation or slander against personal beings (not always God). For a very similar context to this one, compare Acts 13:45. The translation &#8220;blaspheme&#8221; is not used because in contemporary English its meaning is more narrowly defined and normally refers to blasphemy against God (not what Paul&#8217;s opponents were doing here). What they were doing was more like slander or defamation of character.</p>
