<A NAME="1887"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">87</span><note=1965><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;at Jerusalem&#8221; are not in the Greek text, but are implied by the participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#946;&#940;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anabas</font>). The expression &#8220;go up&#8221; refers almost exclusively to the direction of Jerusalem, while the corresponding &#8220;go down&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#941;&#946;&#951;</font>, <font face="Greektl">katebh</font>) refers to directions away from Jerusalem. Both expressions are based on a Hebrew idiom. Assuming Jerusalem is meant, this is another indication of keeping that key church informed. If Jerusalem is not referred to here, then Caesarea is in view. Paul was trying to honor a vow, which also implies a visit to Jerusalem.</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For the location of Jerusalem see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
