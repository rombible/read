<A NAME="1877"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=1955><b>tn</b> Although the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#949;&#955;&#941;&#958;&#945;&#964;&#959;</font> (<font face="Greektl">dielexato</font>; from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#955;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</font>, <font face="Greektl">dialegomai</font>) is frequently translated &#8220;reasoned,&#8221; &#8220;disputed,&#8221; or &#8220;argued,&#8221; this sense comes from its classical meaning where it was used of philosophical disputation, including the Socratic method of questions and answers. However, there does not seem to be contextual evidence for this kind of debate in Acts 18:19. As G. Schrenk (<i>TDNT</i> 2:94-95) points out, &#8220;What is at issue is the address which any qualified member of a synagogue might give.&#8221; Other examples of this may be found in the NT in Matt 4:23 and Mark 1:21.</p>
