<A NAME="1833"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1911><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;a worshiper of God.&#8221; The clarifying phrase &#8220;a Gentile&#8221; has been supplied for clarity, and is indicated by the context, since Paul had parted company with the Jews in the previous verse. The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#949;&#946;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">sebomenou</font>) is practically a technical term for the category called <i>God-fearers</i>, Gentiles who worshiped the God of Israel and in many cases kept the Mosaic law, but did not take the final step of circumcision necessary to become a proselyte to Judaism. See further K. G. Kuhn, <i>TDNT</i> 6:732-34, 743-44.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Here yet another <i>Gentile</i> is presented as responsive to Paul&#8217;s message in Acts.</p>
