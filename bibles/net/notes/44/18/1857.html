<A NAME="1857"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=1935><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;driven away,&#8221; but this could result in a misunderstanding in English (&#8220;driven&#8221; as in a cart or wagon?). &#8220;Forced away&#8221; conveys the idea; Gallio rejected their complaint. In contemporary English terminology the case was &#8220;thrown out of court.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#8053;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">aphlasen</font>) has been translated as a causative since Gallio probably did not perform this action in person, but ordered his aides or officers to remove the plaintiffs.</p>
