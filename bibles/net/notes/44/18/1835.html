<A NAME="1835"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1913><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;who heard him,&#8221; or &#8220;who heard Paul.&#8221; The ambiguity here results from the tendency of Greek to omit direct objects, which must be supplied from the context. The problem is that no less than three different ones may be supplied here: (1) &#8220;him,&#8221; referring to Crispus, but this is not likely because there is no indication in the context that Crispus began to speak out about the Lord; this is certainly possible and even likely, but more than the text here affirms; (2) &#8220;Paul,&#8221; who had been speaking in the synagogue and presumably, now that he had moved to Titius Justus&#8217; house, continued speaking to the Gentiles; or (3) &#8220;about it,&#8221; that is, the Corinthians who heard about Crispus&#8217; conversion became believers. In the immediate context this last is most probable, since the two incidents are juxtaposed. Other, less obvious direct objects could also be supplied, such as &#8220;heard the word of God,&#8221; &#8220;heard the word of the Lord,&#8221; etc., but none of these are obvious in the immediate context.</p>
