<A NAME="1868"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=1946><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Aquila, who.&#8221; The relationship of the participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">keirameno&quot;</font>) is difficult to determine. Traditionally it is taken to refer to Paul, meaning that Paul had his hair cut off because of the vow. However, due to the proximity of the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#913;&#954;&#973;&#955;&#945;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Akula&quot;</font>) and the reversal of the normal order (Aquila and Priscilla, Acts 17:34), the participle is taken as adjectival referring to Aquila by H. Greeven, <i>TDNT</i> 2:777, n. 11. The later references to Paul in Jerusalem (Acts 21:23) do not resolve the problem, because the cutting of Paul&#8217;s own hair, while it may be implied, is not specifically mentioned in connection with the completion of the vows made by the other four.</p>
