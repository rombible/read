<A NAME="1871"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=1949><b>sn</b> <i>He had made a vow.</i> It is debated whether this vow is a private vow of thanksgiving or the Nazirite vow, because it is not clear whether the Nazirite vow could be taken outside Jerusalem. Some have cited the Mishnah (<i>m. Nazir</i> 3:6, 5:4) to argue that the shaving of the hair can occur outside Jerusalem, and Josephus, <i>J. W.</i> 2.15.1 (2.313) is sometimes suggested as a parallel, but these references are not clear. H. Greeven, <i>TDNT</i> 2:777, is certain that this refers to the Nazirite vow. Regardless, it is clear that Paul reflected his pious dependence on God.</p>
