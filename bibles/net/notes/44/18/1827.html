<A NAME="1827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1905><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;shaking out his clothes, he said to them.&#8221; L&amp;N 16:8 translates Acts 18:6 &#8220;when they opposed him and said evil things about him, he protested by shaking the dust from his clothes.&#8221; The addition of the verb &#8220;protested by&#8221; in the translation is necessary to clarify for the modern reader that this is a symbolic action. It is similar but not identical to the phrase in Acts 13:51, where the dust from the feet is shaken off. The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#957;&#945;&#958;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ektinaxameno&quot;</font>) has been translated as a finite verb due to requirements of contemporary English style.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>He protested by shaking out his clothes.</i> A symbolic action of protest, similar but not identical to the practice of shaking the dust off one&#8217;s feet (see Acts 13:51). The two symbolic actions are related, however, since what is shaken off here is the dust raised by the feet and settling in the clothes. The meaning is, &#8220;I am done with you! You are accountable to God.&#8221;</p>
