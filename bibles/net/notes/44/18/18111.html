<A NAME="18111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">111</span><note=1989><b>tn</b> Although many English translations have here &#8220;that Jesus was the Christ,&#8221; in the case of two accusatives following a copulative infinitive, the first would normally be the subject and the second the predicate nominative. Additionally, the first accusative here (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#967;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">ton criston</font>) has the article, a further indication that it should be regarded as subject of the infinitive.</p>
