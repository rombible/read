<A NAME="1893"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">93</span><note=1971><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;was a learned man.&#8221; In this verse <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#953;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">logios</font>) can refer to someone who was an attractive and convincing speaker, a rhetorician (L&amp;N 33.32), or it can refer to the person who has acquired a large part of the intellectual heritage of a given culture (&#8220;learned&#8221; or &#8220;cultured,&#8221; L&amp;N 27.20, see also BDAG 598 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#953;&#959;&#962;</font> which lists both meanings as possible here). The description of Apollos&#8217; fervent speaking in the following verses, as well as implications from 1 Cor 1-4, where Paul apparently compares his style and speaking ability with that of Apollos, suggests that eloquent speaking ability or formal rhetorical skill are in view here. This clause has been moved from its order in the Greek text (<i>Grk</i> &#8220;a certain Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, an eloquent speaker, arrived in Ephesus, who was powerful in the scriptures&#8221;) and paired with the last element (&#8220;powerful in the scriptures&#8221;) due to the demands of clarity and contemporary English style.</p>
