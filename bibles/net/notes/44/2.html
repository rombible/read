<A NAME="21"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=65><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And&#8221; Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;now&#8221; to indicate the transition to a new topic. Greek style often begins sentences or clauses with &#8220;and,&#8221; but English style does not.</p>
<A NAME="22"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=66><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has not been translated for stylistic reasons. It occurs as part of the formula <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7952;&#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#959;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai egeneto</font>) which is often left untranslated in Luke-Acts because it is redundant in contemporary English. Here it is possible (and indeed necessary) to translate <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#959;</font> as &#8220;came&#8221; so that the initial clause of the English translation contains a verb; nevertheless the translation of the conjunction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> is not necessary.</p>
<A NAME="23"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=67><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;a noise.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="24"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=68><b>tn</b> While <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#941;&#961;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ferw</font>) generally refers to movement from one place to another with the possible implication of causing the movement of other objects, in Acts 2:2 <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#941;&#961;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">feromai</font>) should probably be understood in a more idiomatic sense of &#8220;blowing&#8221; since it is combined with the noun for wind (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#957;&#959;&#8053;</font>, <font face="Greektl">pnoh</font>).</p>
<A NAME="25"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=69><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;from the sky.&#8221; The Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ouranos</font>) may be translated &#8220;sky&#8221; or &#8220;heaven&#8221; depending on the context.</p>
<A NAME="26"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=70><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;And divided tongues as of fire.&#8221; The precise meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#961;&#943;&#950;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">diamerizomai</font>) in Acts 2:3 is difficult to determine. The meaning could be &#8220;tongues as of fire dividing up one to each person,&#8221; but it is also possible that the individual tongues of fire were divided (&#8220;And divided tongues as of fire appeared&#8221;). The translation adopted in the text (&#8220;tongues spreading out like a fire&#8221;) attempts to be somewhat ambiguous.</p>
<A NAME="27"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=71><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And all.&#8221; Because of the difference between Greek style, which often begins sentences or clauses with &#8220;and,&#8221; and English style, which generally does not, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has not been translated here.</p>
<A NAME="28"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=72><b>tn</b> The Greek term is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#955;&#8061;&#963;&#963;&#945;&#953;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">glwssai&quot;</font>), the same word used for the tongues of fire.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Other languages.</i> Acts 2:6-7 indicates that these were languages understandable to the hearers, a diverse group from &#8220;every nation under heaven.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="29"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=73><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;just as the spirit gave them to utter.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#966;&#952;&#941;&#947;&#947;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">apofqengomai</font>) was used of special utterances in Classical Greek (BDAG 125 s.v.).</p>
<A NAME="210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=74><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Jews, devout men.&#8221; It is possible that only men are in view here in light of OT commands for Jewish men to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem at various times during the year (cf. Exod 23:17, 34:23; Deut 16:16). However, other evidence seems to indicate that both men and women might be in view. Luke 2:41-52 shows that whole families would make the temporary trip to Jerusalem. In addition, it is probable that the audience consisted of families who had taken up permanent residence in Jerusalem. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#954;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">katoikew</font>) normally means &#8220;reside&#8221; or &#8220;dwell,&#8221; and archaeological evidence from tombs in Jerusalem does indicate that many families immigrated to Jerusalem permanently (see B. Witherington, <i>Acts</i>, 135); this would naturally include women. Also, the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#8053;&#961;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ajnhr</font>), which usually does mean &#8220;male&#8221; or &#8220;man&#8221; (as opposed to woman), sometimes is used generically to mean &#8220;a person&#8221; (BDAG 79 s.v. 2; cf. Matt 12:41). Given this evidence, then, it is conceivable that the audience in view here is not individual male pilgrims but a mixed group of men and women.</p>
<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=75><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Now there were residing in Jerusalem Jews, devout men from every nation under heaven.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>

<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=78><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;They were astounded and amazed, saying.&#8221; The two imperfect verbs, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#958;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#959;</font> (<font face="Greektl">existanto</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#952;&#945;&#973;&#956;&#945;&#950;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">eqaumazon</font>), show both the surprise and the confusion on the part of the hearers. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#958;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#959;</font> (from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#958;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#956;&#953;</font>, <font face="Greektl">existhmi</font>) often implies an illogical perception or response (BDAG 350 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#958;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#956;&#953;</font>): &#8220;to be so astonished as to almost fail to comprehend what one has experienced&#8221; (L&amp;N 25.218).</p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=79><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Behold, aren&#8217;t all these.&#8221; The Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7984;&#948;&#959;&#973;</font> (<font face="Greektl">idou</font>) at the beginning of this statement has not been translated because it has no exact English equivalent here, but adds interest and emphasis (BDAG 468 s.v. 1).</p>
<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=80><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;we hear them, each one of us.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=82><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;Asia&#8221;; in the NT this always refers to the Roman province of Asia, made up of about one-third of the west and southwest end of modern Asia Minor. Asia lay to the west of the region of Phrygia and Galatia. The words &#8220;the province of&#8221; are supplied to indicate to the modern reader that this does not refer to the continent of Asia.</p>
<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=83><b>tn</b> According to BDAG 595 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#923;&#953;&#946;&#973;&#951;</font>, the western part of Libya, Libya Cyrenaica, is referred to here (see also Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 16.6.1 [16.160] for a similar phrase).</p>

<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=86><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;God&#8217;s mighty works.&#8221; Here the genitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">tou qeou</font>) has been translated as a subjective genitive.</p>
<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=87><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;the speakers&#8221; are not in the Greek text, but have been supplied for clarity. Direct objects were frequently omitted in Greek when clear from the context.</p>

<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=90><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;You Jewish men.&#8221; &#8220;Judea&#8221; is preferred here because it is paired with &#8220;Jerusalem,&#8221; a location. This suggests locality rather than ethnic background is the primary emphasis in the context. As for &#8220;men,&#8221; the Greek term here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#8053;&#961;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anhr</font>), which only exceptionally is used in a generic sense of both males and females. In this context, where &#8220;all&#8221; who live in Jerusalem are addressed, it is conceivable that this is a generic usage, although it can also be argued that Peter&#8217;s remarks were addressed primarily to the men present, even if women were there.</p>

<A NAME="228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=92><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;let this be known to you.&#8221; The passive construction has been translated as an active for stylistic reasons.</p>

<A NAME="231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=95><b>sn</b> Note how in the quotation that follows all genders, ages, and classes are included. The event is like a hope Moses expressed in Num 11:29.</p>
<A NAME="232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=96><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>in the last days</i> is not quoted from Joel, but represents Peter&#8217;s interpretive explanation of the current events as falling &#8220;in the last days.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=97><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;on all flesh.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=98><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;slaves.&#8221; Although this translation frequently renders <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">doulos</font>) as &#8220;slave,&#8221; the connotation is often of one who has sold himself into slavery; in a spiritual sense, the idea is that of becoming a slave of God or of Jesus Christ voluntarily. The voluntary notion is not conspicuous here; hence, the translation &#8220;servants.&#8221; In any case, the word does not bear the connotation of a free individual serving another. BDAG notes that &#8220;&#8216;servant&#8217; for &#8216;slave&#8217; is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times&#8230;in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished&#8221; (BDAG 260 s.v.). The most accurate translation is &#8220;bondservant&#8221; (sometimes found in the ASV for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font>), in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another. But as this is archaic, few today understand its force.</p>
<A NAME="235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=99><b>sn</b> The words <i>and they will prophesy</i> in Acts 2:18 are not quoted from Joel 2:29 at this point but are repeated from earlier in the quotation (Acts 2:17) for emphasis. Tongues speaking is described as prophecy, just like intelligible tongues are described in 1 Cor 14:26-33.</p>
<A NAME="236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=100><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;in the heaven.&#8221; The Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ouranos</font>) may be translated &#8220;sky&#8221; or &#8220;heaven&#8221; depending on the context. Here, in contrast to &#8220;the earth below,&#8221; a reference to the sky is more likely.</p>
<A NAME="237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=101><b>tn</b> Here the context indicates the miraculous nature of the signs mentioned; this is made explicit in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=102><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;and wonderful.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=103><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And it will be that.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=104><b>sn</b> A quotation from Joel 2:28-32.</p>
<A NAME="241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=105><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Israelite men,&#8221; although this is less natural English. The Greek term here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#8053;&#961;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anhr</font>), which only exceptionally is used in a generic sense of both males and females. In this context, it is conceivable that this is a generic usage, although it can also be argued that Peter&#8217;s remarks were addressed primarily to the men present, even if women were there.</p>
<A NAME="242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=106><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;miraculous deeds.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=107><b>tn</b> Again, the context indicates the miraculous nature of these signs, and this is specified in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="244"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=108><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;you killed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=109><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;at the hands of lawless men.&#8221; At this point the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anomo&quot;</font>) refers to non-Jews who live outside the Jewish (Mosaic) law, rather than people who broke any or all laws including secular laws. Specifically it is a reference to the Roman soldiers who carried out Jesus&#8217; crucifixion.</p>
<A NAME="246"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=110><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Whom God raised up.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=112><b>sn</b> The term translated <i>pains</i> is frequently used to describe pains associated with giving birth (see Rev 12:2). So there is irony here in the mixed metaphor.</p>
<A NAME="249"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=113><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;for him to be held by it&#8221; (in either case, &#8220;it&#8221; refers to death&#8217;s power).</p>

<A NAME="252"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=116><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;will not abandon my soul to Hades.&#8221; Often &#8220;Hades&#8221; is the equivalent of the Hebrew term Sheol, the place of the dead.</p>
<A NAME="253"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=117><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;to see,&#8221; but the literal translation of the phrase &#8220;to see decay&#8221; could be misunderstood to mean simply &#8220;to look at decay,&#8221; while here &#8220;see decay&#8221; is really figurative for &#8220;experience decay.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="254"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=118><b>sn</b> A quotation from Ps 16:8-11.</p>
<A NAME="255"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=119><b>tn</b> Since this represents a continuation of the address beginning in v.14 and continued in v. 22, &#8220;brothers&#8221; has been used here rather than a generic expression like &#8220;brothers and sisters.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="258"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=122><b>tn</b> The participles <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#967;&#969;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Juparcwn</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#948;&#8061;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">eidw&quot;</font>) are translated as causal adverbial participles.</p>
<A NAME="259"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=123><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;one from the fruit of his loins.&#8221; &#8220;Loins&#8221; is the traditional translation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8000;&#963;&#966;&#8166;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">osfu&quot;</font>), referring to the male genital organs. A literal rendering like &#8220;one who came from his genital organs&#8221; would be regarded as too specific and perhaps even vulgar by many contemporary readers. Most modern translations thus render the phrase &#8220;one of his descendants.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="260"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=124><b>sn</b> An allusion to Ps 132:11 and 2 Sam 7:12-13, the promise in the Davidic covenant.</p>

It could also be translated as a participle of attendant circumstance: &#8220;David foresaw [this] and spoke.&#8221; The word &#8220;this&#8221; is supplied in either case as an understood direct object (direct objects in Greek were often omitted, but must be supplied for the modern English reader).</p>
<A NAME="262"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=126><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the Messiah&#8221;; both &#8220;Christ&#8221; (Greek) and &#8220;Messiah&#8221; (Hebrew and Aramaic) mean &#8220;one who has been anointed.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#967;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">cristos</font>) was originally an adjective (&#8220;anointed&#8221;), developing in LXX into a substantive (&#8220;an anointed one&#8221;), then developing still further into a technical generic term (&#8220;the anointed one&#8221;). In the intertestamental period it developed further into a technical term referring to the hoped-for anointed one, that is, a specific individual. In the NT the development starts there (technical-specific), is so used in the gospels, and then develops in Paul&#8217;s letters to mean virtually Jesus&#8217; last name.</p>
<A NAME="263"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=127><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;abandoned in the world of the dead.&#8221; The translation &#8220;world of the dead&#8221; for Hades is suggested by L&amp;N 1.19. The phrase is an allusion to Ps 16:10.</p>

<A NAME="284"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">84</span><note=148><b>tn</b> There is debate over the meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</font> in the prepositional phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#7940;&#966;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#953;&#8182;&#957; &#8017;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">eis afesin twn Jamartiwn Jumwn</font>, &#8220;for/because of/with reference to the forgiveness of your sins&#8221;). Although a causal sense has been argued, it is difficult to maintain here. <i>ExSyn</i> 369-71 discusses at least four other ways of dealing with the passage: (1) The baptism referred to here is physical only, and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</font> has the meaning of &#8220;for&#8221; or &#8220;unto.&#8221; Such a view suggests that salvation is based on works &#8211; an idea that runs counter to the theology of Acts, namely: (a) repentance often precedes baptism (cf. Acts 3:19; 26:20), and (b) salvation is entirely a gift of God, not procured via water baptism (Acts 10:43 [cf. v. 47]; 13:38-39, 48; 15:11; 16:30-31; 20:21; 26:18); (2) The baptism referred to here is spiritual only. Although such a view fits well with the theology of Acts, it does not fit well with the obvious meaning of &#8220;baptism&#8221; in Acts &#8211; especially in this text (cf. 2:41); (3) The text should be repunctuated in light of the shift from second person plural to third person singular back to second person plural again. The idea then would be, &#8220;Repent <i>for/with reference to </i>your sins, and let each one of you be baptized&#8230;&#8221; Such a view is an acceptable way of handling <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</font>, but its subtlety and awkwardness count against it; (4) Finally, it is possible that to a first-century Jewish audience (as well as to Peter), the idea of baptism might incorporate both the spiritual reality and the physical symbol<i>. </i>That Peter connects both closely in his thinking is clear from other passages such as Acts 10:47 and 11:15-16. If this interpretation is correct, then Acts 2:38 is saying very little about the specific theological relationship between the symbol and the reality, only that historically they were viewed together. One must look in other places for a theological analysis. For further discussion see R. N. Longenecker, &#8220;Acts,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 9:283-85; B. Witherington, <i>Acts</i>, 154-55; F. F.
