Unlike Acts 3-4, the issue here is more than Jesus and his resurrection. Now the impact of his resurrection and the temple&#8217;s centrality has also become an issue. The &#8220;falseness&#8221; of the charge may not be that the witnesses were lying, but that they falsely read the truth of Stephen&#8217;s remarks.</p>
