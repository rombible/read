<A NAME="641"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=494><b>sn</b> <i>The law</i> refers to the law of Moses. It elaborates the nature of the blasphemy in v. 11. To speak against God&#8217;s law in Torah was to blaspheme God (Deut 28:15-19). On the Jewish view of false witnesses, see Exod 19:16-18; 20:16; <i>m. Sanhedrin</i> 3.6; 5.1-5. Stephen&#8217;s speech in Acts 7 may indicate why the temple was mentioned.</p>
