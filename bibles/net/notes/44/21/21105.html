A Gentile was not permitted to enter the inner temple precincts (contrast Eph 2:11-22). According to Josephus (<i>Ant. </i>15.11.5 [15.417]; <i>J. W.</i> 5.5.2 [5.193], cf. 5.5.6 [5.227]), the inner temple courts (the Court of the Women, the Court of the Sons of Israel, and the Court of the Priests) were raised slightly above the level of the Court of the Gentiles and were surrounded by a wall about 5 ft (1.5 m) high. Notices in both Greek and Latin (two of which have been discovered) warned that any Gentiles who ventured into the inner courts would be responsible for their own deaths. See also Philo, <i>Embassy </i>31 (212). In <i>m. Middot</i> 2:3 this wall was called &#8220;<i>soreq</i>&#8221; and according to <i>m. Sanhedrin</i> 9:6 the stranger who trespassed beyond the <i>soreq</i> would die by the hand of God.</p>
