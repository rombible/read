<A NAME="101"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=900><b>sn</b> <i>Caesarea </i>was a city on the coast of Palestine south of Mount Carmel (not Caesarea Philippi). It was known as &#8220;Caesarea by the sea&#8221; (BDAG 499 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#922;&#945;&#953;&#963;&#940;&#961;&#949;&#953;&#945;</font> 2). Largely Gentile, it was a center of Roman administration and the location of many of Herod the Great&#8217;s building projects (Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 15.9.6 [15.331-341]).</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map2-C1; Map4-B3; Map5-F2; Map7-A1; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="102"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=901><b>sn</b> <i>A centurion</i> was a noncommissioned officer in the Roman army or one of the auxiliary territorial armies, commanding a <i>centuria</i> of (nominally) 100 men. The responsibilities of centurions were broadly similar to modern junior officers, but there was a wide gap in social status between them and officers, and relatively few were promoted beyond the rank of senior centurion. The Roman troops stationed in Judea were auxiliaries, who would normally be rewarded with Roman citizenship after 25 years of service. Some of the centurions may have served originally in the Roman legions (regular army) and thus gained their citizenship at enlistment. Others may have inherited it, like Paul.</p>
<A NAME="103"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=902><b>sn</b> A <i>cohort</i> was a Roman military unit of about 600 soldiers, one-tenth of a legion (BDAG 936 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#960;&#949;&#8150;&#961;&#945;</font>). The <i>Italian Cohort</i> has been identified as <i>cohors II Italica</i> which is known to have been stationed in Syria in <sc>a.d. 88.</p>

<A NAME="105"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=904><b>sn</b> The description of Cornelius as <i>a devout, God-fearing man</i> probably means that he belonged to the category called &#8220;God-fearers,&#8221; Gentiles who worshiped the God of Israel and in many cases kept the Mosaic law, but did not take the final step of circumcision necessary to become a proselyte to Judaism. See further K. G. Kuhn, <i>TDNT</i> 6:732-34, 43-44, and Sir 11:17; 27:11; 39:27.</p>

BDAG 185 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#946;&#965;&#961;&#963;&#949;&#973;&#962;</font> regards it as a surname. See also MM 118.</p>

The translation &#8220;from among those who served him&#8221; is general enough to cover either possibility.</p>

<A NAME="1025"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=924><b>tn</b> The traditional translation, &#8220;he fell into a trance,&#8221; is somewhat idiomatic; it is based on the textual variant <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#941;&#960;&#949;&#963;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">epepesen</font>, &#8220;he fell&#8221;) found in the Byzantine text but almost certainly not original.</p>

In this context, however, where &#8220;creeping things&#8221; are contrasted with &#8220;four-footed animals,&#8221; the English word &#8220;reptiles,&#8221; which primarily but not exclusively designates snakes, is probably more appropriate. See also Gen 6:20, as well as the law making such creatures unclean food in Lev 11:2-47.</p>

The idiomatic expression &#8220;birds of the sky&#8221; refers to wild birds as opposed to domesticated fowl (cf.

<A NAME="10129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">129</span><note=1028><b>sn</b> The Jewish Christians who were with Peter <i>were greatly astonished</i> because they thought the promise of the Spirit would be limited only to those of Israel. God&#8217;s plan was taking on fresh dimensions even as it was a reflection of what the prophets had promised.</p>
<A NAME="10130"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">130</span><note=1029><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;because.&#8221;</p>

This could be either &#8220;have&#8221; (NIV, NRSV) or &#8220;did&#8221; (NASB). &#8220;Did&#8221; is preferred here because the comparison Peter is making concerns not just the fact of the present possession of the Spirit (&#8220;they received the Spirit we now possess&#8221;), but the <i>manner</i> in which the Gentiles in Cornelius&#8217; house received the Spirit (&#8220;they received the Spirit in the same manner we did [on the day of Pentecost]&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="10135"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">135</span><note=1034><b>tn</b> The Greek construction anticipates a negative reply which is indicated in the translation by the &#8216;tag&#8217; question, &#8220;can he?&#8221; The question is rhetorical. Peter was saying these Gentiles should be baptized since God had confirmed they were his.</p>
<A NAME="10136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">136</span><note=1035><b>tn</b> The Greek construction (passive infinitive with accusative subject) could be translated either &#8220;he ordered them to be baptized&#8221; or &#8220;he ordered that they be baptized,&#8221; but the implication in English in either case is that Peter was giving orders to the Gentiles in Cornelius&#8217; house, telling them to get baptized. It is much more likely in the context that Peter was ordering those Jewish Christians who accompanied him to baptize the new Gentile converts. They would doubtless have still had misgivings even after witnessing the outpouring of the Spirit and hearing the tongues. It took Peter&#8217;s apostolic authority (&#8220;ordered&#8221;) to convince them to perform the baptisms.</p>
<A NAME="10137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">137</span><note=1036><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Messiah&#8221;; both &#8220;Christ&#8221; (Greek) and &#8220;Messiah&#8221; (Hebrew and Aramaic) mean &#8220;one who has been anointed.&#8221; Jesus&#8217; right to judge as the provider of forgiveness is highlighted here.</p>
