<A NAME="1221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1143><b>tn</b> While <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#950;&#8061;&#957;&#957;&#965;&#956;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">zwnnumi</font>) sometimes means &#8220;to dress,&#8221; referring to the fastening of the belt or sash as the final act of getting dressed, in this context it probably does mean &#8220;put on your belt&#8221; since in the conditions of a prison Peter had probably not changed into a different set of clothes to sleep. More likely he had merely removed his belt or sash, which the angel now told him to replace. The translation &#8220;put on your belt&#8221; is given by L&amp;N 49.14 for this verse. The archaic English &#8220;girdle&#8221; for the sash or belt has an entirely different meaning today.</p>
