<A NAME="1261"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=1183><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Herod) has been specified in the translation for clarity. Since Herod has been the subject of the preceding material, and the circumstances of his death are the subject of the following verses (20-23), it is best to understand Herod as the subject here. This is especially true since according to Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 19.8.2 [19.343-352], Herod Agrippa I died at Caesarea in <sc>a.d. 44, and vv. 20-23 here describe his death. Thus the end of v. 19 provides Luke&#8217;s transition to explain how Herod got from Jerusalem to Caesarea where he died. In spite of all this evidence, the NRSV translates this phrase &#8220;Then Peter went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there,&#8221; understanding the referent to be Peter rather than Herod Agrippa I.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>King Herod</i> was Herod Agrippa I, the grandson of Herod I (Herod the Great), who died at Caesarea in <sc>a.d. 44 according to Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 19.8.2 [19.343-352].</p>
