<A NAME="124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1126><b>sn</b> The expression <i>executed with a sword</i> probably refers to a beheading. James was the first known apostolic martyr (Eusebius, <i>Eccl. Hist.</i> 2.9.1-3). On James, not the Lord&#8217;s brother, see Luke 5:10; 6:14. This death ended a short period of peace noted in Acts 9:31 after the persecution mentioned in 8:1-3.</p>
