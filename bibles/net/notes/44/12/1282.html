<A NAME="1282"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">82</span><note=1204><b>sn</b> <i>He was eaten by worms and died.</i> Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 19.8.2 (19.343-352), states that Herod Agrippa I died at Caesarea in <sc>a.d. 44. The account by Josephus, while not identical to Luke&#8217;s account, is similar in many respects: On the second day of a festival, Herod Agrippa appeared in the theater with a robe made of silver. When it sparkled in the sun, the people cried out flatteries and declared him to be a god. The king, carried away by the flattery, saw an owl (an omen of death) sitting on a nearby rope, and immediately was struck with severe stomach pains. He was carried off to his house and died five days later. The two accounts can be reconciled without difficulty, since while Luke states that Herod was immediately struck down by an angel, his death could have come several days later. The mention of <i>worms</i> with death adds a humiliating note to the scene. The formerly powerful ruler had been thoroughly reduced to nothing (cf. Jdt 16:17; 2 Macc 9:9; cf. also Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 17.6.5 [17.168-170], which details the sickness which led to Herod the Great&#8217;s death). </p>
