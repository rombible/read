<A NAME="1269"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=1191><b>tn</b> On the term translated &#8220;personal assistant&#8221; BDAG 554 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#959;&#953;&#964;&#8182;&#957;</font> states, &#8220;used as part of a title: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#954;&#959;&#953;&#964;&#8182;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> <i>the one in charge of the bed-chamber, the chamberlain</i>.&#8221; This individual was not just a domestic servant or butler, but a highly respected person who had considerable responsibility for the king&#8217;s living quarters and personal affairs. The English word &#8220;chamberlain&#8221; corresponds very closely to this meaning but is not in common use today. The term &#8220;personal assistant,&#8221; while it might convey more business associations than management of personal affairs, nevertheless communicates the concept well in contemporary English.</p>
