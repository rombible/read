<A NAME="1815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1893><b>tn</b> On the term translated &#8220;tentmakers,&#8221; see BDAG 928-29 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#954;&#957;&#951;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#972;&#962;</font>.

However, there does not seem to be contextual evidence for this kind of debate in Acts 18:4. As G. Schrenk (<i>TDNT</i> 2:94-95) points out, &#8220;What is at issue is the address which any qualified member of a synagogue might give.&#8221; Other examples of this may be found in the NT in Matt 4:23 and Mark 1:21.</p>

The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#952;&#949;&#957;</font> has been translated as a conative imperfect.</p>

At this point Paul apparently began to work less and preach more.</p>
<A NAME="1823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1901><b>tn</b> BDAG 233 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#973;&#961;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</font> 2 has &#8220;<i>testify of, bear witness to </i>solemnly (orig. under oath)&#8230;W. acc. and inf. foll.

<A NAME="1825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1903><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;him&#8221; is not in the Greek text but is implied. Direct objects were often omitted in Greek when clear from the context, but must be supplied for the modern English reader.</p>
<A NAME="1826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1904><b>tn</b> The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#946;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#966;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#973;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">blasfhmountwn</font>) has been taken temporally. The direct object (&#8220;him&#8221;) is implied rather than expressed and could be impersonal (&#8220;it,&#8221; referring to what Paul was saying rather than Paul himself), but the verb occurs more often in contexts involving defamation or slander against personal beings (not always God). For a very similar context to this one, compare Acts 13:45. The translation &#8220;blaspheme&#8221; is not used because in contemporary English its meaning is more narrowly defined and normally refers to blasphemy against God (not what Paul&#8217;s opponents were doing here). What they were doing was more like slander or defamation of character.</p>
<A NAME="1827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1905><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;shaking out his clothes, he said to them.&#8221; L&amp;N 16:8 translates Acts 18:6 &#8220;when they opposed him and said evil things about him, he protested by shaking the dust from his clothes.&#8221; The addition of the verb &#8220;protested by&#8221; in the translation is necessary to clarify for the modern reader that this is a symbolic action. It is similar but not identical to the phrase in Acts 13:51, where the dust from the feet is shaken off. The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#957;&#945;&#958;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ektinaxameno&quot;</font>) has been translated as a finite verb due to requirements of contemporary English style.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>He protested by shaking out his clothes.</i> A symbolic action of protest, similar but not identical to the practice of shaking the dust off one&#8217;s feet (see Acts 13:51). The two symbolic actions are related, however, since what is shaken off here is the dust raised by the feet and settling in the clothes. The meaning is, &#8220;I am done with you! You are accountable to God.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1906><b>sn</b> <i>Your blood be on your own heads!</i> By invoking this epithet Paul declared himself not responsible for their actions in rejecting Jesus whom Paul preached (cf.

The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#949;&#946;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">sebomenou</font>) is practically a technical term for the category called <i>God-fearers</i>, Gentiles who worshiped the God of Israel and in many cases kept the Mosaic law, but did not take the final step of circumcision necessary to become a proselyte to Judaism. See further K. G. Kuhn, <i>TDNT</i> 6:732-34, 743-44.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Here yet another <i>Gentile</i> is presented as responsive to Paul&#8217;s message in Acts.</p>

<A NAME="1835"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1913><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;who heard him,&#8221; or &#8220;who heard Paul.&#8221; The ambiguity here results from the tendency of Greek to omit direct objects, which must be supplied from the context. The problem is that no less than three different ones may be supplied here: (1) &#8220;him,&#8221; referring to Crispus, but this is not likely because there is no indication in the context that Crispus began to speak out about the Lord; this is certainly possible and even likely, but more than the text here affirms; (2) &#8220;Paul,&#8221; who had been speaking in the synagogue and presumably, now that he had moved to Titius Justus&#8217; house, continued speaking to the Gentiles; or (3) &#8220;about it,&#8221; that is, the Corinthians who heard about Crispus&#8217; conversion became believers. In the immediate context this last is most probable, since the two incidents are juxtaposed. Other, less obvious direct objects could also be supplied, such as &#8220;heard the word of God,&#8221; &#8220;heard the word of the Lord,&#8221; etc., but none of these are obvious in the immediate context.</p>
<A NAME="1836"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1914><b>sn</b> Frequently in Acts such a <i>vision </i>will tell the reader where events are headed. See Acts 10:9-16 and 16:9-10 for other accounts of visions.</p>

<A NAME="1843"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1921><b>sn</b> <i>Gallio</i> was proconsul of Achaia from <sc>a.d. 51-52. This date is one of the firmly established dates in Acts. Lucius Junius Gallio was the son of the rhetorician Seneca and the brother of Seneca the philosopher. The date of Gallio&#8217;s rule is established from an inscription (W. Dittenberger, ed., <i>Sylloge Inscriptionum Graecarum</i> 2.3 no. 8). Thus the event mentioned here is probably to be dated July-October <sc>a.d. 51.</p>
<A NAME="1844"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1922><b>sn</b> The <i>proconsul</i> was the Roman official who ruled over a province traditionally under the control of the Roman senate.</p>

The judgment seat was a familiar item in Greco-Roman culture, often located in the <i>agora</i>, the public square or marketplace in the center of a city. So this was a very public event.</p>

The words &#8220;in a way&#8221; are not in the Greek text, but are a necessary clarification to prevent the misunderstanding in the English translation that worshiping God was in itself contrary to the law. What is under dispute is the <i>manner</i> in which God was being worshiped, that is, whether Gentiles were being required to follow all aspects of the Mosaic law, including male circumcision. There is a hint of creating public chaos or disturbing Jewish custom here since Jews were the ones making the complaint. Luke often portrays the dispute between Christians and Jews as within Judaism.</p>

Traditionally it is taken to refer to Paul, meaning that Paul had his hair cut off because of the vow.

Greeven, <i>TDNT</i> 2:777, n. 11. The later references to Paul in Jerusalem (Acts 21:23) do not resolve the problem, because the cutting of Paul&#8217;s own hair, while it may be implied, is not specifically mentioned in connection with the completion of the vows made by the other four.</p>
