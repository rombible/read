<A NAME="53"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=343><b>sn</b> This is a good example of the Greek verb <i>fill </i>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#972;&#969;</font>, <font face="Greektl">plhrow</font>) meaning &#8220;to exercise control over someone&#8217;s thought and action&#8221; (cf.

<A NAME="54"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=344><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;from the sale of&#8221; are not in the Greek text, but are supplied to clarify the meaning, since the phrase &#8220;proceeds from the land&#8221; could possibly be understood as crops rather than money from the sale.</p>

<A NAME="59"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=349><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;to men.&#8221; If Peter&#8217;s remark refers only to the apostles, the translation &#8220;to men&#8221; would be appropriate. But if (as is likely) the action was taken to impress the entire congregation (who would presumably have witnessed the donation or been aware of it) then the more general &#8220;to people&#8221; is more appropriate, since the audience would have included both men and women.</p>

The same verb could also be translated &#8220;removed&#8221; (see L&amp;N 15.200), although that sense appears somewhat redundant and out of sequence with the following verb and participle (&#8220;carried him out and buried him&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=353><b>sn</b> <i>Buried.</i> Same day burial was a custom in the Jewish world of the first century (cf. also Deut 21:23).</p>

<A NAME="533"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=373><b>tn</b> Literally a relative pronoun, &#8220;who.&#8221; In English, however, a relative clause (&#8220;bringing the sick and those troubled by unclean spirits, who were all being healed&#8221;) could be understood to refer only to the second group (meaning only those troubled by unclean spirits were being healed) or even that the unclean spirits were being healed. To avoid this ambiguity the pronoun &#8220;they&#8221; was used to begin a new English sentence.</p>
<A NAME="534"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=374><b>sn</b> <i>They were all being healed.</i> Note how the healings that the apostles provided were comprehensive in their consistency.</p>

It is a key term in Judaism for religiously motivated rage (1 Macc 2:24; 1QH 14:13-15; <i>m. Sanhedrin </i>9:5). It was a zeal motivated by a desire to maintain the purity of the faith.</p>

Pharisees differed with Sadducees on certain doctrines and patterns of behavior.
