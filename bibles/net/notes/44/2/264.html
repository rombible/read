<A NAME="264"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=128><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;flesh.&#8221; See vv. 26b-27. The reference to &#8220;body&#8221; in this verse picks up the reference to &#8220;body&#8221; in v. 26. The Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#940;&#961;&#958;</font> (<font face="Greektl">sarx</font>) in both verses literally means &#8220;flesh&#8221;; however, the translation &#8220;body&#8221; stresses the lack of decay of his physical body. The point of the verse is not merely the lack of decay of his flesh alone, but the resurrection of his entire person, as indicated by the previous parallel line &#8220;he was not abandoned to Hades.&#8221;</p>
