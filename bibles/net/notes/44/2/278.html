<A NAME="278"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=142><b>sn</b> <i>Lord.</i> This looks back to the quotation of Ps 110:1 and the mention of &#8220;calling on the Lord&#8221; in 2:21. Peter&#8217;s point is that the Lord on whom one calls for salvation is Jesus, because he is the one mediating God&#8217;s blessing of the Spirit as a sign of the presence of salvation and the last days.</p>
