<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=90><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;You Jewish men.&#8221; &#8220;Judea&#8221; is preferred here because it is paired with &#8220;Jerusalem,&#8221; a location. This suggests locality rather than ethnic background is the primary emphasis in the context. As for &#8220;men,&#8221; the Greek term here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#8053;&#961;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anhr</font>), which only exceptionally is used in a generic sense of both males and females. In this context, where &#8220;all&#8221; who live in Jerusalem are addressed, it is conceivable that this is a generic usage, although it can also be argued that Peter&#8217;s remarks were addressed primarily to the men present, even if women were there.</p>
