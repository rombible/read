<A NAME="26"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=70><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;And divided tongues as of fire.&#8221; The precise meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#961;&#943;&#950;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">diamerizomai</font>) in Acts 2:3 is difficult to determine. The meaning could be &#8220;tongues as of fire dividing up one to each person,&#8221; but it is also possible that the individual tongues of fire were divided (&#8220;And divided tongues as of fire appeared&#8221;). The translation adopted in the text (&#8220;tongues spreading out like a fire&#8221;) attempts to be somewhat ambiguous.</p>
