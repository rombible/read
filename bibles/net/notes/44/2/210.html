<A NAME="210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=74><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Jews, devout men.&#8221; It is possible that only men are in view here in light of OT commands for Jewish men to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem at various times during the year (cf. Exod 23:17, 34:23; Deut 16:16). However, other evidence seems to indicate that both men and women might be in view. Luke 2:41-52 shows that whole families would make the temporary trip to Jerusalem. In addition, it is probable that the audience consisted of families who had taken up permanent residence in Jerusalem. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#954;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">katoikew</font>) normally means &#8220;reside&#8221; or &#8220;dwell,&#8221; and archaeological evidence from tombs in Jerusalem does indicate that many families immigrated to Jerusalem permanently (see B. Witherington, <i>Acts</i>, 135); this would naturally include women. Also, the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#8053;&#961;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ajnhr</font>), which usually does mean &#8220;male&#8221; or &#8220;man&#8221; (as opposed to woman), sometimes is used generically to mean &#8220;a person&#8221; (BDAG 79 s.v. 2; cf. Matt 12:41). Given this evidence, then, it is conceivable that the audience in view here is not individual male pilgrims but a mixed group of men and women.</p>
