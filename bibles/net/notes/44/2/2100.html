<A NAME="2100"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">100</span><note=164><b>tn</b> It is possible that the first term for property (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#964;&#8053;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</font>, <font face="Greektl">kthmata</font>) refers to real estate (as later usage seems to indicate) while the second term (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#958;&#949;&#953;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Juparxeis</font>) refers to possessions in general, but it may also be that the two terms are used together for emphasis, simply indicating that all kinds of possessions were being sold. However, if the first term is more specifically a reference to real estate, it foreshadows the incident with Ananias and Sapphira in Acts 5:1-11.</p>
