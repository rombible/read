<A NAME="284"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">84</span><note=148><b>tn</b> There is debate over the meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</font> in the prepositional phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#7940;&#966;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#953;&#8182;&#957; &#8017;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">eis afesin twn Jamartiwn Jumwn</font>, &#8220;for/because of/with reference to the forgiveness of your sins&#8221;). Although a causal sense has been argued, it is difficult to maintain here. <i>ExSyn</i> 369-71 discusses at least four other ways of dealing with the passage: (1) The baptism referred to here is physical only, and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</font> has the meaning of &#8220;for&#8221; or &#8220;unto.&#8221; Such a view suggests that salvation is based on works &#8211; an idea that runs counter to the theology of Acts, namely: (a) repentance often precedes baptism (cf. Acts 3:19; 26:20), and (b) salvation is entirely a gift of God, not procured via water baptism (Acts 10:43 [cf. v. 47]; 13:38-39, 48; 15:11; 16:30-31; 20:21; 26:18); (2) The baptism referred to here is spiritual only. Although such a view fits well with the theology of Acts, it does not fit well with the obvious meaning of &#8220;baptism&#8221; in Acts &#8211; especially in this text (cf. 2:41); (3) The text should be repunctuated in light of the shift from second person plural to third person singular back to second person plural again. The idea then would be, &#8220;Repent <i>for/with reference to </i>your sins, and let each one of you be baptized&#8230;&#8221; Such a view is an acceptable way of handling <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</font>, but its subtlety and awkwardness count against it; (4) Finally, it is possible that to a first-century Jewish audience (as well as to Peter), the idea of baptism might incorporate both the spiritual reality and the physical symbol<i>. </i>That Peter connects both closely in his thinking is clear from other passages such as Acts 10:47 and 11:15-16. If this interpretation is correct, then Acts 2:38 is saying very little about the specific theological relationship between the symbol and the reality, only that historically they were viewed together. One must look in other places for a theological analysis. For further discussion see R. N. Longenecker, &#8220;Acts,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 9:283-85; B. Witherington, <i>Acts</i>, 154-55; F. F. Bruce, <i>The Acts of the Apostles: The Greek Text with Introduction and Commentary</i>, 129-30; BDAG 290 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</font> 4.f.</p>
