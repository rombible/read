<A NAME="235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=99><b>sn</b> The words <i>and they will prophesy</i> in Acts 2:18 are not quoted from Joel 2:29 at this point but are repeated from earlier in the quotation (Acts 2:17) for emphasis. Tongues speaking is described as prophecy, just like intelligible tongues are described in 1 Cor 14:26-33.</p>
