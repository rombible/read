<A NAME="241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=105><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Israelite men,&#8221; although this is less natural English. The Greek term here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#8053;&#961;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anhr</font>), which only exceptionally is used in a generic sense of both males and females. In this context, it is conceivable that this is a generic usage, although it can also be argued that Peter&#8217;s remarks were addressed primarily to the men present, even if women were there.</p>
