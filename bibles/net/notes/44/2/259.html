<A NAME="259"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=123><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;one from the fruit of his loins.&#8221; &#8220;Loins&#8221; is the traditional translation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8000;&#963;&#966;&#8166;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">osfu&quot;</font>), referring to the male genital organs. A literal rendering like &#8220;one who came from his genital organs&#8221; would be regarded as too specific and perhaps even vulgar by many contemporary readers. Most modern translations thus render the phrase &#8220;one of his descendants.&#8221;</p>
