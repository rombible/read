<A NAME="883"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">83</span><note=747><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the Candace&#8221; (the title of the queen of the Ethiopians). The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#922;&#945;&#957;&#948;&#940;&#954;&#951;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Kandakh&quot;</font>) is much more likely a title rather than a proper name (like Pharaoh, which is a title); see L&amp;N 37.77. A few, however, still take the word to be the name of the queen (L&amp;N 93.209). BDAG 507 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#922;&#945;&#957;&#948;&#940;&#954;&#951;</font>, treats the term as a title and lists classical usage by Strabo (<i>Geography</i> 17.1.54) and others.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Candace</i> was the title of the queen of the Ethiopians. <i>Ethiopia</i> refers to the kingdom of Nubia in the northern Sudan, whose capital was Meroe (not to be confused with Abyssinia, which was later called Ethiopia and converted to Christianity in the 4th century <sc>a.d.). Classical writers refer to several queens of Meroe in the 1st century <sc>b.c. and 1st century <sc>a.d. who had the title Candace (<i>Kandake</i>). The Candace referred to here was probably Amantitere, who ruled <sc>a.d. 25-41.</p>
