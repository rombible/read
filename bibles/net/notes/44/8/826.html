<A NAME="826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=690><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;began to harm [the church] severely.&#8221; If the nuance of this verb is &#8220;destroy,&#8221; then the imperfect verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#955;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#943;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#959;</font> (<font face="Greektl">elumaineto</font>) is best translated as a conative imperfect as in the translation above. If instead the verb is taken to mean &#8220;injure severely&#8221; (as L&amp;N 20.24), it should be translated in context as an ingressive imperfect (&#8220;began to harm the church severely&#8221;). Either option does not significantly alter the overall meaning, since it is clear from the stated actions of Saul in the second half of the verse that he intended to destroy or ravage the church.</p>
