<A NAME="860"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=724><b>tn</b> Since the semantic range for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">logos</font>) is so broad, a number of different translations could be given for the prepositional phrase here. Something along the lines of &#8220;in this thing&#8221; would work well, but is too colloquial for the present translation.</p>
