<A NAME="16127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">127</span><note=1737><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;together with his entire household&#8221; is placed at the end of the English sentence so that it refers to both the rejoicing and the belief. A formal equivalence translation would have &#8220;and he rejoiced greatly with his entire household that he had come to believe in God,&#8221; but the reference to the entire household being baptized in v. 33 presumes that all in the household believed.</p>
