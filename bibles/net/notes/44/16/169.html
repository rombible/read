<A NAME="169"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1619><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;who was well spoken of by the brothers in Lystra and Iconium.&#8221; Because of the awkwardness in English of having two relative clauses follow one another (&#8220;who was a believer&#8230;who was well spoken of&#8221;) and the awkwardness of the passive verb (&#8220;was well spoken of&#8221;), the relative pronoun at the beginning of 16:2 (&#8220;who&#8221;) has been translated as a pronoun (&#8220;him&#8221;) and the construction converted from passive to active at the same time a new sentence was started in the translation.</p>
