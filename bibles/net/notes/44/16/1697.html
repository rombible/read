<A NAME="1697"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">97</span><note=1707><b>tn</b> L&amp;N 6.21 has &#8220;stocks&#8221; for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#8056; &#958;&#973;&#955;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ei&quot; to xulon</font>) here, as does BDAG 685 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#958;&#973;&#955;&#959;&#957;</font> 2.b. However, it is also possible (as mentioned in L&amp;N 18.12) that this does not mean &#8220;stocks&#8221; but a block of wood (a log or wooden column) in the prison to which prisoners&#8217; feet were chained or tied. Such a possibility is suggested by v. 26, where the &#8220;bonds&#8221; (&#8220;chains&#8221;?) of the prisoners loosened.</p>
