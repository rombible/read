<A NAME="1666"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=1676><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;who had a spirit of divination&#8221;; <i>Grk</i> &#8220;who had a spirit of Python.&#8221; According to BDAG 896-97 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#973;&#952;&#969;&#957;</font>, originally <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#928;&#973;&#952;&#969;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Puqwn</font>) was the name of the serpent or dragon that guarded the Delphic oracle. According to Greek mythology, it lived at the foot of Mount Parnassus and was killed by Apollo. From this, the word came to designate a person who was thought to have a spirit of divination. Pagan generals, for example, might consult someone like this. So her presence here suggests a supernatural encounter involving Paul and her &#8220;spirit.&#8221; W. Foerster, <i>TDNT</i> 6:920, connects the term with ventriloquism but states: &#8220;We must assume, however, that for this girl, as for those mentioned by Origen&#8230;, the art of ventriloquism was inseparably connected with a (supposed or authentic) gift of soothsaying.&#8221; It should also be noted that if the girl in question here were only a ventriloquist, the exorcism performed by Paul in v. 18 would not have been effective.</p>
