Although it may be possible to understand the aorist active participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#961;&#8053;&#958;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font> in a causative sense (&#8220;the magistrates caused the clothes to be torn off Paul and Silas&#8221;) in the mob scene that was taking place, it is also possible that the magistrates themselves actively participated. This act was done to prepare them for a public flogging (2 Cor 11:25; 1 Thess 2:2).</p>
