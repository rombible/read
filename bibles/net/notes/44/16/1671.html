<A NAME="1671"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=1681><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;slaves.&#8221; See the note on the word &#8220;servants&#8221; in 2:18. The translation &#8220;servants&#8221; was used here because in this context there appears to be more emphasis on the activity of Paul and his companions (&#8220;proclaiming to you the way of salvation&#8221;) than on their status as &#8220;slaves of the Most High God.&#8221;</p>
