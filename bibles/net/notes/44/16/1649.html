<A NAME="1649"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1659><b>tc</b> &#8225; Or perhaps, &#8220;a city in the first district&#8221; (there are a number of textual variants). L&amp;N 1.85 follow the text of UBS<sup>4</sup> and NA<sup>27</sup> here: &#8220;In Ac 16:12&#8230;the Greek New Testament published by the United Bible Societies has adopted a conjectural emendation, since the more traditional text, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#8061;&#964;&#951; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#956;&#949;&#961;&#943;&#948;&#959;&#962;</font>, literally &#8216;first of the district,&#8217; is not only misleading in meaning but does not reflect the historical fact that Philippi was a city in one of the four districts of Macedonia but was not a capital city.&#8221; The original text is probably <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#8061;&#964;&#951; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#956;&#949;&#961;&#943;&#948;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">prwth th&quot; merido&quot;</font>, &#8220;first of that district&#8221;) as found in <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>74</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A C <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 33<sup>vid</sup> 36 81 323 945 1175 1891 <i>pc</i>. This has traditionally been translated to give the impression that Philippi was the capital city of the district, but it does not necessarily have to be translated this way. The translation of the article before <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#949;&#961;&#943;&#948;&#959;&#962;</font> as &#8220;that&#8221; acknowledges that there were other districts in the province of Macedonia.</p>
