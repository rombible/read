<A NAME="16102"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">102</span><note=1712><b>tn</b> L&amp;N 23.75 has &#8220;had awakened&#8221; here. It is more in keeping with contemporary English style, however, to keep the two verbal ideas parallel in terms of tense (&#8220;when the jailer woke up and saw&#8221;) although logically the second action is subsequent to the first.</p>
