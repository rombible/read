<A NAME="1767"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=1824><b>sn</b> A <i>Stoic</i> was a follower of the philosophy founded by Zeno (342-270 <sc>b.c.), a Phoenician who came to Athens and modified the philosophical system of the Cynics he found there. The Stoics rejected the Epicurean ideal of pleasure, stressing virtue instead. The Stoics emphasized responsibility for voluntary actions and believed risks were worth taking, but thought the actual attainment of virtue was difficult. They also believed in providence.</p>
