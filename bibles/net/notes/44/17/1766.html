<A NAME="1766"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=1823><b>sn</b> An <i>Epicurean</i> was a follower of the philosophy of Epicurus, who founded a school in Athens about 300 <sc>b.c. Although the Epicureans saw the aim of life as pleasure, they were not strictly hedonists, because they defined pleasure as the absence of pain. Along with this, they desired the avoidance of trouble and freedom from annoyances. They saw organized religion as evil, especially the belief that the gods punished evildoers in an afterlife. In keeping with this, they were unable to accept Paul&#8217;s teaching about the resurrection.</p>
