<A NAME="17120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">120</span><note=1877><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the Areopagite&#8221; (a member of the council of the Areopagus). The noun &#8220;Areopagite&#8221; is not in common usage today in English. It is clearer to use a descriptive phrase &#8220;a member of the Areopagus&#8221; (L&amp;N 11.82). However, this phrase alone can be misleading in English: &#8220;Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, and a woman named Damaris&#8221; could be understood to refer to three people (Dionysius, an unnamed member of the Areopagus, and Damaris) rather than only two. Converting the descriptive phrase to a relative clause in English (&#8220;who was a member of the Areopagus&#8221;) removes the ambiguity.</p>
