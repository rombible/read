This term does not refer so much to the place, however, as to the advisory council of Athens known as the <i>Areopagus</i>, which dealt with ethical, cultural, and religious matters, including the supervision of education and controlling the many visiting lecturers. Thus it could be translated <i>the council of the Areopagus</i>. See also the term in v. 22.</p>
