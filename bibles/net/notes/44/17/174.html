<A NAME="174"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1761><b>sn</b> <i>Thessalonica</i> (modern Salonica) was a city in Macedonia about 33 mi (53 km) west of Apollonia. It was the capital of Macedonia. The road they traveled over was called the <i>Via Egnatia</i>. It is likely they rode horses, given their condition in Philippi. The implication of v. 1 is that the two previously mentioned cities lacked a synagogue.</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see JP1-C1; JP2-C1; JP3-C1; JP4-C1.</p>
