<A NAME="413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=260><b>tn</b> In the historical setting it is likely that only men are referred to here. The Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#8053;&#961;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anhr</font>) usually refers to males or husbands rather than people in general. Thus to translate &#8220;of the people&#8221; would give a false impression of the number, since any women and children were apparently not included in the count.</p>
<A NAME="414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=261><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;It happened that on the next day.&#8221; The introductory phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#959;</font> (<font face="Greektl">egeneto</font>, &#8220;it happened that&#8221;), common in Luke (69 times) and Acts (54 times), is redundant in contemporary English and has not been translated.</p>
<A NAME="415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=262><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;and scribes.&#8221; The traditional rendering of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">grammateu&quot;</font>) as &#8220;scribe&#8221; does not communicate much to the modern English reader, for whom the term might mean &#8220;professional copyist,&#8221; if it means anything at all. The people referred to here were recognized experts in the law of Moses and in traditional laws and regulations. Thus &#8220;expert in the law&#8221; comes closer to the meaning for the modern reader.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Experts in the law</i> would have been mostly like the Pharisees in approach. Thus various sects of Judaism were coming together against Jesus.</p>

Instead a new sentence is begun in the translation at the beginning of v. 7.</p>

This question, meaning &#8220;by whose authority,&#8221; surfaces an old dispute (see Luke 20:1-8). Who speaks for God about the ancient faith?</p>
<A NAME="422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=269><b>sn</b> <i>Filled with the Holy Spirit. </i>The narrator&#8217;s remark about <i>the Holy Spirit</i> indicates that Peter speaks as directed by God and for God. This fulfills Luke 12:11-12 (1 Pet 3:15).</p>

The longer reading was most likely added by scribes to give literary balance to the addressees in that &#8220;Rulers&#8221; already had an adjunct while &#8220;elders&#8221; was left absolute.</p>
<A NAME="425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=272><b>tn</b> This clause is a first class condition. It assumes for the sake of argument that this is what they were being questioned about.</p>

<A NAME="429"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=276><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Messiah&#8221;; both &#8220;Christ&#8221; (Greek) and &#8220;Messiah&#8221; (Hebrew and Aramaic) mean &#8220;one who has been anointed.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="431"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=278><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;you&#8221; is inserted into the quotation because Peter is making a direct application of Ps 118:22 to his hearers. Because it is not in the OT, it has been left as normal type (rather than bold italic). The remarks are like Acts 2:22-24 and 3:12-15.</p>
<A NAME="432"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=279><b>sn</b> A quotation from Ps 118:22 which combines the theme of rejection with the theme of God&#8217;s vindication/exaltation.</p>
<A NAME="433"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=280><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#8061;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anqrwpoi&quot;</font>) has been translated as a generic noun (&#8220;people&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="434"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=281><b>sn</b> <i>Must be saved. </i>The term used here (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#949;&#8150;</font>, <font face="Greektl">dei</font>, &#8220;it is necessary&#8221;) reflects the necessity set up by God&#8217;s directive plan.</p>

<A NAME="437"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=284><b>sn</b> <i>Uneducated</i> does not mean &#8220;illiterate,&#8221; that is, unable to read or write. Among Jews in NT times there was almost universal literacy, especially as the result of widespread synagogue schools. The term refers to the fact that Peter and John had no formal rabbinic training and thus, in the view of their accusers, were not qualified to expound the law or teach publicly. The objection is like Acts 2:7.</p>
<A NAME="438"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=285><b>tn</b> For the translation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7984;&#948;&#953;&#8182;&#964;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">idiwtai</font>) as &#8220;ordinary men&#8221; see L&amp;N 27.26.</p>

<A NAME="442"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=289><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#951;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">shmeion</font>) has been translated as &#8220;miraculous sign&#8221; rather than simply &#8220;sign&#8221; or &#8220;miracle&#8221; since both components appear to be present in the context. It is clear that the healing of the lame man was a miracle, but for the Sanhedrin it was the value of the miraculous healing as a sign that concerned them because it gave attestation to the message of Peter and John. The sign &#8220;speaks&#8221; as Peter claimed in 3:11-16.</p>
<A NAME="443"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=290><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;has been done by them.&#8221;</p>

The person of Jesus and his authority is the &#8220;troubling&#8221; topic that, as far as the Jewish leadership is concerned, needs controlling.</p>
<A NAME="447"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=294><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;answered and said to them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="448"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=295><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;hear,&#8221; but the idea of &#8220;hear and obey&#8221; or simply &#8220;obey&#8221; is frequently contained in the Greek verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">akouw</font>; see L&amp;N 36.14).</p>

See also the note on this word in v. 16.</p>
<A NAME="452"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=299><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;had been done.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="453"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=300><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;they&#8221;; the referents (Peter and John) have been specified in the translation for clarity, since a new topic begins in v. 23 and the last specific reference to Peter and John in the Greek text is in 4:19.</p>
<A NAME="454"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=301><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;to their own [people].&#8221; In context this phrase is most likely a reference to other believers rather than simply their own families and/or homes, since the group appears to act with one accord in the prayer that follows in v. 24. At the literary level, this phrase suggests how Jews were now splitting into two camps, pro-Jesus and anti-Jesus.</p>
<A NAME="455"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=302><b>sn</b> <i>With one mind. </i>Compare Acts 1:14.</p>
<A NAME="456"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=303><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Lord of all.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The use of the title <i>Master of all </i>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#949;&#963;&#960;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">despoths</font>) emphasizes that there is a sovereign God who is directing what is taking place.</p>
<A NAME="457"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=304><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;and the earth, and the sea,&#8221; but <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has not been translated before &#8220;the earth&#8221; and &#8220;the sea&#8221; since contemporary English normally uses a coordinating conjunction only between the last two elements in a series of three or more.</p>

<A NAME="466"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=313><b>sn</b> The application of Ps 2:1-2 is that Jews and Gentiles are opposing Jesus. The surprise of the application is that Jews are now found among the enemies of God&#8217;s plan.</p>
