<A NAME="92"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=784><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;breathing out threats and murder&#8221; is an idiomatic expression for &#8220;making threats to murder&#8221; (see L&amp;N 33.293). Although the two terms &#8220;threats&#8221; and &#8220;murder&#8221; are syntactically coordinate, the second is semantically subordinate to the first. In other words, the content of the threats is to murder the disciples.</p>
