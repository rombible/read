<A NAME="94"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=786><b>sn</b> The expression &#8220;the way&#8221; in ancient religious literature refers at times to &#8220;the whole way of life fr. a moral and spiritual viewpoint&#8221; (BDAG 692 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001;&#948;&#972;&#962;</font> 3.c), and it has been so used of Christianity and its teachings in the book of Acts (see also 19:9, 23; 22:4; 24:14, 22). It is a variation of Judaism&#8217;s idea of two ways, the true and the false, where &#8220;<i>the Way</i>&#8221; is the true one (<i>1 En.</i> 91:18; <i>2 En.</i> 30:15).</p>
