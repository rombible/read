<A NAME="967"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=849><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;he was with them going in and going out in Jerusalem.&#8221; The expression &#8220;going in and going out&#8221; is probably best taken as an idiom for association without hindrance. Some modern translations (NASB, NIV) translate the phrase &#8220;moving about freely in Jerusalem,&#8221; although the NRSV retains the literal &#8220;he went in and out among them in Jerusalem.&#8221;</p>
