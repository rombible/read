<A NAME="926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=808><b>tc</b> &#8225; The words <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#8000;&#961;&#940;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en oramati</font>, &#8220;in a vision&#8221;) are not found in some of the earliest and best <sc>mss (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>74</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A 81 <i>pc </i>lat sa bo), but are implied from the context. The phrase is included, although sometimes in a different order with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">andra</font>, &#8220;man&#8221;) or omitting <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#945;</font> altogether, by B C E <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 33 1175 1739 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>. The order of words in NA<sup>27</sup>, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#945; &#7952;&#957; &#8001;&#961;&#940;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font>, is supported only by B C 1175. Generally speaking, when there are three or more variants, with one an omission and the others involving rearrangements, the longer readings are later scribal additions. Further, the reading looks like a clarifying note, for an earlier vision is explicitly mentioned in v. 10. On the other hand, it is possible that some scribes deleted the words because of perceived repetition, though this is unlikely since it is a different vision two verses back. It is also possible that some scribes could have confused <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001;&#961;&#940;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font> with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8000;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">onomati</font>, &#8220;name&#8221;); <i>TCGNT</i> 319 notes that several <sc>mss place <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font> before <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#913;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#943;&#945;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Ananian</font>, &#8220;Ananias&#8221;) while a few others drop <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8000;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font> altogether. The Sahidic <sc>mss are among those that drop the word, however, and they also lack <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#8001;&#961;&#940;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font>; all that is left is one version and father that drops <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8000;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font>. Perhaps the best argument for the authenticity of the phrase is that B C 1175 preserve a rare, distinctively Lukan word order, but this is not nearly as harsh or unusual as what Luke does elsewhere. A decision is difficult in this case, but on balance the omission of the phrase seems to be authentic. The words are nevertheless added in the translation because of contextual considerations. NA<sup>27</sup> places the words in brackets, indicating doubts as to their authenticity. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Apparently while in Damascus Paul had a subsequent <i>vision</i> in the midst of his blindness, fulfilling the prediction in 9:6.</p>
