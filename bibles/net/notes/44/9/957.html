<A NAME="957"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=839><b>tn</b> The opening in the wall is not specifically mentioned here, but the parallel account in 2 Cor 11:33 mentions a &#8220;window&#8221; or &#8220;opening&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">quris</font>) in the city wall through which Paul was lowered. One alternative to introducing mention of the opening is to translate Acts 9:25 &#8220;they let him down over the wall,&#8221; as suggested in L&amp;N 7.61. This option is not employed by many translations, however, because for the English reader it creates an (apparent) contradiction between Acts 9:25 and 2 Cor 11:33. In reality the account here is simply more general, omitting the detail about the window.</p>
