<A NAME="1582"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">82</span><note=1573><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;men who&#8221;; but this can be misleading because in English the referent could be understood to be the men sent along with Barnabas and Paul rather than Barnabas and Paul themselves. This option does not exist in the Greek original, however, since <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#8061;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anqrwpoi&quot;</font>) is dative and must agree with &#8220;Barnabas and Paul,&#8221; while <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#945;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">andra&quot;</font>) is accusative. By omitting the word &#8220;men&#8221; from the translation here, it is clear in English that the phrase refers to the immediately preceding nouns &#8220;Barnabas and Paul.&#8221;</p>
