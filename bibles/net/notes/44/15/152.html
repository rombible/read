<A NAME="152"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1493><b>tc</b> Codex Bezae (D) and a few other witnesses have &#8220;and walk&#8221; here (i.e., instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8183; &#7956;&#952;&#949;&#953; &#964;&#8183; &#924;&#969;&#971;&#963;&#941;&#969;&#962;</font> [<font face="Greektl">tw eqei tw Mwu&gt;sew&quot;</font>] they read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8183; &#7956;&#952;&#949;&#953; &#964;&#8183; &#924;&#969;&#971;&#963;&#941;&#969;&#962; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#960;&#945;&#964;&#8134;&#964;&#949;</font> [<font face="Greektl">kai tw eqei tw Mwu&gt;sew&quot; peripathte</font>]). This is a decidedly stronger focus on obedience to the Law. As well, D expands vv. 1-5 in various places with the overall effect of being &#8220;more sympathetic to the local tradition of the church at Jerusalem&#8221; while the Alexandrian witnesses are more sympathetic to Paul (<i>TCGNT</i> 377). Codex D is well known for having a significantly longer text in Acts, but modern scholarship is generally of the opinion that the text of D expands on the original wording of Acts, with a theological viewpoint that especially puts Peter in a more authoritarian light. The expansion in these five verses is in keeping with that motif even though Peter is not explicitly in view.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Unless you are circumcised.</i> These teachers from Judea were teaching that Gentiles could not be saved unless they kept the law of Moses in regard to circumcision. Thus according to them a Gentile had first to become a proselyte to Judaism, including circumcision, before one could become a Christian. This party is sometimes known (collectively) as Judaizers. They did not question that Gentiles could come into the community, but disagreed with Paul and Barnabas on what basis they could do so.</p>
