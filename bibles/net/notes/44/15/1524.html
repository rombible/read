<A NAME="1524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1515><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;God chose among you from my mouth the Gentiles to hear the message of the gospel and to believe.&#8221; The sense of this sentence in Greek is difficult to render in English. The Greek verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#955;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">eklegomai</font>, &#8220;choose&#8221;) normally takes a person or thing as a direct object; in this verse the verb has neither clearly stated. The translation understands the phrase &#8220;from my mouth,&#8221; referring to Peter, as a description of both who God chose and the task to be done. This coupled with the following statement about Gentiles hearing the message of the gospel leads to the more dynamic rendering in the translation.</p>
