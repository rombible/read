<A NAME="1531"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1522><b>sn</b> A<i> yoke</i> is a wooden bar or frame that joins two animals like oxen or horses so that they can pull a wagon, plow, etc. together. Here it is used figuratively of the restriction that some in the early church wanted to place on Gentile converts to Christianity of observing the law of Moses and having males circumcised. The <i>yoke</i> is a decidedly negative image: Matt 23:4, but cf. Matt 11:29-30.</p>
