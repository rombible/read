<A NAME="1520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1511><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;long ago&#8221; (an idiom, literally &#8220;from ancient days&#8221;). According to L&amp;N 67.26, &#8220;this reference to Peter having been chosen by God sometime before to bring the gospel to the Gentiles can hardly be regarded as a reference to ancient times, though some persons understand this to mean that God&#8217;s decision was made at the beginning of time. The usage of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#966;&#8127; &#7969;&#956;&#949;&#961;&#8182;&#957; &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#943;&#969;&#957;</font> is probably designed to emphasize the established nature of God&#8217;s decision for Peter to take the gospel to the Gentiles beginning with the centurion Cornelius. The fact that this was relatively early in the development of the church may also serve to explain the use of the idiom.&#8221;</p>
