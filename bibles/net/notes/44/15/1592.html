<A NAME="1592"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">92</span><note=1583><b>tc</b> Codex Bezae (D) as well as 323 614 945 1739 1891 sa and other witnesses have after &#8220;sexual immorality&#8221; the following statement: &#8220;And whatever you do not want to happen to yourselves, do not do to another/others.&#8221; By adding this negative form of the Golden Rule, these witnesses effectively change the Apostolic Decree from what might be regarded as ceremonial restrictions into more ethical demands. The issues here are quite complicated, and beyond the scope of this brief note. Suffice it to say that D and its allies here are almost surely an expansion and alteration of the original text of Acts. For an excellent discussion of the exegetical and textual issues, see <i>TCGNT</i> 379-83.</p>
