<A NAME="1588"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">88</span><note=1579><b>tn</b> This is the same expression translated &#8220;decided&#8221; in Acts 15:22, 25. BDAG 255 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#954;&#941;&#969;</font> 2.b.<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#946;</font> lists &#8220;<i>decide</i>&#8221; as a possible gloss for this verse, and this translation would be consistent with the translation of the same expression in Acts 15:22, 25. However, the unusually awkward &#8220;the Holy Spirit and we have decided&#8221; would result. Given this approach, it would be more natural in English to say &#8220;We and the Holy Spirit have decided,&#8221; but changing the order removes the emphasis the Greek text gives to the Holy Spirit. Thus, although the similarity to the phrases in 15:22, 25 is obscured, it is better to use the alternate translation &#8220;<i>it seems best to me</i>&#8221; (also given by BDAG): &#8220;it seemed best to the Holy Spirit and to us.&#8221; Again the scope of agreement is highlighted.</p>
