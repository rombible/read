<A NAME="1557"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=1548><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I have decided,&#8221; &#8220;I think.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#961;&#943;&#957;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">krinw</font>) has a far broader range of meaning than the often-used English verb &#8220;judge.&#8221; BDAG 568 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#961;&#943;&#957;&#969;</font> 3 places this use in Acts 15:19 in the category &#8220;<i>judge, think, consider, look upon</i>&#8221; followed by double accusative of object and predicate. However, many modern translations give the impression that a binding decision is being handed down by James: &#8220;it is my judgment&#8221; (NASB, NIV); &#8220;I have reached the decision&#8221; (NRSV). L&amp;N 22.25, on the other hand, translate the phrase here &#8220;I think that we should not cause extra difficulty for those among the Gentiles.&#8221; This gives more the impression of an opinion than a binding decision. The resolution of this lies not so much in the lexical data as in how one conceives James&#8217; role in the leadership of the Jerusalem church, plus the dynamics of the specific situation where the issue of Gentile inclusion in the church was being discussed. The major possibilities are: (1) James is handing down a binding decision to the rest of the church as the one who has ultimate authority to decide this matter; (2) James is offering his own personal opinion in the matter, which is not binding on the church; (3) James is voicing a consensus opinion of all the apostles and elders, although phrasing it as if it were his own; (4) James is making a suggestion to the rest of the leadership as to what course they should follow. In light of the difficulty in reconstructing the historical situation in detail, it is best to use a translation which maintains as many of the various options as possible. For this reason the translation &#8220;Therefore I conclude&#8221; has been used, leaving open the question whether in reaching this conclusion James is speaking only for himself or for the rest of the leadership.</p>
