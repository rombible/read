The omission of the pronoun (the reading of B D P 0111<sup>vid</sup> 33 1739 1881 <i>pc</i>) seems to be the original wording of this salutation. As well, the intrinsic evidence also supports the shorter reading: If 2 Thessalonians is authentic, it was one of Paul&#8217;s earliest letters, and, if so, his stereotyped salutation was still in embryonic form (see discussion at 1 Thess 1:1). NA<sup>27</sup> places the word in brackets, indicating some doubts as to its authenticity.</p>
