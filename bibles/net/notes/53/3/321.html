<A NAME="321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=72><b>tc</b> Most witnesses, including some early and important ones (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> A D F G <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936; </font><font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> </font>lat sy), conclude this letter with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">amhn</font>, &#8220;amen&#8221;). Such a conclusion is routinely added by scribes to NT books because a few of these books originally had such an ending (cf. Rom 16:27; Gal 6:18; Jude 25). A majority of Greek witnesses have the concluding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957; </font>in every NT book except Acts, James, and 3 John (and even in these books, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> is found in some witnesses). It is thus a predictable variant. Further, the witnesses for the omission are among the best <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* B 0278 6 33 1739 1881* 2464 sa), giving sufficient base to prefer the shorter reading.</p>
