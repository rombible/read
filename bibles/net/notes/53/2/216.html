<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=34><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the one who restrains.&#8221; This gives a puzzling contrast to the impersonal phrase in v. 6 (&#8220;the thing that restrains&#8221;). The restraint can be spoken of as a force or as a person. Some have taken this to mean the Roman Empire in particular or human government in general, since these are forces that can also be seen embodied in a person, the emperor or governing head. But apocalyptic texts like Revelation and Daniel portray human government of the end times as under Satanic control, not holding back his influence. Also the power to hold back Satanic forces can only come from God. So others understand this restraint to be some force from God: the preaching of the gospel or the working of the Holy Spirit through God&#8217;s people.</p>
