<A NAME="32"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=53><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the word of the Lord.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> &#8220;The word of the Lord&#8221; is a technical expression in OT literature, often referring to a divine prophetic utterance (e.g., Gen 15:1, Isa 1:10, Jonah 1:1). In the NT it occurs 15 times: 3 times as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8165;&#8134;&#956;&#945; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#954;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">rJhma tou kuriou</font>; Luke 22:61, Acts 11:16, 1 Pet 1:25) and 12 times as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#954;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">logo&quot; tou kuriou</font>; here and in Acts 8:25; 13:44, 48, 49; 15:35, 36; 16:32; 19:10, 20; 1 Thess 1:8, 4:15). As in the OT, this phrase focuses on the prophetic nature and divine origin of what has been said. Here the phrase has been translated &#8220;the Lord&#8217;s message&#8221; because of the focus upon the spread of the gospel evident in the passage.</p>

<A NAME="35"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=56><b>tn</b> The genitive in the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">thn agaphn tou qeou</font>, &#8220;the love of God&#8221;) could be translated as either a subjective genitive (&#8220;God&#8217;s love&#8221;) or an objective genitive (&#8220;your love for God&#8221;). Either is grammatically possible. This is possibly an instance of a plenary genitive (see <i>ExSyn</i> 119-21; M. Zerwick, <i>Biblical Greek</i>, §§36-39). If so, the emphasis would be on believers being directed toward the love God gives which in turn produces increased love in them for him. </p>

Either is grammatically possible. This is possibly an instance of a plenary genitive (see <i>ExSyn</i> 119-21; M. Zerwick, <i>Biblical Greek</i>, §§36-39).

<A NAME="38"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=59><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;unruly, out of line.&#8221; The particular violation Paul has in mind is idleness (as described in vv. 8-11), so this could be translated to reflect that.</p>
<A NAME="39"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=60><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;walking in an undisciplined way&#8221; (&#8220;walking&#8221; is a common NT idiom for one&#8217;s way of life or conduct).</p>
<A NAME="310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=61><b>tc</b> The reading &#8220;you received&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#949;&#955;&#940;&#946;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font>, <font face="Greektl">parelabete</font>) is found predominately in Western witnesses (F G 1505 2464 <i>pc</i>), although the support of B and the Sahidic version strengthens the reading considerably. The reading &#8220;they received&#8221; is found in two different forms: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#949;&#955;&#940;&#946;&#959;&#963;&#945;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">parelabosan</font>; in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* A [D*] 0278 33 <i>pc</i>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#941;&#955;&#945;&#946;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">parelabon</font>; in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> D<sup>2</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 1739 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>). (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#941;&#955;&#945;&#946;&#959;&#957;</font> is evidently a correction of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#949;&#955;&#940;&#946;&#959;&#963;&#945;&#957;</font> to the more common spelling for the third person aorist form). The external evidence is divided fairly evenly, with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#949;&#955;&#940;&#946;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#949;&#955;&#940;&#946;&#959;&#963;&#945;&#957;</font> each having adequate support. Internal evidence leans toward &#8220;they received&#8221;: Given the second person reading, there is little reason why scribes would intentionally change it to a third person plural, and especially an archaic form at that. There is ample reason, however, for scribes to change the third person form to the second person form given that in the prior context <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#940;&#948;&#959;&#963;&#953;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">paradosis</font>, &#8220;tradition&#8221;) is used with a relative clause (as here) with a second person verb (see 2:15). The third person form should be regarded as original.</p>
<A NAME="311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=62><b>tn</b> This is the verbal form of the words occurring in vv. 6 and 11, meaning &#8220;to act out of line, in an unruly way.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=63><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;we did not eat bread freely from anyone.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=64><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;but working,&#8221; as a continuation of the previous sentence. Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started with the word &#8220;Instead&#8221; in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=65><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;an example for you to imitate us.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=66><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;walking in an undisciplined way&#8221; (&#8220;walking&#8221; is a common NT idiom for one&#8217;s way of life or conduct).</p>
<A NAME="316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=67><b>tn</b> There is a play on words in the Greek: &#8220;working at nothing, but working around,&#8221; &#8220;not keeping busy but being busybodies.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=68><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;that by working quietly they may eat their own bread.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=69><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;brothers.&#8221; See note on the phrase &#8220;brothers and sisters&#8221; in 1:3.</p>
<A NAME="319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=70><b>tn</b> That is, as a fellow believer.</p>
<A NAME="320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=71><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;The greeting in my hand, Paul, which is a sign in every letter, thus I write.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Up to 3:17 the letter was dictated by Paul but written down by a secretary or amanuensis. But Paul took up the pen and wrote vv. 17-18 personally to authenticate that it was his (<i>how I write in every letter</i>). See similar indications in 1 Cor 16:21; Gal 6:11; and Col 4:18.</p>
<A NAME="321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=72><b>tc</b> Most witnesses, including some early and important ones (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> A D F G <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936; </font><font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> </font>lat sy), conclude this letter with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">amhn</font>, &#8220;amen&#8221;). Such a conclusion is routinely added by scribes to NT books because a few of these books originally had such an ending (cf. Rom 16:27; Gal 6:18; Jude 25). A majority of Greek witnesses have the concluding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957; </font>in every NT book except Acts, James, and 3 John (and even in these books, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> is found in some witnesses). It is thus a predictable variant. Further, the witnesses for the omission are among the best <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* B 0278 6 33 1739 1881* 2464 sa), giving sufficient base to prefer the shorter reading.</p>
