<A NAME="765"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=484><b>tn</b> The words, &#8220;you people of this nation&#8221; are not in the text. Many English versions supply, &#8220;Jerusalem.&#8221; The address shifts from second masculine singular addressing Jeremiah (vv. 27-28a) to second feminine singular. It causes less disruption in the flow of the context to see the nation as a whole addressed here as a feminine singular entity (as, e.g., in 2:19, 23; 3:2, 3; 6:26) than to introduce a new entity, Jerusalem.</p>
