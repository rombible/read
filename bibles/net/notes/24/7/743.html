<A NAME="743"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=462><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;to provoke me.&#8221; There is debate among grammarians and lexicographers about the nuance of the Hebrew particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿma</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">an</font>). Some say it always denotes purpose, while others say it may denote either purpose or result, depending on the context. For example, BDB 775 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</font> note 1 says that it always denotes purpose, never result, but that sometimes what is really a result is represented ironically as though it were a purpose. That explanation fits nicely here in the light of the context of the next verse. The translation is intended to reflect some of that ironic sarcasm.</p>
