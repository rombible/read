<A NAME="759"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=478><b>tc</b> There is some textual debate about the legitimacy of this expression here. The text reads merely &#8220;day&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yom</font>). <i>BHS</i> suggests the word is to be deleted as a dittography of the plural ending of the preceding word. The word is in the Greek and Latin, and the Syriac represents the typical idiom &#8220;day after day&#8221; as though the noun were repeated. Either <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> has dropped out by haplography or a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mem</font>) has been left out, i.e., reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1502;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yomam</font>, &#8220;daily&#8221;).</p>
