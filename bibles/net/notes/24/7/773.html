<A NAME="773"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=492><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the high places of [or in] Topheth.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The noun <i>Topheth</i> is generally explained as an artificial formation of a word related to the Aramaic word for &#8220;cooking stove&#8221; combined with the vowels for the word for &#8220;shame.&#8221; Hence, Jewish piety viewed it as a very shameful act, one that was contrary to the law (see Lev 18:21; 20:2-6). Child sacrifice was practiced during the reigns of the wicked kings Ahaz and Manasseh and apparently during Jeremiah&#8217;s day (cf. 2 Kgs 16:3; 21:6; Jer 32:35).</p>
