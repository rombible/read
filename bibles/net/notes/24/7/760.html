<A NAME="760"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=479><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;But your predecessors&#8230;&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;But they&#8230;.&#8221; There is a confusing interchange in the pronouns in vv. 25-26 which has led to some leveling in the ancient versions and the modern English versions. What is involved here are four levels of referents, the &#8220;you&#8221; of the present generation (vv. 21-22a), the ancestors who were delivered from Egypt (i.e., the &#8220;they&#8221; of vv. 22b-24), the &#8220;you&#8221; of v. 25 which involves all the Israelites from the Exodus to the time of speaking, and the &#8220;they&#8221; of v. 26 which cannot be the ancestors of vv. 22-24 (since they cannot be more wicked than themselves) but must be an indefinite entity which is a part of the &#8220;you&#8221; of v. 25, i.e., the more immediate ancestors of the present generation. If this is kept in mind, there is no need to level the pronouns to &#8220;they&#8221; and &#8220;them&#8221; or to &#8220;you&#8221; and &#8220;your&#8221; as some of the ancient versions and modern English versions have done.</p>
