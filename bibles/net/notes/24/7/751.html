<A NAME="751"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=470><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Add your burnt offerings to your [other] sacrifices and eat the meat!&#8221; See the following <b>sn</b> for explanation. This is an example of the rhetorical use of the imperative for a sarcastic challenge. Cf. GKC 324 §110.<i>a</i>; cf. Amos 4:4, &#8220;Go to Bethel and sin!&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> All of the burnt offering, including the meat, was to be consumed on the altar (e.g., Lev 1:6-9). The meat of the other sacrifices could be eaten by the priest who offered the sacrifice and the person who brought it (e.g., Lev 7:16-18, 32). Since, however, the people of Judah were making a mockery of the sacrificial system by offering sacrifices while disobeying the law, the <sc>Lord rejected the sacrifices (cf. 6:20). Since they were violating the moral law they might as well go ahead and violate the cultic law by eating the meat dedicated to God because he rejected it anyway.</p>
