<A NAME="756"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=475><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;They went backward and not forward&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;They were to the backward and not to the forward.&#8221; The two phrases used here appear nowhere else in the Bible and the latter preposition plus adverb elsewhere is used temporally meaning &#8220;formerly&#8221; or &#8220;previously.&#8221; The translation follows the proposal of J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah </i>(AB), 57. Another option is &#8220;they turned their backs to me, not their faces,&#8221; understanding the line as a variant of a line in 2:27.</p>
