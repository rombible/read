<A NAME="753"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=472><b>tn</b> Verses 22-23a read in Hebrew, &#8220;I did not speak with your ancestors and I did not command them when I brought them out of Egypt about words/matters concerning burnt offering and sacrifice, but I commanded them this word:&#8221; Some modern commentators have explained this passage as an evidence for the lateness of the Pentateuchal instruction regarding sacrifice or a denial that sacrifice was practiced during the period of the wilderness wandering. However, it is better explained as an example of what R. de Vaux calls a dialectical negative, i.e., &#8220;not so much this as that&#8221; or &#8220;not this without that&#8221; (<i>Ancient Israel</i>, 454-56). For other examples of this same argument see Isa 1:10-17; Hos 6:4-6; Amos 5:21-25.</p>
