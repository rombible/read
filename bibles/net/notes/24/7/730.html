<A NAME="730"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=449><b>sn</b> <i>The place in Shiloh&#8230;see what I did to it</i>. This refers to the destruction of Shiloh by the Philistines circa 1050 <sc>b.c. (cf. Ps 78:60). The destruction of Shiloh is pertinent to the argument. The presence of the tabernacle and ark of the covenant did not prevent Shiloh from being destroyed when Israel sinned. The people of Israel used the ark as a magic charm but it did not prevent them from being defeated or the ark being captured (1 Sam 4:3, 11, 21-22).</p>
