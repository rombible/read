<A NAME="725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=444><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;&#8216;We are safe!&#8217; &#8211; safe, you think, to go on doing all those hateful things.&#8221; Verses 9-10 are all one long sentence in the Hebrew text. It has been broken up for English stylistic reasons. Somewhat literally it reads &#8220;Will you steal&#8230;then come and stand&#8230;and say, &#8216;We are safe&#8217; so as to/in order to do&#8230;&#8221; The Hebrew of v. 9 has a series of infinitives which emphasize the bare action of the verb without the idea of time or agent. The effect is to place a kind of staccato like emphasis on the multitude of their sins all of which are violations of one of the Ten Commandments. The final clause in v. 8 expresses purpose or result (probably result) through another infinitive. This long sentence is introduced by a marker (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;</font> interrogative in Hebrew) introducing a rhetorical question in which God expresses his incredulity that they could do these sins, come into the temple and claim the safety of his protection, and then go right back out and commit the same sins. J. Bright (<i>Jeremiah </i>[AB], 52) catches the force nicely: &#8220;What? You think you can steal, murder&#8230;and then come and stand&#8230;and say, &#8216;We are safe&#8230;&#8217; just so that you can go right on&#8230;&#8221;</p>
