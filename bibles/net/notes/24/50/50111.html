<A NAME="50111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">111</span><note=2793><b>sn</b> Compare Jer 6:22-24 where almost the same exact words as 50:41-43 are applied to the people of Judah. The repetition of prophecies here and in the following verses emphasizes the talionic nature of God&#8217;s punishment of Babylon; as they have done to others, so it will be done to them (cf. 25:14; 50:15).</p>
