<A NAME="508"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2690><b>sn</b> <i>A nation from the north</i> refers to Medo-Persia which at the time of the conquest of Babylon in 539 <sc>b.c. had conquered all the nations to the north, the northwest, and the northeast of Babylon forming a vast empire to the north and east of Babylon. Contingents of these many nations were included in her army and reference is made to them in 50:9 and 51:27-28. There is also some irony involved here because the &#8220;enemy from the north&#8221; referred to so often in Jeremiah (cf. 1:14; 4:6; 6:1) has been identified with Babylon (cf. 25:9). Here in a kind of talionic justice Judah&#8217;s nemesis from the north will be attacked and devastated by an enemy from the north.</p>
