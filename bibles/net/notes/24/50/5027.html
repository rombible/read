<A NAME="5027"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2709><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;People of Babylonia&#8221; are not in the text but they are implicit in the reference in the next verse to &#8220;your mother&#8221; which refers to the city and the land as the mother of its people. These words have been supplied in the translation to identify the referent of &#8220;you&#8221; and have been added for clarity.</p>
