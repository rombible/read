<A NAME="5090"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">90</span><note=2772><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the Chaldeans.&#8221; For explanation of the rendering see the study note on 21:4. There is no verb in this clause. Therefore it is difficult to determine whether this should be understood as a command or as a prediction. The presence of <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive perfects after a similar construction in vv. 36b, d, 37c, 38a and the imperfects after &#8220;therefore&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1461;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">lakhen</font>) all suggest the predictive or future nuance. However, the <i>vav</i> consecutive perfect could be used to carry on the nuance of command (cf. GKC 333 §112.<i>q</i>) but not in the sense of purpose as NRSV, NJPS render them.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;A sword against the Chaldeans.&#8221; The &#8220;sword&#8221; here is metaphorical for destructive forces in the persons of the armies of the north (vv. 3, 9) which the <sc>Lord is marshaling against Babylon and which he has addressed by way of command several times (e.g., vv. 14, 21, 26-27, 29). Compare 46:14 and the study note there.</p>
