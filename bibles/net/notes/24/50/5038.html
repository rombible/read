<A NAME="5038"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2720><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;She has given her hand.&#8221; For the idiom here involving submission/surrender see BDB 680 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1503;</font> Qal.1.z and compare the usage in 1 Chr 29:24; 2 Chr 30:8. For a different interpretation, however, see the rather complete discussion in G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, and T. G. Smothers (<i>Jeremiah 26-52 </i>[WBC],<i> </i>366) who see this as a reference to making a covenant. The verb in this line and the next two lines are all Hebrew perfects and most translators and commentaries see them as past. God&#8217;s Word, however, treats them as prophetic perfects and translates them as future. This is more likely in the light of the imperatives both before and after.</p>
