<A NAME="5058"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=2740><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;You were found [or found out] and captured because you fought against the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The same causal connection is maintained by the order of the translation but it puts more emphasis on the cause and connects it also more closely with the first half of the verse. The first person is used because the <sc>Lord is speaking of himself first in the first person &#8220;I set&#8221; and then in the third. The first person has been maintained throughout. Though it would be awkward, perhaps one could retain the reference to the <sc>Lord by translating, &#8220;I, the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
