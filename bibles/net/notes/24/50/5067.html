<A NAME="5067"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=2749><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Kill all her young bulls.&#8221; Commentators are almost universally agreed that the reference to &#8220;young bulls&#8221; is figurative here for the princes and warriors (cf. BDB 831 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;</font> 2.f, which compares Isa 34:7 and Ezek 39:18). This is virtually certain because of the reference to the time coming for them to be punished; this would scarcely fit literal bulls. For the verb rendered &#8220;kill&#8221; here see the translator&#8217;s note on v. 21.</p>
