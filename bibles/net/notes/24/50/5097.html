<A NAME="5097"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">97</span><note=2779><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;A sword against his horses and his chariots and against all the mixed company [or mixed multitude] in her midst and they will become like women.&#8221; The sentence had to be split up because it is too long and the continuation of the second half with its consequential statement would not fit together with the first half very well. Hence the subject and verb have been repeated. The Hebrew word translated &#8220;foreign troops&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489;</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">erev</font>) is the same word that is used in 25:20 to refer to the foreign peoples living in Egypt and in Exod 12:38 for the foreign people that accompanied Israel out of Egypt. Here the word is translated contextually to refer to foreign mercenaries, an identification that most of the commentaries and many of the modern English versions accept (see, e.g., J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah </i>[AB], 355; NRSV; NIV). The significance of the simile &#8220;they will become like women&#8221; has been spelled out for the sake of clarity.</p>
