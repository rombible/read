Many interpret the particle as introducing the grounds for the next verse, i.e., &#8220;because&#8230;&#8221; The translation here will reflect the concessive by beginning the next verse with &#8220;But.&#8221; The long protasis has been broken up and restructured to better conform with contemporary English style.</p>
