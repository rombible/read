<A NAME="5089"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">89</span><note=2771><b>tn</b> This translation again reflects the problem often encountered in these prophecies where the <sc>Lord appears to be speaking but refers to himself in the third person. It would be possible to translate here using the first person as CEV and NIrV do. However, to sustain that over the whole verse results in a considerably greater degree of paraphrase. The verse could be rendered &#8220;But I am strong and I will rescue them. I am the <sc>Lord who rules over all. I will champion their cause. And I will bring peace and rest to&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
