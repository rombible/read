<A NAME="50110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">110</span><note=2792><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The king of Babylon hears report of them and his hands hang limp.&#8221; The verbs are translated as future because the passage is prophetic and the verbs may be interpreted as prophetic perfects (the action viewed as if it were as good as done). In the parallel passage in 6:24 the verbs could be understood as present perfects because the passage could be viewed as in the present. Here it is future.</p>
