<A NAME="5057"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=2739><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;How broken and shattered is the hammer of all the earth!&#8221; The &#8220;hammer&#8221; is a metaphor for Babylon who was God&#8217;s war club to shatter the nations and destroy kingdoms just like Assyria is represented in Isa 10:5 as a rod and a war club. Some readers, however, might not pick up on the metaphor or identify the referent, so the translation has incorporated an identification of the metaphor and the referent within it. &#8220;See how&#8221; and &#8220;See what&#8221; are an attempt to capture the nuance of the Hebrew particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ekh</font>) which here expresses an exclamation of satisfaction in a taunt song (cf. BDB 32 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1498;&#1456;</font> 2 and compare usage in Isa 14:4, 12; Jer 50:23).</p>
