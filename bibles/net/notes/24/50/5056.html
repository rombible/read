<A NAME="5056"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=2738><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;of Babylonia&#8221; are not in the text but are implicit from the context. They have been supplied in the translation to clarify the referent.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The verbs in vv. 22-25 are all descriptive of the present, but all of this is really to take place in the future. Hebrew poetry has a way of rendering future actions as though they were already accomplished. The poetry of this section makes it difficult, however, to render the verbs as future, as has been done regularly in the present translation.</p>
