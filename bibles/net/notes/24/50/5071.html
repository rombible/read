<A NAME="5071"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=2753><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Hark! Fugitives and refugees from the land of Babylon to declare in Zion the vengeance of the <sc>Lord our God, vengeance for his temple.&#8221; For the meaning &#8220;Hark!&#8221; for the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qol</font>) see BDB 877 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;</font> 1.f and compare the usage in Jer 10:22. The syntax is elliptical because there is no main verb. The present translation has supplied the verb &#8220;come&#8221; as many other English versions have done. The translation also expands the genitival expression &#8220;vengeance for his temple&#8221; to explain what all the commentaries agree is involved.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This verse appears to be a parenthetical exclamation of the prophet in the midst of his report of what the <sc>Lord said through him. He throws himself into the future and sees the fall of Babylon and hears the people reporting in Zion how God has destroyed Babylon to get revenge for the Babylonians destroying his temple. Jeremiah prophesied from 627 <sc>b.c. (see the study note on 1:2) until sometime after 586 <sc>b.c. after Jerusalem fell and he was taken to Egypt. The fall of Babylon occurred in 538 <sc>b.c. some fifty years later. However, Jeremiah had prophesied as early as the first year of Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s reign (605 <sc>b.c.; Jer 25:1) that many nations and great kings would come and subject Babylon, the instrument of God&#8217;s wrath &#8211; his sword against the nations &#8211; to bondage (Jer 25:12-14).</p>
