<A NAME="5054"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=2736><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Smite down and completely destroy after them.&#8221; The word translated &#8220;kill&#8221; or &#8220;smite down&#8221; is a word of uncertain meaning and derivation. BDB 352 s.v. III <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;</font> relates it to an Aramaic word meaning &#8220;attack, smite down.&#8221; KBL 329-30 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;</font> sees it as a denominative from the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kherev</font>, &#8220;sword&#8221;), a derivation which many modern commentaries accept and reflect in a translation &#8220;put to the sword.&#8221; KBL, however, gives &#8220;to smite down; to slaughter&#8221; which is roughly the equivalent of the meaning assigned to it in BDB. The word only occurs here and in v. 27 in the Qal and in 2 Kgs 3:23 in the Niphal where it means something like &#8220;attacked one another, fought with one another.&#8221; Many commentators question the validity of the word &#8220;after them&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1501;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">akharehem</font>) which occurs at the end of the line after &#8220;completely destroy.&#8221; The Targum reads &#8220;the last of them&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">akharitam</font>) which is graphically very close and accepted by some commentators. The present translation has chosen to represent &#8220;after them&#8221; by a paraphrase at the beginning &#8220;pursue them.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> For the concept underlying the words translated here &#8220;completely destroy&#8221; see the study note on Jer 25:9.</p>
