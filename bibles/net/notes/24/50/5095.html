<A NAME="5095"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">95</span><note=2777><b>tn</b> Hebrew has &#8220;his&#8221; in both cases here whereas the rest of the possessive pronouns throughout vv. 35-37 are &#8220;her.&#8221; There is no explanation for this switch unless the third masculine singular refers as a distributive singular to the soldiers mentioned in the preceding verse (cf. GKC 464 §145.<i>l</i>). This is probably the case here, but to refer to &#8220;their horses and their chariots&#8221; in the midst of all the &#8220;her&#8230;&#8221; might create more confusion than what it is worth to be that pedantic.</p>
