<A NAME="5053"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=2735><b>sn</b> <i>Merathaim&#8230;Pekod</i>. It is generally agreed that the names of these two regions were chosen for their potential for wordplay. Merathaim probably refers to a region in southern Babylon near where the Tigris and Euphrates come together before they empty into the Persian Gulf. It was known for its briny waters. In Hebrew the word would mean &#8220;double rebellion&#8221; and would stand as an epithet for the land of Babylon as a whole. Pekod refers to an Aramean people who lived on the eastern bank of the lower Tigris River. They are mentioned often in Assyrian texts and are mentioned in Ezek 23:23 as allies of Babylon. In Hebrew the word would mean &#8220;punishment.&#8221; As an epithet for the land of Babylon it would refer to the fact that Babylon was to be punished for her double rebellion against the <sc>Lord.</p>
