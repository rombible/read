<A NAME="5098"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">98</span><note=2780><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a drought against her waters and they will dry up.&#8221; Several of the commentaries and modern English versions accept the emendation proposed by <i>BHS</i> and read here &#8220;sword&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489;</font> [<font face="Scholar">kherev</font>] in place of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489;</font> [<font face="Scholar">khorev</font>], the change of only one vowel) in keeping with the rest of the context. According to <i>BHS</i> this reading is supported by the Lucianic and Hexaplaric recensions of the LXX (the Greek version) and the Syriac version. In this case the drying up of the waters (of the canals) is attributed to neglect brought about by war conditions. However, it is just as likely that these versions are influenced by the repetition of the word &#8220;sword&#8221; as the Hebrew and the other versions are influenced by the concept of &#8220;drying up&#8221; of the waters to read &#8220;drought.&#8221; Hence the present translation, along with the majority of modern English versions, retains the Hebrew &#8220;drought.&#8221;</p>
