<A NAME="50102"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">102</span><note=2784><b>tn</b> The identification of this bird has been called into question by G. R. Driver, &#8220;Birds in the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>PEQ </i>87 (1955): 137-38. He refers to this bird as an owl. That identification, however, is not reflected in any of the lexicons including the most recent, which still gives &#8220;ostrich&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 402 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font>) as does W. S. McCullough, &#8220;Ostrich,&#8221; <i>IDB</i> 3:611. REB, NIV, NCV, and God&#8217;s Word all identify this bird as &#8220;owl/desert owl.&#8221;</p>
