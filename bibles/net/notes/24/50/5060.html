<A NAME="5060"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=2742><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The <sc>Lord has opened up his armory and has brought out the weapons of his wrath.&#8221; The problem of the <sc>Lord referring to himself in the third person (or of the prophet speaking on his behalf) is again raised here and is again resolved by using the first person throughout. The construction &#8220;weapons of my wrath&#8221; would not convey any meaning to many readers so the significance has been spelled out in the translation.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The <i>weapons</i> are the nations which God is bringing from the north against them. Reference has already been made in the study notes that Assyria is the &#8220;rod&#8221; or &#8220;war club&#8221; by which God vents his anger against Israel (Isa 10:5-6) and Babylon a hammer or war club with which he shatters the nations (Jer 50:23; 51:20). Now God will use other nations as weapons to execute his wrath against Babylon. For a similar idea see Isa 13:2-5 where reference is made to marshaling the nations against Babylon. Some of the nations that the <sc>Lord will marshal against Babylon are named in Jer 51:27-28.</p>
