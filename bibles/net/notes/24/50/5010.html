<A NAME="5010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2692><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the children of Israel will come, they and the children of Judah together. They shall go, weeping as they go, and they will seek the <sc>Lord their God.&#8221; The concept of &#8220;seeking&#8221; the <sc>Lord often has to do with seeking the <sc>Lord in worship (by sacrifice [Hos 5:6; 2 Chr 11:16]; prayer [Zech 8:21, 22; 2 Sam 12:16; Isa 65:1; 2 Chr 15:4]). In Hos 7:10 it is in parallel with returning to the <sc>Lord. In Ps 69:6 it is in parallel with hoping in or trusting in the <sc>Lord. Perhaps the most helpful parallels here, however, are Hos 3:5 (in comparison with Jer 30:9) and 2 Chr 15:15 where it is in the context of a covenant commitment to be loyal to the <sc>Lord which is similar to the context here (see the next verse). The translation is admittedly paraphrastic but &#8220;seeking the <sc>Lord&#8221; does not mean here looking for God as though he were merely a person to be found.</p>
