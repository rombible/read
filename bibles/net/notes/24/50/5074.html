<A NAME="5074"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=2756><b>sn</b> The <i>Holy One of Israel</i> is a common title for the <sc>Lord in the book of Isaiah. It is applied to the <sc>Lord only here and in 51:5 in the book of Jeremiah. It is a figure where an attribute of a person is put as a title of a person (compare &#8220;your majesty&#8221; for a king). It pictures the Lord as the sovereign king who rules over his covenant people and exercises moral authority over them.</p>
