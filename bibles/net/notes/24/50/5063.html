<A NAME="5063"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=2745><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Come against her from the end.&#8221; There is a great deal of debate about the meaning of &#8220;from the end&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1461;&#1509;</font>, <font face="Scholar">miqqets</font>). Some follow the suggestion of F. Giesebrecht in BDB 892 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1510;&#1462;&#1492;</font> 3 and emend the text to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1464;&#1510;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">miqqatseh</font>) on the basis of the presumed parallel in Jer 51:31 which is interpreted as &#8220;on all sides,&#8221; i.e., &#8220;from every quarter/side.&#8221; However, the phrase does not mean that in Jer 51:31 but is used as it is elsewhere of &#8220;from one end to another,&#8221; i.e., in its entirety (so Gen 19:4). The only real parallel here is the use of the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1461;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qets</font>) with a suffix in Isa 37:24 referring to the remotest part, hence something like from the end (of the earth), i.e., from a far away place. The referent &#8220;her&#8221; has been clarified here to refer to Babylonia in case someone might not see the connection between v. 25d and v. 26.</p>
