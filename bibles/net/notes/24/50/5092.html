<A NAME="5092"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">92</span><note=2774><b>tn</b> The meaning and the derivation of the word translated &#8220;false prophets&#8221; is uncertain. The same word appears in conjunction with the word for &#8220;diviners&#8221; in Isa 44:25 and probably also in Hos 11:6 in conjunction with the sword consuming them &#8220;because of their counsel.&#8221; BDB 95 s.v. III <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1491;</font> b sees this as a substitution of &#8220;empty talk&#8221; for &#8220;empty talkers&#8221; (the figure of metonymy) and refer to them as false prophets. KBL 108 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1491;</font> emends the form in both places to read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">barim</font>) in place of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">baddim</font>) and defines the word on the basis of Akkadian to mean &#8220;soothsayer&#8221; (KBL 146 s.v. V <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;</font>). <i>HALOT</i> 105 s.v. V <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1491;</font> retains the pointing, derives it from an Amorite word found in the Mari letters, and defines it as &#8220;oracle priest.&#8221; However, G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, and T. G. Smothers (<i>Jeremiah 26-52 </i>[WBC],<i> </i>368) call this identification into question because the word only occurs in one letter from Mari and its meaning is uncertain there. It is hazardous to emend the text in two places, perhaps even three, in light of no textual evidence in any of the passages and to define the word on the basis of an uncertain parallel. Hence the present translation opts here for the derivation and extended definition given in BDB.</p>
