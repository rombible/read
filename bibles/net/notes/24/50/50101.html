<A NAME="50101"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">101</span><note=2783><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;by the terrors.&#8221; However, as <i>HALOT</i> 40 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> indicates these are &#8220;images that cause terror&#8221; (a substitution of the effect for the cause). The translation of this line follows the interpretation of the majority of modern English versions and all the commentaries consulted. NIV, NCV, and God&#8217;s Word reflect a different syntax, understanding the subject to be the idols just mentioned rather than &#8220;her people&#8221; which is supplied here for the sake of clarity (the Hebrew text merely says &#8220;they.&#8221;) Following that lead, one could render &#8220;but those idols will go mad with terror.&#8221; This makes excellent sense in the context which often refers to effects (vv. 36b, d, 37c, 38b) of the war that is coming. However, that interpretation does not fit as well with the following &#8220;therefore/so,&#8221; which basically introduces a judgment or consequence after an accusation of sin.</p>
