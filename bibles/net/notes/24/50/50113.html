For the translation notes explaining the details of the translation here see the translator&#8217;s notes on 49:19-21.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This passage is virtually identical with Jer 49:19-21 with the replacement of Babylon, land of Babylonia for Edom. As God used Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians to destroy Edom, so he would use Cyrus and the Medes and Persians and their allies to destroy Babylon (cf. 25:13, 14). As Nebuchadnezzar was God&#8217;s servant to whom all would be subject (25:9; 27:6), so Cyrus is called in Isaiah &#8220;his anointed one,&#8221; i.e., his chosen king whom he will use to shatter other nations and set Israel free (Isa 45:1-4).</p>
