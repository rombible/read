<A NAME="281"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1614><b>tc</b> The original text is unusually full here and deemed by many scholars to be corrupt: <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And it happened in that year in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month Hananiah&#8230;said to&#8230;&#8221; Many scholars see a contradiction between &#8220;in the fourth year&#8221; and &#8220;in the beginning of the reign.&#8221; These scholars point to the fact that the Greek version does not have &#8220;in that year&#8221; and &#8220;in the beginning of the reign of&#8221;; it merely reads &#8220;in the fourth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fifth month.&#8221; These scholars generally also regard the heading at 27:1 to be unoriginal and interpret the heading in the MT here as a faulty harmonization of the original (that in the Greek version) with the erroneous one in the Hebrew of 27:1. However, it is just as possible that the Greek version in both places is an attempt to harmonize the data of 27:1 and 28:1. I.e., it left out both the heading at 27:1, and &#8220;in that year&#8221; and &#8220;at the beginning of the reign of&#8221; in the heading here because it thought the data was contradictory. However, it is just as likely that there is really no contradiction here. I.e., the term &#8220;beginning of the reign&#8221; can include the fourth year. E. H. Merrill has argued that the term here refers not to the accession year (see the translator&#8217;s note on 26:1) but to the early years in general (&#8220;The &#8216;Accession Year&#8217; and Davidic Chronology,&#8221; JANESCU 19 [1989]: 105-6, and cf. note 18 for bibliography on Akkadian parallels). Hence the phrase has been translated both here and in 27:1 &#8220;early in the reign of&#8230;&#8221; For other attempts at harmonization see the discussion in G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, T. G. Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52 </i>(WBC),<i> </i>41, n. 1a.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The dating here is very full and precise. &#8220;In that same year&#8221; ties the events here in with the messages that Jeremiah delivered to the envoys, the king and his court, and the priests and people while wearing the yoke symbolizing servitude to Nebuchadnezzar. The text wants to show that the events here transpired shortly after those in Jer 27 and that Jeremiah is still wearing the yoke. The supplying of the precise month is important because the end of the chapter will show that Jeremiah&#8217;s prophecy regarding Hananiah was fulfilled two months later. Hence Jeremiah is the true prophet and Hananiah and the others (27:16) are false. The supplying of the year is perhaps significant because the author states in 51:59 that Zedekiah went to Babylon that same year, probably to pledge his loyalty. The suggestion lies ready to hand that the events of this chapter and the preceding one lead to his dismissal of the false prophet Hananiah&#8217;s advice and the acceptance of Jeremiah&#8217;s.</p>
