<A NAME="2815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1628><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the yoke bars of wood you have broken, but you have made in its stead yoke bars of iron.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This whole incident (and the preceding one in Jer 28) is symbolic. Jeremiah&#8217;s wearing of the yoke was symbolic of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s message to submit to Babylonian authority. Hananiah&#8217;s breaking of the yoke was a prediction that that authority would not last beyond two years. By breaking the yoke he was encouraging rebellion against Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s (and hence the <sc>Lord&#8217;s) authority (cf. 27:9, 14). However, rebelling would only result in further, harsher, more irresistible measures by Nebuchadnezzar to control such rebellion.</p>
