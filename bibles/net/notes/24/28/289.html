<A NAME="289"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1622><b>tc</b> Many Hebrew <sc>mss read &#8220;starvation/famine&#8221; which is the second member of a common triad &#8220;sword, famine, and plague&#8221; in Jeremiah. This triad occurs thirteen times in the book and undoubtedly influenced a later scribe to read &#8220;starvation [= famine]&#8221; here. For this triad see the note on 14:14. The words &#8220;disaster and plagues&#8221; are missing in the LXX.</p>
