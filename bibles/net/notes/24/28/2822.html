<A NAME="2822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1635><b>sn</b> Comparison with Jer 28:1 shows that this whole incident took place in the space of two months. Hananiah had prophesied that the captivity would be over before two years had past. However, before two months were past, Hananiah himself died in fulfillment of Jeremiah&#8217;s prophecy of his death. His death was a validation of Jeremiah as a true prophet. The subsequent events of 588 <sc>b.c. would validate Jeremiah&#8217;s prophesies and invalidate those of Hananiah.</p>
