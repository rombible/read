<A NAME="285"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1618><b>sn</b> See the study note on 27:2 for this figure. Hananiah is given the same title &#8220;the prophet&#8221; as Jeremiah throughout the chapter and claims to speak with the same authority (compare v. 2a with 27:21a). He even speaks like the true prophet; the verb form &#8220;I will break&#8221; is in the &#8220;prophetic perfect&#8221; emphasizing certitude. His message here is a contradiction of Jeremiah&#8217;s message recorded in the preceding chapter (compare especially v. 3 with 27:16, 19-22 and v. 4 with 22:24-28). The people and the priests are thus confronted with a choice of whom to believe. Who is the &#8220;true&#8221; prophet and who is the &#8220;false&#8221; one? Only fulfillment of their prophecies will prove which is which (see Deut 18:21-22).</p>
