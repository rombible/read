Both verses begin with a <i>casus pendens</i> construction to throw the two verses into contrast: <i>Heb</i> &#8220;<i>The prophets</i> who were before me and you from ancient times, <i>they</i> prophesied&#8230;<i>The prophet</i> who prophesied peace, when the word of <i>that prophet</i> came true, <i>that prophet</i> was known that the <sc>Lord truly sent <i>him</i>.&#8221;</p>
