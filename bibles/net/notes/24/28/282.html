<A NAME="282"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1615><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to me.&#8221; The rest of the chapter is all in third person narrative (see vv. 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 15). Hence, many explain the first person here as a misunderstanding of the abbreviation &#8220;to Jeremiah&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500; &#1497;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el yirmiyyah</font>] = <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1463;&#1497;</font>, [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elay</font>]). It is just as likely that there is a similar kind of disjunction here that was found in 27:1-2 only in the opposite direction. There what started out as a third person report was really a first person report. Here what starts out as a first person report is really a third person report. The text betrays both the hands of the narrator, probably Baruch, and the reportee, Jeremiah, who dictated a synopsis of his messages and his stories to Baruch to write down (Jer 36:4, 32).</p>
