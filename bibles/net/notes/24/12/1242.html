<A NAME="1242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=794><b>tn</b> The pronouns here are actually second plural: <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Be ashamed/disconcerted because of your harvests.&#8221; Because the verb form (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;</font>, <font face="Scholar">uvoshu</font>) can either be Qal perfect third plural or Qal imperative masculine plural many emend the pronoun on the noun to third plural (see, e.g., <i>BHS</i>). However, this is the easier reading and is not supported by either the Latin or the Greek which have second plural. This is probably another case of the shift from description to direct address that has been met with several times already in Jeremiah (the figure of speech called apostrophe; for other examples see, e.g., 9:4; 11:13). As in other cases the translation has been leveled to third plural to avoid confusion for the contemporary English reader. For the meaning of the verb here see BDB 101 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;</font> Qal.2 and compare the usage in Jer 48:13.</p>
