<A NAME="1255"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=807><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they will be built up among my people.&#8221; The expression &#8220;be built up among&#8221; is without parallel. However, what is involved here is conceptually parallel to the ideas expressed in Isa 19:23-25 and Zech 14:16-19. That is, these people will be allowed to live on their own land, to worship the <sc>Lord there, and to come to Jerusalem to celebrate the feasts. To translate literally would be meaningless or misleading for many readers.</p>
