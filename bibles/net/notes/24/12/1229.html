<A NAME="1229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=781><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;like speckled birds of prey.&#8221; The meanings of these words are uncertain. In the Hebrew text sentence is a question: &#8220;Is not my inheritance to me a bird of prey [or] a hyena/a speckled bird of prey?&#8221; The question expects a positive answer and so is rendered here as an affirmative statement. The meaning of the word &#8220;speckled&#8221; is debated. It occurs only here. BDB 840 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1463;</font> relates it to another word that occurs only once in Judg 5:30 which is translated &#8220;dyed stuff.&#8221; <i>HALOT</i> 936 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1463;</font> relates a word found in the cognates meaning &#8220;hyena.&#8221; This is more likely and is the interpretation followed by the Greek which reads the first two words as &#8220;cave of hyena.&#8221; This translation has led some scholars to posit a homonym for the word &#8220;bird of prey&#8221; meaning &#8220;cave&#8221; which is based on Arabic parallels. The metaphor would then be of Israel carried off by hyenas and surrounded by birds of prey. The evidence for the meaning &#8220;cave&#8221; is weak and would involve a wordplay of a rare homonym with another word that is better known. For a discussion of the issues see J. Barr, <i>Comparative Philology and the Text of the Old Testament</i>, 128-29, 153.</p>
