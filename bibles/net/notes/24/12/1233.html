To translate as &#8220;vineyards&#8221; as some do would be misleading because that would miss the figurative nuance altogether.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The figure of Israel as God&#8217;s vine and the land as God&#8217;s vineyard is found several times in the Bible. The best known of these is the extended metaphor in Isa 5:1-7. This figure also appears in Jer 2:20. </p>
