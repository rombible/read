<A NAME="1230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=782><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Are birds of prey around her?&#8221; The question is again rhetorical and expects a positive answer. The birds of prey are of course the hostile nations surrounding her. The metaphor involved in these two lines may be interpreted differently. I.e., God considers Israel a proud bird of prey (hence the word for speckled) but one who is surrounded and under attack by other birds of prey. The fact that the sentences are divided into two rhetorical questions speaks somewhat against this.</p>
