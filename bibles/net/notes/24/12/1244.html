<A NAME="1244"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=796><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Thus says the <sc>Lord concerning&#8230;.&#8221; This structure has been adopted to prevent a long dangling introduction to what the <sc>Lord has to say that does not begin until the middle of the verse in Hebrew. The first person address was adopted because the speaker is still the <sc>Lord as in vv. 7-13.</p>
