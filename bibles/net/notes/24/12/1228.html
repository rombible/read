<A NAME="1228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=780><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;so I will reject her.&#8221; The word &#8220;hate&#8221; is sometimes used in a figurative way to refer to being neglected, i.e., treated as though unloved. In these contexts it does not have the same emotive connotations that a typical modern reader would associate with hate. See Gen 29:31, 33 and E. W. Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, 556.</p>
