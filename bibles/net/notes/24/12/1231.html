<A NAME="1231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=783><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Go, gather all the beasts of the field [= wild beasts]. Bring them to devour.&#8221; The verbs are masculine plural imperatives addressed rhetorically to some unidentified group (the heavenly counsel?) Cf. the notes on 5:1 for further discussion. Since translating literally would raise question about who the commands are addressed to, they have been turned into passive third person commands to avoid confusion. The metaphor has likewise been turned into a simile to help the modern reader. By the way, the imperatives here implying future action argue that the passage is future and that it is correct to take the verb forms as prophetic perfects.</p>
