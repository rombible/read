The Masoretic is supported by the Latin and is retained here on the basis of external evidence. Either text makes good sense in the context. Some identify the &#8220;he&#8221; with Jeremiah and understand the text to be saying that the conspirators are certain that they will succeed and he will not live to see his prophecies fulfilled.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The words here may be an outright rejection of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s words in Deut 32:20, which is part of a song that was to be taught to Israel in the light of their predicted rejection of the <sc>Lord.</p>
