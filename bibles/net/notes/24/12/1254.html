<A NAME="1254"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=806><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;If they do this&#8221; are not in the text. They are part of an attempt to break up a Hebrew sentence which is long and complex into equivalent shorter sentences consistent with contemporary English style. Verse 16 in Hebrew is all one sentence with a long complex conditional clause followed by a short consequence: &#8220;If they carefully learn the ways of my people to swear by name, &#8216;By the life of the <sc>Lord,&#8217; as they taught my people to swear by Baal, then they will be built up in the midst of my people.&#8221; The translation strives to create the same contingencies and modifications by breaking up the sentence into shorter sentences in accord with contemporary English style.</p>
