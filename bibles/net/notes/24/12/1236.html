<A NAME="1236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=788><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;But there is no man laying it to heart.&#8221; For the idiom here see BDB 525 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1461;&#1489;</font> II.3.d and compare the usage in Isa 42:25; 47:7.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> There is a very interesting play on words and sounds in this verse that paints a picture of desolation and the pathos it evokes. Part of this is reflected in the translation. The same Hebrew word referring to a desolation or a waste (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1461;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shÿmemah</font>) is repeated three times at the end of three successive lines and the related verb is found at the beginning of the fourth (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nashammah</font>). A similar sounding word is found in the second of the three successive lines (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;&#1468;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shamah</font> = &#8220;he [they] will make it&#8221;). This latter word is part of a further play because it is repeated in a different form in the last line (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">sham</font> = &#8220;laying&#8221;); they lay it waste but no one lays it to heart. There is also an interesting contrast between the sorrow the <sc>Lord feels and the inattention of the people.</p>
