<A NAME="481"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2521><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Yahweh of armies, the God of Israel.&#8221; For this title see 7:3 and the study note on 2:19.</p>
<A NAME="482"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2522><b>sn</b> <i>Moab</i> was a country east of the Dead Sea whose boundaries varied greatly over time. Basically, it was the tableland between the Arnon River about halfway up the Dead Sea and the Zered River which is roughly at the southern tip of the Dead Sea. When the Israelites entered Palestine they were forbidden to take any of the Moabite territory but they did capture the kingdom of Sihon north of the Arnon which Sihon had taken from Moab. Several of the towns mentioned in the oracles of judgment against Moab here are in this territory north of the Arnon and were assigned to Reuben and Gad. Several are mentioned on the famous Moabite Stone which details how Mesha king of Moab recovered from Israel many of these cities during the reign of Joram (852-841 <sc>b.c.; cf. 2 Kgs 3:4-5). It is usually assumed that Moab submitted to Nebuchadnezzar after the battle of Carchemish and that they remained loyal to him throughout most of this period, though representatives were present at Jerusalem in 594 <sc>b.c. when plans for revolt were apparently being discussed (Jer 27:3). Moabite contingents were used by Nebuchadnezzar in 598 <sc>b.c. to harass Jehoiakim after he rebelled (2 Kgs 24:2) so they must have remained loyal at that time. According to the Jewish historian Josephus, Nebuchadnezzar conquered Moab in 582 <sc>b.c. and destroyed many of its cities. </p>
<A NAME="483"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2523><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Woe to Nebo for it is destroyed.&#8221; For the use of the Hebrew particle &#8220;Woe&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hoy</font>) see the translator&#8217;s note on 22:13. The translation has taken this form because the phrase &#8220;Woe to&#8221; probably does not convey the proper meaning or significance to the modern reader. The verbs again are in the tense (Hebrew prophetic perfect) that views the action as if it were as good as done. The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) probably is causal but the asseverative works better in the modified translation.</p>
<A NAME="484"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2524><b>sn</b> <i>Nebo</i> and <i>Kiriathaim</i> were both north of the Arnon and were assigned to Reuben (Num 32:3, Josh 13:19). They are both mentioned on the Moabite Stone as having been recovered from Israel.</p>
<A NAME="485"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2525><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Misgab.&#8221; The translation here follows the majority of commentaries and English versions. Only REB sees this as a place name, &#8220;Misgab,&#8221; which is otherwise unknown. The constant use of this word to refer to a fortress, the presence of the article on the front of it, and the lack of any reference to a place of this name anywhere else argues against it being a place name. However, the fact that the verbs that accompany it are feminine while the noun for &#8220;fortress&#8221; is masculine causes some pause.</p>
<A NAME="486"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2526><b>tn</b> For the meaning of the verb here see BDB 369 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1514;</font> Qal.1 and compare usage in Isa 7:8; 30:31.</p>
<A NAME="487"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2527><b>sn</b> <i>Heshbon</i> was originally a Moabite city but was captured by Sihon king of Og and made his capital (Num 21:26-30). It was captured from Sihon and originally assigned to the tribe of Reuben (Num 32:37; Josh 13:17). Later it was made a Levitical city and was assigned to the tribe of Gad (Josh 21:39). It formed the northern limits of Moab. It was located about eighteen miles east of the northern tip of the Dead Sea.</p>
<A NAME="488"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2528><b>sn</b> There is a wordplay in Hebrew on the word &#8220;Heshbon&#8221; and the word &#8220;plot&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khoshvu</font>).</p>
<A NAME="489"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2529><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;In Heshbon they plot evil against her [i.e., Moab].&#8221; The &#8220;they&#8221; is undefined, but it would scarcely be Moabites living in Heshbon. Hence TEV and CEV are probably correct in seeing a reference to the enemy which would imply the conquest of this city which lay on the northern border of Moab.</p>
<A NAME="4810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2530><b>tn</b> The meaning of this line is somewhat uncertain. The translation here follows all the modern English versions and commentaries in reading the place name &#8220;Madmen&#8221; even though the place is otherwise unknown and the Greek, Syriac, and Latin version all read this word as an emphasizing infinitive absolute of the following verb &#8220;will be destroyed,&#8221; i.e. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501; &#1497;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1465;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">damom yiddommu</font>). Some see this word as a variant of the name Dimon in Isa 15:9 which in turn is a playful variant of the place name Dibon. There is once again a wordplay on the word &#8220;Madmen&#8221; and &#8220;will be destroyed&#8221;: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1502;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<i>madmen</i>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1465;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<i>yiddommu</i>). For the meaning of the verb = &#8220;perish&#8221; or &#8220;be destroyed&#8221; see Jer 8:14; Ps 31:18.</p>
<A NAME="4811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2531><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;A sword will follow after you.&#8221; The sword is again figurative of destructive forces, here the army of the Babylonians.</p>
<A NAME="4812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2532><b>tc</b> The reading here follows the <i>Qere</i> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1456;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1462;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ireha</font>) which is the same noun found in Jer 14:3 in the sense of &#8220;servants.&#8221; Here it refers to the young ones, i.e., the children (cf. the use of the adjective BDB 859 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font> 2 and see Gen 43:33). Many of the modern commentaries and a few of the modern English versions follow the Greek version and read &#8220;their cry is heard as far as Zoar&#8221; (reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1465;&#1506;&#1458;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tso</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arah</font>; see, for example, J. A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah </i>[NICOT], 699, n. 4, and BDB 858 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1465;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</font>). However, that leaves the verb with an indefinite subject (the verb is active 3rd plural not passive) not otherwise identified in the preceding context. Many of the modern English versions such as NRSV, NJPS, NIV retain the Hebrew as the present translation has done. In this case the masculine plural noun furnishes a logical subject for the verb.</p>
<A NAME="4813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2533><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Indeed her fugitives will&#8230;&#8221; It is unclear what the subject of the verbs are in this verse. The verb in the first two lines &#8220;climb&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1462;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aleh</font>) is third masculine singular and the verb in the second two lines &#8220;will hear&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1461;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shame</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">u</font>) is third common plural. The causal particles at the beginning of the two halves of the verse suggest some connection with the preceding, so the translation assumes that the children are still the subject. In this case the singular verb would be a case of the distributive singular already referred to in the translator&#8217;s note on 46:15. The parallel passage in Isa 15:5 refers to the &#8220;fugitives&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1462;&#1492;&#1464;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bÿrikheha</font>) with the same singular verb as here and that may be the implied subject here.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The location of <i>Luhith</i> and <i>Horonaim</i> are uncertain, though, from their connection with Zoar in Isa 15:5, they appear to be located in southern Moab. Zoar was at the southern tip of the Dead Sea.</p>
<A NAME="4814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2534><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the distresses of the cry of destruction.&#8221; Many commentaries want to leave out the word &#8220;distresses&#8221; because it is missing from the Greek version and the parallel passage in Isa 15:5. However, it is in all the Hebrew <sc>mss and in the other early versions, and it is hard to see why it would be added here if it were not original.</p>
<A NAME="4815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2535><b>tc</b> The meaning of this line is uncertain. The translation follows one reading of the Hebrew text. The Greek version reads &#8220;Be like a wild donkey in the desert!&#8221; There are three points of debate in this line: the syntax of the verb form &#8220;be&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1497;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tihyenah</font>) and the text and meaning of the word translated &#8220;shrub&#8221; in the Hebrew text. This word only occurs with this meaning here and in Jer 17:6. A related word occurs in Ps 102:17 (102:18 HT). Elsewhere this spelling refers to the place name Aroer which was a place in Moab on the edge of the Arnon River. Most commentators do not feel that a reference to that place is appropriate here because it was not in the desert. The Greek version reads &#8220;like a wild donkey&#8221; (reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</font> [<font face="Scholar">kÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arod</font>] in place of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1506;&#1461;&#1512;</font> [<font face="Scholar">ka</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aro</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">er</font>]). That would make an appropriate simile here because the wild donkey enjoys its freedom and is hard to capture. G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, and T. G. Smothers (<i>Jeremiah 26-52 </i>[WBC],<i> </i>312) explain the simile of the &#8220;shrub&#8221; as referring to the marginal and rudimentary existence of a displaced person. That may not be as optimistic as the reference to the wild donkey but it does give an appropriate meaning. The third feminine plural has been explained as the singular noun + suffix = &#8220;yourselves&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1462;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nafshÿkhem</font>) used as a collective (so S. R. Driver, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 368, with cross reference to GKC 462-63 §145.<i>c</i>). J. Bright (<i>Jeremiah </i>[AB], 314, n. e-e) follows a suggestion of D. N. Freedman in seeing the form (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1497;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tihyenah</font>) as a mistake for the 2nd masculine plural plus energic (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tihyun</font>). Given the number of other textual corruptions in this passage, this is possible. The resultant meaning in either case is the same.</p>
<A NAME="4816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2536><b>sn</b> <i>Chemosh</i> was the national god of Moab (see also Numb 21:29). Child sacrifice appears to have been a part of his worship (2 Kgs 3:27). Solomon built a high place in Jerusalem for him (1 Kgs 11:7), and he appears to have been worshiped in Israel until Josiah tore that high place down (2 Kgs 23:13).</p>
<A NAME="4817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2537><b>sn</b> The practice of carrying off the gods of captive nations has already been mentioned in the study note on 43:12. See also Isa 46:1-2 noted there.</p>
<A NAME="4818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2538><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The valley will be destroyed and the tableland be laid waste.&#8221; However, in the context this surely refers to the towns and not to the valley and the tableland itself.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Most commentaries see a reference to the towns in the Jordan valley referred to in Josh 13:27 and the towns mentioned in Josh 13:15-17 which were on the high tableland or high plateau or plain north of the Arnon. The mention of the towns in the first half of the verse is broader than that because it would include all the towns in the southern half of Moab between the Arnon and Zered as well as those mentioned in the second half in conjunction with the valley and the high plateau north of the Arnon.</p>
<A NAME="4819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2539><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;which/for/as the <sc>Lord has spoken.&#8221; The first person form has again been adopted because the <sc>Lord is the speaker throughout (cf. v. 1).</p>
<A NAME="4820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2540><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Scatter salt over Moab for it will certainly be laid in ruins.&#8221; The meaning of these two lines is very uncertain. The Hebrew of these two lines presents several difficulties. It reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1509; &#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1489; &#1504;&#1464;&#1510;&#1465;&#1488; &#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1510;&#1461;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tÿnu-tsits lÿmo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">av natso</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> tetse</font>&#8217;). Of the five words two are extremely problematic and the meaning of the second affects also the meaning of the last word which normally means &#8220;go out.&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsits</font>) regularly refers to a blossom or flower or the diadem on the front of Aaron&#8217;s mitre. BDB 851 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1509;</font> gives a nuance &#8220;wings (coll)&#8221; based on the interpretation of Abu Walid and some medieval Jewish interpreters who related it to an Aramaic root. But BDB says that meaning is dubious and refers to the Greek which reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#951;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">shmeia</font>, &#8220;sign&#8221; or &#8220;sign post&#8221;). Along with KBL 802 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1509;</font> and <i>HALOT</i> 959 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1509;</font>, BDB suggests that the Greek presupposes the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsiyyun</font>) which refers to a road marker (Jer 31:21) or a gravestone (2 Kgs 23:17). That is the meaning followed here. Several modern commentaries and English versions have followed a proposal by W. Moran that the word is related to a Ugaritic word meaning salt (cf., e.g., J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah </i>[AB], 320). However, <i>HALOT</i> 959 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1509;</font> questions the validity of this on philological grounds saying that the meaning of salt does not really fit the Ugaritic either. The present translation follows the suggestions of the lexicons here and reads the word as though the Greek supported the meaning &#8220;gravestone.&#8221; The other difficulty is with the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1510;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">natso</font>&#8217;), which looks like a Qal infinitive absolute of an otherwise unattested root which BDB s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font> says is defined in Gesenius&#8217; Thesaurus as &#8220;fly.&#8221; However, see the meaning and the construction of an infinitive absolute of one root with that of another as highly improbable. Hence, most modern lexicons either emend the forms to read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1510;&#1465;&#1492; &#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">natsoh titseh</font>) from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">natsah</font>) meaning &#8220;to fall into ruins&#8221; (so KBL 629 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1492;</font> Qal, and see among others J. A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah </i>[NICOT], 700, n. 10, who notes that final <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> [<font face="Scholar">aleph</font>] and final <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">hey</font>] are often confused; see the discussion and examples in GKC 216-17 §75.<i>nn</i>-<i>rr</i>). This is the option that this translation as well as a number of modern ones have taken. A second option is to see <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1510;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">natso</font>&#8217;) as an error for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatso</font>&#8217;) and read the text in the sense of &#8220;she will certainly surrender,&#8221; a meaning that the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatsa</font>&#8217;) has in 1 Sam 11:3; Isa 36:6. The best discussion of this option as well as a discussion on the problem of reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsits</font>) as salt is found in G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, T. G. Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52 </i>(WBC),<i> </i>313-14.</p>

In this verse the picture is that of the decanter emptying the wine from the vessels and then breaking the jars. The wine represents the people and the vessels the cities and towns where the people lived. The verse speaks of the exile of the people and the devastation of the land. The metaphor has been interpreted so it conveys meaning to the average reader.</p>

<A NAME="4825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2545><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Moab will be ashamed because of Chemosh as the house of Israel was ashamed because of Bethel, their [source of] confidence.&#8221; The &#8220;shame&#8221; is, of course, the disappointment, disillusionment because of the lack of help from these gods in which they trusted (for this nuance of the verb see BDB 101 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;</font> Qal.2 and compare usage in Jer 2:13; Isa 20:5). Because of the parallelism, some see the reference to Bethel to be a reference to a West Semitic god worshiped by the people of Israel (see J. P. Hyatt, &#8220;Bethel [Deity],&#8221; <i>IDB</i> 1:390 for the arguments). However, there is no evidence in the OT that such a god was worshiped in Israel, and there is legitimate evidence that northern Israel placed its confidence in the calf god that Jeroboam set up in Bethel (cf. 1 Kgs 12:28-32; Hos 10:5; 8:5-6; Amos 7:10-17).</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map4-G4; Map5-C1; Map6-E3; Map7-D1; Map8-G3.</p>

There is some difference of opinion about the identification of the &#8220;I&#8221; in this verse. Most commentators see it as referring to the prophet. However, F. B. Huey (<i>Jeremiah, Lamentations </i>[NAC], 395) is probably correct in seeing it as referring to the <sc>Lord. He points to the fact that the &#8220;I&#8221; in vv. 33, 35, 38 can only refer to God. The &#8220;I know&#8221; in v. 30 also clearly has the <sc>Lord as its subject.

<A NAME="4854"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=2574><b>tn</b> The meaning of this verse is very uncertain. The ambiguity of the syntax and the apparent elliptical nature of this text makes the meaning of this verse uncertain. The Hebrew text reads: &#8220;From the cry of Heshbon unto Elealeh unto Jahaz they utter their voice from Zoar unto Horonaim Eglath Shelishiyah.&#8221; The translation and interpretation here are based on interpreting the elliptical syntax here by the parallel passage in Isaiah 15:4-6 where cries of anguish rise from Heshbon and Elealeh which are heard all the way to Jahaz. The people flee southward arriving at Zoar and Eglath Shelishiyah where they voice the news of the destruction in the north. Hence, the present translation interprets the phrase &#8220;from the cry of Heshbon unto Elealeh&#8221; to be parallel to &#8220;Heshbon and Elealeh cry out&#8221; and take the preposition &#8220;from&#8221; with the verb &#8220;they utter their voice,&#8221; i.e., with the cry of Heshbon and Elealeh. The impersonal &#8220;they raise their voice&#8221; is then treated as a passive and made the subject of the whole verse. There is some debate about the identification of the waters of Nimrim. They may refer to the waters of the Wadi Nimrim which enters the Jordan about eight miles north of the Dead Sea or those of the Wadi en-Numeirah which flows into the southern tip of the Dead Sea from about ten miles south. Most commentators take the reference to be the latter because of association with Zoar. However, if the passage is talking about the destruction in the north which is reported in the south by the fleeing refugees, the reference is probably to the Wadi Nimrim in the north.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Elealeh</i> was about two miles (3.3 km) north of Heshbon. Jahaz was about twenty miles (33 km) south of it. These three cities were in the north and <i>Zoar</i>, <i>Horonaim</i>, and <i>Eglath Shelishiyah</i> were apparently in the south.

And it devours the forehead of Moab and the skull of the sons of noise.&#8221; The meaning of the first part is fairly clear because v. 2 has already spoken of the conquest of Heshbon and a plot formed there to conquer the rest of the nation. The fire going forth from Heshbon would hence refer here to the conflagrations of war spreading from Heshbon to the rest of the country. The reference to the &#8220;midst of Sihon&#8221; is to be understood metonymically as a reference for the ruler to what he once ruled (cf. E. W. Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, 583). The last two lines must refer to more than the fugitives who stopped at Heshbon for protection because it refers to the forehead of Moab (a personification of the whole land or nation). It is unclear, however, why reference is made to the foreheads and skulls of the Moabites, other than the fact that this verse seems to be a readaptation or reuse of Num 24:17 where the verb used with them is &#8220;smite&#8221; which fits nicely in the sense of martial destruction. Translated rather literally, it appears here to refer to the destruction by the fires of war of the Moabites, the part (forehead and skulls) put for the whole. TEV sees a reference here to the &#8220;frontiers&#8221; and &#8220;mountain heights&#8221; of Moab and this would work nicely for &#8220;foreheads&#8221; which is elsewhere used of the corner or border of a land in Neh 9:22. The word &#8220;crown&#8221; or &#8220;skull&#8221; might be a picturesque metaphor for the mountain heights of a land, but the word is never used elsewhere in such a figurative way. TEV (and CEV) which follows it might be correct here but there is no way to validate it. The meaning &#8220;war-loving people&#8221; for the phrase &#8220;sons of noise&#8221; is based on the suggestion of BDB 981 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> 1 which relates the phrase to the dominant use for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">on</font>) and is adopted also by TEV, CEV, and C. von Orelli, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 341. REB &#8220;braggarts&#8221; and NIV &#8220;noisy boasters&#8221; seem to base the nuance on the usage of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">on</font>) in Jer 46:17 where Pharaoh is referred to as an empty noise and the reference to Moab&#8217;s arrogance and boasting in 48:29.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This verse and the next are an apparent adaptation and reuse of a victory song in Num 21:28-29 and a prophecy in Num 24:17. That explains the reference to Sihon who was the Amorite king who captured Heshbon and proceeded from there to capture most of northern Moab (the area between Heshbon and the Arnon) which has been referred to earlier in this prophecy. This prophecy appears to speak of the destruction of Moab beginning from the same place under the picture of a destructive fire which burns up all the people. The fire is a reference to the conflagrations of war in which the enemy captures the cities and sets them on fire and burns all the people in them. What Sihon once did (Num 21:28-29) and what Balaam prophesied would happen to Moab in the future (by David? Num 24:17) are being reapplied to a new situation.</p>
