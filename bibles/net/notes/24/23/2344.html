<A NAME="2344"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1317><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;they commit adultery and deal falsely.&#8221; The word &#8220;shocking&#8221; only occurs here and in 5:30 where it is found in the context of prophesying lies. This almost assures that the reference to &#8220;walking in lies&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the lie&#8221;) is referring to false prophesy. Moreover the references to the prophets in 5:13 and in 14:13-15 are all in the context of false prophesy as are the following references in this chapter in 23:24, 26, 32 and in 28:15. This appears to be the theme of this section. This also makes it likely that the reference to adultery is not literal adultery, though two of the false prophets in Babylon were guilty of this (29:23). The reference to &#8220;encouraging those who do evil&#8221; that follows also makes more sense if they were preaching messages of comfort rather than messages of doom. The verbs here are infinitive absolutes in place of the finite verb, probably used to place greater emphasis on the action (cf. Hos 4:2 in a comparable judgment speech.)</p>
