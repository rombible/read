<A NAME="2381"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">81</span><note=1354><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;through Baal.&#8221; This is an elliptical expression for the worship of Baal. See 11:17; 12:16; 19:5 for other references to their relation to Baal. There is a deliberate paralleling in the syntax here between &#8220;through their dreams&#8221; and &#8220;through Baal.&#8221;</p>
