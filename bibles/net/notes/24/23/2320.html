<A NAME="2320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1293><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his name will be called &#8216;The <sc>Lord our righteousness&#8217;.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Hebrew word translated &#8220;justice&#8221; here is very broad in its usage, and it is hard to catch all the relevant nuances for this word in this context. It is used for &#8220;vindication&#8221; in legal contexts (see, e.g., Job 6:29), for &#8220;deliverance&#8221; or &#8220;salvation&#8221; in exilic contexts (see, e.g., Isa 58:8), and in the sense of ruling, judging with &#8220;justice&#8221; (see, e.g., Lev 19:15; Isa 32:1). Here it probably sums up the justice that the <sc>Lord provides through raising up this ruler as well as the safety, security, and well-being that result (see vv. 5-6a). In the NT this takes on soteriological connotations (see 1 Cor 1:31 in its context).</p>
