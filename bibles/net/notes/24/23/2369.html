<A NAME="2369"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=1342><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;Do you people think&#8221; at the beginning of this verse and &#8220;Do you really think&#8221; at the beginning of the next verse are not in the text but are a way of trying to convey the nature of the rhetorical questions which expect a negative answer. They are also a way of trying to show that the verses are still connected with the preceding discussion addressed to the people (cf. 23:16, 20).</p>
