<A NAME="2314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1287><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a righteous sprig to David&#8221; or &#8220;a righteous shoot&#8221; (NAB).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This passage and the parallel in Jer 33:15 are part of a growing number of prayers and prophecies regarding an ideal ruler to come forth from the Davidic line who will bring the justice, security, and well-being that the continuing line of Davidic rulers did not. Though there were periodic kings like Josiah who did fulfill the ideals set forth in Jer 22:3 (see Jer 22:15), by and large they were more like Jehoiakim who did not (see Jer 22:13). Hence the <sc>Lord brought to an end the Davidic rule. The potential for the ideal, however, remained because of God&#8217;s promise to David (2 Sam 7:16). The Davidic line became like a tree which was cut down, leaving only a stump. But from that stump God would bring forth a &#8220;shoot,&#8221; a &#8220;sprig&#8221; which would fulfill the ideals of kingship. See Isa 11:1-6 and Zech 3:8, 6:12 for this metaphor and compare Dan 4:14-15, 23, 26 for a different but related use of the metaphor.</p>
