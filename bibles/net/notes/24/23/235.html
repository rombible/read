<A NAME="235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1278><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Therefore, thus says the <sc>Lord, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds who should be shepherding my people: You have scattered my sheep and driven them away and you have not taken care of them. Behold I will visit upon you the evil of your deeds.&#8221; &#8220;Therefore&#8221; announces the judgment which does not come until &#8220;Behold.&#8221; It is interrupted by the messenger formula and a further indictment. The original has been broken up to conform more to contemporary English style, the metaphors have been interpreted for clarity and the connections between the indictments and the judgments have been carried by &#8220;So.&#8221;</p>
