<A NAME="23106"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">106</span><note=1379><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The burden is [or will be] to a man his word.&#8221; There is a good deal of ambiguity regarding how this line is to be rendered. For the major options and the issues involved W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah </i>(Hermeneia), 1:651-52 should be consulted. Most of them are excluded by the observation that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;</font> probably does not mean &#8220;oracle&#8221; anywhere in this passage (see note on v. 33 regarding the use of this word). Hence it does not mean &#8220;every man&#8217;s word becomes his oracle&#8221; as in NIV or &#8220;for that &#8216;burden&#8217; [= oracle] is what he entrusts to the man of his word&#8221; (W. McKane, <i>Jeremiah </i>[ICC], 1:600-601). The latter is also ruled out by the fact that the antecedent of &#8220;his&#8221; on &#8220;his word&#8221; is clearly the word &#8220;man&#8221; in front of it. This would be the only case where the phrase &#8220;man of his word&#8221; occurs. There is also no textual reason for repointing the noun with the article as the noun with the interrogative to read &#8220;For how can his word become a burden to anyone?&#8221; There are, of course, other options but this is sufficient to show that the translation has been chosen after looking at other alternatives.</p>
