<A NAME="2327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1300><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;false&#8221; is not in the text, but it is clear from the context that these are whom the sayings are directed against. The words &#8220;Here is what the <sc>Lord says&#8221; are also not in the text. But comparison with 46:2; 48:1; 49:1, 7, 23, 28; and 21:11 will show that this is a heading. The words are supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
