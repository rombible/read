<A NAME="23102"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">102</span><note=1375><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;So, I, Jeremiah tell you&#8221; are not in the text. They are supplied in the translation for clarity to show that it is he who is addressing the people, not the <sc>Lord. See &#8220;our God&#8221; in v. 38 and &#8220;Here is what the <sc>Lord says&#8230;&#8221; which indicate the speaker is other than he.</p>
