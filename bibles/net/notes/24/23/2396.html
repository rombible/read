<A NAME="2396"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">96</span><note=1369><b>tn</b> The meaning of vv. 33-40 is debated. The translation given here follows the general direction of NRSV and REB rather than that of NIV and the related direction taken by NCV and God&#8217;s Word. The meaning of vv. 33-40 are debated because of (1) the ambiguity involved in the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">masa</font>&#8217;), which can mean either &#8220;burden&#8221; (as something carried or weighing heavily on a person; see, e.g., Exod 23:5; Num 4:27; 2 Sam 15:33; Ps 38:4) or &#8220;oracle&#8221; (of doom; see, e. g., Isa 13:1; Nah 1:1); (the translation is debated due to etymological concerns), (2) the ambiguity of the line in v. 36 which has been rendered &#8220;For what is &#8216;burdensome&#8217; really pertains rather to what a person himself says&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;the burden is to the man his word&#8221;), and (3) the text in v. 33 of &#8220;you are the burden.&#8221; Many commentaries see a wordplay on the two words &#8220;burden&#8221; and &#8220;oracle&#8221; which are homonyms. However, from the contrasts that are drawn in the passage, it is doubtful whether the nuance of &#8220;oracle&#8221; ever is in view. The word is always used in the prophets of an oracle of doom or judgment; it is not merely revelation of God which one of the common people would have been uttering (contra NIV). Jeremiah never uses the word in that sense nor does anyone else in the book of Jeremiah.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> What is in view here is the idea that the people consider Jeremiah&#8217;s views of loyalty to God and obedience to the covenant &#8220;burdensome.&#8221; I.e., what burdensome demands is the <sc>Lord asking you to impose on us (See Jer 17:21, 22, 24, 27 where this same word is used regarding Sabbath observance which they chafed at). The <sc>Lord answers back that it is not he who is being burdensome to them; they are burdensome to him (See 15:6: &#8220;I am weary&#8221; and compare Isa 1:14 where the verb rather than the noun is used).</p>
