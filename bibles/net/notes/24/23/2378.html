<A NAME="2378"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=1351><b>tn</b> The relation of the words to one another in v. 26 and the beginning of v. 27 has created difficulties for translators and commentators. The proper solution is reflected in the NJPS. Verses 26-27 read somewhat literally, &#8220;How long is there in the hearts of the prophets who are prophesying the lie and [in the hearts of] the prophets of the delusions of their [own] heart the plotting to cause my people to forget my name&#8230;&#8221; Most commentaries complain that the text is corrupt, that there is no subject for &#8220;is there.&#8221; However, the long construct qualification &#8220;in the hearts of&#8221; has led to the lack of observation that the proper subject is &#8220;the plotting to make my people forget.&#8221; There are no exact parallels but Jer 14:22; Neh 5:5 follow the same structure. The &#8220;How long&#8221; precedes the other means of asking a question for the purpose of emphasis (cf. BDB 210 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1458;</font> 1.b and compare for example the usage in 2 Sam 7:7). There has also been a failure to see that &#8220;the prophets of the delusion of&#8230;&#8221; is a parallel construct noun after &#8220;heart of.&#8221; Stripping the syntax down to its barest minimum and translating literally, the sentence would read &#8220;How long will the plotting&#8230;continue in the hearts of the prophets who&#8230;and [in hearts of] the prophets of&#8230;&#8221; The sentence has been restructured in the translation to conform to contemporary English style but attempt has been made to maintain the same subordinations.</p>
