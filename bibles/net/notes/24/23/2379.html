<A NAME="2379"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">79</span><note=1352><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my name.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In the OT, the &#8220;name&#8221; reflected the person&#8217;s character (cf. Gen 27:36; 1 Sam 25:25) or his reputation (Gen 11:4; 2 Sam 8:13). To speak in someone&#8217;s name was to act as his representative or carry his authority (1 Sam 25:9; 1 Kgs 21:8). To call someone&#8217;s name over something was to claim it for one&#8217;s own (2 Sam 12:28). Hence, here to forget the name is equivalent to forgetting who he was in his essential character (cf. Exod 3:13-15; 6:3; 34:5-7). By preaching lies they had obliterated part of his essential character and caused people to forget who he really was.</p>
