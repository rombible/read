<A NAME="23103"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">103</span><note=1376><b>tn</b> This line is sometimes rendered as a description of what the people are doing (cf. NIV). However, repetition with some slight modification referring to the prophet in v. 37 followed by the same kind of prohibition that follows here shows that what is being contrasted is two views toward the <sc>Lord&#8217;s message, i.e., one of openness to receive what the <sc>Lord says through the prophet and one that already characterizes the <sc>Lord&#8217;s message as a burden. Allusion to the question that started the discussion in v. 33 should not be missed. The prophet alluded to is Jeremiah. He is being indirect in his reference to himself.</p>
