<A NAME="2356"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=1329><b>tc</b> The translation follows the Greek version. The Hebrew text reads, &#8220;who reject me, &#8216;The <sc>Lord has spoken, &#8220;Things&#8230;&#8221;&#8217;&#8221; The Greek version is to be preferred here because of (1) the parallelism of the lines &#8220;reject what the <sc>Lord has said&#8221; // &#8220;follow the stubborn inclinations of their own hearts;&#8221; (2) the preceding context which speaks of &#8220;visions of their own imaginations not of what the <sc>Lord has given them;&#8221; (3) the following context which denies that they have ever had access to the <sc>Lord&#8217;s secrets; (4) the general contexts earlier regarding false prophecy where rejection of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s word is in view (6:14 [see there v. 10]; 8:11 [see there v. 9]); (5) the meter of the poetic lines (the Hebrew meter is 3/5/4/3; the meter presupposed by the translation is 5/3/4/3 with the 3&#8217;s being their words).
