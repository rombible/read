<A NAME="2398"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">98</span><note=1371><b>tn</b> The meaning &#8220;cast you away&#8221; is questioned by some because the word is regularly used of &#8220;forsaking&#8221; or &#8220;abandoning&#8221; (see, e.g., Jer 7:29; 12:7; 15:6). However, it is clearly use of &#8220;casting down&#8221; or &#8220;throwing away&#8221; in Ezek 29:5; 32:4 and that meaning is virtually assured in v. 39 where the verb is combined with the phrase &#8220;from my presence&#8221; which is elsewhere used in rejection contexts with verbs like &#8220;send away,&#8221; &#8220;throw out,&#8221; or &#8220;remove&#8221; (see BDB 819 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1462;&#1492;</font> II.8.a). This is another example of the bracketing effect of a key word and should be rendered the same in the two passages. Moreover, it fits in nicely with the play on &#8220;burden&#8221; here.</p>
