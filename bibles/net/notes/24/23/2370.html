<A NAME="2370"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=1343><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Am I a god nearby and not a god far off?&#8221; The question is sometimes translated as though there is an alternative being given in v. 23, one that covers both the ideas of immanence and transcendence (i.e., &#8220;Am I only a god nearby and not also a god far off?&#8221;). However, the <font face="Scholar">hey</font> interrogative (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;</font>) at the beginning of this verse and the particle (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>) at the beginning of the next show that the linkage is between the question in v. 23 and that in v. 24a. According to BDB 210 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1458;</font> 1.d both questions in this case expect a negative answer.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The thought that is expressed here must be viewed against the background of ancient Near Eastern thought where gods were connected with different realms, e.g., Baal, the god of wind, rain, and fertility, Mot, the god of drought, infertility, and death, Yam, the god of the sea and of chaos. Moreover, Baal was worshiped in local manifestations as the Baal of Peor, Baal of Gad, etc. Hence, Baal is sometimes spoken of in the singular and sometimes in the plural. The <sc>Lord is the one true God (Deut 6:4). Moreover, he is the maker of heaven and earth (Gen 14:12; 2 Kgs 19:15; Ps 115:15), sees into the hearts of all men (Ps 33:13-15), and judges men according to what they do (Ezek 7:3, 7, 27). There is no hiding from him (Job 34:22; Ps 139:7-12) and no escape from his judgment (Amos 9:2-4). God has already spoken to the people and their leaders through Jeremiah along these lines (Jer 16:17; 21:14). Lurking behind the thoughts expressed here is probably Deut 29:19-21 where God warns that one &#8220;bad apple&#8221; who thinks he can get away with sinning against the covenant can lead to the destruction of all. The false prophets were the &#8220;bad apples&#8221; that were encouraging the corruption of the whole nation by their words promoting a false sense of security unconnected with loyalty to God and obedience to his covenant. The first question deals with the issue of God&#8217;s transcendence, the second with his omniscience, and the third with his omnipresence.</p>
