<A NAME="2373"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=1346><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know&#8221; are not in the text. They are a way of conveying the idea that the question which reads literally &#8220;Do I not fill heaven and earth?&#8221; expects a positive answer. They follow the pattern used at the beginning of the previous two questions and continue that thought. The words are supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
