<A NAME="2376"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">76</span><note=1349><b>sn</b> To have <i>had a dream</i> was not an illegitimate means of receiving divine revelation. God had revealed himself in the past to his servants through dreams (e.g., Jacob [Gen 31:10-11] and Joseph [Gen 37:6, 7, 9]) and God promised to reveal himself through dreams (Num 12:6; Joel 2:28 [3:1 HT]). What was illegitimate was to use the dream to lead people away from the <sc>Lord (Deut 13:1-5 [13:2-6 HT]). That was what the prophets were doing through their dreams which were &#8220;lies&#8221; and &#8220;the delusions of their own minds.&#8221; Through them they were making people forget who the <sc>Lord really was which was just like what their ancestors had done through worshiping Baal.</p>
