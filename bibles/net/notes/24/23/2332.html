<A NAME="2332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1305><b>tn</b> For the word translated &#8220;They live&#8230;lives&#8221; see usage in Jer 8:6. For the idea of &#8220;misusing&#8221; their power (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;their power is not right&#8221; i.e., used in the wrong way) see 2 Kgs 7:9; 17:9. In the original text this line (really two lines in the Hebrew poetry) are at the end of the verse. However, this places the antecedent too far away and could lead to confusion. The lines have been rearranged to avoid such confusion.</p>
