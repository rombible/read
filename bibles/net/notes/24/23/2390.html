<A NAME="2390"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">90</span><note=1363><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;The <sc>Lord&#8221; is not actually in the text but is implicit in the idiom. It is generally supplied in all the English versions.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Jer 23:30-33 are filled with biting sarcasm. The verses all begin with &#8220;Behold I am against the prophets who&#8230;&#8221; and go on to describe their reprehensible behavior. They &#8220;steal&#8221; one another&#8217;s messages which the <sc>Lord sarcastically calls &#8220;my words&#8221; (The passage shows that they are not; compare Marc Anthony&#8217;s use of &#8220;noble&#8221; to describe the ignoble men who killed Caesar). Here the use of the idiom translated &#8220;to use their own tongue&#8221; is really the idiom that refers to taking something in preparation for action, i.e., &#8220;they take <i>their</i> tongue&#8221; and &#8220;declare.&#8221; The verb &#8220;declare&#8221; is only used here and is derived from the idiom &#8220;oracle of &#8220; which is almost universally used in the idiom &#8220;oracle of the <sc>Lord&#8221; which occurs 176 times in Jeremiah. I.e., it is their tongue that is &#8220;declaring not his mouth (v. 16). Moreover in the report of what they &#8220;declare&#8221; the <sc>Lord has left out the qualifying &#8220;of the <sc>Lord&#8221; to suggest the delusive nature of their message, i.e. they mislead people into believing that their message is from the <sc>Lord. Elsewhere in the discussion of the issue of false prophecy the <sc>Lord will use the full formula (Ezek 13:6-7). How ironic that their &#8220;Oracle of&#8230;&#8221; is punctuated by the triple &#8220;Oracle of the <sc>Lord&#8221; (vv. 30, 31, 32; translated here &#8220;I, the <sc>Lord, affirm that&#8230;).</p>
