<A NAME="2326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1299><b>sn</b> Jeremiah has already had a good deal to say about the false prophets and their fate. See 2:8, 26; 5:13, 31; 14:13-15. Here he parallels the condemnation of the wicked prophets and their fate (23:9-40) with that of the wicked kings (21:11-22:30).</p>
