<A NAME="2362"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=1335><b>tn</b> The syntax of this line has generally been misunderstood, sometimes to the point that some want to delete the word wrath. Both here and in 30:23 where these same words occur the word &#8220;anger&#8221; stands not as an accusative of attendant circumstance but an apposition, giving the intended referent to the figure. Comparison should be made with Jer 25:15 where &#8220;this wrath&#8221; is appositional to &#8220;the cup of wine&#8221; (cf. GKC 425 §131.<i>k</i>).</p>
