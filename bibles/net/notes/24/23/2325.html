<A NAME="2325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1298><b>tn</b> This passage is the same as 16:14-15 with a few minor variations in Hebrew wording. The notes on that passage should be consulted for the rendering here. This passage has the Niphal of the verb &#8220;to say&#8221; rather than the impersonal use of the Qal. It adds the idea of &#8220;bringing out&#8221; to the idea of &#8220;bringing up out&#8221; and (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;who brought up and who brought out,&#8221; probably a case of hendiadys) before &#8220;the people [here &#8220;seed&#8221; rather than &#8220;children&#8221;] of Israel [here &#8220;house of Israel&#8221;] from the land of the north.&#8221; These are minor variations and do not affect the sense in any way. So the passage is rendered in much the same way.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This passage looks forward to a new and greater Exodus, one that so outstrips the earlier one that the earlier will not serve as the model of deliverance any longer. This same ideal was the subject of Isaiah&#8217;s earlier prophecies in Isa 11:11-12, 15-16; 43:16-21; 49:8-13; 51: 1-11.</p>
