<A NAME="2335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1308><b>tn</b> The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) which begins this verse is parallel to the one at the beginning of the preceding verse. However, the connection is too distant to render it &#8220;for.&#8221; &#8220;Moreover&#8221; is intended to draw the parallel. The words &#8220;the <sc>Lord says&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;Oracle of the <sc>Lord&#8221;) have been drawn up to the front to introduce the shift in speaker from Jeremiah, who describes his agitated state, to God, who describes the sins of the prophets and priests and his consequent judgment on them.</p>
