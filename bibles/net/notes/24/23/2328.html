My bones tremble.&#8221; It has already been noted several times that the &#8220;heart&#8221; in ancient Hebrew psychology was the intellectual and volitional center of the person, the kidneys were the emotional center, and the bones the locus of strength and also the subject of joy, distress, and sorrow.
