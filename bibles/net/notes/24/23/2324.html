<A NAME="2324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1297><b>tc</b> It is probably preferable to read the third masculine singular plus suffix (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hiddikham</font>) here with the Greek version and the parallel passage in 16:15 rather than the first singular plus suffix in the MT (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hiddakhtim</font>). If this is not a case of mere graphic confusion, the MT could have arisen under the influence of the first person in v. 3. Though sudden shifts in person have been common in the book of Jeremiah, that is unlikely in a context reporting an oath.</p>
