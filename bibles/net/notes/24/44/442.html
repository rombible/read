<A NAME="442"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2385><b>sn</b> The first three cities, <i>Migdol</i>, <i>Tahpanhes</i>, and <i>Memphis</i>, are located in Northern or Lower Egypt. Memphis (Heb &#8220;<i>Noph</i>&#8221;) was located south of Heliopolis (which was referred to earlier as &#8220;the temple of the sun&#8221;) and was about fourteen miles (23 km) south of Cairo. For the identification and location of Tahpanhes see the study note on Jer 43:7. The location of Migdol has been debated but is tentatively identified with a border fortress about twenty-five miles (42 km) east-northeast of Tahpanhes. The &#8220;region of southern Egypt&#8221; is literally &#8220;the land of Pathros,&#8221; the long Nile valley extending north and south between Cairo and Aswan (biblical Syene). For further information see the discussion in G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, T. G. Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52 </i>(WBC),<i> </i>262-63. Reference here is to Judean exiles who had fled earlier as well as to those from Mizpah who were led into Egypt by Johanan and the other arrogant men (43:3, 5).</p>
