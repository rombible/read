<A NAME="4428"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2411><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;There shall not be an escapee or a survivor to the remnant of Judah who came to sojourn there in the land of Egypt even to return to the land of Judah which they are lifting up their souls [= &#8220;longing/desiring&#8221; (BDB 672 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1488;</font> Piel.2)] to return to live there; for none shall return except fugitives.&#8221; The long, complex Hebrew original has been broken up and restructured to better conform with contemporary English style. Another possible structure would be &#8220;None of the Judean remnant who have come to live in the land of Egypt will escape or survive. None of them will escape or survive to return to the land of Judah where they long to return to live. Indeed (emphatic use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> [<font face="Scholar">ki</font>]; cf. BDB 472 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 1.e) none of them shall return except a few fugitives.&#8221; This verse is a good example of rhetorical hyperbole where a universal negative does not apply to absolutely all the particulars. Though the <sc>Lord denies at the outset that any will escape or survive the punishment of vv. 12-13 to return to Judah, he says at the end that a few fugitives will return (the two words for fugitive are from the same root and mean the same thing). (E. W. Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, 618-19, might classify this as a synecdoche of genus where a universal negative does not deny particularity.) That this last statement is not a gloss or an afterthought is supported by what is said later in v. 28.</p>
