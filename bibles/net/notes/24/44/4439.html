<A NAME="4439"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2422><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The sacrifices which you sacrificed in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your fathers, your kings and your leaders and the people of the land, did not the <sc>Lord remember them and [did they not] come into his mind?&#8221; The question is again rhetorical and expects a positive answer. So it is rendered here as an affirmative statement for the sake of clarity and simplicity. An attempt has been made to shorten the long Hebrew sentence to better conform with contemporary English style.</p>
