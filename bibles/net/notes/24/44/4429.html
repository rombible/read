<A NAME="4429"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2412><b>tn</b> The translation is very interpretive at several key points: <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Then all the men who were aware that their wives were sacrificing to other gods and all their wives who were standing by, a great crowd/congregation, and all the people who were living in the land of Egypt in Pathros answered, saying.&#8221; It is proper to assume that the phrase &#8220;a great crowd&#8221; is appositional to &#8220;all the men&#8230;and their wives&#8230;.&#8221; It is also probably proper to assume that the phrase &#8220;who were standing by&#8221; is unnecessary to the English translation. What is interpretive is the assumption that the &#8220;and all the people who were living in Egypt in Pathros&#8221; is explicative of &#8220;the great crowd&#8221; and that the phrase &#8220;in Pathros&#8221; is conjunctive and not appositional. Several commentaries and English versions (e.g., J. A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah </i>[NICOT], 678-79, n. 2; NJPS) assume that the phrase is descriptive of a second group, i.e., all the Jews from Pathros in Egypt (i.e., southern Egypt [see the study note on 44:1]). Those who follow this interpretation generally see this as a gloss (see Thompson, 678, n. 2, and also W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah </i>[Hermeneia], 2:279, n. 15b). It is probably better to assume that the phrase is explicative and that &#8220;all&#8221; is used in the same rhetorical way that it has been used within the chapter, i.e., &#8220;all&#8221; = representatives of all. Likewise the phrase &#8220;in Pathros&#8221; should be assumed to be conjunctive as in the Syriac translation and as suggested by <i>BHS</i> fn c since Jeremiah&#8217;s answer in vv. 24, 26 is directed to all the Judeans living in Egypt.</p>
