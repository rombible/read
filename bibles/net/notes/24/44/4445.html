<A NAME="4445"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=2428><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Therefore.&#8221; This particle quite often introduces the announcement of judgment after an indictment or accusation of a crime. That is its function here after the statement of cause in vv. 24-25. However, it would not sound right after the immediately preceding ironical or sarcastic commands to go ahead and fulfill their vows. &#8220;But&#8221; is a better transition unless one wants to paraphrase &#8220;Therefore, since you are so determined to do that&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
