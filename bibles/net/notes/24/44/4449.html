Not all but almost all; very few would survive. The following statement implies that the reason that they are left alive is to bear witness to the fact that the <sc>Lord&#8217;s threats were indeed carried out. See vv. 11-14 for a parallel use of &#8220;all&#8221; and &#8220;none&#8221; qualified by a &#8220;few.&#8221;</p>
