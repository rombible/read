The disasters included the death of Josiah himself at the battle of Megiddo, the deportation of his son Jehoahaz to Egypt, the death of Jehoiakim, the deportation of Jehoiachin (Jeconiah) and many other Judeans in 597 <sc>b.c., the death by war, starvation, and disease of many Judeans during the siege of Jerusalem in 588-86 <sc>b.c., and the captivity of many of those who survived. Instead of seeing these as punishments for their disobedience to the <sc>Lord as Jeremiah had preached to them, they saw these as consequences of their failure to continue the worship of the foreign gods.</p>
