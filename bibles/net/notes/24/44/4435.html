<A NAME="4435"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2418><b>tc</b> The words &#8220;And the women added&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text. They are, however, implicit in what is said. They are found in the Syriac version and in one recension of the Greek version. W. L. Holladay (<i>Jeremiah </i>[Hermeneia], 2:279, n. 19a) suggests that these words are missing from the Hebrew text because of haplography, i.e., that the scribe left out <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1499;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vahannashim </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">omru khi</font>) because his eye jumped from the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> at the beginning to the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) that introduced the temporal clause and left out everything in between. It is, however, just as likely, given the fact that there are several other examples of quotes which have not been formally introduced in the book of Jeremiah, that the words were not there and are supplied by these two ancient versions as a translator&#8217;s clarification.</p>
