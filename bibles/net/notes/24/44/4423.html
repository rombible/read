<A NAME="4423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2406><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and to destroy all Judah.&#8221; However, this statement must be understood within the rhetoric of the passage (see vv. 7-8 and the study note on v. 8) and within the broader context of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s promises to restore the remnant who are in Babylon and those scattered in other lands (23:3; 24:5-6; 29:14; 30:3; 32:27). In this context &#8220;all Judah&#8221; must refer to all the Judeans living in Egypt whom Jeremiah is now addressing. This involves the figure of synecdoche where all does not extend to all individuals but to all that are further specified or implied (see E. W. Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, 616-18, and the comments in H. Freedman,<i> Jeremiah</i> [SoBB], 285). The &#8220;and&#8221; in front of &#8220;to destroy&#8221; is to be understood as an example of the epexegetical use of the conjunction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vav</font>; see BDB 252 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;</font> 1.b and compare the translation of J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah </i>[AB], 260).</p>
