<A NAME="4454"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=2437><b>sn</b> <i>Hophra</i> ruled over Egypt from 589-570 <sc>b.c. He was the Pharaoh who incited Zedekiah to rebel against Nebuchadnezzar and whose army proved ineffective in providing any long-term relief to Jerusalem when it was under siege (see Jer 37 and especially the study note on 37:5). He was assassinated following a power struggle with a court official who had earlier saved him from a rebellion of his own troops and had ruled as co-regent with him.</p>
