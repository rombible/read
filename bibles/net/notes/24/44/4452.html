<A NAME="4452"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=2435><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;This will be to you the sign, oracle of the <sc>Lord, that I will punish you in this place in order that you may know that my threats against you for evil/disaster/harm will certainly stand [see the translator&#8217;s note on the preceding verse for the meaning of this word here].&#8221; The word &#8220;sign&#8221; refers to an event that is a pre-omen or portent of something that will happen later (see BDB 16 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> 2 and compare usage in 1 Sam 14:10; 2 Kgs 19:29). The best way to carry that idea across in this context seems to be &#8220;I will make something happen to prove [or portend].&#8221; Another possibility would be &#8220;I will give you a pre-omen that,&#8221; but many readers would probably not be familiar with &#8220;omen/pre-omen.&#8221; Again the sentence has been broken in two and restructured to better conform with English style.</p>
