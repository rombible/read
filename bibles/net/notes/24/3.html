<A NAME="31"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=119><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;May he go back to her again?&#8221; The question is rhetorical and expects a negative answer.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> For the legal background for the illustration that is used here see Deut 24:1-4.</p>
<A NAME="32"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=120><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Would the land not be utterly defiled?&#8221; The stative is here rendered actively to connect better with the preceding. The question is rhetorical and expects a positive answer.</p>
<A NAME="33"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=121><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;But you have played the prostitute with many lovers.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="34"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=122><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Returning to me.&#8221; The form is the bare infinitive which the KJV and ASV have interpreted as an imperative &#8220;Yet, return to me!&#8221; However, it is more likely that a question is intended, expressing surprise in the light of the law alluded to and the facts cited. For the use of the infinitive absolute in the place of a finite verb, cf. GKC 346 §113.<i>ee</i>. For the introduction of a question without a question marker, cf. GKC 473 §150.<i>a</i>.</p>
<A NAME="35"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=123><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and see.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="36"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=124><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Where have you not been ravished?&#8221; The rhetorical question expects the answer &#8220;nowhere,&#8221; which suggests she has engaged in the worship of pagan gods on every one of the hilltops.</p>
<A NAME="37"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=125><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;You sat for them [the lovers, i.e., the foreign gods] beside the road like an Arab in the desert.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="38"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=126><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;by your prostitution and your wickedness.&#8221; This is probably an example of hendiadys where, when two nouns are joined by &#8220;and,&#8221; one expresses the main idea and the other qualifies it.</p>
<A NAME="39"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=127><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you have the forehead of a prostitute.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=128><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Have you not just now called out to me, &#8216;[you are] my father!&#8217;?&#8221; The rhetorical question expects a positive answer.</p>
<A NAME="311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=129><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Will he keep angry forever? Will he maintain [it] to the end?&#8221; The questions are rhetorical and expect a negative answer. The change to direct address in the English translation is intended to ease the problem of the rapid transition, common in Hebrew style (but not in English), from second person direct address in the preceding lines to third person indirect address in these two lines. See GKC 462 §144.<i>p</i>.</p>
<A NAME="312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=130><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;You do the evil and you are able.&#8221; This is an example of hendiadys, meaning &#8220;You do all the evil that you are able to do.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=131><b>tn</b> &#8220;Have you seen&#8230;&#8221; The question is rhetorical and expects a positive answer.</p>
<A NAME="314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=132><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;she played the prostitute there.&#8221; This is a metaphor for Israel&#8217;s worship; she gave herself to the worship of other gods like a prostitute gives herself to her lovers. There seems no clear way to completely spell out the metaphor in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=133><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I said to her, &#8216;Come back to me!&#8217;&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amar</font>) usually means &#8220;to say,&#8221; but here it means &#8220;to think,&#8221; of an assumption that turns out to be wrong (so <i>HALOT </i>66.4 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;</font>); cf. Gen 44:28; Jer 3:19; Pss 82:6; 139:11; Job 29:18; Ruth 4:4; Lam 3:18.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Open theists suggest that passages such as this indicate God has limited foreknowledge; however, more traditional theologians view this passage as an extended metaphor in which God presents himself as a deserted husband, hoping against hope that his adulterous wife might return to him. The point of the metaphor is not to make an assertion about God&#8217;s foreknowledge, but to develop the theme of God&#8217;s heartbreak due to Israel&#8217;s unrepentance.</p>
<A NAME="316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=134><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;what she did&#8221; are not in the text but are implicit from the context and are supplied in the translation for clarification.</p>

The MT reads &#8220;I saw&#8221; which may be a case of attraction to the verb at the beginning of the previous verse.</p>
<A NAME="318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=136><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;because she committed adultery.&#8221; The translation is intended to spell out the significance of the metaphor.</p>

<A NAME="325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=143><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Wayward Israel has proven herself to be more righteous than unfaithful Judah.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> A comparison is drawn here between the greater culpability of Judah, who has had the advantage of seeing how God disciplined her sister nation for having sinned and yet ignored the warning and committed the same sin, and the culpability of Israel who had no such advantage.</p>
<A NAME="326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=144><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Go and proclaim these words to the north.&#8221; The translation assumes that the message is directed toward the exiles of northern Israel who have been scattered in the provinces of Assyria to the north.</p>
<A NAME="327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=145><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will not cause my face to fall on you.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=147><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;You must confess&#8221; are repeated to convey the connection. The Hebrew text has an introductory &#8220;that&#8221; in front of the second line and a coordinative &#8220;and&#8221; in front of the next two lines.</p>

While the proposal makes sense, it remains a conjectural emendation since it is not supported by any actual manuscripts or ancient versions.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;scattered your ways with foreign [gods]&#8221; or &#8220;spread out your breasts to strangers.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=149><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I am your true husband.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> There is a wordplay between the term &#8220;true master&#8221; and the name of the pagan god Baal. The pronoun &#8220;I&#8221; is emphatic, creating a contrast between the <sc>Lord as Israel&#8217;s true master/husband versus Baal as Israel&#8217;s illegitimate lover/master. See 2:23-25.</p>
<A NAME="332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=150><b>tn</b> The words, &#8220;If you do&#8221; are not in the text but are implicit in the connection of the Hebrew verb with the preceding.</p>

<A NAME="337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=155><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the ark of the covenant.&#8221; It is called this because it contained the tables of the law which in abbreviated form constituted their covenant obligations to the <sc>Lord, cf. Exod 31:18; 32:15; 34:29.</p>
<A NAME="338"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=156><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Nor will another one be made&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;one will not do/make [it?] again.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="346"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=164><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;How I would place you among the sons.&#8221; Israel appears to be addressed here contextually as the <sc>Lord&#8217;s wife (see the next verse). The pronouns of address in the first two lines are second feminine singular as are the readings of the two verbs preferred by the Masoretes (the <i>Qere</i> readings) in the third and fourth lines. The verbs that are written in the text in the third and fourth lines (the <i>Kethib</i> readings) are second masculine plural as is the verb describing Israel&#8217;s treachery in the next verse.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The imagery here appears to be that of treating the wife as an equal heir with the sons and of giving her the best piece of property.</p>
<A NAME="347"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=165><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;What a joy it would be for me to&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text but are implied in the parallel structure.</p>
<A NAME="348"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=166><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the most beautiful heritage among the nations.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="350"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=168><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;turn back from [following] after me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="351"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=169><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;house of Israel.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="352"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=170><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a wife unfaithful from her husband.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="353"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=171><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;A sound is heard on the hilltops, the weeping of the supplication of the children of Israel because [or indeed] they have perverted their way.&#8221; At issue here is whether the supplication is made to Yahweh in repentance because of what they have done or whether it is supplication to the pagan gods which is evidence of their perverted ways. The reference in this verse to the hilltops where idolatry was practiced according to 3:2 and the reference to Israel&#8217;s unfaithfulness in the preceding verse make the latter more likely. For the asseverative use of the Hebrew particle (here rendered &#8220;indeed&#8221;) where the particle retains some of the explicative nuance; cf. BDB 472-73 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 1.e and 3.c.</p>
<A NAME="354"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=172><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;have forgotten the <sc>Lord their God,&#8221; but in the view of the parallelism and the context, the word &#8220;forget&#8221; (like &#8220;know&#8221; and &#8220;remember&#8221;) involves more than mere intellectual activity.</p>
<A NAME="355"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=173><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I will forgive your apostasies.&#8221; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will [or want to] heal your apostasies.&#8221; For the use of the verb &#8220;heal&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1508;&#1464;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">rafa</font>&#8217;) to refer to spiritual healing and forgiveness see Hos 14:4.</p>
<A NAME="356"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=174><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;They say.&#8221; There is an obvious ellipsis of a verb of saying here since the preceding words are those of the <sc>Lord and the following are those of the people. However, there is debate about whether these are the response of the people to the <sc>Lord&#8217;s invitation, a response which is said to be inadequate according to the continuation in 4:1-4, or whether these are the <sc>Lord&#8217;s model for Israel&#8217;s confession of repentance to which he adds further instructions about the proper heart attitude that should accompany it in 4:1-4. The former implies a dialogue with an unmarked twofold shift in speaker between 3:22b-25 and 4:1-4:4 while the latter assumes the same main speaker throughout with an unmarked instruction only in 3:22b-25. This disrupts the flow of the passage less and appears more likely.</p>
<A NAME="357"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=175><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Truly in vain from the hills the noise/commotion [and from] the mountains.&#8221; The syntax of the Hebrew sentence is very elliptical here.</p>
<A NAME="358"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=176><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Truly in the <sc>Lord our God is deliverance for Israel.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="359"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=177><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;From our youth the shameful thing has eaten up&#8230;&#8221; The shameful thing is specifically identified as Baal in Jer 11:13. Compare also the shift in certain names such as Ishbaal (&#8220;man of Baal&#8221;) to Ishbosheth (&#8220;man of shame&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="360"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=178><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fathers&#8221; (also in v. 25).</p>
