<A NAME="391"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2232><b>sn</b> 2 Kgs 25:1 and Jer 52:4 give the more precise date of the tenth day of the tenth month of the ninth year which would have been Jan 15, 588 <sc>b.c. The reckoning is based on the calendar that begins the year in the spring (Nisan = March/April).</p>
<A NAME="392"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2233><b>sn</b> According to modern reckoning that would have been July 18, 586 <sc>b.c. The siege thus lasted almost a full eighteen months.</p>
<A NAME="393"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2234><b>tn</b> English versions and commentaries differ on the number of officials named here and the exact spelling of their names. For a good discussion of the options see F. B. Huey, <i>Jeremiah, Lamentations </i>(NAC), 341, n. 71. Most commentaries follow the general lead of J. Bright (<i>Jeremiah </i>[AB], 243) as the present translation has done here. However, the second name is not emended on the basis of v. 13 as Bright does, nor is the second Nergal-Sharezer regarded as the same man as the first and the information on the two combined as he does. The first Nergal-Sharezer is generally identified on the basis of Babylonian records as the man who usurped the throne from Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s son, Awel-Marduk or Evil-Merodach as he is known in the OT (Jer 52:31; 2 Kgs 25:27). The present translation renders the two technical Babylonian terms &#8220;Rab-Saris&#8221; (only in Jer 39:3, 13; 2 Kgs 18:17) and &#8220;Rab-Mag&#8221; (only in Jer 39:3, 13) as &#8220;chief officer&#8221; and &#8220;high official&#8221; without knowing precisely what offices they held. This has been done to give the modern reader some feeling of their high position without specifying exactly what their precise positions were (i.e., the generic has been used for the [unknown] specific).</p>
<A NAME="394"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2235><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sat.&#8221; The precise meaning of this phrase is not altogether clear, but J. Bright (<i>Jeremiah </i>[AB], 243) is undoubtedly correct in assuming that it had to do with setting up a provisional military government over the city.</p>
<A NAME="395"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2236><b>tn</b> The Hebrew style here is typically full or redundant, giving a general subject first and then listing the specifics. The Hebrew<i> </i>text reads: &#8220;Then all the officers of the king of Babylon came and sat in the Middle Gate, Nergal-Sharezer&#8230;and all the rest of the officers of the king of Babylon.&#8221; In the translation the general subject has been eliminated and the list of the &#8220;real&#8221; subjects used instead; this eliminates the dashes or commas typical of some modern English versions.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The identification of the location of the <i>Middle Gate</i> is uncertain since it is mentioned nowhere else in the OT.</p>
<A NAME="396"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2237><b>sn</b> The <i>king&#8217;s garden</i> is mentioned again in Neh 3:15 in conjunction with the pool of Siloam and the stairs that go down from the city of David. This would have been in the southern part of the city near the Tyropean Valley which agrees with the reference to the &#8220;two walls&#8221; which were probably the walls on the eastern and western hills.</p>
<A NAME="397"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2238><b>sn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;toward the Arabah.&#8221; The Arabah was the rift valley north and south of the Dead Sea. Here the intention was undoubtedly to escape across the Jordan to Moab or Ammon. It appears from 40:14; 41:15 that the Ammonites were known to harbor fugitives from the Babylonians.</p>
<A NAME="398"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2239><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The Chaldeans.&#8221; See the study note on 21:4 for explanation.</p>
<A NAME="399"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2240><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B2; Map6-E1; Map7-E1; Map8-E3; Map10-A2; Map11-A1.</p>
<A NAME="3910"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2241><b>sn</b> 2 Kgs 25:5 and Jer 52:8 mention that the soldiers all scattered from him. That is why the text focuses on Zedekiah here.</p>
<A NAME="3911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2242><b>sn</b> <i>Riblah</i> was a strategic town on the Orontes River in Syria. It was at a crossing of the major roads between Egypt and Mesopotamia. Pharaoh Necho had earlier received Jehoahaz there and put him in chains (2 Kgs 23:33) prior to taking him captive to Egypt. Nebuchadnezzar had set up his base camp for conducting his campaigns against the Palestinian states there and was now sitting in judgment on prisoners brought to him.</p>
<A NAME="3912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2243><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fetters of bronze.&#8221; The more generic &#8220;chains&#8221; is used in the translation because &#8220;fetters&#8221; is a word unfamiliar to most modern readers.</p>
<A NAME="3913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2244><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Chaldean.&#8221; See the study note on 21:4 for explanation.</p>
<A NAME="3914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2245><b>tc</b> The reading here is based on an emendation following the parallels in Jer 52:13 and 2 Kgs 25:9. The Hebrew text here does not have &#8220;the temple of the <sc>Lord&#8221; and reads merely &#8220;house of the people.&#8221; The text here is probably corrupt. It reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et-bet ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">am</font>, &#8220;and the house of the people&#8221;), which many explain as a collective use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bayit</font>). However, no parallels are cited by any of the commentaries, grammars, or lexicons for such a use. It is more likely that the words <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492; &#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿhvah vÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et-bate</font>) have fallen out of the text due to similar beginnings. The words <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et-bet yhwh</font>) are found in the parallel texts cited in the marginal note. The Greek version is no help here because vv. 4-13 are omitted, probably due to the similarities in ending of vv. 3, 13 (i.e., homoioteleuton of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456; &#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1462;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">melekh bavel</font>).</p>
<A NAME="3915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2246><b>sn</b> According to the parallels in 2 Kgs 25:8-9; Jer 52:12-13 this occurred almost a month after the wall was breached and Zedekiah&#8217;s failed escape. It took place under the direction of Nebuzaradan, the captain of the king&#8217;s special guard who is mentioned in the next verse.</p>
<A NAME="3916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2247><b>tn</b> For the meaning of this phrase see BDB 371 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;</font> 2 and compare the usage in Gen 39:1.</p>
<A NAME="3917"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2248><b>tc</b> The translation is based on an emendation of the text which leaves out &#8220;the rest of the people who were left&#8221; as a double writing of the same phrase at the beginning of the verse. Some commentators emend the phrase &#8220;the rest of the people who were left&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1514; &#1497;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512; &#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hannish</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arim vÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et yeter ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">am</font>) to read &#8220;the rest of the craftsmen who were left&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1514; &#1497;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512; &#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503; &#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">vÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et yeter ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amon hannish</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arim</font>) on the basis of the parallel in Jer 52:15 (which does not have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hannish</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arim</font>). However, it is easier to explain the phrase as a dittography of the phrase at the beginning (which is exactly the same except <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font> [<font face="Scholar">ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ir</font>] follows it). The text is redundant because it refers twice to the same group of people. The Hebrew text reads: &#8220;And the rest of the people who were left in the city and the deserters who had deserted to him and the rest of the people Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, carried into exile to Babylon.&#8221; The text has also been divided up to create two shorter sentences to better conform with contemporary English style.</p>
<A NAME="3918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2249><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Nebuzaradan, the captain of the royal guard.&#8221; However, the subject is clear from the preceding and contemporary English style would normally avoid repeating the proper name and title.</p>
<A NAME="3919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2250><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon commanded concerning Jeremiah by the hand of Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, saying.&#8221; Since Nebuchadnezzar is at Riblah (v. 6) and Nebuzaradan and the other officers named in the next verse are at Jerusalem, the <i>vav</i> consecutive imperfect should again be translated as a pluperfect (see 38:2 and the translator&#8217;s notes there for explanation). For the meaning of &#8220;through&#8221; or &#8220;through the agency of&#8221; for the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1497;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿyad</font>) see BDB 391 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;</font> 5.d. The sentence has been broken up to better conform with contemporary English style.</p>
<A NAME="3920"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2251><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Get [or fetch] him.&#8221; The referent is supplied for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3921"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2252><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;take care of him&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;set your eyes on him.&#8221; For the meaning of this idiom see BDB 963 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> 2.c and compare 24:6 where the phrase &#8220;for good&#8221; is added.</p>
<A NAME="3922"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2253><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Don&#8217;t do anything evil [= harmful] to him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2254><b>tn</b> See the translator&#8217;s notes on 39:3, 9 for the names and titles here.</p>
<A NAME="3924"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2255><b>sn</b> <i>Gedaliah</i>. This is the first reference to this individual whom Nebuchadnezzar appointed governor over the people who were left to live in Judah (cf. 40:5; 2 Kgs 25:22). His father was the man who spoke up for Jeremiah when he was accused of being a false prophet by some of the priests and prophets (26:24). His grandfather was the royal secretary under Josiah who brought the discovery of the book of the law to Josiah&#8217;s attention, read it to him, and was involved in helping Josiah institute his reforms (2 Kgs 22:8-10).</p>
<A NAME="3925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2256><b>tn</b> The meaning of the last phrase is uncertain. An alternate translation is &#8220;to take him home with him.&#8221; The text reads literally &#8220;to bring him into the house.&#8221; However, it is unclear whether &#8220;the house&#8221; refers to Jeremiah&#8217;s house or to Gedaliah&#8217;s. The fact that Nebuzaradan later offers Jeremiah the option of going back to Gedaliah (40:5) suggests that the house is here Gedaliah&#8217;s where Jeremiah would be looked out for in accord with Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s command (v. 12).</p>
<A NAME="3926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2257><b>tn</b> Many translate this last clause as a conclusion or summary remark, &#8220;So Jeremiah stayed&#8230;&#8221; However, it is better to translate it as an adversative because it probably refers to the fact that rather than staying with Gedaliah in the governor&#8217;s residence Jeremiah stayed among the people. That is how he wound up being led off as a prisoner to Ramah. See further the study note on 40:1. According to <i>IBHS</i> 550 §33.2.1d the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive can have either of these values (see examples 11 and 12 for the adversative or contrastive nuance).</p>
<A NAME="3927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2258><b>sn</b> <i>Jer 39:15-18. </i>This incident is out of chronological order (see Jer 38:7-13). It is placed here either due to a desire not to interrupt the sequential ordering of events centering on Jeremiah&#8217;s imprisonment and his release (38:14&#8211;39:14) or to contrast God&#8217;s care and concern for the faithful (Ebed-Melech who, though a foreigner, trusted in God) with his harsh treatment of the faithless (Zedekiah who, though informed of God&#8217;s will, was too weak-willed in the face of opposition by his courtiers to carry it out).</p>
<A NAME="3928"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2259><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Now the word of the <sc>Lord came to Jeremiah while he&#8230;saying.&#8221; The form of this clause is disjunctive showing that it does not follow the preceding events in either chronological or logical sequence. For a discussion of the form and function of such disjunctive clauses see <i>IBHS</i> 650-52 §39.2.3. This example most closely fits the description and function of example 12, Ruth 4:18, 21-22 on p. 652.</p>
<A NAME="3929"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2260><b>sn</b> Even though Jeremiah was confined to the courtyard of the guardhouse, he was still free to entertain visitors (32:2, 8). Moreover, Ebed-Melech was an official attached to the royal court and would have had access to the courtyard of the guardhouse (38:7, 13). Jeremiah would not have had to leave the courtyard of the guardhouse to &#8220;go and tell&#8221; him something.</p>
<A NAME="3930"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2261><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Behold, I will bring to pass my words against this city for evil/disaster and not for good/good fortune.&#8221; For the form of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;</font> ([<font face="Scholar">mevi</font>] <i>Kethib</i>, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;</font> [<font face="Scholar">mevi</font>&#8217;] <i>Qere</i>) see GKC 206-7 §74.<i>k</i>, where the same form is noted for the <i>Kethib</i> in 2 Sam 5:2; 1 Kgs 21:21; Jer 19:15 all of which occur before a word beginning with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>. For the nuance &#8220;carry out&#8221; (or &#8220;bring to pass&#8221;) see BDB 99 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;</font> Hiph.2.b.</p>
<A NAME="3931"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2262><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And they [= my words for disaster] will come to pass [= happen] before you on that day [i.e., the day that I bring them to pass/carry them out].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3932"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2263><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;But I will rescue you on that day&#8221; (referring to the same day mentioned in the preceding verse).</p>
<A NAME="3933"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2264><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Oracle of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3934"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2265><b>sn</b> Some commentators see this as a reference to the princes from whose clutches Ebed-Melech delivered Jeremiah (38:7-13). However, it is clear that in this context it refers to those that he would fear when the <sc>Lord brings about the threatened disaster, i.e., the Babylonians who are attacking the city.</p>
<A NAME="3935"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2266><b>sn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you will not fall by the sword.&#8221; In the context this would include death in battle and execution as a prisoner of war.</p>
<A NAME="3936"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2267><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your life will be to you for spoil.&#8221; For the meaning of this idiom see the study note on 21:9 and compare the usage in 21:9; 38:2; 45:4.</p>
<A NAME="3937"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2268><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Oracle of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
