<A NAME="381"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2170><b>tn</b> The name is spelled &#8220;Jucal&#8221; in the Hebrew text here rather than &#8220;Jehucal&#8221; as in Jer 37:3. The translation uses the same spelling throughout so that the English reader can identify these as the same individual.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Jehucal</i> was a member of the delegation sent to Jeremiah by Zedekiah in Jer 37:3.</p>
<A NAME="382"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2171><b>sn</b> <i>Pashhur</i> was a member of the delegation sent to Jeremiah in 21:2. For the relative sequence of these two delegations see the study note on 21:1.</p>
<A NAME="383"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2172><b>tn</b> J. Bright (<i>Jeremiah </i>[AB], 226, 30) is probably correct in translating the verbs here as pluperfects and in explaining that these words are prophecies that Jeremiah uttered before his arrest not prophecies that were being delivered to the people through intermediaries sent by Jeremiah who was confined in the courtyard of the guardhouse. For the use of the <i>vav</i> consecutive + imperfect to denote the pluperfect see the discussion and examples in <i>IBHS</i> 552-53 §33.2.3a and see the usage in Exod 4:19. The words that are cited in v. 2 are those recorded in 21:9 on the occasion of the first delegation and those in v. 3 are those recorded in 21:10; 34:2; 37:8; 32:28 all except the last delivered before Jeremiah was confined in the courtyard of the guardhouse.</p>

<A NAME="386"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2175><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his life will be to him for spoil and he will live.&#8221; For the meaning of this idiom see the study note on 21:9. The words and &#8220;he will live&#8221; have been left out of the translation because they are redundant after &#8220;will live&#8221; and &#8220;they will escape with their lives.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> See Jer 21:9 for this prophecy.</p>
<A NAME="387"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2176><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;They had also heard him say,&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text. They are supplied in the translation for clarity so as to avoid any possible confusion that might be created by saying merely &#8220;And the <sc>Lord says,&#8221; without any introduction.</p>
<A NAME="388"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2177><b>sn</b> See Jer 21:10; 32:28; 34:2; 37:8 for this same prophecy. Jeremiah had repeatedly said this or words to the same effect.</p>

To render &#8220;For&#8221; might be misunderstood as a grounds for the preceding statement. To render &#8220;And&#8221; or &#8220;Moreover&#8221; sounds a little odd here. If it must be represented, &#8220;Moreover&#8221; is perhaps the best rendering.</p>

Compare the common paraphrasis of &#8220;your servant&#8221; for &#8220;I&#8221; in Hebrew (cf. BDB 714 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1491;</font> 6 and usage in 1 Sam 20:7, 8) and compare the usage in Pss 63:11 (63:12 HT); 61:6 (61:7 HT) where the king is praying for himself.

<A NAME="3816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2185><b>sn</b> A <i>cistern</i> was a pear-shaped pit with a narrow opening. Cisterns were cut or dug in the limestone rock and lined with plaster to prevent seepage. They were used to collect and store rain water or water carried up from a spring.</p>
<A NAME="3817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2186><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the son of the king.&#8221; See the translator&#8217;s note on Jer 36:26 for the rendering here.</p>

<A NAME="3819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2188><b>sn</b> This individual, <i>Ebed Melech</i>, is mentioned only here. Later he will be promised deliverance from destruction when the city falls because he had shown trust in God (see Jer 39:16-18).</p>
<A NAME="3820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2189><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Ebed Melech, the Cushite, a man, an eunuch/official, and he was [= who was; a circumstantial clause] in the house of the king, heard that they had put Jeremiah&#8230;&#8221; The passive construction &#8220;Jeremiah had been put&#8221; has been used to avoid the indefinite subject &#8220;they&#8221; or the addition of &#8220;the officials.&#8221; For the translation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1505;</font> (<font face="Scholar">saris</font>) as &#8220;official&#8221; here rather than &#8220;eunuch&#8221; see the translator&#8217;s note on 29:2 and see also the usage in 34:19. For the translation of &#8220;Cushite&#8221; as Ethiopian see the study note on 13:23.</p>
<A NAME="3821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2190><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And the king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate.&#8221; This clause is circumstantial to the following clause; thus &#8220;while the king was&#8230;&#8221; Most commentators agree that the reference to sitting in the gate here likely refers to the same kind of judicial context that has been posited for 26:10 (see the translator&#8217;s note there for further references). Hence the translation uses &#8220;sitting&#8221; with the more technical &#8220;holding court&#8221; to better reflect the probable situation.</p>
<A NAME="3822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2191><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Those men have made evil all they have done to the prophet Jeremiah in that they have thrown him into the cistern and he will die of starvation in the place where he is because there is no more food in the city.&#8221; The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et</font>) before &#8220;they have thrown&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1514; &#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512; &#1492;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">et </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asher hishlikhu</font>) is explanatory or further definition of &#8220;all they have done to&#8221; (i.e., the particle is repeated for apposition). The verb form &#8220;and he is sure to die&#8221; is an unusual use of the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive + imperfect that the grammars see as giving a logical consequence without a past nuance (cf. GKC 328 §111.<i>l</i> and <i>IBHS</i> 557-58 §33.3.1f).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> &#8220;Because there isn&#8217;t any food left in the city&#8221; is rhetorical exaggeration; the food did not run out until just before the city fell. Perhaps the intent is to refer to the fact that there was no food in the city for people so confined (i.e., in solitary confinement).</p>
<A NAME="3823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2192><b>tc</b> Some modern English versions (e.g., NRSV, REB, TEV) and commentaries read &#8220;three&#8221; on the basis that thirty men would not be necessary for the task (cf. J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah </i>[AB], 231). Though the difference in &#8220;three&#8221; and &#8220;thirty&#8221; involves minimal emendation (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">shÿlosha</font>] for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> [<font face="Scholar">shÿloshim</font>]) there is no textual or versional evidence for it except for one Hebrew <sc>ms. Perhaps the number was large to prevent the officials from hindering Ebed Melech from accomplishing the task.</p>
<A NAME="3824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2193><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;went into the palace in under the treasury.&#8221; Several of the commentaries (e.g., J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah </i>[AB], 227; J. A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah </i>[NICOT], 639, n. 6) emend the prepositional phrase &#8220;in under&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">el-takhat</font>) to the noun &#8220;wardrobe&#8221; plus the preposition &#8220;to&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1462;&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">el-meltakhat</font>). This is a plausible emendation which would involve dropping out <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mel</font>) due to its similarity with the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>) which precedes it. However, there is no textual or versional evidence for such a reading and the compound preposition is not in itself objectionable (cf. BDB 1066 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;</font> III.1.a). The Greek version reads &#8220;the part underground&#8221; (representing a Hebrew <i>Vorlage</i> of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500; &#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514; &#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">el takhat ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arets</font>) in place of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500; &#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514; &#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1510;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el takhat ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">otsar</font>). The translation follows the Hebrew text but adds the word &#8220;room&#8221; for the sake of English style.</p>
<A NAME="3825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2194><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;worn-out clothes and worn-out rags.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="3828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2197><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Jeremiah did so.&#8221; The alternate translation is what the text reads literally.</p>

<A NAME="3830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2199><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;Some time later&#8221; are not in the text but are a way of translating the conjunction &#8220;And&#8221; or &#8220;Then&#8221; that introduces this narrative.</p>
<A NAME="3831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2200><b>sn</b> The precise location of this entrance is unknown since it is mentioned nowhere else in the OT. Many commentators equate this with the &#8220;king&#8217;s outer entry&#8221; (mentioned in 2 Kgs 16:18) which appears to have been a private entryway between the temple and the palace.</p>
<A NAME="3832"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2201><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;when you answer&#8221; are not in the text but are implicit in the connection. They are supplied in the translation for the sake of clarity and smoothness of style.</p>
<A NAME="3833"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2202><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;you will most certainly kill me, won&#8217;t you?&#8221; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Will you not certainly kill me?&#8221; The question is rhetorical and expects a positive answer. In situations like this BDB s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;</font> 4.b(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#946;</font>) says that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1458;&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">halo</font>&#8217;) &#8220;has a tendency to become little more than an affirmative particle, declaring with some rhetorical emphasis what is, or might be, well known.&#8221; The idea of certainty is emphasized here by the addition of the infinitive absolute before the finite verb (Joüon 2:422 §123.e).</p>
<A NAME="3834"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2203><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;So King Zedekiah secretly swore an oath to Jeremiah, saying.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="3838"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2207><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Your life/soul will live.&#8221; The quote is a long condition-consequence sentence with compound consequential clauses.

The infinitive absolute in the condition emphasizes the one condition, i.e., going out or surrendering (cf. Joüon 2:423 §123.g, and compare usage in Exod 15:26). For the idiom &#8220;go out to&#8221; = &#8220;surrender to&#8221; see the full idiom in 21:9 &#8220;go out and fall over to&#8221; which is condensed in 38:2 to &#8220;go out to.&#8221; The expression here is the same as in 38:2.</p>

Your feet are sunk in the mud. They turned backward.&#8221; The term &#8220;men of your friendship&#8221; (cf. BDB 1023 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> 5.a) is used to refer to Jeremiah&#8217;s &#8220;so-called friends&#8221; in 20:10, to the trusted friend who deserted the psalmist in Ps 41:10, and to the allies of Edom in Obad 7. According to most commentators it refers here to the false prophets and counselors who urged the king to rebel against Nebuchadnezzar. The verb translated &#8220;misled&#8221; is a verb that often refers to inciting or instigating someone to do something, often with negative connotations (so BDB 694 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</font> Hiph.2). It is generally translated &#8220;deceive&#8221; or &#8220;mislead&#8221; in 2 Kgs 18:32; 2 Chr 32:11, 15. Here it refers to the fact that his pro-Egyptian counselors induced him to rebel.

The phrase &#8220;your feet are sunk in the mud&#8221; is figurative for being entangled in great difficulties (so BDB 371 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1506;</font> Hoph and compare the usage in the highly figurative description of trouble in Ps 69:2 [69:3 HT]).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The taunt song here refers to the fact that Zedekiah had been incited into rebellion by pro-Egyptian nobles in his court who prevailed on him to seek aid from the new Egyptian Pharaoh in 589 <sc>b.c. and withhold tribute from Nebuchadnezzar. This led to the downfall of the city which is depicted in Jeremiah&#8217;s vision from the standpoint of its effects on the king himself and his family.</p>

Do not hide from us and we will not kill you [so that we will not kill you] and [tell us] what the king said to you,&#8217; then tell them.&#8221; The sentence has been broken up to better conform with contemporary English style.</p>

He was returned to the courtyard of the guardhouse (cf. v. 13) after the conversation with the king where the officials came to question him (v. 27).

<A NAME="3862"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=2231><b>tc</b> The precise meaning of this line and its relation to the context are somewhat uncertain. This line is missing from the Greek and Syriac versions and from a few Hebrew <sc>mss. Some English versions and commentaries omit it as a double writing of the final words of the preceding line (see, e.g., REB; W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah </i>[Hermeneia], 2:268). Others see it as misplaced from the beginning of 39:3 (see, e.g., NRSV, TEV, J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah </i>[AB], 245). The clause probably does belong syntactically with 39:3 (i.e., <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;</font> [<font face="Scholar">ka</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asher</font>] introduces a temporal clause which is resumed by the <i>vav</i> consecutive on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyavo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">u</font>; see BDB 455 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;</font> 3), but it should not be moved there because there is no textual evidence for doing so. The intervening verses are to be interpreted as parenthetical, giving the background for the events that follow (see, e.g., the translation in D. Barthélemy, ed., <i>Preliminary and Interim Report on the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project</i>, 4:280). The chapter is not so much concerned with describing how Jerusalem fell as it is with contrasting the fate of Zedekiah who disregarded the word of the <sc>Lord with the fate of Jeremiah and that of Jeremiah&#8217;s benefactor Ebed Melech. The best way to treat the line without actually moving it before 39:3a is to treat it as a heading as has been done here.</p>
