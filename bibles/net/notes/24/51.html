<A NAME="511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2796><b>sn</b> The <i>destructive wind</i> is a figurative reference to the &#8220;foreign people&#8221; who will &#8220;winnow&#8221; Babylon and drive out all the people (v. 2). This figure has already been used in 4:11-12 and in 49:36. See the study note on 4:11-12 and the translator&#8217;s notes on 22:22 and 49:36.</p>
<A NAME="512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2797><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I will arouse the spirit of hostility of a destroying nation&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will stir up against Babylon&#8230;a destroying wind [or the spirit of a destroyer].&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ruakh</font>) can refer to either a wind (BDB 924 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> 2.a) or a spirit (BDB 925 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> 2.g). It can be construed as either a noun followed by an adjectival participle (so, &#8220;a destroying wind&#8221;) or a noun followed by another noun in the &#8220;of&#8221; relationship (a construct or genitival relationship; so, &#8220;spirit of a destroyer&#8221;). The same noun with this same verb is translated &#8220;stir up the spirit of&#8221; in 1 Chr 5:26; 2 Chr 21:16; 36:22; Hag 1:14; and most importantly in Jer 51:11 where it refers to the king of the Medes. However, the majority of the exegetical tradition (all the commentaries consulted and all the English versions except NASB and NIV) opt for the &#8220;destructive wind&#8221; primarily because of the figure of winnowing that is found in the next verse. The translation follows the main line exegetical tradition here for that same reason.</p>
<A NAME="513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2798><b>sn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the people who live in Leb-qamai.&#8221; &#8220;Leb-qamai&#8221; is a code name for &#8220;Chaldeans&#8221; formed on the principle of substituting the last letter of the alphabet for the first, the next to the last for the second, and so on. This same principle is used in referring to Babylon in 25:26 and 51:41 as &#8220;Sheshach.&#8221; See the study note on 25:26 where further details are given. There is no consensus on why the code name is used because the terms Babylon and Chaldeans (= Babylonians) have appeared regularly in this prophecy or collection of prophecies.</p>
<A NAME="514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2799><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I will send foreign people against Babylonia.&#8221; The translation follows the reading of the Greek recensions of Aquila and Symmachus and the Latin version (the Vulgate). That reading is accepted by the majority of modern commentaries and several of the modern versions (e.g., NRSV, REB, NAB, and God&#8217;s Word). It fits better with the verb that follows it than the reading of the Hebrew text and the rest of the versions. The difference in the two readings is again only the difference in vocalization, the Hebrew text reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<i>zarim</i>) and the versions cited reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1465;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<i>zorim</i>). If the Hebrew text is followed, there is a wordplay between the two words, &#8220;foreigners&#8221; and &#8220;winnow.&#8221; The words &#8220;like a wind blowing away chaff&#8221; have been supplied in the translation to clarify for the reader what &#8220;winnow&#8221; means.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Winnowing involved throwing a mixture of grain and chaff (or straw) into the air and letting the wind blow away the lighter chaff, leaving the grain to fall on the ground. Since God considered all the Babylonians chaff, they would all be &#8220;blown away.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2800><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;They will strip her land bare like a wind blowing away chaff.&#8221; The alternate translation would be necessary if one were to adopt the alternate reading of the first line (the reading of the Hebrew text). The explanation of &#8220;winnow&#8221; would then be necessary in the second line. The verb translated &#8220;strip&#8230;bare&#8221; means literally &#8220;to empty out&#8221; (see BDB 132 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1511;</font> Polel). It has been used in 19:7 in the Qal of &#8220;making void&#8221; Judah&#8217;s plans in a wordplay on the word for &#8220;bottle.&#8221; See the study note on 19:7 for further details.</p>
<A NAME="516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2801><b>tn</b> This assumes that the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) is temporal (cf. BDB 473 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 2.a). This is the interpretation adopted also by NRSV and G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, T. G. Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52 </i>(WBC),<i> </i>349. J. Bright (<i>Jeremiah </i>[AB], 345) and J. A. Thompson (<i>Jeremiah </i>[NICOT], 747, n. 3) interpret it as asseverative or emphatic, &#8220;Truly, indeed.&#8221; Many of the modern English versions merely ignore it. Reading it as temporal makes it unnecessary to emend the following verb as Bright and Thompson do (from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;</font> [<font face="Scholar">hayu</font>] to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;</font> [<font face="Scholar">yihyu</font>]).</p>
<A NAME="517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2802><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the day of disaster.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2803><b>tc</b> The text and consequent meaning of these first two lines are uncertain. Literally the Masoretic reads &#8220;against let him string let him string the one who strings his bow and against let him raise himself up in his coat of armor.&#8221; This makes absolutely no sense and the ancient versions and Hebrew <sc>mss did not agree in reading this same text. Many Hebrew <sc>mss and all the versions as well as the Masoretes themselves (the text is left unpointed with a marginal note not to read it) delete the second &#8220;let him string.&#8221; The LXX (or Greek version) left out the words &#8220;against&#8221; at the beginning of the first two lines. It reads &#8220;Let the archer bend his bow and let the one who has armor put it on.&#8221; The Lucianic recension of the LXX and some Targum <sc>mss supplied the missing object &#8220;it&#8221; and thus read &#8220;Let the archer ready his bow against it and let him array himself against it in his coat of mail.&#8221; This makes good sense but does not answer the question of why the Hebrew text left off the suffix on the preposition twice in a row. Many Hebrew <sc>mss and the Syriac, Targum, and Vulgate (the Latin version) change the pointing of &#8220;against&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>]) to &#8220;not&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;</font><i> </i>[&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>]) and thus read &#8220;Let the archer not string the bow and let him not array himself in his armor.&#8221; However, many commentators feel that this does not fit the context because it would apparently be addressed to the Babylonians, not the enemy, which would create a sudden shift in addressee with the second half of the verse. However, if it is understood in the sense taken here it refers to the enemy not allowing the Babylonian archers to get ready for the battle, i.e., a surprise attack. This sense is suggested as an alternative in J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah </i>(AB), 346, n. u-u, and J. A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah </i>(NICOT), 747, n. 5, and is the interpretation adopted in TEV and probably also in NIrV.</p>
<A NAME="519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2804><b>sn</b> For the concept underlying this word see the study note on &#8220;utterly destroy&#8221; in Jer 25:9 and compare the usage in 50:21, 26.</p>
<A NAME="5110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2805><b>tn</b> The majority of English versions and the commentaries understand the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive + perfect as a future here &#8220;They will fall.&#8221; However, it makes better sense in the light of the commands in the previous verse to understand this as an indirect third person command (= a jussive; see GKC 333 §112.<i>q</i>, <i>r</i>) as REB and NJPS do.</p>
<A NAME="5111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2806><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the land of the Chaldeans.&#8221; See the study note on 21:4 for explanation.</p>
<A NAME="5112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2807><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;cities&#8221; is not in the text. The text merely says &#8220;in her streets&#8221; but the antecedent is &#8220;land&#8221; and must then refer to the streets of the cities in the land.</p>
<A NAME="5113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2808><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;widowed&#8221; (cf. BDB 48 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1503;</font>, an adjective occurring only here but related to the common word for &#8220;widow&#8221;). It is commonly translated as has been done here.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The verses from v. 5 to v. 19 all speak of the <sc>Lord in the third person. The prophet who is the spokesman for the <sc>Lord (50:1) thus is speaking. However, the message is still from God because this was all what he spoke &#8220;through the prophet Jeremiah.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="5114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2809><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Yahweh of armies.&#8221; For an explanation of this rendering see the study note on 2:19.</p>
<A NAME="5115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2810><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;all, though their land was&#8230;&#8221; The majority of the modern English versions understand the land here to refer to the land of Israel and Judah (the text reads &#8220;their land&#8221; and Israel and Judah are the nearest antecedents). In this case the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) is concessive (cf. BDB 473 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 2.c[b]). Many of the modern commentaries understand the referent to be the land of the Chaldeans/Babylonians. However, most of them feel that the line is connected as a causal statement to 51:2-4 and see the line as either textually or logically out of place. However, it need not be viewed as logically out of place. It is parallel to the preceding and gives a second reason why they are to be destroyed. It also forms an excellent transition to the next lines where the exiles and other foreigners are urged to flee and not get caught up in the destruction which is coming &#8220;because of her sin.&#8221; It might be helpful to note that both the adjective &#8220;widowed&#8221; and the suffix on &#8220;their God&#8221; are masculine singular, looking at Israel and Judah as one entity. The &#8220;their&#8221; then goes back not to Israel and Judah of the preceding lines but to the &#8220;them&#8221; in v. 4. This makes for a better connection with the following and understands the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> in its dominant usage not an extremely rare one (see the comment in BDB 473 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 2.c[b]). This interpretation is also reflected in RSV.</p>
<A NAME="5116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2811><b>sn</b> See the note on the phrase &#8220;the Holy One of Israel&#8221; in 50:29.</p>
<A NAME="5117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2812><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;you foreign people&#8221; are not in the text and many think the referent is the exiles of Judah. While this is clearly the case in v. 45 the referent seems broader here where the context speaks of every man going to his own country (v. 9).</p>
<A NAME="5118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2813><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;her.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2814><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;paying to her a recompense [i.e., a payment in kind].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2815><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;of her wrath&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text but are supplied in the translation to help those readers who are not familiar with the figure of the &#8220;cup of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s wrath.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The figure of the cup of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s wrath invoked in Jer 25:15-29 is invoked again here and Babylon is identified as the agent through which the wrath of the <sc>Lord is visited on the other nations. See the study note on 25:15 for explanation and further references.</p>
<A NAME="5121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2816><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;upon the grounds of such conditions the nations have gone mad.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2817><b>tn</b> The verbs in this verse and the following are all in the Hebrew perfect tense, a tense that often refers to a past action or a past action with present results. However, as the translator&#8217;s notes have indicated, the prophets use this tense to view the actions as if they were as good as done (the Hebrew prophetic perfect). The stance here is ideal, viewed as already accomplished.</p>
<A NAME="5123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2818><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;Foreigners living there will say&#8221; are not in the text but are implicit from the third line. These words are generally assumed by the commentaries and are explicitly added in TEV and NCV which are attempting to clarify the text for the average reader.</p>
<A NAME="5124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2819><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Leave/abandon her.&#8221; However, it is smoother in the English translation to make this verb equivalent to the cohortative that follows. </p>
<A NAME="5125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2820><b>tn</b> This is an admittedly very paraphrastic translation that tries to make the figurative nuance of the Hebrew original understandable for the average reader. The Hebrew text reads: &#8220;For her judgment [or punishment (cf. BDB 1078 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1496;</font> 1.f) = &#8216;execution of judgment&#8217;] touches the heavens, and is lifted up as far as the clouds.&#8221; The figure of hyperbole or exaggeration is being used here to indicate the vastness of Babylon&#8217;s punishment which is the reason to escape (vv. 6, 9c). For this figure see Deut 1:28 in comparison with Num 13:28 and see also Deut 9:1. In both of the passages in Deut it refers to an exaggeration about the height of the walls of fortified cities. The figure also may be a play on Gen 11:4 where the nations gather in Babylon to build a tower that reaches to the skies. The present translation has interpreted the perfects here as prophetic because it has not happened yet or they would not be encouraging one another to leave and escape. For the idea here compare 50:16.</p>
<A NAME="5126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2821><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;The exiles from Judah will say&#8221; are not in the text but are implicit from the words that follow. They are supplied in the translation to clearly identify for the reader the referent of &#8220;us.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2822><b>tn</b> There is some difference of opinion as to the best way to render the Hebrew expression here. Literally it means &#8220;brought forth our righteousnesses.&#8221; BDB 842 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1492;</font> 7.b interprets this of the &#8220;righteous acts&#8221; of the people of Judah and compares the usage in Isa 64:6; Ezek 3:20; 18:24; 33:13. However, Judah&#8217;s acts of righteousness (or more simply, their righteousness) was scarcely revealed in their deliverance. Most of the English versions and commentaries refer to &#8220;vindication&#8221; i.e., that the <sc>Lord has exonerated or proven Israel&#8217;s claims to be true. However, that would require more explanation than the idea of &#8220;deliverance&#8221; which is a perfectly legitimate usage of the term (cf. BDB 842 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1492;</font> 6.a and compare the usage in Isa 46:13; 51:6, 8; 56:1). The present translation interprets the plural form here as a plural of intensity or amplification (GKC 397-98 §124.<i>e</i>) and the suffix as a genitive of advantage (<i>IBHS</i> 147 §9.5.2e). This interpretation is also reflected in REB and God&#8217;s Word.</p>
<A NAME="5128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2823><b>sn</b> The imperatives here and in v. 12 are directed to the soldiers in the armies of the kings from the north (here identified as the kings of Media [see also 50:3, 9; 51:27-28]). They have often been addressed in this prophecy as though they were a present force (see 50:14-16; 50:21 [and the study note there]; 50:26, 29; 51:3) though the passage as a whole is prophetic of the future. This gives some idea of the ideal stance that the prophets adopted when they spoke of the future as though already past (the use of the Hebrew prophetic perfect which has been referred to often in the translator&#8217;s notes).</p>
<A NAME="5129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2824><b>tn</b> The meaning of this word is debated. The most thorough discussion of this word including etymology and usage in the OT and Qumran is in <i>HALOT</i> 1409-10 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1496;</font>, where the rendering &#8220;quiver&#8221; is accepted for all the uses of this word in the OT. For a more readily accessible discussion for English readers see W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah </i>(Hermeneia), 2:422-23. The meaning &#8220;quiver&#8221; fits better with the verb &#8220;fill&#8221; than the meaning &#8220;shield&#8221; which is adopted in BDB 1020 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1496;</font>. &#8220;Quiver&#8221; is the meaning adopted also in NRSV, REB, NAB, and NJPS.</p>
<A NAME="5130"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2825><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The <sc>Lord has stirred up the spirit of&#8230;&#8221; The verb is rendered here as a prophetic perfect. The rendering &#8220;arouse a spirit of hostility&#8221; is an attempt to render some meaning to the phrase and not simply ignore the word &#8220;spirit&#8221; as many of the modern English versions do. For a fuller discussion including cross references see the translator&#8217;s note on v. 1.</p>
<A NAME="5131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2826><b>sn</b> <i>Media</i> was a country in what is now northwestern Iran. At the time this prophecy was probably written they were the dominating force in the northern region, the most likely enemy to Babylon. By the time Babylon fell in 538 <sc>b.c. the Medes had been conquered and incorporated in the Persian empire by Cyrus. However, several times in the Bible this entity is known under the combined entity of Media and Persia (Esth 1:3, 4, 18, 19; 10:2; Dan 5:28; 6:8, 12, 15; 8:20). Dan 5:31 credits the capture of Babylon to Darius the Mede, which may have been another name for Cyrus or the name by which Daniel refers to a Median general named Gobryas.</p>
<A NAME="5132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2827><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;For it is the vengeance of the <sc>Lord, vengeance for his temple.&#8221; As in the parallel passage in 50:28, the genitival construction has been expanded in the translation to clarify for the English reader what the commentaries in general agree is involved.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Verse 11c-f appears to be a parenthetical or editorial comment by Jeremiah to give some background for the attack which is summoned in vv. 11-12.</p>

<A NAME="5137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2832><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;For the <sc>Lord has both planned and done what he said concerning the people living in Babylon,&#8221; i.e., &#8220;he has carried out what he planned.&#8221; Here is an obvious case where the perfects are to be interpreted as prophetic; the commands imply that the attack is still future.</p>
<A NAME="5138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2833><b>sn</b> <i>Babylon</i> was situated on the Euphrates River and was surrounded by canals (also called &#8220;rivers&#8221;).</p>

The meaning of the last phrase is debated. For a discussion of the two options see W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah </i>(Hermeneia), 2:423. Most modern commentaries and English versions see an allusion to the figure in Isa 38:12 where the reference is to the end of life compared to a tapestry which is suddenly cut off from the loom.

It is also found in a number of Hebrew <sc>mss, in the Lucianic recension of the LXX (the Greek version), the Aramaic Targums, and the Latin Vulgate. Most English versions and many commentaries assume it here. However, it is easier to explain why the word is added in a few of the versions and some Hebrew than to explain why it was left out. It is probable that the word is not original here because the addressees are different and the function of this hymnic piece is slightly different (see the study note on the next line for details).

However, S. R. Driver, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 317, n. c maintains that v. 24 speaks against this. It does seem a little inconsistent to render the <i>vav</i> consecutive perfect at the beginning of v. 24 as future while rendering those in vv. 20b-23 as customary past. However, change in person from second masculine singular (vv. 20b-23) to the second masculine plural in &#8220;before your very eyes&#8221; and its position at the end of the verse after &#8220;which they did in Zion&#8221; argue that a change in address occurs there. Driver has to ignore the change in person and take &#8220;before your eyes&#8221; with the verb &#8220;repay&#8221; at the beginning to maintain the kind of consistency he seeks. The <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive imperfect can be used for either the customary past (GKC 335-36 §112.<i>dd</i> with cross reference back to GKC 331-32 §112.<i>e</i>) or the future (GKC 334 §112.<i>x</i>). Hence the present translation has followed the majority of commentaries (and English versions like TEV, NCV, CEV, NIrV) in understanding the referent as Babylon and v. 24 being a transition to vv. 25-26 (cf., e.g., J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah </i>[AB], 356-57, and J. A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah </i>[NICOT], 756-57). If the referent is understood as Media then the verbs in vv. 20-23 should all be translated as futures.

The LXX (the Greek version) renders the word &#8220;kings&#8221; as singular and levels all the pronouns to &#8220;his,&#8221; paraphrasing the final clause and combining it with &#8220;king of the Medes&#8221; to read &#8220;and of all the earth.&#8221; The Latin Vulgate levels them all to the third masculine plural, and this is followed by the present translation as well as a number of other modern English versions (NASB, NIV, NRSV, TEV, NCV). The ASV and NJPS understand the feminine to refer to Media, i.e., &#8220;her governors and all her prefects&#8221; and understand the masculine in the last line to be a distributive singular referring back to the lands each of the governors and prefects ruled over.

A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah </i>[NICOT], 760). The translation has sought to convey those ideas as clearly as possible without digressing too far from the literal.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> There are two figures involved here: one of the threshing floor being leveled and stamped down hard and smooth and the other of the harvest. At harvest time the stalks of grain were cut down, gathered in sheaves, taken to the harvest floor where the grain was loosened from the husk by driving oxen and threshing sleds over them. The grain was then separated from the mixture of grain, straw and husks by repeatedly throwing it in the air and letting the wind blow away the lighter husks and ground-up straw. The figure of harvest is often used of judgment in the OT. See, e.g., Joel 3:13 (4:13 Hebrew text) and Hos 6:11 and compare also Mic 4:12-13 and Jer 51:2 where different steps in this process are also used figuratively in connection with judgment. Babylon will be leveled to the ground and its people cut down in judgment.</p>
<A NAME="5178"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=2873><b>tn</b> This verse is extremely difficult to translate because of the shifting imagery, the confusion over the meaning of one of the verbs, and the apparent inconsistency of the pronominal suffixes here with those in the following verse which everyone agrees is connected with it. The pronominal suffixes are first common plural but the versions all read them as first common singular which the Masoretes also do in the <i>Qere</i>. That reading has been followed here for consistency with the next verse which identifies the speaker as the person living in Zion and the personified city of Jerusalem. The Hebrew text reads: &#8220;Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon devoured me [cf. 50:7, 17] and threw me into confusion. He set me down an empty dish. He swallowed me like a monster from the deep [cf. BDB 1072 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> 3 and compare usage in Isa 27:1; Ezek 29:3; 32:2]. He filled his belly with my dainties. He rinsed me out [cf. BDB s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;</font> Hiph.2 and compare the usage in Isa 4:4].&#8221; The verb &#8220;throw into confusion&#8221; has proved troublesome because its normal meaning does not seem appropriate. Hence various proposals have been made to understand it in a different sense. The present translation has followed W. L. Holladay (<i>Jeremiah </i>[Hermeneia], 2:428) in understanding the verb to mean &#8220;disperse&#8221; or &#8220;route&#8221; (see NAB). The last line has seemed out of place and has often been emended to read &#8220;he has spewed me out&#8221; (so NIV, NRSV, a reading that presupposes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> [<font face="Scholar">hiddikhani</font>] for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1457;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> [<font face="Scholar">hedikhani</font>]). The reading of the MT is not inappropriate if it is combined with the imagery of an empty jar and hence is retained here (see F. B. Huey, <i>Jeremiah, Lamentations </i>[NAC], 425, n. 59; H. Freedman, <i>Jeremiah</i> [SoBB], 344; NJPS). The lines have been combined to keep the imagery together.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The speaker in this verse and the next is the personified city of Jerusalem. She laments her fate at the hands of the king of Babylon and calls down a curse on Babylon and the people who live in Babylonia.
