<A NAME="85"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=502><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they will not&#8221; but the referent is far enough removed that it might be ambiguous.</p>
<A NAME="86"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=503><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;like dung/manure on the surface of the ground.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="87"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=504><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Death will be chosen rather than life by the remnant who are left from this wicked family in all the places where I have banished them.&#8221; The sentence is broken up and restructured to avoid possible confusion because of the complexity of the English to some modern readers. There appears to be an extra &#8220;those who are left&#8221; that was inadvertently copied from the preceding line. It is missing from one Hebrew <sc>ms and from the Greek and Syriac versions and is probably not a part of the original text.</p>
<A NAME="88"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=505><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Yahweh of armies.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> For the significance of this title see the notes at 2:19 and 7:3.</p>
<A NAME="89"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=506><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;the <sc>Lord said to me&#8221; are not in the text but are implicit from the context. They are supplied in the translation to make clear who is speaking and who is being addressed.</p>
<A NAME="810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=507><b>sn</b> There is a play on two different nuances of the same Hebrew word that means &#8220;turn&#8221; and &#8220;return,&#8221; &#8220;turn away&#8221; and &#8220;turn back.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=508><b>tc</b> The text is quite commonly emended, changing <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492; &#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shovÿvah ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">am</font>) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;&#1464;&#1489; &#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shovav ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">am</font>) and omitting <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1501;&#1460;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿrushalaim</font>); this is due to the anomaly of a feminine singular verb with a masculine singular subject and the fact that the word &#8220;Jerusalem&#8221; is absent from one Hebrew <sc>ms and the LXX. However, it is possible that this is a case where the noun &#8220;Jerusalem&#8221; is a defining apposition to the word &#8220;these people,&#8221; an apposition which GKC 425 §131.<i>k</i> calls &#8220;permutation.&#8221; In this case the verb could be attracted to the appositional noun and there would be no reason to emend the text. The MT is undoubtedly the harder reading and is for that reason to be preferred.</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=509><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;to their allegiance to false gods,&#8221; or &#8220;to their false professions of loyalty&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to deceit.&#8221; Either &#8220;to their mistaken beliefs&#8221; or &#8220;to their allegiance to false gods&#8221; would fit the preceding context. The former is more comprehensive than the latter and was chosen for that reason.</p>
<A NAME="813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=510><b>sn</b> There is a continuing play on the same root word used in the preceding verse. Here the words &#8220;turn away from me,&#8221; &#8220;apostasy,&#8221; and &#8220;turn back to me&#8221; are all forms from the root that was translated &#8220;go the wrong way&#8221; and &#8220;turn around&#8221; in v. 4. The intended effect is to contrast Judah&#8217;s recalcitrant apostasy with the usual tendency to try and correct one&#8217;s mistakes.</p>
<A NAME="814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=511><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I have paid attention and I have listened.&#8221; This is another case of two concepts being joined by &#8220;and&#8221; where one expresses the main idea and the other acts as an adverbial or adjectival modifier (a figure called hendiadys).</p>
<A NAME="815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=512><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;What have I done?&#8221; The addition of the word &#8220;wrong&#8221; is implicit in the context and is supplied in the translation for clarity. The rhetorical question does not function as a denial of wrongdoing, but rather as contrite shock at one&#8217;s own wrongdoing. It is translated as a declaration for the sake of clarity.</p>
<A NAME="816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=513><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;each one of them turns aside into their own running course.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The wordplay begun in v. 4 is continued here. The word translated &#8220;turns aside&#8221; in the literal translation and &#8220;wayward&#8221; in the translation is from the same root as &#8220;go the wrong way,&#8221; &#8220;turn around,&#8221; &#8220;turn away from me,&#8221; &#8220;apostasy,&#8221; &#8220;turn back to me.&#8221; What God hoped for were confessions of repentance and change of behavior; what he got was denial of wrongdoing and continued turning away from him.</p>
<A NAME="817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=514><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;its appointed time.&#8221; The translation is contextually motivated to avoid lack of clarity.</p>
<A NAME="818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=515><b>tn</b> There is debate in the commentaries and lexicons about the identification of some of these birds, particularly regarding the identification of the &#8220;swallow&#8221; which is more likely the &#8220;swift&#8221; and the &#8220;crane&#8221; which some identify with the &#8220;thrush.&#8221; For a discussion see the Bible encyclopedias and the UBS handbook <i>Fauna and Flora of the Bible</i>. The identity of the individual birds makes little difference to the point being made and &#8220;swallow&#8221; is more easily identifiable to the average reader than the &#8220;swift.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=516><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;keep.&#8221; Ironically birds, which do not think, obey the laws of nature, but Israel does not obey the laws of God.</p>
<A NAME="820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=517><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;do not know.&#8221; But here as elsewhere the word &#8220;know&#8221; is more than an intellectual matter. It is intended here to summarize both &#8220;know&#8221; and &#8220;follow&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;observe&#8221;) in the preceding lines.</p>
<A NAME="821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=518><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the ordinance/requirement of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=519><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Surely, behold!&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=520><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the scribes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=521><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The lying pen of the scribes have made [it] into a lie.&#8221; The translation is an attempt to make the most common interpretation of this passage understandable for the average reader. This is, however, a difficult passage whose interpretation is greatly debated and whose syntax is capable of other interpretations. The interpretation of the NJPS, &#8220;Assuredly, for naught has the pen labored, for naught the scribes,&#8221; surely deserves consideration within the context; i.e. it hasn&#8217;t done any good for the scribes to produce a reliable copy of the law, which the people have refused to follow. That interpretation has the advantage of explaining the absence of an object for the verb &#8220;make&#8221; or &#8220;labored&#8221; but creates a very unbalanced poetic couplet.</p>
<A NAME="825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=522><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;be trapped.&#8221; However, the word &#8220;trapped&#8221; generally carries with it the connotation of divine judgment. See BDB 540 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1491;</font> Niph.2, and compare usage in Jer 6:11 for support. The verbs in the first two lines are again the form of the Hebrew verb that emphasizes that the action is as good as done (Hebrew prophetic perfects).</p>
<A NAME="826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=523><b>sn</b> See Jer 6:12-15 for parallels to 8:10-12. The words of Jeremiah to the people may have been repeated on more than one occasion or have been found appropriate to more than one of his collection of messages in written and edited form. See Jer 36:4 and Jer 36:28 for reference to at least two of these collections.</p>
<A NAME="827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=524><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;daughter of my people.&#8221; For the translation given here see 4:11 and the note on the phrase &#8220;dear people&#8221; there.</p>
<A NAME="828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=525><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;They heal the wound of my people lightly.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=526><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;They say, &#8216;Peace! Peace!&#8217; and there is no peace!&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=527><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;They will fall among the fallen.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=528><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I will completely destroy them.&#8221; The translation which is adopted is based on the revocalization of the MT which appears to mean literally &#8220;gathering I will sweep them away,&#8221; a rather improbable grammatical combination. It follows the suggestion found in <i>HALOT</i> 705 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;</font> (Hiph) of reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1465;&#1505;&#1461;&#1507; &#1488;&#1458;&#1505;&#1460;&#1497;&#1508;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ose</font>, a first singular Qal imperfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1507;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asaf</font>] followed by a noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1505;&#1460;&#1497;&#1507;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asif</font>] with possessive suffix) instead of the MT&#8217;s <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1505;&#1465;&#1507; &#1488;&#1458;&#1505;&#1460;&#1497;&#1508;&#1461;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aspf </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asifem</font>, a Qal infinitive absolute of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1507;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asaf</font>] followed by the Hiphil imperfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;</font> [<font face="Scholar">suf</font>] plus suffix). For parallel usage of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">asaf</font>) see BDB 62 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1507;</font> Qal.4, and for a similar form of the verb see Mic 4:6. The alternate translation follows the suggestion in BDB 692 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;</font> Hiph: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1505;&#1465;&#1507;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asof</font>) is to be interpreted as a form of the Hiphil infinitive absolute (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1505;&#1461;&#1507;</font> [<font face="Scholar">hasef</font>] would be expected) chosen for assonance with the following form. This suggestion would gain more credence if the MT is to be retained in Zeph 1:2 where parallel forms are found. However, that text too has been questioned on lexical and grammatical grounds. The translation adopted fits the following context better than the alternate one and is based on less questionable lexical and grammatical parallels. The Greek translation which reads &#8220;they shall gather their fruits&#8221; supports the translation chosen.</p>
<A NAME="832"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=529><b>tn</b> The meaning of this line is very uncertain. A possible alternate translation is: &#8220;They have broken the laws that I gave them.&#8221; The line reads rather literally &#8220;And I gave them they passed over them.&#8221; The translation adopted treats the first expression as a noun clause (cf. GKC 488-89 §155.<i>n</i>) which is the subject of the following verb, i.e., &#8220;the things I gave them [contextually, the grapes, etc.] passed over from them.&#8221; The alternate translation treats the expression as a dangling object (a Hebrew <i>casus pendens</i>) resumed by the pronoun &#8220;them&#8221; and understands &#8220;the things that I gave them&#8221; to be the law or some related entity which is often the object of this verb (see BDB 717 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;</font> Qal.1.i). Neither of these translations is without its weakness. The weakness of the translation which has been adopted is the unusual use it assigns to the object suffix of the verb translated &#8220;pass over.&#8221; The weakness of the alternate translation is the rather abrupt and opaque introduction of a new topic of reference (i.e., the laws) into the context. On the whole the latter weakness would appear to outweigh the former. This line is missing from the Greek version and J. Bright (<i>Jeremiah </i>[AB]) and J. A. Thompson (<i>Jeremiah </i>[NICOT]) despair of giving a translation. For other possible suggestions see, W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah </i>(Hermeneia), 1:285-86.</p>
<A NAME="833"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=530><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;The people say&#8221; are not in the text but are implicit in the shift of speakers between vv. 4-13 and vv. 14-16. They are supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="834"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=531><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Gather together and let us enter into the fortified cities.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="835"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=532><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Let us die there.&#8221; The words &#8220;at least&#8221; and &#8220;fighting&#8221; are intended to bring out the contrast of passive surrender to death in the open country and active resistance to the death implicit in the context.</p>
<A NAME="836"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=533><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;of judgment&#8221; are not in the text but are intended to show that &#8220;poison water&#8221; is not literal but figurative of judgment at the hands of God through the agency of the enemy mentioned in v. 16.</p>
<A NAME="837"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=534><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;against the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The switch is for the sake of smoothness in English.</p>

<A NAME="840"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=537><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;They are coming to destroy&#8221; are not in the text. They are inserted to break up a long sentence in conformity with contemporary English style.</p>
<A NAME="841"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=538><b>tn</b> These words which are at the end of the Hebrew verse are brought forward to show at the outset the shift in speaker.</p>
<A NAME="842"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=539><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Indeed [or For] behold!&#8221; The translation is intended to convey some of the connection that is suggested by the Hebrew particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) at the beginning of the verse.</p>
<A NAME="843"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=540><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I am sending against you snakes, poisonous ones which cannot be charmed.&#8221; In the light of the context literal snakes are scarcely meant. So the metaphor is turned into a simile to prevent possible confusion. For a similar metaphorical use of animals for enemies see 5:6.</p>
<A NAME="844"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=541><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they will bite you.&#8221; There does not appear to be any way to avoid the possible confusion that literal snakes are meant here except to paraphrase. Possibly one could say &#8220;And they will attack you and &#8216;bite&#8217; you,&#8221; but the enclosing of the word &#8220;bite&#8221; in quotations might lead to even further confusion.</p>
<A NAME="845"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=542><b>tn</b> The words, &#8220;Then I said&#8221; are not in the text but there is a general consensus that the words of vv. 18-19a are the words of Jeremiah. These words are supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="846"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=543><b>tn</b> The meaning of this word is uncertain. The translation is based on the redivision and repointing of a word that occurs only here in the MT and whose pattern of formation is unparalleled in the Hebrew Bible. The MT reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1490;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mavligiti</font>) which BDB provisionally derives from a verb root meaning &#8220;to gleam&#8221; or &#8220;to shine.&#8221; However, BDB notes that the text is dubious (cf. BDB 114 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1490;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;</font>). The text is commonly emended to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497; &#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mibbÿli gÿhot</font>) which is a Qal infinitive from a verb meaning &#8220;to heal&#8221; preceded by a compound negative &#8220;for lack of, to be at a loss for&#8221; (cf., e.g., <i>HALOT</i> 514 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1490;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;</font> and 174 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1492;&#1492;</font>). This reading is supported by the Greek text which has an adjective meaning &#8220;incurable,&#8221; which is, however, connected with the preceding verse, i.e., &#8220;they will bite you incurably.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="847"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=544><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;daughter of my people.&#8221; For the translation given here see 4:11 and the note on the phrase &#8220;dear people&#8221; there.</p>

<A NAME="852"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=549><b>sn</b> The people&#8217;s cry and the <sc>Lord&#8217;s interruption reflect the same argument that was set forth in the preceding chapter.

See especially 7:4 and 7:30.</p>
