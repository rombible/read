<A NAME="205"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1159><b>tn</b> This name is translated rather than transliterated to aid the reader in understanding this name and connect it clearly with the explanation that follows in the next verse. For a rather complete discussion on the significance of this name and an attempt to explain it as a pun on the name &#8220;Pashhur&#8221; see J. A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah </i>(NICOT), 455, n. 35.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The name <font face="Scholar">Pashhur</font><i> </i>is essentially a curse pronounced by Jeremiah invoking the <sc>Lord&#8217;s authority. The same phrase occurs in Jer 6:25; 46:5; 49:29 which are all in the context of war. In ancient Israelite culture the change in name denoted a change in status or destiny. See, for example, the shift from Jacob (&#8220;He grabs the heel&#8221; and &#8220;Cheater&#8221; or &#8220;Deceiver,&#8221; Gen 25:26; 27:36) to Israel (&#8220;He perseveres with God,&#8221; Gen 32:28).</p>
