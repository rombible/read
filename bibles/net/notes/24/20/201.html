<A NAME="201"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1155><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;chief overseer/officer.&#8221; The translation follows the suggestion of P. C. Craigie, P. H. Kelley, J. F. Drinkard, <i>Jeremiah 1-25 </i>(WBC),<i> </i>267, based on the parallel passage in 29:26-27 where this official appears to have been in charge of maintaining order in the temple.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Judging from a comparison of this passage with Jer 29:26-27 and that passage in turn with 2 Kgs 25:18, Pashhur held an office second in rank only to the high priest. He was in charge of keeping order in the temple and took offense at what he heard Jeremiah saying.</p>
