<A NAME="2020"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1174><b>tn</b> The phrase translated &#8220;Those who would cause me terror are everywhere&#8221; has already occurred in 6:25 in the context of the terror caused by the enemy from the north and in 20:3 in reference to the curse pronounced on Pashhur who would experience it first hand. Some have seen the phrase here not as Jeremiah&#8217;s ejaculation of terror but of his assailant&#8217;s taunts of his message or even their taunting nickname for him. But comparison of this passage with the first two lines of Ps 31:13 (31:14 HT) which are word for word the same as these two will show that it refers to the terror inspired by the plots of his enemies to do away with him. It is also clear from the context of that passage and the following context here that the &#8220;whispering of many&#8221; (the literal translation of &#8220;many whispering words of intrigue against me) refers to intrigues to take vengeance on him and do away with him.</p>
