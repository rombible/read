<A NAME="2016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1170><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;speak in his name.&#8221; This idiom occurs in passages where someone functions as the messenger under the authority of another. See Exod 5:23; Deut 18:19, 29:20; Jer 14:14. The antecedent in the first line is quite commonly misidentified as being &#8220;him,&#8221; i.e., the <sc>Lord. Comparison, however, with the rest of the context, especially the consequential clause &#8220;then it becomes&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">vÿhayah</font>), and Jer 23:36 shows that it is &#8220;the word of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
