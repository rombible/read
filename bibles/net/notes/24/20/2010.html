<A NAME="2010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1164><b>sn</b> As a member of the priesthood and the protector of order in the temple, Pashhur was undoubtedly one of those who promulgated the deceptive belief that the <sc>Lord&#8217;s presence in the temple was a guarantee of Judah&#8217;s safety (cf. 7:4, 8). Judging from the fact that two other men held the same office after the leading men in the city were carried into exile in 597 <sc>b.c. (see Jer 29:25-26 and compare 29:1-2 for the date and 2 Kgs 24:12-16 for the facts), this prophecy was probably fulfilled in 597. For a similar kind of oracle of judgment see Amos 7:10-17.</p>
