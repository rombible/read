<A NAME="204"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1158><b>sn</b> A comparison of Ezek 8:3 and 9:2 in their contexts will show that this probably refers to the northern gate to the inner court of the temple. It is called Upper because it was on higher ground above the gate in the outer court. It is qualified by &#8220;in the <sc>Lord&#8217;s temple&#8221; to distinguish it from the Benjamin Gate in the city wall (cf. 37:13; 38:7). Like the Benjamin Gate in the city wall it faced north toward the territory of the tribe of Benjamin.</p>
