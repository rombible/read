<A NAME="2024"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1178><b>tn</b> All the text says literally is &#8220;Perhaps he can be enticed so that we can prevail over him.&#8221; However the word &#8220;enticed&#8221; needs some qualification. As W. McKane (<i>Jeremiah </i>[ICC], 1:479) notes it should probably be read in the context of the &#8220;stumbling&#8221; (= &#8220;something that would lead to my downfall&#8221;). Hence &#8220;slipping up&#8221; has been supplied as an object. It is vague enough to avoid specifics as the original text does but suggests some reference to &#8220;something that would lead to my downfall.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> There is an interesting ironical play on words here with the earlier use of these same Hebrew words in v. 7 to refer to the <sc>Lord coercing him into being his spokesman and overcoming his resistance. Jeremiah is lamenting that it was God&#8217;s call to speak his word which he could not (and still cannot) resist that has led ironically to his predicament, which is a source of terror to him.</p>
