The translation is more in keeping with contemporary English style.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This verse is almost an exact duplication of the petition in one of Jeremiah&#8217;s earlier prayers and complaints. See Jer 11:20 and notes there for explanation of the Hebrew psychology underlying the use of &#8220;kidneys and heart&#8221; here. For the thoughts expressed here see Ps 17.</p>
