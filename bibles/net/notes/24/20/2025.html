<A NAME="2025"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1179><b>sn</b> This line has some interesting ties with Jer 15:20-21 where Jeremiah is assured by God that he is indeed with him as he promised him when he called him (1:8, 19) and will deliver him from the clutches of wicked and violent people. The word translated here &#8220;awe-inspiring&#8221; is the same as the word &#8220;violent people&#8221; there. Jeremiah is confident that his &#8220;awe-inspiring&#8221; warrior will overcome &#8220;violent people.&#8221; The statement of confidence here is, by the way, a common element in the psalms of petition in the Psalter. The common elements of that type of psalm are all here: invocation (v. 7), lament (vv. 7-10), confession of trust/confidence in being heard (v. 11), petition (v. 12), thanksgiving or praise (v. 13). For some examples of this type of psalm see Pss 3, 7, 26.</p>
