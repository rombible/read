<A NAME="2019"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1173><b>tn</b> It would be difficult to render accurately the Hebrew particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) that introduces this verse without lengthening the English line unduly. It probably means something like &#8220;This is true even though I&#8230;,&#8221; i.e., the particle is concessive (cf. BDB s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 2.c). No other nuance seems appropriate. The particle is left out of the translation, but its presence is acknowledged here.</p>
