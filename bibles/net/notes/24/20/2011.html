<A NAME="2011"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1165><b>tn</b> The translation is admittedly interpretive but so is every other translation that tries to capture the nuance of the verb rendered here &#8220;coerced.&#8221; Here the Hebrew text reads: &#8220;You [ &#8211; ]ed me and I let myself be [ &#8211; ]ed. You overpowered me and prevailed.&#8221; The value one assigns to [ &#8211; ] is in every case interpretive based on what one thinks the context is referring to. The word is rendered &#8220;deceived&#8221; or &#8220;tricked&#8221; by several English versions (see, e.g., KJV, NASB, TEV, ICV) as though God had misled him. It is rendered &#8220;enticed&#8221; by some (see, e.g., NRSV, NJPS) as though God had tempted him with false hopes. Some go so far as to accuse Jeremiah of accusing God of metaphorically &#8220;raping&#8221; him. It is true that the word is used of &#8220;seducing&#8221; a virgin in Exod 22:15 and that it is used in several places to refer to &#8220;deceiving&#8221; someone with false words (Prov 24:28; Ps 78:36). It is also true that it is used of &#8220;coaxing&#8221; someone to reveal something he does not want to (Judg 14:15; 16:5) and of &#8220;enticing&#8221; someone to do something on the basis of false hopes (1 Kgs 22:20-22; Prov 1:10). However, it does not always have negative connotations or associations. In Hos 2:14 (2:16 HT) God &#8220;charms&#8221; or &#8220;woos&#8221; Israel, his estranged &#8216;wife,&#8217; into the wilderness where he hopes to win her back to himself. What Jeremiah is alluding to here is crucial for translating and interpreting the word. There is no indication in this passage that Jeremiah is accusing God of misleading him or raising false hopes; God informed him at the outset that he would encounter opposition (1:17-19). Rather, he is alluding to his call to be a prophet, a call which he initially resisted but was persuaded to undertake because of God&#8217;s persistence (Jer 1:7-10). The best single word to translate &#8216;&#8230;&#8217; with is thus &#8220;persuaded&#8221; or &#8220;coerced.&#8221; The translation spells out the allusion explicitly so the reader is not left wondering about what is being alluded to when Jeremiah speaks of being &#8220;coerced.&#8221; The translation &#8220;I let you do it&#8221; is a way of rendering the Niphal of the same verb which must be tolerative rather than passive since the normal passive for the Piel would be the Pual (See <i>IBHS</i> 389-90 §23.4g for discussion and examples.). The translation &#8220;you overcame my resistance&#8221; is based on allusion to the same context (1:7-10) and the parallel use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khazaq</font>) as a transitive verb with a direct object in 1 Kgs 16:22.</p>
