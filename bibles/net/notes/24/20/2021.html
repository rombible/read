<A NAME="2021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1175><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Denounce and let us denounce him.&#8221; The verb which is translated &#8220;denounce&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nagad</font>) does not take an accusative object of person as it does here very often. When it does it usually means to inform someone. The only relevant passage appears to be Job 17:5 where it means something like &#8220;denounce.&#8221; What is probably involved here are the attempts to portray Jeremiah as a traitor (Jer 26:10) and a false prophet (see his conflict with Hananiah in Jer 28).</p>
