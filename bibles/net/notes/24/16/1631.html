<A NAME="1631"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1020><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;So I will make known to those nations, I will make known to them at this time my power and my might. Then they will know that my name is the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> There is a decided ambiguity in this text about the identity of the pronoun &#8220;them.&#8221; Is it his wicked people he has been predicting judgment upon or the nations that have come to recognize the folly of idolatry? The nearer antecedent would argue for that. However, usage of &#8220;hand&#8221; (translated here &#8220;power&#8221;) in 6:12; 15:6 and later 21:5 and especially the threatening motif of &#8220;at this time&#8221; (or &#8220;now&#8221;) in 10:18 suggest that the &#8220;So&#8221; goes back logically to vv. 16-18, following a grounds of judgment with the threatened consequence as it has in at least 16 out of 18 occurrences thus far. Moreover it makes decidedly more sense that the Jews will know that his name is the <sc>Lord as the result of the present (&#8220;at this time&#8221;) display of his power in judgment than that the idolaters will at some later (cf. Isa 2:2-4 for possible parallel) time. There has been a decided emphasis that the people of Israel do not &#8220;know&#8221; him (cf. 2:8; 4:22; 9:3, 6). Now they will, but in a way they did not wish to. There is probably an allusion (and an ironic reversal) here to Exod 3:13-15; 34:5-7. They have presumed upon his graciousness and forgotten that his name not only involves being with them to help but being against them to punish sin. Even if the alternate translation is followed the reference is still to God&#8217;s mighty power made known in judging the wicked Judeans. The words &#8220;power&#8221; and &#8220;might&#8221; are an example of hendiadys in which two nouns joined by &#8220;and&#8221; in which one modifies the other.</p>
