<A NAME="3047"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1751><b>sn</b> Jer 30:23-24 are almost a verbatim repetition of 23:19-20. There the verses were addressed to the people of Jerusalem as a warning that the false prophets had no intimate awareness of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s plans which were plans of destruction for wicked Israel not plans of peace and prosperity. Here they function as further assurance that the <sc>Lord will judge the wicked nations oppressing them when he reverses their fortunes and restores them once again to the land as his special people (cf. vv. 18-22).</p>
