<A NAME="3013"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1717><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Alas [or Woe] for that day will be great.&#8221; For the use of the particle &#8220;Alas&#8221; to signal a time of terrible trouble, even to sound the death knell for someone, see the translator&#8217;s note on 22:13.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The reference to <i>a terrible time of trouble</i> (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;that day&#8221;) is a common shorthand reference in the prophets to &#8220;the Day of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The &#8220;Day of the <sc>Lord&#8221; refers to a time when God intervenes in judgment against the wicked. The time referent can be either near or far, referring to something as near as the Assyrian threat in the time of Ahaz (Isa 7:18, 20, 21, 23) or as distant as the eschatological battle of God against Gog when he attacks Israel (Ezek 38:14, 18). The judgment can be against Israel&#8217;s enemies and result in Israel&#8217;s deliverance (Jer 50:30-34). At other times as here the Day of the <sc>Lord involves judgment on Israel itself. Here reference is to the judgment that the northern kingdom, Israel, has already experienced (cf., e.g., Jer 3:8) and which the southern kingdom, Judah, is in the process of experiencing and which Jeremiah has lamented over several times and even described in hyperbolic and apocalyptic terms in Jer 4:19-31.</p>
