<A NAME="3029"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1733><b>tc</b> The translation of these first two lines follows the redivision of the lines suggested in NIV and NRSV rather than that of the Masoretes who read, &#8220;There is no one who pleads your cause with reference to [your] wound.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This verse exhibits a mixed metaphor of an advocate pleading someone&#8217;s case (cf., Jer 5:28; 22:18) and of a physician applying medicine to wounds and sores resulting from them (see, e.g., Jer 8:18 for the latter metaphor). Zion&#8217;s sins are beyond defense and the wounds inflicted upon her beyond healing. However, God, himself, in his own time will forgive her sins (Jer 31:34; 33:8) and heal her wounds (Jer 30:17).</p>
