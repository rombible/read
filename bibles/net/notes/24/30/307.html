<A NAME="307"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1711><b>sn</b> As the nations of <i>Israel and Judah</i> were united in their sin and suffered the same fate &#8211; that of exile and dispersion &#8211; (cf. Jer 3:8; 5:11; 11:10, 17) so they will ultimately be regathered from the nations and rejoined under one king, a descendant of David, and regain possession of their ancestral lands. The prophets of both the eighth and seventh century looked forward to this ideal (see, e.g., Hos 1:11 (2:2 HT); Isa 11:11-13; Jer 23:5-6; 30:3; 33:7; Ezek 37:15-22). This has already been anticipated in Jer 3:18.</p>
