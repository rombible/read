<A NAME="3034"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1738><b>tn</b> Again the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) appears to be intensive rather than causal. Compare the translator&#8217;s note on v. 12. It is possible that it has an adversative sense as an implicit contrast with v. 13 which expresses these concepts in the negative (cf. BDB 474 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 3.e for this use in statements which are contextually closer to one another).</p>
