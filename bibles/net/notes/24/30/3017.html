<A NAME="3017"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1721><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will break his yoke from upon your neck.&#8221; For the explanation of the figure see the study note on 27:2. The shift from third person at the end of v. 7 to second person in v. 8c, d and back to third person in v. 8e is typical of Hebrew poetry in the book of Psalms and in the prophetic books (cf., GKC 351 §114.<i>p</i> and compare usage in Deut 32:15; Isa 5:8 listed there). The present translation, like several other modern ones, has typically leveled them to the same person to avoid confusion for modern readers who are not accustomed to this poetic tradition.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In the immediate context the reference to <i>the yoke of their servitude to foreign domination</i> (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;his yoke&#8221;) should be understood as a reference to the yoke of servitude to Nebuchadnezzar which has been referred to often in Jer 27-28 (see, e.g., 27:8, 12; 28:2, 4, 11). The end of that servitude has already been referred to in 25:11-14; 29:11-14. Like many other passages in the OT it has been given a later eschatological reinterpretation in the light of subsequent bondages and lack of complete fulfillment, i.e., of restoration to the land and restoration of the Davidic monarchy.</p>
