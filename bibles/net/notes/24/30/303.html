<A NAME="303"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1707><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Write all the words which I speak to you in a scroll.&#8221; The verb &#8220;which I speak&#8221; is the instantaneous use of the perfect tense (cf. GKC 311-12 §106.<i>i</i> or <i>IBHS</i> 488-89 §30.5.1d). The words that the <sc>Lord is about to speak follow in chs. 30&#8211;31.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Reference is made here to the so-called &#8220;Book of Consolation&#8221; which is the most extended treatment of the theme of hope or deliverance in the book. Jeremiah was called to be a prophet both of judgment (of tearing down and destroying) and of deliverance (of replanting and rebuilding; see Jer 1:10). Jeremiah lamented that he had to predominantly pronounce judgment but he has periodically woven in prophecies of hope after judgment in 3:14-18; 16:14-15; 23:3-8; 24:4-7; 29:10-14, 32. The oracles of hope contained in these chapters are undated but reference is made in them to the restoration of both Israel which had gone into exile in Assyria in 722 <sc>b.c. and Judah which began to be exiled in 605 and 597 <sc>b.c. Jeremiah had already written as early as the reign of Zedekiah about the exiles who were the good figs who were to experience the &#8220;good&#8221; of restoration (24:4-7; 29:10-14) and had spoken of the further exile of those who remained in Judah. So it is possible that these oracles fit in roughly the same time frame as chapters 27&#8211;29. </p>
