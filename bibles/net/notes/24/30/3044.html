<A NAME="3044"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1748><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;For who is he who would pledge his heart to draw near to me.&#8221; The question is a rhetorical one expecting the answer &#8220;no one&#8221; and is a way of expressing an emphatic negative (see BDB 566 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;</font> f[c]). The concept of &#8220;pledging&#8221; something refers to putting up security in guarantee of payment. Here the word is used figuratively of &#8220;putting up one&#8217;s heart [i.e., his very being (cf. BDB 524 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1461;&#1489;</font> 7 and Ps 22:26)]&#8221; for the privilege of access to God. The rhetorical question denies that any one would do that if he were not bidden by God to do so.</p>
