He is called &#8220;David&#8221; in Hos 3:5, Ezek 34:23-24; 37:24-25 and referred to as a shoot or sprig of Jesse in Isa 11:1, 10 and a &#8220;righteous branch&#8221; springing from David (the Davidic line). He is called &#8220;David&#8221; because he is from the Davidic line and because David is the type of the ideal king whom the prophets looked forward to. See further the study notes on 23:5 for this ideal king and for his relation to the NT fulfillment in the person of Jesus the Christ.</p>
