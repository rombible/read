<A NAME="4123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2320><b>sn</b> <i>Geruth Kimham</i> is nowhere else mentioned in the Bible and its precise location is unknown. Many commentators relate the second part of the name to the name of the son of David&#8217;s benefactor when he fled from Absalom (2 Sam 19:38-39) and see this as a reference to an estate that David assigned this son as reward for his father&#8217;s largess. Gibeon was about six miles northwest of Jerusalem and Benjamin is approximately the same distance southwest of it. Hence, the people mentioned here had not traveled all that far.</p>
