<A NAME="4125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2322><b>tn</b> Verses 16-18a are a long complex sentence in the Hebrew text with some rather awkward placement of qualifying terms. In the Hebrew text these verses read: &#8220;<b>41:16</b> And he took, Johanan&#8230;and all the army officers with him, all the people who were left alive which he [Johanan] had taken back from Ishmael son of Nethaniah from Mizpah after he [Ishmael] had killed Gedaliah&#8230;men, men of war, and women and children and court officials which he [Johanan] had brought back from Gibeon <b>41:17</b> and they went and they stayed at Geruth Kimham&#8230;to go to enter Egypt <b>41:18</b> because of the Chaldean because they were afraid of them because Ishmael&#8230;&#8221; The sentence has been broken down and restructured to reflect all the relevant data in shorter sentences which better conform with contemporary English style. There are a couple of places where the text and syntax are debated. Many modern English versions and commentaries read &#8220;They led off/took control of/took all survivors of the people whom Ishmael&#8230;had taken captive [reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492; &#1465;&#1488;&#1514;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shavah </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">otam</font>) in place of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489; &#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1461;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">heshiv me</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et</font>), &#8220;whom he (Johanan) had taken back/rescued from Ishmael] from Mizpah after he had&#8230;&#8221; This is a decidedly smoother text but there is no manuscript or versional evidence for it and so it has been rejected here. Some commentators and English versions see the words &#8220;men of war&#8221; (&#8220;soldiers&#8221;) following the word &#8220;men&#8221; as appositional to that word and hence see only one category. However, there are no parallels to these words used in this kind of apposition. So the translation reflects two categories.</p>
