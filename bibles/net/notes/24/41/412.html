<A NAME="412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2299><b>sn</b> <i>All the Judeans</i>. This can scarcely refer to all the Judeans who had rallied around Gedaliah at Mizpah because v. 10 later speaks of Ishmael carrying off &#8220;the rest of the people who were at Mizpah.&#8221; Probably what is meant is &#8220;all the Judeans and Babylonian soldiers&#8221; that were also at the meal. It is possible that this meal was intended to seal a covenant between Gedaliah and Ishmael of Ishmael&#8217;s allegiance to Gedaliah and his Babylonian overlords (cf. Gen 26:30-31; 31:53-54; Exod 24:11). In any case, this act of treachery and deceit was an extreme violation of the customs of hospitality practiced in the ancient Near East.</p>
