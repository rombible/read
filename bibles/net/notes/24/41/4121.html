<A NAME="4121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2318><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all the people who were with Ishmael.&#8221; However, this does not refer to his own troops but to those he had taken with him from Mizpah, i.e., the captives. The phrase is specifically clarified in the next verse, i.e. &#8220;the people whom Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah.&#8221; Hence the phrase is translated here according to sense, not according to the literal wording.</p>
