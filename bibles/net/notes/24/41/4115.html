<A NAME="4115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2312><b>tc</b> The translation here follows the reading of the Greek version. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain; some understand it to mean &#8220;because of Gedaliah [i.e., to cover up the affair with Gedaliah]&#8221; and others understand it to mean &#8220;alongside of Gedaliah.&#8221; The translation presupposes that the Hebrew text reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512; &#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bor gadol hu</font>&#8217;) in place of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1497;&#1463;&#1491;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿyad-gÿdalyahu</font>). The meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1497;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿyad</font>) does not fit any of the normal ones given for this expression and those who retain the Hebrew text normally explain it as an unparalleled use of &#8220;because&#8221; or &#8220;in the affair of&#8221; (so NJPS) or a rare use meaning &#8220;near, by the side of &#8220; (see BDB 391 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;</font> 5.d where only Ps 141:6 and Zech 4:12 are cited. BDB themselves suggest reading with the Greek version as the present translation does [so BDB 391 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;</font> 5.c(3)]). For the syntax presupposed by the Greek text which has been followed consult <i>IBHS</i> 298 §16.3.3d and 133 §8.4.2b. The first clause is a classifying clause with normal order of subject-predicate-copulative pronoun and it is followed by a further qualifying relative clause.</p>
