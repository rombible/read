<A NAME="415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2302><b>sn</b> <i>Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria</i> were all cities in the northern kingdom of Israel with important religious and political histories. When Israel was destroyed in 722 <sc>b.c., some of the Israelites had been left behind and some of the Judeans had taken up residence in these northern cities. People residing there had participated in the reforms of Hezekiah (2 Chr 30:11) and Josiah (2 Chr 34:9) and were evidently still faithfully following the Jewish calendar. They would have been on their way to Jerusalem to celebrate the Jewish New Year and the Feast of Tabernacles (Lev 23:34).</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For the location of Samaria see Map2-B1; Map4-D3; Map5-E2; Map6-A4; Map7-C1.</p>
