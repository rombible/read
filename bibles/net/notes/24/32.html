Zedekiah had begun to reign in 598/97 and Nebuchadnezzar had begun to reign in 605/604 <sc>b.c. The dating of Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s rule here includes the partial year before he was officially crowned on New Year&#8217;s day. See the translator&#8217;s note on 25:1 for the method of dating a king&#8217;s reign.</p>
<A NAME="322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1854><b>sn</b> Jer 32:2-5 are parenthetical, giving the background for the actual report of what the <sc>Lord said in v. 7. The background is significant because it shows that Jeremiah was predicting the fall of the city and the kingdom and was being held prisoner for doing so. Despite this pessimistic outlook, the <sc>Lord wanted Jeremiah to demonstrate his assurance of the future restoration (which has been the topic of the two preceding chapters) by buying a field as a symbolic act that the Israelites would again one day regain possession of their houses, fields, and vineyards (vv. 15, 44). (For other symbolic acts with prophetic import see Jer 13, 19.)</p>
<A NAME="323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1855><b>sn</b> According to Jer 39:1 the siege began in Zedekiah&#8217;s ninth year (i.e., in 589/88 <sc>b.c.). It had been interrupted while the Babylonian army was occupied with fighting against an Egyptian force that had invaded Judah. During this period of relaxed siege Jeremiah had attempted to go to his home town in Anathoth to settle some property matters, had been accused of treason, and been thrown into a dungeon (37:11-15). After appealing to Zedekiah he had been moved from the dungeon to the courtyard of the guardhouse connected to the palace (37:21) where he remained confined until Jerusalem was captured in 587/86 <sc>b.c. (38:28).</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1856><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the courtyard of the guarding&#8221; or &#8220;place of guarding.&#8221; This expression occurs only in the book of Jeremiah (32:2, 8, 12; 33:1; 37:21; 38:6, 12, 28; 39:14, 15) and in Neh 3:25. It is not the same as an enclosed prison which is where Jeremiah was initially confined (37:15-16; literally a &#8220;house of imprisoning&#8221; [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bet ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">esur</font>] or &#8220;house of confining&#8221; [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bet hakkele</font>&#8217;]). It is said to have been in the palace compound (32:2) near the citadel or upper palace (Neh 3:25). Though it was a place of confinement (32:2; 33:1; 39:15) Jeremiah was able to receive visitors, e.g., his cousin Hanamel (32:8) and the scribe Baruch (32:12), and conduct business there (32:12). According to 32:12 other Judeans were also housed there. A cistern of one of the royal princes, Malkijah, was located in this courtyard, so this is probably not a &#8220;prison compound&#8221; as NJPS interpret but a courtyard adjacent to a guardhouse or guard post (so G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, T. G. Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52 </i>[WBC],<i> </i>151, and compare Neh 12:39 where reference is made to a Gate of the Guard/Guardhouse) used here for housing political prisoners who did not deserve death or solitary confinement as some of the officials though Jeremiah did.</p>
<A NAME="325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1857><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Zedekiah king of Judah.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1858><b>tn</b> The translation represents an attempt to break up a very long Hebrew sentence with several levels of subordination and embedded quotations and also an attempt to capture the rhetorical force of the question &#8220;Why&#8230;&#8221; which is probably an example of what E. W. Bullinger (<i>Figures of Speech</i>, 953-54) calls a rhetorical question of expostulation or remonstrance (cf. the note on 26:9 and compare also the question in 36:29. In all three of these cases NJPS translates &#8220;How dare you&#8230;&#8221; which captures the force nicely). The Hebrew<i> </i>text reads, &#8220;For Zedekiah king of Judah had confined him, saying, &#8216;Why are you prophesying, saying, &#8220;Thus says the <sc>Lord, &#8216;Behold I am giving this city into the hands of the king of Babylon and he will capture it.&#8217;&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1859><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The Chaldeans.&#8221; See the study note on 21:4 for further explanation.</p>
<A NAME="328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1860><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his [Zedekiah&#8217;s] mouth will speak with his [Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s] mouth and his eyes will see his eyes.&#8221; The verbs here are an obligatory imperfect and its <i>vav</i> consecutive perfect equivalent. (See <i>IBHS</i> 508-9 §31.4g for discussion and examples of the former and <i>IBHS </i>528<i> </i>§32.2.1d, n. 16, for the latter.)</p>
<A NAME="329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1861><b>tn</b> This is the verb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">paqad</font>) that has been met with several times in the book of Jeremiah, most often in the ominous sense of &#8220;punish&#8221; (e.g., 6:15; 11:22; 23:24) but also in the good sense of &#8220;resume concern for&#8221; (e.g., 27:22; 29:10). Here it is obviously in the ominous sense referring to his imprisonment and ultimate death (52:11).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Compare Jer 34:2-3 for this same prophecy. The incident in Jer 34:1-7 appears to be earlier than this one. Here Jeremiah is confined to the courtyard of the guardhouse; there he appears to have freedom of movement.</p>
<A NAME="3210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1862><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Oracle of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1863><b>sn</b> The pronouns are plural here, referring to the people of Judah and Jerusalem. Jeremiah had counseled that they surrender (cf. 27:12; 21:8-10) because they couldn&#8217;t succeed against the Babylonian army even under the most favorable circumstances (37:3-10).</p>
<A NAME="3212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1864><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The Chaldeans.&#8221; See the study note on 21:4 for further explanation.</p>
<A NAME="3213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1865><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The word of the <sc>Lord came to me, saying.&#8221; This verse resumes the narrative introduction in v. 1 which was interrupted by the long parenthetical note about historical background. There is again some disjunction in the narrative (compare the translator&#8217;s notes on 27:2 and 28:1). What was begun as a biographical (third person) narrative turns into an autobiographical (first person) narrative until v. 26 where the third person is again resumed. Again this betrays the hand of the narrator, Baruch.</p>
<A NAME="3214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1866><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your right.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mishpat</font>) here and in v. 8 refers to legal entitlement for the option to purchase a property (BDB 1049 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1496;</font> 5; cf. Deut 21:17).</p>
<A NAME="3215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1867><b>sn</b> Underlying this request are the laws of redemption of property spelled out in Lev 25:25-34 and illustrated in Ruth 4:3-4. Under these laws, if a property owner became impoverished and had to sell his land, the nearest male relative had the right and duty to buy it so that it would not pass out of the use of the extended family. The land, however, would not actually belong to Jeremiah because in the year of Jubilee it reverted to its original owner. All Jeremiah was actually buying was the right to use it (Lev 25:13-17). Buying the field, thus, did not make any sense (thus Jeremiah&#8217;s complaint in v. 25) other than the fact that the <sc>Lord intended to use Jeremiah&#8217;s act as a symbol of a restored future in the land.</p>
<A NAME="3216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1868><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And according to the word of the <sc>Lord my cousin Hanamel came to me to the courtyard of the guardhouse and said, &#8216;&#8230;&#8217;&#8221; The sentence has been broken down to conform better with contemporary English style.</p>
<A NAME="3217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1869><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I weighed out the money [more literally, &#8220;silver&#8221;] for him, seventeen shekels of silver.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Coins were not in common use until the postexilic period. Payment in gold and silver was made by cutting off pieces of silver or gold and weighing them in a beam balance using standard weights as the measure. A shekel weighed approximately 0.4 ounce or 11.4 grams. The English equivalents are only approximations.</p>
<A NAME="3218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1870><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;of purchase&#8221; are not in the text but are implicit. The qualification is spelled out explicitly in vv. 11, 12, 13. These words are supplied in the translation for clarity. An alternative translation would be &#8220;I put the deed in writing.&#8221; However, since the same idiom <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1489; &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1505;&#1461;&#1508;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">catav bÿsefer</font>) is used later in v. 12 with respect to the witnesses, it is likely that it merely refers to signing the document.</p>
<A NAME="3219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1871><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;to the purchase&#8221; are not in the text but are implicit in the idiom &#8220;I had some witnesses serve as witness.&#8221; The words are supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1872><b>tn</b> There is some uncertainty about the precise meaning of the phrases translated &#8220;the order of transfer and the regulations.&#8221; The translation follows the interpretation suggested by J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah </i>(AB), 237; J. A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah </i>(NICOT), 586, n. 5; and presumably BDB 349 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1511;</font> 7, which defines the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khoq</font>) here as &#8220;conditions of the deed of purchase.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1873><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the deed, the purchase.&#8221; This is a case of apposition of species in place of the genitive construction (cf. GKC 423 §131.<i>b</i> and compare the usage in Exod 24:5).</p>
<A NAME="3222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1874><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I took the deed of purchase, both that which was sealed [and contained] the order and the regulations and that which was open [i.e., unsealed], and I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch&#8230;in the presence of my cousin Hanamel and in the presence of&#8230;and in the presence of&#8230;.&#8221; It is awkward to begin a sentence with &#8220;I took&#8230;&#8221; without finishing the thought, and the long qualifiers in v. 12 make that sentence too long. The sentence is broken up in accordance with contemporary English style. The reference to the &#8220;deed of purchase&#8221; in v. 12 should be viewed as a plural consisting of both written and sealed copies as is clear from v. 11 and also v. 14. Part of the confusion is due to the nature of this document which consisted of a single papyrus scroll, half of which was rolled up and sealed and the other half which was left &#8220;opened&#8221; or unsealed. J. Bright (<i>Jeremiah </i>[AB], 237-38) is probably incorrect in assuming that the copies were duplicate since the qualification &#8220;containing the order of transfer and the regulations&#8221; is only applied to the appositional participle, &#8220;the sealed one [or copy].&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Aramaic documents from a slightly later period help us understand the nature of such deeds. The document consisted of a single papyrus sheet divided in half. One half contained all the particulars and was tightly rolled up, bound with strips of cloth or thread, sealed with wax upon which the parties affixed their seal, and signed by witnesses. The other copy consisted of an abstract and was left loosely rolled and unsealed (i.e., open to be consulted at will). If questions were raised about legality of the contract then the sealed copy could be unsealed and consulted.</p>

<A NAME="3227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1879><b>sn</b> The significance of the symbolic act performed by Jeremiah as explained here was a further promise (see the &#8220;again&#8221; statements in 31:4, 5, 23 and the &#8220;no longer&#8221; statements in 31:12, 29, 34, 40) of future restoration beyond the destruction implied in vv. 3-5. After the interruption of exile, normal life of buying and selling of fields, etc. would again be resumed and former property rights would be recognized.</p>

It is part of the attributes of God spelled out in Exod 34:6-7.</p>
<A NAME="3232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1884><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;pays back into the bosom of their children the sin of their parents.&#8221;</p>

This is typical of hymnic introductions to hymns of praise (cf., e.g., Ps 136) but it is hard to sustain the relative subordination which all goes back to the suffix on &#8220;hard for you.&#8221; The sentences have been broken up but the connection with the end of v. 17 has been sacrificed for conformity to contemporary English style.</p>
<A NAME="3234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1886><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[you are] great in counsel and mighty in deed.&#8221;</p>

And you continue to do them until this day both in Israel and among mankind. By this mean you have gained a renown&#8230;&#8221; The translation here follows the syntactical understanding reflected also in NJPS. The Hebrew<i> </i>text reads: &#8220;you did miracles and marvelous acts in the land of Egypt until this day and in Israel and in mankind and you made for yourself a name as this day.&#8221; The majority of English versions and commentaries understand the phrases &#8220;until this day and in Israel and in mankind&#8221; to be an elliptical sentence with the preceding verb and objects supplied as reflected in the alternate translation. However, the emphasis on the miraculous deeds in Egypt in this section both before and after this elliptical phrase and the dominant usage of the terms &#8220;signs and wonders&#8221; to refer to the plagues and other miraculous signs in Egypt calls this interpretation into question. The key here is understanding &#8220;both in Israel and in mankind&#8221; as an example of a <i>casus pendens </i>construction (a dangling subject, object, or other modifier) before a conjunction introducing the main clause (cf. GKC 327 §111.<i>h</i> and 458 §143.<i>d</i> and compare the usage in Jer 6:19; 33:24; 1 Kgs 15:13). This verse is the topic sentence which is developed further in v. 21 and initiates a narrative history of the distant past that continues until v. 22b where reference is made to the long history of disobedience which has led to the present crisis.</p>

Jeremiah has repeatedly emphasized that the history of Israel since their entry into the land has been one of persistent disobedience and rebellion (cf., e.g. 7:22-26; 11:7-8). The statement, of course, is somewhat hyperbolical as all categorical statements of this kind are.</p>

The god <i>Molech</i> is especially associated with the practice of child sacrifice (Lev 18:21; 20:2-5; 2 Kgs 23:10). In 1 Kgs 11:7 this god is identified as the god of the Ammonites who is also called Milcom in 1 Kgs 11:5; 2 Kgs 23:13. Child sacrifice, however, was not confined to this god; it was also made to the god Baal (Jer 19:5) and to other idols that the Israelites had set up (Ezek 16:20-21). This practice was, however, strictly prohibited in Israel (Lev 18:21; 20:2-5; Deut 12:31; 18:10). It was this practice as well as other pagan rites that Manasseh had instituted in Judah that ultimately led to Judah&#8217;s demise (2 Kgs 24:3-4). Though Josiah tried to root these pagan practices (2 Kgs 23:4-14) out of Judah he could not do so. The people had only made a pretense of following his reforms; their hearts were still far from God (Jer 3:10; 12:2).</p>

In 32:24 this is Jeremiah&#8217;s statement just before he expresses his perplexity about the <sc>Lord&#8217;s command to buy the field of his cousin in spite of the certainty of the city&#8217;s demise. In 32:28 it is the <sc>Lord&#8217;s affirmation that the city will indeed fall. Here, the <sc>Lord picks up Jeremiah&#8217;s assessment only to add a further prophesy (vv. 37-41) of what is just as sure to happen (v. 42). This is the real answer to Jeremiah&#8217;s perplexity. Verses 28-35 are an assurance that the city will indeed be captured and a reiteration again of the reason for its demise. The structure of the two introductions in v. 28 and v. 36 are parallel and flow out of the statement that the <sc>Lord is God of all mankind and nothing is too hard for him (neither destruction nor restoration [cf. 1:10]).</p>
<A NAME="3278"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=1930><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And now therefore thus says the <sc>Lord, the God of Israel, concerning this city which you [masc. pl.] are saying has been given [prophetic perfect = will be given] into the hand of the king of Babylon through sword, starvation, and disease.&#8221; The translation attempts to render the broader structure mentioned in the study note and to break the sentence down in a way that conforms more to contemporary English style and that will lead into the speech which does not begin until the next verse. As in v. 28 the third person introduction has been changed to first person for smoother narrative style in a first person speech (i.e., vv. 27-44 are all the <sc>Lord&#8217;s answer to Jeremiah&#8217;s prayer). The words &#8220;right in&#8221; added to &#8220;are saying&#8221; are intended to reflect the connection between v. 28 and the statement here (which is a repetition of v. 24). I.e., God does not deny that Jeremiah&#8217;s assessment is correct; he affirms it but has something further to say in answer to Jeremiah&#8217;s prayer.</p>
<A NAME="3279"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">79</span><note=1931><b>tn</b> The verb here should be interpreted as a future perfect; though some of the people have already been exiled (in 605 and 597 <sc>b.c.), some have not yet been exiled at the time this prophesy is given (see study note on v. 1 for the date).

Ezek 11:19 and see BDB 525 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1461;&#1500;&#1489;</font> 4 where reference is made to &#8220;inclinations, resolutions, and determinations of the will&#8221;). The phrase &#8220;one way&#8221; refers to one way of life or conduct (cf. BDB 203 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> 6.a where reference is made to moral action and character), a way of life that is further qualified by the goal of showing &#8220;fear, reverence, respect&#8221; for the <sc>Lord. The Hebrew sentence has been broken up to avoid a long complex sentence in English which is contrary to contemporary English style. However, an attempt has been made to preserve all the connections of the original.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Other passages also speak about the &#8220;single-minded purpose&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;one heart&#8221;) and &#8220;living in a way that shows respect for me.&#8221; Deut 30:6-8 speaks of a circumcised heart that will love him, obey him, and keep his commands. Ezek 11:20-21 speaks of the removal of a stony heart and the giving of a single-minded, &#8220;fleshy&#8221; heart and a new spirit that will follow his decrees and keep his laws. Ezek 36:26-27 speaks of the removal of a stony heart and the giving of a new, &#8220;fleshy&#8221; heart and a new spirit and an infusion of God&#8217;s own spirit so that they will be able to follow his decrees and keep his laws. Jer 24:7 speaks of the giving of a (new) heart so that they might &#8220;know&#8221; him. And Jer 31:33 speaks of God writing his law on their hearts. All this shows that there is a new motivation and a new enablement for fulfilling the old stipulations, especially that of whole-hearted devotion to him (cf. Deut 6:4-6).</p>
<A NAME="3282"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">82</span><note=1934><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;an everlasting covenant.&#8221; For the rationale for the rendering &#8220;agreement&#8221; and the nature of the biblical covenants see the study note on 11:2.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> For other references to the lasting (or everlasting) nature of the new covenant see Isa 55:3; 61:8; Jer 50:5; Ezek 16:60; 37:26. The new covenant appears to be similar to the ancient Near Eastern covenants of grants whereby a great king gave a loyal vassal a grant of land or dynastic dominion over a realm in perpetuity in recognition of past loyalty. The right to such was perpetual as long as the great king exercised dominion, but the actual enjoyment could be forfeited by individual members of the vassal&#8217;s dynasty. The best example of such an covenant in the OT is the Davidic covenant where the dynasty was given perpetual right to rule over Israel. Individual kings might be disciplined and their right to enjoy dominion taken away, but the dynasty still maintained the right to rule (see 2 Sam 23:5; Ps 89:26-37 and note especially 1 Kgs 11:23-39). The new covenant appears to be the renewal of God&#8217;s promise to Abraham to always be the God of his descendants and for his descendants to be his special people (Gen 17:7) something they appear to have forfeited by their disobedience (see Hos 1:9). However, under the new covenant he promises to never stop doing them good and grants them a new heart, a new spirit, the infusion of his own spirit, and the love and reverence necessary to keep from turning away from him. The new covenant is not based on their past loyalty but on his gracious forgiveness and his gifts.</p>
<A NAME="3283"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">83</span><note=1935><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;stop being gracious to them&#8221; or &#8220;stop blessing them with good&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;turn back from them to do good to them.&#8221;</p>
