<A NAME="34"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=122><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Returning to me.&#8221; The form is the bare infinitive which the KJV and ASV have interpreted as an imperative &#8220;Yet, return to me!&#8221; However, it is more likely that a question is intended, expressing surprise in the light of the law alluded to and the facts cited. For the use of the infinitive absolute in the place of a finite verb, cf. GKC 346 §113.<i>ee</i>. For the introduction of a question without a question marker, cf. GKC 473 §150.<i>a</i>.</p>
