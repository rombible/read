The pronouns of address in the first two lines are second feminine singular as are the readings of the two verbs preferred by the Masoretes (the <i>Qere</i> readings) in the third and fourth lines. The verbs that are written in the text in the third and fourth lines (the <i>Kethib</i> readings) are second masculine plural as is the verb describing Israel&#8217;s treachery in the next verse.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The imagery here appears to be that of treating the wife as an equal heir with the sons and of giving her the best piece of property.</p>
