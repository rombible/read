<A NAME="356"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=174><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;They say.&#8221; There is an obvious ellipsis of a verb of saying here since the preceding words are those of the <sc>Lord and the following are those of the people. However, there is debate about whether these are the response of the people to the <sc>Lord&#8217;s invitation, a response which is said to be inadequate according to the continuation in 4:1-4, or whether these are the <sc>Lord&#8217;s model for Israel&#8217;s confession of repentance to which he adds further instructions about the proper heart attitude that should accompany it in 4:1-4. The former implies a dialogue with an unmarked twofold shift in speaker between 3:22b-25 and 4:1-4:4 while the latter assumes the same main speaker throughout with an unmarked instruction only in 3:22b-25. This disrupts the flow of the passage less and appears more likely.</p>
