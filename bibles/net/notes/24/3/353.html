<A NAME="353"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=171><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;A sound is heard on the hilltops, the weeping of the supplication of the children of Israel because [or indeed] they have perverted their way.&#8221; At issue here is whether the supplication is made to Yahweh in repentance because of what they have done or whether it is supplication to the pagan gods which is evidence of their perverted ways. The reference in this verse to the hilltops where idolatry was practiced according to 3:2 and the reference to Israel&#8217;s unfaithfulness in the preceding verse make the latter more likely. For the asseverative use of the Hebrew particle (here rendered &#8220;indeed&#8221;) where the particle retains some of the explicative nuance; cf. BDB 472-73 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 1.e and 3.c.</p>
