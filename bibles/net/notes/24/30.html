<A NAME="301"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1705><b>tn</b> Compare the headings at 7:1; 11:1; 18:1; 21:1 and the translator&#8217;s note at those places.</p>
<A NAME="302"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1706><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Thus says Yahweh of armies, the God of Israel, saying&#8230;.&#8221; For significance of the title &#8220;Yahweh of armies, the God of Israel&#8221; see the note at 2:19.</p>
<A NAME="303"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1707><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Write all the words which I speak to you in a scroll.&#8221; The verb &#8220;which I speak&#8221; is the instantaneous use of the perfect tense (cf. GKC 311-12 §106.<i>i</i> or <i>IBHS</i> 488-89 §30.5.1d). The words that the <sc>Lord is about to speak follow in chs. 30&#8211;31.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Reference is made here to the so-called &#8220;Book of Consolation&#8221; which is the most extended treatment of the theme of hope or deliverance in the book. Jeremiah was called to be a prophet both of judgment (of tearing down and destroying) and of deliverance (of replanting and rebuilding; see Jer 1:10). Jeremiah lamented that he had to predominantly pronounce judgment but he has periodically woven in prophecies of hope after judgment in 3:14-18; 16:14-15; 23:3-8; 24:4-7; 29:10-14, 32. The oracles of hope contained in these chapters are undated but reference is made in them to the restoration of both Israel which had gone into exile in Assyria in 722 <sc>b.c. and Judah which began to be exiled in 605 and 597 <sc>b.c. Jeremiah had already written as early as the reign of Zedekiah about the exiles who were the good figs who were to experience the &#8220;good&#8221; of restoration (24:4-7; 29:10-14) and had spoken of the further exile of those who remained in Judah. So it is possible that these oracles fit in roughly the same time frame as chapters 27&#8211;29. </p>
<A NAME="304"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1708><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Oracle of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="305"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1709><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;restore the fortune.&#8221; For the translation and meaning of this idiom see the note at 29:14.</p>
<A NAME="306"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1710><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fathers.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="307"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1711><b>sn</b> As the nations of <i>Israel and Judah</i> were united in their sin and suffered the same fate &#8211; that of exile and dispersion &#8211; (cf. Jer 3:8; 5:11; 11:10, 17) so they will ultimately be regathered from the nations and rejoined under one king, a descendant of David, and regain possession of their ancestral lands. The prophets of both the eighth and seventh century looked forward to this ideal (see, e.g., Hos 1:11 (2:2 HT); Isa 11:11-13; Jer 23:5-6; 30:3; 33:7; Ezek 37:15-22). This has already been anticipated in Jer 3:18.</p>
<A NAME="308"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1712><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And these are the words/things that the <sc>Lord speaks concerning Israel and Judah.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="309"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1713><b>tn</b> The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) is functioning here as loosely causal or epexegetical of the preceding introduction. For this usage cf. BDB 473-74 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 3.c. This nuance borders on that of the intensive use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font>. See the discussion in BDB 472 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> note and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 1.e.</p>
<A NAME="3010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1714><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;We have heard the sound of panic and of fear, and there is no peace.&#8221; It is generally agreed that the person of the verb presupposes that this is an unintroduced quote of the people.</p>
<A NAME="3011"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1715><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Ask and see/consider.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3012"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1716><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;with their hands on their loins.&#8221; The word rendered &#8220;loins&#8221; refers to the area between the ribs and the thighs.</p>
<A NAME="3013"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1717><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Alas [or Woe] for that day will be great.&#8221; For the use of the particle &#8220;Alas&#8221; to signal a time of terrible trouble, even to sound the death knell for someone, see the translator&#8217;s note on 22:13.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The reference to <i>a terrible time of trouble</i> (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;that day&#8221;) is a common shorthand reference in the prophets to &#8220;the Day of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The &#8220;Day of the <sc>Lord&#8221; refers to a time when God intervenes in judgment against the wicked. The time referent can be either near or far, referring to something as near as the Assyrian threat in the time of Ahaz (Isa 7:18, 20, 21, 23) or as distant as the eschatological battle of God against Gog when he attacks Israel (Ezek 38:14, 18). The judgment can be against Israel&#8217;s enemies and result in Israel&#8217;s deliverance (Jer 50:30-34). At other times as here the Day of the <sc>Lord involves judgment on Israel itself. Here reference is to the judgment that the northern kingdom, Israel, has already experienced (cf., e.g., Jer 3:8) and which the southern kingdom, Judah, is in the process of experiencing and which Jeremiah has lamented over several times and even described in hyperbolic and apocalyptic terms in Jer 4:19-31.</p>
<A NAME="3014"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1718><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;It is a time of trouble for Jacob but he will be saved out of it.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Jacob</i> here is figurative for the people descended from him. Moreover the figure moves from Jacob = descendants of Jacob to only a part of those descendants. Not all of his descendants who have experienced and are now experiencing trouble will be saved. Only a remnant (i.e., the good figs, cf., e.g., Jer 23:3; 31:7) will see the good things that the <sc>Lord has in store for them (Jer 24:5-6). The bad figs will suffer destruction through war, starvation, and disease (cf., e.g., Jer 24:8-10 among many other references).</p>
<A NAME="3015"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1719><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And it shall happen in that day.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The <i>time for them to be rescued</i> (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;that day&#8221;) is the day of deliverance from the trouble alluded to at the end of the preceding verse, not the day of trouble mentioned at the beginning. Israel (even the good figs) will still need to go through the period of trouble (cf. vv. 10-11).</p>
<A NAME="3016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1720><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Oracle of Yahweh of armies.&#8221; See the study note on 2:19 for explanation of the title for God.</p>
<A NAME="3017"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1721><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will break his yoke from upon your neck.&#8221; For the explanation of the figure see the study note on 27:2. The shift from third person at the end of v. 7 to second person in v. 8c, d and back to third person in v. 8e is typical of Hebrew poetry in the book of Psalms and in the prophetic books (cf., GKC 351 §114.<i>p</i> and compare usage in Deut 32:15; Isa 5:8 listed there). The present translation, like several other modern ones, has typically leveled them to the same person to avoid confusion for modern readers who are not accustomed to this poetic tradition.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In the immediate context the reference to <i>the yoke of their servitude to foreign domination</i> (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;his yoke&#8221;) should be understood as a reference to the yoke of servitude to Nebuchadnezzar which has been referred to often in Jer 27-28 (see, e.g., 27:8, 12; 28:2, 4, 11). The end of that servitude has already been referred to in 25:11-14; 29:11-14. Like many other passages in the OT it has been given a later eschatological reinterpretation in the light of subsequent bondages and lack of complete fulfillment, i.e., of restoration to the land and restoration of the Davidic monarchy.</p>
<A NAME="3018"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1722><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will tear off their bands.&#8221; The &#8220;bands&#8221; are the leather straps which held the yoke bars in place (cf. 27:2). The metaphor of the &#8220;yoke on the neck&#8221; is continued. The translation reflects the sense of the metaphor but not the specific referent.</p>
<A NAME="3019"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1723><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;subject&#8221; in this verse and &#8220;subjugate&#8221; are from the same root word in Hebrew. A deliberate contrast is drawn between the two powers that they will serve. </p>
<A NAME="3020"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1724><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and to David their king whom I will raise up for them.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The <i>Davidic ruler which I will raise up as king over them</i> refers to a descendant of David who would be raised up over a regathered and reunited Israel and Judah. He is called &#8220;David&#8221; in Hos 3:5, Ezek 34:23-24; 37:24-25 and referred to as a shoot or sprig of Jesse in Isa 11:1, 10 and a &#8220;righteous branch&#8221; springing from David (the Davidic line). He is called &#8220;David&#8221; because he is from the Davidic line and because David is the type of the ideal king whom the prophets looked forward to. See further the study notes on 23:5 for this ideal king and for his relation to the NT fulfillment in the person of Jesus the Christ.</p>
<A NAME="3021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1725><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;So do not be afraid, my servant Jacob, oracle of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; Here and elsewhere in the verse the terms Jacob and Israel are poetic for the people of Israel descended from the patriarch Jacob. The terms have been supplied throughout with plural referents for greater clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3022"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1726><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;For I will rescue you from far away, your descendants from the land of their captivity.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1727><b>sn</b> Compare the ideals of the Mosaic covenant in Lev 26:6, the Davidic covenant in 2 Sam 7:10-11, and the new covenant in Ezek 34:25-31.</p>
<A NAME="3024"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1728><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Oracle of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3025"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1729><b>tn</b> The translation &#8220;entirely unpunished&#8221; is intended to reflect the emphatic construction of the infinitive absolute before the finite verb.</p>
<A NAME="3026"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1730><b>tn</b> The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) here is parallel to the one in v. 5 that introduces the first oracle. See the discussion in the translator&#8217;s note there.</p>
<A NAME="3027"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1731><b>tn</b> The pronouns in vv. 10-17 are second feminine singular referring to a personified entity. That entity is identified in v. 17 as Zion, which here stands for the people of Zion.</p>
<A NAME="3028"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1732><b>sn</b> The <i>wounds</i> to the body politic are those of the incursions from the enemy from the north referred to in Jer 4:6; 6:1 over which Jeremiah and even God himself have lamented (Jer 8:21; 10:19; 14:17). The enemy from the north has been identified as Babylon and has been identified as the agent of God&#8217;s punishment of his disobedient people (Jer 1:15; 4:6; 25:9).</p>
<A NAME="3029"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1733><b>tc</b> The translation of these first two lines follows the redivision of the lines suggested in NIV and NRSV rather than that of the Masoretes who read, &#8220;There is no one who pleads your cause with reference to [your] wound.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This verse exhibits a mixed metaphor of an advocate pleading someone&#8217;s case (cf., Jer 5:28; 22:18) and of a physician applying medicine to wounds and sores resulting from them (see, e.g., Jer 8:18 for the latter metaphor). Zion&#8217;s sins are beyond defense and the wounds inflicted upon her beyond healing. However, God, himself, in his own time will forgive her sins (Jer 31:34; 33:8) and heal her wounds (Jer 30:17).</p>
<A NAME="3030"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1734><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;forgotten you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3031"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1735><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;attacked you like&#8230;with the chastening of a cruel one because of the greatness of your iniquity [and because] your sins are many.&#8221; The sentence has been broken down to conform to contemporary English style and better poetic scansion.</p>
<A NAME="3032"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1736><b>tn</b> For the translation of this particle, which is normally translated &#8220;therefore&#8221; and often introduces an announcement of judgment, compare the usage at Jer 16:14 and the translator&#8217;s note there. Here as there it introduces a contrast, a rather unexpected announcement of salvation. For a similar use see also Hos 2:14 (2:16 HT). Recognition of this usage makes the proposed emendation of <i>BHS</i> of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1461;&#1503; &#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lakhen kol</font>) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿkhol</font>) unnecessary.</p>
<A NAME="3033"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1737><b>sn</b> With the exception of the second line there is a definite attempt at wordplay in each line to underline the principle of <i>lex talionis</i> on a national and political level. This principle has already been appealed to in the case of the end of Babylonian sovereignty in 25:14; 27:7.</p>
<A NAME="3034"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1738><b>tn</b> Again the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) appears to be intensive rather than causal. Compare the translator&#8217;s note on v. 12. It is possible that it has an adversative sense as an implicit contrast with v. 13 which expresses these concepts in the negative (cf. BDB 474 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 3.e for this use in statements which are contextually closer to one another).</p>
<A NAME="3035"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1739><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Oracle of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3036"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1740><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will restore the fortunes of the tents of Jacob and will have compassion on his habitations.&#8221; For the meaning of the idiom &#8220;restore the fortunes of&#8221; see the translator&#8217;s note on 29:14. The &#8220;tents of Jacob&#8221; refers to their homes or houses (see BDB 14 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1465;&#1492;&#1462;&#1500;</font> 2 and compare usage in Judg 19:9; Mal 2:12). The word &#8220;ruined&#8221; has been supplied in the translation to show more clearly the idea of restoration of their houses on their former sites in conformity to the concepts in the latter half of the verse.</p>
<A NAME="3037"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1741><b>sn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;on its tel.&#8221; A tel is a site where successive layers of occupation are built upon one another after the destruction or decay of the former city. The original site was not abandoned because it had been chosen for strategic purposes, such as proximity to water or ease of defense. Many modern archaeological sites have the designation &#8220;Tel&#8221; as a component of their name because of this practice.</p>
<A NAME="3038"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1742><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;according to its custom [or plan].&#8221; Cf. BDB 1049 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1496;</font> 6.d and compare usage in 1 Sam 27:11.</p>
<A NAME="3039"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1743><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Out of them will come thanksgiving and a sound of those who are playful.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3040"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1744><b>sn</b> Compare Jer 29:6.</p>
<A NAME="3041"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1745><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his children will be as in former times and his congregation/community will be established before me.&#8221; &#8220;His children&#8221; refers to &#8220;Jacob&#8221; who has been referred to in v. 18 in the phrase &#8220;I will restore the fortunes of the tents of Jacob.&#8221; &#8220;His children&#8221; are thus the restored exiles. Some commentaries see the reference here to the restoration of numbers in accordance with the previous verse. However, the last line of this verse and the reference to the ruler in the following verse suggests rather restoration of the religious and political institutions to their former state. For the use of the word translated &#8220;community&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">edah</font>) to refer to a political congregation as well as its normal use to refer to a religious one see 1 Kgs 12:20. For the idea of &#8220;in my favor&#8221; (i.e., under the eye and regard of) for the Hebrew phrase used here (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1508;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">lÿfanay</font>) see BDB 817 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1462;&#1492;</font> II.4.a(b).</p>
<A NAME="3042"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1746><b>sn</b> The statement <i>their ruler will come from their own number</i> accords with the regulation in Deut 17:15. They would not be ruled by a foreign leader but by one of their own people. In v. 9 he is specifically said to come from the Davidic line. See the study note there.</p>
<A NAME="3043"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1747><b>sn</b> Ordinarily this prerogative was confined to the priests and the Levites and even then under strict regulations (cf., e.g., Num 8:19; 16:10; Lev 16:10; 21:17; 22:3). Uzziah king of Judah violated this and suffered leprosy for having done so (2 Chr 26:16-20). It is clear, however, that both David and Solomon on occasion exercised priestly functions in the presence of the ark or the altar which it was normally lawful for only the priests to approach (cf., e.g., 2 Sam 6:13-14; 1 Kgs 8:22, 54-55). Here reference is probably not to the normal prerogatives of offering sacrifice or burning incense but access to God&#8217;s special presence at special times for the purpose of consultation.</p>
<A NAME="3044"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1748><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;For who is he who would pledge his heart to draw near to me.&#8221; The question is a rhetorical one expecting the answer &#8220;no one&#8221; and is a way of expressing an emphatic negative (see BDB 566 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;</font> f[c]). The concept of &#8220;pledging&#8221; something refers to putting up security in guarantee of payment. Here the word is used figuratively of &#8220;putting up one&#8217;s heart [i.e., his very being (cf. BDB 524 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1461;&#1489;</font> 7 and Ps 22:26)]&#8221; for the privilege of access to God. The rhetorical question denies that any one would do that if he were not bidden by God to do so.</p>
<A NAME="3045"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1749><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Oracle of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3046"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1750><b>sn</b> This was their highest privilege (cf. Exod 6:7, Lev 26:12; Jer 24:7) but also their greatest responsibility (cf. Jer 7:3; 11:4). It is a formula referring to a covenant relationship in which God pledges to protect, provide, and be present with his people and they in turn promise to be loyal and obedient to him (see Deut 26:17-18; 29:10-13).</p>
<A NAME="3047"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1751><b>sn</b> Jer 30:23-24 are almost a verbatim repetition of 23:19-20. There the verses were addressed to the people of Jerusalem as a warning that the false prophets had no intimate awareness of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s plans which were plans of destruction for wicked Israel not plans of peace and prosperity. Here they function as further assurance that the <sc>Lord will judge the wicked nations oppressing them when he reverses their fortunes and restores them once again to the land as his special people (cf. vv. 18-22).</p>
