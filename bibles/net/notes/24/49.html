<A NAME="491"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2595><b>sn</b> <i>Ammonites</i>. Ammon was a small kingdom to the north and east of Moab which was in constant conflict with the Transjordanian tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh over territorial rights to the lands north and south of the Jabbok River. Ammon mainly centered on the city of Rabbah which is modern Amman. According to Judg 11:13 the Ammonites claimed the land between the Jabbok and the Arnon but this was land taken from them by Sihon and Og and land that the Israelites captured from the latter two kings. The Ammonites attempted to expand into the territory of Israel in the Transjordan in the time of Jephthah (Judg 10-11) and the time of Saul (1 Sam 11). Apparently when Tiglath Pileser carried away the Israelite tribes in Transjordan in 733 <sc>b.c., the Ammonites took over possession of their cities (Jer 49:1). Like Moab they appear to have been loyal to Nebuchadnezzar in the early part of his reign, forming part of the contingent that he sent to harass Judah when Jehoiakim rebelled in 598 <sc>b.c. (2 Kgs 24:2). But along with Moab and Edom they sent representatives to plot rebellion against Nebuchadnezzar in 594 <sc>b.c. (Jer 27:3). The Ammonites were evidently in rebellion against him in 588 <sc>b.c. when he had to decide whether to attack Rabbah or Jerusalem first (Ezek 21:18-23 [21:23-28 HT]). They appear to have remained in rebellion after the destruction of Jerusalem because their king Baalis was behind the plot to assassinate Gedaliah and offered refuge to Ishmael after he did it (Jer 40:13; 41:15). According to the Jewish historian Josephus they were conquered in 582 <sc>b.c. by Nebuchadnezzar.</p>
<A NAME="492"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2596><b>tc</b> The reading here and in v. 3 follows the reading of the Greek, Syriac, and Latin versions and 1 Kgs 11:5, 33; 2 Kgs 23:13. The Hebrew reads &#8220;Malcom&#8221; both here, in v. 3, and Zeph 1:5. This god is to be identified with the god known elsewhere as Molech (cf. 1 Kgs 11:7).</p>
<A NAME="493"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2597><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Does not Israel have any sons? Does not he have any heir [or &#8220;heirs&#8221; as a collective]? Why [then] has Malcom taken possession of Gad and [why] do his [Malcom&#8217;s] people live in his [Gad&#8217;s] land?&#8221; A literal translation here will not produce any meaning without major commentary. Hence the meaning that is generally agreed on is reflected in an admittedly paraphrastic translation. The reference is to the fact that the Ammonites had taken possession of the cities that had been deserted when the Assyrians carried off the Transjordanian tribes in 733 <sc>b.c. assuming that the Israelites would not return in sufficient numbers to regain control of it. The thought underlying the expression &#8220;Why has Milcom taken possession&#8230;&#8221; reflects the idea, common in the OT and the ancient Near East, that the god of a people drove out the previous inhabitants, gave their land to his worshipers to possess, and took up residence with them there (cf., e.g., Deut 1:21; Judg 11:24 and line 33-34 of the Moabite stone: &#8220;Chemosh said to me, &#8216;Go down, fight against Hauronen.&#8217; And I went down [and I fought against the town and took it], and Chemosh dwelt there in my time.&#8221; [<i>ANET</i> 321]).</p>

<A NAME="496"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2600><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Its daughters will be burned with fire.&#8221; For the use of the word &#8220;daughters&#8221; to refer to the villages surrounding a larger city see BDB 123 s.v.

<A NAME="498"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2602><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;you women of Rabbah&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;daughters of Rabbah.&#8221; It is difficult to tell whether the word &#8220;daughters&#8221; is used here in the same sense that it has in v. 2 (see the translator&#8217;s note there) or in the literal sense of &#8220;daughters.&#8221; The former has been preferred because the cities themselves (e.g., Heshbon) are called to wail in the earlier part of the verse and the term &#8220;daughters&#8221; has been used in the previous verse of the surrounding villages.</p>
<A NAME="499"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2603><b>tc</b> Or &#8220;Run back and forth inside the walls of your towns.&#8221; Or &#8220;slash yourselves with gashes.&#8221; The meaning of this line is uncertain. The Hebrew text reads &#8220;run back and forth among the walls.&#8221; The word &#8220;run back and forth&#8221; is generally taken as a Hitpolel of a verb that means to &#8220;go about&#8221; in the Qal and to &#8220;go back and forth&#8221; in the Polel (cf. BDB 1002 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;</font>). The noun that follows in the Hebrew means &#8220;wall, hedge&#8221; and is quite commonly modified by the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1465;&#1488;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tso</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">n</font>, &#8220;sheep&#8221;) referring to sheepfolds (cf., e.g., Num 32:36; 1 Sam 24:3). But the phrase &#8220;run back and forth among the sheepfolds&#8221; yields little meaning here. In Ps 89:40 (89:41 HT) the word &#8220;wall&#8221; is used in parallelism with fortified cities and refers to the walls of the city. That is the sense that is assumed in one of the alternate translations with the words &#8220;of your towns&#8221; being supplied in the translation for clarification. However, that figure is a little odd in a context which speaks of mourning rites. Hence, some emend the word &#8220;walls&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1461;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">gÿderot</font>) to &#8220;gashes&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1467;&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">gÿdudot</font>), a word that has occurred in a similar context in Jer 48:37. That would involve only the common confusion of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;</font>. That is the reading adopted here and fits the context nicely. NRSV appears to go one step further and read the verb as a Hitpolel from a root that is otherwise used only as a noun to mean &#8220;whip&#8221; or &#8220;scourge.&#8221; NRSV reads &#8220;slash yourselves with whips&#8221; which also makes excellent sense in the context but is not supported by any parallel use of the verb.</p>
<A NAME="4910"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2604><b>sn</b> Compare Jer 48:7 and the study note there.</p>
<A NAME="4911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2605><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Why do you brag about your valleys, about the fruitfulness of your valleys.&#8221; The meaning of the first two lines of this verse are uncertain primarily due to the ambiguity of the expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1489; &#1506;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1511;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zav </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">imqekh</font>). The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zav</font>) is either a Qal perfect or Qal participle of a verb meaning flow. It is common in the expression &#8220;a land flowing with milk and honey&#8221; and is also common to refer to the seminal discharge or discharge of blood which makes a man or woman unclean. BDB 264 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font> Qal.2 sees it as an abbreviation of the idea of &#8220;flowing with milk and honey&#8221; and sees it as referring to the fertility of Ammon&#8217;s valley. However, there are no other examples of such an ellipsis. Several of the modern English versions and commentaries have taken the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1502;&#1462;&#1511;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">emeq</font>) not as a reference to a valley but to the homonym cited in the note on 47:5 and see the reference here to the flowing away of Ammon&#8217;s strength. That interpretation is followed here. Instead of explaining the plural ending on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1502;&#1464;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amaqim</font>) as being an enclitic <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mem</font>) as others who follow this interpretation (e.g., J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah</i> [AB], 325), the present translation understands the plural as a plural of amplification (cf. GKC 397-98 §124.<i>e</i> and compare the noun &#8220;might&#8221; in Isa 40:26).</p>
<A NAME="4912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2606><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;apostate daughter.&#8221; This same term is applied to Israel in Jer 31:22 but seems inappropriate here to Ammon because she had never been loyal to the <sc>Lord and could not hence be called &#8220;apostate.&#8221; However, if it is used of the fact that she rebelled against the <sc>Lord&#8217;s servant, Nebuchadnezzar, it might be appropriate (cf. Jer 27:6, 8). Hence the term &#8220;rebellious&#8221; is used in the translation to represent it. The word &#8220;daughter&#8221; is again a personification of the land (cf. BDB 123 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1514;</font> 3) and is here translated &#8220;people of Ammon&#8221; to make it easier for the modern reader to identify the referent. </p>
<A NAME="4913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2607><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The Lord Yahweh of armies.&#8221; For an explanation of the rendering here and of the significance of this title see the study note on 2:19.</p>

<A NAME="4918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2612><b>sn</b> <i>Edom</i> was a kingdom to the south and east of Judah. Its borders varied over time but basically Edom lay in the hundred mile strip between the Gulf of Aqaba on the south and the Zered River on the north. It straddled the Arabah leading down from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba, having as its northern neighbors both Judah and Moab. A long history of hostility existed between Israel and Edom, making Edom one of the favorite objects of the prophets&#8217; oracles of judgment (cf., e.g., Isa 21:11-12; 34:5-15; 63:1-6; Amos 1:11-12; Ezek 25:12-14; 35:1-15; Obad 1-16). Not much is known about Edom at this time other than the fact that they participated in the discussions regarding rebellion against Nebuchadnezzar in 594 <sc>b.c. According to Obadiah 10-16 they not only gloated over Judah&#8217;s downfall in 586 <sc>b.c. but participated in its plunder and killed some of those who were fleeing the country.</p>
<A NAME="4919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2613><b>sn</b> <i>Teman</i> was the name of one of Esau&#8217;s descendants, the name of an Edomite clan and the name of the district where they lived (Gen 36:11, 15, 34). Like the name Bozrah, it is used poetically for all of Edom (Jer 49:20; Ezek 25:13).</p>
<A NAME="4920"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2614><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Has counsel perished from men of understanding?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4921"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2615><b>tn</b> The meaning of this last word is based on the definition given in KBL 668 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1495;</font> Nif and <i>HALOT</i> 726 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1495;</font> Nif, which give the nuance &#8220;to be [or become] corrupt&#8221; rather than that of BDB 710 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1495;</font> Niph who give the nuance &#8220;let loose (i.e., to be dismissed; to be gone)&#8221; from a verb that is elsewhere used of the overhanging of a curtains or a cliff.</p>
<A NAME="4922"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2616><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;make deep to dwell.&#8221; The meaning of this phrase is debated. Some take it as a reference for the Dedanites who were not native to Edom to go down from the heights of Edom and go back home (so G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, T. G. Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52 </i>[WBC],<i> </i>330). The majority of commentaries, however, take it as a reference to the Dedanites disassociating themselves from the Edomites and finding remote hiding places to live in (so J. A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah </i>[NICOT], 718). For the options see W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah </i>(Hermeneia), 2:375.</p>
<A NAME="4923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2617><b>sn</b> <i>Dedan</i>. The Dedanites were an Arabian tribe who lived to the southeast of Edom. They are warned here to disassociate themselves from Edom because Edom is about to suffer disaster.</p>
<A NAME="4924"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2618><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;For I will bring the disaster of Esau upon him, the time when I will punish him.&#8221; Esau was the progenitor of the tribes and nation of Edom (cf. Gen 36:1, 8, 9, 19).</p>
<A NAME="4925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2619><b>tn</b> The translation of this verse is generally based on the parallels in Obad 5. There the second line has a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;</font> interrogative in front of it. The question can still be assumed because questions can be asked in Hebrew without a formal marker (cf. GKC 473 §150.<i>a</i> and BDB 519 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;</font> 1.a[e] and compare usage in 2 Kgs 5:26).</p>
<A NAME="4926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2620><b>tn</b> The tense and nuance of the verb translated &#8220;pillage&#8221; are both different than the verb in Obad 5. There the verb is the imperfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ganav</font>, &#8220;to steal&#8221;). Here the verb is the perfect of a verb which means to &#8220;ruin&#8221; or &#8220;spoil.&#8221; The English versions and commentaries, however, almost all render the verb here in much the same way as in Obad 5. The nuance must mean they only &#8220;ruin, destroy&#8221; (by stealing) only as much as they need (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;their sufficiency&#8221;), and the verb is used as metonymical substitute, effect for cause. The perfect must be some kind of a future perfect; &#8220;would they not have destroyed only&#8230;&#8221; The negative question is carried over by ellipsis from the preceding lines.</p>
<A NAME="4927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2621><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Their children and relatives will all be destroyed. And none of their neighbors will say, &#8216;Leave your orphans with me and I&#8217;ll keep them alive. Your widows can trust in me.&#8217;&#8221; This latter interpretation is based on a reading in a couple of the Greek versions (Symmachus and Lucian) and is accepted by a number of the modern commentaries, (J. Bright, J. A. Thompson, W. L. Holladay, and G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, T. G. Smothers). However, the majority of modern English versions do not follow it and lacking any other Hebrew or versional evidence it is probable that this is an interpretation to explain the mitigation of what appears as a prophecy of utter annihilation. There have been other cases in Jeremiah where a universal affirmation (either positive or negative) has been modified in the verses that follow. The verb in the second line <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1496;&#1464;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tivtakhu</font>) is highly unusual; it is a second masculine plural form with a feminine plural subject. The form is explained in GKC 127-28 §47.<i>k</i> and 160-61 §60.<i>a</i>, n. 1 as a pausal substitution for the normal form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1496;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tivtakhnah</font>) and a similar form in Ezek 37:7 cited as a parallel.</p>
<A NAME="4928"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2622><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;of my wrath&#8221; after &#8220;cup&#8221; in the first line and &#8220;from the cup of my wrath&#8221; in the last line are not in the text but are implicit in the metaphor.

Edom was certainly not one of the innocent victims as is clear from this judgment speech and those referred to in the study note on 49:7.</p>

The reference to &#8220;its towns&#8221; (translated here &#8220;all the towns around it&#8221;) could then be a reference to all the towns in Edom. It was located about twenty-five miles southeast of the southern end of the Dead Sea apparently in the district of Teman (see the parallelism in Amos 1:12).</p>

They have been supplied in the translation to mark the shift from the address of the messenger summoning the nations to prepare to do battle against Edom. The <sc>Lord is clearly the speaker (see the end of v. 16) and Edom is clearly the addressee. Such sudden shifts are common in Hebrew poetry, particularly Hebrew prophecy, but are extremely disruptive to a modern reader trying to follow the argument of a passage. TEV adds &#8220;The <sc>Lord said&#8221; and then retains third person throughout. CEV puts all of vv. 14-16 in the second person and uses indirect discourse in v. 15.</p>
<A NAME="4935"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2629><b>tn</b> The meaning of this Hebrew word (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1462;&#1510;&#1462;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tifletset</font>) is uncertain because it occurs only here. However, it is related to a verb root that refers to the shaking of the pillars (of the earth) in Job 9:6 and a noun (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1462;&#1510;&#1462;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mifletset</font>) that refers to &#8220;horror&#8221; or &#8220;shuddering&#8221; used in Job 21:6; Isa 21:4; Ezek 7:18; Ps 55:6.
