<A NAME="171"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1021><b>tn</b> The chapter division which was not a part of the original text but was added in the middle ages obscures the fact that there is no new speech here. The division may have resulted from the faulty identification of the &#8220;them&#8221; in the preceding verse. See the translator&#8217;s note on that verse.</p>
<A NAME="172"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1022><b>tn</b> The adjective &#8220;stone-hard&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text. It is implicit in the metaphor and is supplied in the translation for clarity. Cf. Ezek 11:19; 36:26; and Job 19:24 for the figure.</p>
<A NAME="173"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1023><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;adamant.&#8221; The word &#8220;diamond&#8221; is an accommodation to modern times. There is no evidence that diamond was known in ancient times. This hard stone (perhaps emery) became metaphorical for hardness; see Ezek 3:9 and Zech 7:12. For discussion see W. E. Staples, &#8220;Adamant,&#8221; <i>IDB</i> 1:45.</p>
<A NAME="174"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1024><b>tn</b> This verse has been restructured for the sake of the English poetry: <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The sin of Judah is engraved [or written] with an iron pen, inscribed with a point of a diamond [or adamant] upon the tablet of their hearts and on the horns of their altars.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> There is biting sarcasm involved in the use of the figures here. The law was inscribed on the tablets of stone by the &#8220;finger&#8221; of God (Exod 31:18; 32:16). Later under the new covenant it would be written on their hearts (Jer 31:33). Blood was to be applied to the horns of the altar in offering the sin offering (cf., e.g., Lev 4:7, 18, 25, 20) and on the bronze altar to cleanse it from sin on the Day of Atonement (Lev 16:18). Here their sins are engraved (permanently written, cf. Job 19:24) on their hearts (i.e., control their thoughts and actions) and on their altars (permanently polluting them).</p>
<A NAME="175"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1025><b>tn</b> It is difficult to convey in good English style the connection between this verse and the preceding. The text does not have a finite verb but a temporal preposition with an infinitive: <i>Heb</i> &#8220;while their children remember their altars&#8230;&#8221; It is also difficult to translate the verb &#8220;literally.&#8221; (i.e., what does &#8220;remember&#8221; their altars mean?). Hence it has been rendered &#8220;always think about.&#8221; Another possibility would be &#8220;have their altars&#8230;on their minds.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> There is possibly a sarcastic irony involved here as well. The Israelites were to remember the <sc>Lord and what he had done and were to commemorate certain days, e.g., the Passover and the Sabbath which recalled their deliverance. Instead they resorted to the pagan altars and kept them in mind.</p>
<A NAME="176"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1026><b>tc</b> This reading follows many Hebrew <sc>mss and ancient versions. Many other Hebrew <sc>mss read &#8220;your&#8221; [masc. pl.].</p>
<A NAME="177"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1027><b>sn</b> <i>Sacred poles dedicated to&#8230;Asherah</i>. A leading deity of the Canaanite pantheon was Asherah, wife/sister of El and goddess of fertility. She was commonly worshiped at shrines in or near groves of evergreen trees, or, failing that, at places marked by wooden poles (Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asherim</font>], plural). They were to be burned or cut down (Deut 7:5; 12:3; 16:21; Judg 6:25, 28, 30; 2 Kgs 18:4).</p>
<A NAME="178"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1028><b>tc</b> This reading follows some of the ancient versions. The MT reads, &#8220;hills. My mountain in the open field [alluding to Jerusalem] and your wealth&#8230;I will give.&#8221; The vocalization of the noun plus pronoun and the unusual form of the expression to allude to Jerusalem calls into question the originality of the MT. The MT reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1458;&#1512;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">harari</font>) which combines the suffix for a singular noun with a pointing of the noun in the plural, a form which would be without parallel (compare the forms in Ps 30:8 for the singular noun with suffix and Deut 8:9 for the plural noun with suffix). Likewise, Jerusalem was not &#8220;in the open field.&#8221; For a similar expression compare Jer 13:27.</p>
<A NAME="179"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1029><b>tc</b> Or &#8220;I will give away your wealth, all your treasures, and your places of worship&#8230;&#8221; The translation follows the emendation suggested in the footnote in <i>BHS</i>, reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bimkhir</font>) in place of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1465;&#1514;&#1462;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bamotekha</font>). The forms are graphically very close and one could explain the origin of either from the other. The parallel in 15:13-14 reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> bimkhir</font>). The text here may be a deliberate play on that one. The emended text makes decidedly better sense contextually than the MT unless some sardonic reference to their idolatry is intended.</p>
<A NAME="1710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1030><b>tc</b> Or &#8220;Through your own fault you will lose the land&#8230;&#8221; As W. McKane (<i>Jeremiah</i> [ICC], 1:386) notes the ancient versions do not appear to be reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">uvÿkha</font>) as in the MT but possibly <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿvaddÿkha</font>; see <i>BHS</i> fn). The translation follows the suggestion in <i>BHS</i> fn that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yadÿkha</font>, literally &#8220;your hand&#8221;) be read for MT <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;</font>. This has the advantage of fitting the idiom of this verb with &#8220;hand&#8221; in Deut 15:2 (see also v. 3 there). The Hebrew text thus reads &#8220;You will release your hand from your heritage.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1031><b>tc</b> A few Hebrew <sc>mss and two Greek <sc>mss read &#8220;a fire is kindled in my anger&#8221; (reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1491;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">qodkha</font>) as in 15:14 in place of &#8220;you have kindled a fire in my anger&#8221; (reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">qadakhtem</font>) in the majority of Hebrew <sc>mss and versions. The variant may be explained on the basis of harmonization with the parallel passage. </p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you have started a fire in my anger which will burn forever.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1032><b>sn</b> Verses 5-11 are a collection of wisdom-like sayings (cf. Ps 1) which set forth the theme of the two ways and their consequences. It has as its background the blessings and the curses of Deut 28 and the challenge to faith in Deut 29-30 which climaxes in Deut 30:15-20. The nation is sinful and God is weary of showing them patience. However, there is hope for individuals within the nation if they will trust in him.</p>
<A NAME="1713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1033><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;who make flesh their arm.&#8221; The &#8220;arm&#8221; is the symbol of strength and the flesh is the symbol of mortal man in relation to the omnipotent God. The translation &#8220;mere flesh and blood&#8221; reflects this.</p>
<A NAME="1714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1034><b>sn</b> In the psychology of ancient Hebrew thought the <i>heart</i> was the center not only of the emotions but of the thoughts and motivations. It was also the seat of moral conduct (cf. its placement in the middle of the discussion of moral conduct in Prov 4:20-27, i.e., in v. 23).</p>
<A NAME="1715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1035><b>tn</b> This word occurs only here and in Jer 48:6. It has been identified as a kind of juniper, which is a short shrub with minute leaves that look like scales. For a picture and more discussion see <i>Fauna and Flora of the Bible</i>, 131.</p>
<A NAME="1716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1036><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Blessed is the person who trusts in the <sc>Lord, and whose confidence is in the <sc>Lord.&#8221; However, because this is a statement of the <sc>Lord and the translation chooses to show that the blessing comes from him, the first person is substituted for the divine name.</p>
<A NAME="1717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1037><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;incurably deceitful&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;It is incurable.&#8221; For the word &#8220;deceitful&#8221; compare the usage of the verb in Gen 27:36 and a related noun in 2 Kgs 10:19. For the adjective &#8220;incurable&#8221; compare the usage in Jer 15:18. It is most commonly used with reference to wounds or of pain. In Jer 17:16 it is used metaphorically for a &#8220;woeful day&#8221; (i.e., day of irreparable devastation).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The background for this verse is Deut 29:18-19 (29:17-18 HT) and Deut 30:17.</p>
<A NAME="1718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1038><b>tn</b> The term rendered &#8220;mind&#8221; here and in the previous verse is actually the Hebrew word for &#8220;heart.&#8221; However, in combination with the word rendered &#8220;heart&#8221; in the next line, which is the Hebrew for &#8220;kidneys,&#8221; it is best rendered &#8220;mind&#8221; because the &#8220;heart&#8221; was considered the center of intellect, conscience, and will and the &#8220;kidneys&#8221; the center of emotions.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> For an earlier reference to this motif see Jer 11:20. For a later reference see Jer 20:12. See also Ps 17:2-3.</p>
<A NAME="1719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1039><b>tn</b> The meaning of this line is somewhat uncertain. The word translated &#8220;broods over&#8221; occurs only here and Isa 34:15. It is often defined on the basis of an Aramaic cognate which means &#8220;to gather&#8221; with an extended meaning of &#8220;to gather together under her to hatch.&#8221; Many commentators go back to a Rabbinic explanation that the partridge steals the eggs of other birds and hatches them out only to see the birds depart when they recognize that she is not the mother. Modern studies question the validity of this zoologically. Moreover, W. L. Holladay contests the validity on the basis of the wording &#8220;and she does hatch them&#8221; (<i>Heb </i>&#8220;bring them to birth&#8221;). See W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah </i>(Hermeneia), 1:498, and see also P. C. Craigie, P. H. Kelley, J. F. Drinkard, <i>Jeremiah 1-25 </i>(WBC),<i> </i>229. The point of the comparison is that the rich gather their wealth but they do not get to see the fruits of it.</p>
<A NAME="1720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1040><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text merely says &#8220;it.&#8221; But the antecedent might be ambiguous in English so the reference to wealth gained by unjust means is here reiterated for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1721"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1041><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he will be [= prove to be] a fool.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1722"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1042><b>tn</b> The words, &#8220;Then I said&#8221; are not in the text. They are supplied in the translation for clarity to show the shift in speaker.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The <sc>Lord is no longer threatening judgment but is being addressed. For a similar doxological interruption compare Jer 16:19-20.</p>
<A NAME="1723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1043><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;O glorious throne, O high place from the beginning, O hope of Israel, O <sc>Lord.&#8221; Commentators and translators generally understand these four lines (which are three in the Hebrew original) as two predications, one eulogizing the temple and the other eulogizing God. However, that does not fit the context very well and does not take into account the nature of Jeremiah&#8217;s doxology in Jeremiah 16:19-20 (and compare also 10:6-7). There the doxology is context motivated, focused on God, and calls on relevant attributes in the form of metaphorical epithets. That fits nicely here as well. For the relevant parallel passages see the study note.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> As King and Judge seated on his heavenly throne on high the <sc>Lord metes out justice. For examples of this motif see Jer 25:30; Ps 11:4; 9:4, 7 (9:5, 8 HT). As the place of sanctuary he offers refuge for those who are fleeing for safety. Ezek 11:16 and Isa 18:1-4 are examples of passages using that motif. Finally, the <sc>Lord has been referred to earlier as the object of Israel&#8217;s hope (Jer 14:8). All of these are relevant to the choices that the <sc>Lord has placed before them, trust or turn away, and the threat that as all-knowing Judge he will reward people according to their behavior.</p>
<A NAME="1724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1044><b>tc</b> The translation is based on an emendation suggested in W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah </i>(Hermeneia), 1:500, n. b-b. The emendation involves following the reading preferred by the Masoretes (the <i>Qere</i>) and understanding the preposition with the following word as a corruption of the suffix on it. Thus the present translation reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1462;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464; &#1488;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">usurekha </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">erets</font>) instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1463;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">usuray ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">erets</font>, &#8220;and those who leave me will be written in the earth&#8221;), a reading which is highly improbable since all the other pronouns are second singular.</p>
<A NAME="1725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1045><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;to the world of the dead.&#8221; An alternative interpretation is: &#8220;will be as though their names were written in the dust&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;will be written in the dust.&#8221; The translation follows the nuance of &#8220;earth&#8221; listed in <i>HALOT</i> 88 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</font> 4 and found in Jonah 2:6 (2:7 HT); Job 10:21-22. For the nuance of &#8220;enrolling, registering among the number&#8221; for the verb translated here &#8220;consign&#8221; see BDB 507 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1489;</font> Qal.3 and 508 s.v. Niph.2 and compare usage in Ezek 13:9 and Ps 69:28 (69:29 HT). </p>
<A NAME="1726"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1046><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The fountain of living water.&#8221; For an earlier use of this metaphor and the explanation of it see Jer 2:13 and the notes there. There does not appear to be any way to retain this metaphor in the text without explaining it. In the earlier text the context would show that literal water was not involved. Here it might still be assumed that the <sc>Lord merely gives life-giving water.</p>
<A NAME="1727"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1047><b>tn</b> The translation fills in the details of the metaphor from a preceding context (15:18) and from the following context (17:18). The literal translation &#8220;Heal me and I will be healed. Rescue me and I will be rescued.&#8221; does not make much sense if these details are not filled in. The metaphor is filled in for clarity for the average reader.</p>
<A NAME="1728"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1048><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Behold, they are saying to me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1049><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Where is the word of the <sc>Lord. Let it come [or come to pass] please.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1730"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1050><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I have not run after you for the sake of disaster.&#8221; The translation follows the suggestion of some ancient versions. The Hebrew text reads &#8220;I have not run from being a shepherd after you.&#8221; The translation follows two Greek versions (Aquila and Symmachus) and the Syriac in reading the word &#8220;evil&#8221; or &#8220;disaster&#8221; here in place of the word &#8220;shepherd&#8221; in the Hebrew text. The issue is mainly one of vocalization. The versions mentioned are reading a form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mera</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>) instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1512;&#1465;&#1506;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mero</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eh</font>). There does not appear to be any clear case of a prophet being called a shepherd, especially in Jeremiah where it is invariably used of the wicked leaders/rulers of Judah, the leaders/rulers of the enemy that he brings to punish them, or the righteous ruler that he will bring in the future. Moreover, there are no cases where the preposition &#8220;after&#8221; is used with the verb &#8220;shepherd.&#8221; Parallelism also argues for the appropriateness of this reading; &#8220;disaster&#8221; parallels the &#8220;incurable day.&#8221; The thought also parallels the argument thus far. Other than 11:20; 12:3; 15:15 where he has prayed for vindication by the <sc>Lord punishing his persecutors as they deserve, he has invariably responded to the <sc>Lord&#8217;s word of disaster with laments and prayers for his people (see 4:19-21; 6:24; 8:18; 10:19-25; 14:7-9, 19-22).</p>

<A NAME="1735"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1055><b>sn</b> Observance of the Sabbath day (and the Sabbatical year) appears to have been a litmus test of the nation&#8217;s spirituality since it is mentioned in a number of passages besides this one (cf., e.g., Isa 56:2, 6; 58:13; Neh 13:15-18). Perhaps this is because the Sabbath day was the sign of the Mosaic covenant (Exod 31:13-17) just as the rainbow was the sign of the Noahic covenant (Gen 9:12, 13, 17) and circumcision was the sign of the Abrahamic covenant (Gen 17:11). This was not the only command they failed to obey, nor was their failure to obey this one the sole determining factor in the <sc>Lord&#8217;s decision to destroy Judah (cf. 7:23- 24; 11:7-8 in their contexts).</p>

Some identify it with the Benjamin Gate mentioned in Jer 37:13; 38:7 (cf. NAB), but there is no textual support for this in the Hebrew Bible or in any of the ancient versions.</p>

Elsewhere the verb &#8220;be careful&#8221; is used with the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lamed</font>) in the sense of the reflexive. Hence the word &#8220;soul&#8221; cannot be simply reflexive here. BDB 1037 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;</font> Niph.1 understands this as a case where the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font> introduces the cost or price (cf. BDB 90 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;</font> III.3.a).</p>
<A NAME="1741"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1061><b>sn</b> Comparison with Neh 13:15-18 suggests that these loads were merchandise or agricultural produce which were being brought in for sale. The loads that were carried out of the houses in the next verse were probably goods for barter.</p>
<A NAME="1742"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1062><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;carry loads on the Sabbath and bring [them] in through.&#8221; The two verbs &#8220;carry&#8221; and &#8220;bring in&#8221; are an example of hendiadys (see the note on &#8220;Be careful&#8230;by carrying&#8221;). This is supported by the next line where only &#8220;carry out&#8221; of the houses is mentioned.</p>
<A NAME="1743"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1063><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Do not carry any loads out of your houses on the Sabbath day and do not do any work.&#8221; Translating literally might give the wrong impression that they were not to work at all. The phrase &#8220;on the Sabbath day&#8221; is, of course, intended to qualify both prohibitions.</p>
<A NAME="1744"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1064><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;But sanctify [or set apart as sacred] the Sabbath day.&#8221; The idea of setting it apart as something sacred to the <sc>Lord is implicit in the command. See the explicit statements of this in Exod 20:10; 31:5; 35:2; Lev 24:8. For some readers the idea of treating the Sabbath day as something sacred won&#8217;t mean much without spelling the qualification out specifically. Sabbath observance was not just a matter of not working.</p>
<A NAME="1745"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1065><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fathers.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1746"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1066><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;They.&#8221; The antecedent is spelled out to avoid any possible confusion.</p>
<A NAME="1747"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1067><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;They hardened [or made stiff] their neck so as not to.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1749"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1069><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;If you will carefully obey me by not bringing&#8230;and by sanctifying&#8230;by not doing&#8230;, then kings will&#8230;.&#8221; The structure of prohibitions and commands followed by a brief &#8220;if&#8221; clause has been used to break up a long condition and consequence relationship which is contrary to contemporary English style.</p>
<A NAME="1750"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1070><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;who sit [or are to sit] on David&#8217;s throne.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1751"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1071><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;There will come through the gates of this city the kings and princes&#8230;riding in chariots and on horses, they and their officials&#8230;&#8221; The structure of the original text is broken up here because of the long compound subject which would make the English sentence too long. The term &#8220;princes&#8221; is often omitted as a supposed double writing of the word that follows it and looks somewhat like it (the Hebrew reads here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; &#1497;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">vÿsarim yoshÿvim</font>) or the same word which occurs later in the verse and is translated &#8220;officials&#8221; (the word can refer to either). It is argued that &#8220;princes&#8221; are never said to sit on the throne of David (translated here &#8220;follow in the succession of David&#8221;). However, the word is in all texts and versions and the concept of sitting on the throne of someone is descriptive of both past, present, and future and is even used with the participle in a proleptic sense of &#8220;the one who is to sit on the throne&#8221; (cf. Exod 11:5; 12:29).</p>
