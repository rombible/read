<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1189><b>sn</b> <i>Zedekiah</i> was the last king of Judah. He ruled from 597 <sc>b.c. when he was placed on the throne by Nebuchadnezzar (2 Kgs 24:17) until the fall of Jerusalem in 587/6 <sc>b.c. He acquiesced to some of his anti-Babylonian counselors, rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar, and sought help from the Egyptians (Ezek 17:12-15). This brought Nebuchadnezzar against the city in 588 <sc>b.c. This is the first of two delegations to Jeremiah. The later one was sent after Nebuchadnezzar withdrew to take care of the Egyptian threat (cf. Jer 37:1-9). </p>
