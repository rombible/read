<A NAME="2123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1210><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;The <sc>Lord told me to say&#8221; are not in the text. They have been supplied in the translation for clarity. This text has been treated in two very different ways depending upon how one views the connection of the words &#8220;and to/concerning the household of the King of Judah, &#8216;Hear the word of the <sc>Lord:&#8230;&#8217;&#8221; with the preceding and following. Some treat the words that follow as a continuation of Jeremiah&#8217;s response to the delegation sent by Zedekiah (cf. vv. 3, 8). Others treat this as introducing a new set of oracles parallel to those in 23:9-40 which are introduced by the heading &#8220;to/concerning the prophets.&#8221; There are three reasons why this is the more probable connection: (1) the parallelism in expression with 23:9; (2) the other introductions in vv. 3, 8 use the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>) instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿ</font>) used here, and they have the formal introduction &#8220;you shall say&#8230;&#8221;; (3) the warning or challenge here would mitigate the judgment pronounced on the king and the city in vv. 4-7. Verses 8-9 are different. They are not a mitigation but an offer of escape for those who surrender. Hence, these words are a title &#8220;Now concerning the royal court.&#8221; (The <i>vav</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>] that introduces this is disjunctive = &#8220;Now.&#8221;) However, since the imperative that follows is masculine plural and addressed to the royal house, something needs to be added to introduce it. Hence the translation supplies &#8220;The <sc>Lord told me to say&#8221; to avoid confusion or mistakenly connecting it with the preceding.</p>
