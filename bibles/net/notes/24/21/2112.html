<A NAME="2112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1199><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;with outstretched hand and with strong arm.&#8221; These are, of course, figurative of God&#8217;s power and might. He does not literally have hands and arms.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The phrases in this order are unique but a very similar phrase &#8220;by strong hand and outstretched arm&#8221; are found several times with reference to God&#8217;s mighty power unleashed against Egypt at the exodus (cf., Deut 4:34; 5:15; 26:8; Jer 32:21; Ps 136:12). Instead of being directed at Israel&#8217;s enemies it will now be directed against her. </p>
