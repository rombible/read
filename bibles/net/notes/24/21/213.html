<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1190><b>sn</b> The <i>Pashhur son of Malkijah</i> referred to here is not the same as the Pashhur referred to in 20:1-6 who was the son of Immer. This Pashhur is referred to later in 38:1. The <i>Zephaniah</i> referred to here was the chief of security referred to later in Jer 29:25-26. He appears to have been favorably disposed toward Jeremiah.</p>
