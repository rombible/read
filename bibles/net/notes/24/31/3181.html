It involves an acknowledgment of his sovereignty and whole hearted commitment to obedience to him. This is perhaps best seen in the parallelisms in Hos 4:1; 6:6 where &#8220;the knowledge of God&#8221; is parallel with faithfulness and steadfast love and in the context of Hos 4 refers to obedience to the <sc>Lord&#8217;s commands.</p>
