<A NAME="3140"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1791><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;because I bear the reproach of my youth.&#8221; For the plural referents see the note at the beginning of v. 18.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The expression <i>the disgraceful things we did in our earlier history</i> refers to the disgrace that accompanied the sins that Israel did in her earlier years before she learned the painful lesson of submission to the <sc>Lord through the discipline of exile. For earlier references to the sins of her youth (i.e., in her earlier years as a nation) see 3:24-25; 22:21 and see also 32:29. At the time that these verses were written, neither northern Israel or Judah had expressed the kind of contrition voiced in vv. 18-19. As one commentator notes, the words here are both prophetic and instructive.</p>
