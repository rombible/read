<A NAME="3114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1765><b>tc</b> Or &#8220;The <sc>Lord will rescue his people. He will deliver those of Israel who remain alive.&#8221; The translation used in the text follows the Hebrew: &#8220;Rescue your people, O <sc>Lord, the remnant of Israel.&#8221; The alternate translation which is preferred by several modern English versions (e.g., REB, TEV) and a majority of modern commentaries (see, e.g., J. A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah </i>[NICOT], 569; J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah </i>[AB], 273, n. s-s) follows the reading of the Greek version and the Aramaic Targum and appears more appropriate to the context of praise presupposed by the preceding imperatives. The difference in the two readings are the omission of one vowel letter and the confusion of a final <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kaf</font>) and a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">holem-vav</font>) which are very similar in form. (The Greek presupposes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1506;&#1463; &#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492; &#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;</font> [<font face="Scholar">hoshi</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">a yÿhvah </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et-</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ammo</font>] for the Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1506; &#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492; &#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1456;</font> [<font face="Scholar">hosha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> yÿhvah </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et-</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ammÿkh</font>].) The key to a decision here is the shift from the verbs of praise to the imperative &#8220;say&#8221; which introduces the quotation; there is a shift from praise to petition. The shift in mood is not uncommon, occurring, for example, in Ps 118:25 and 126:4; it is the shift in mood between praise for what has begun to petition for what is further hoped for. It is easier to explain the origin contextually of the Greek and Targum than it is the Hebrew text, thus the Greek and Targum are probably a secondary smoothing of the text (this is the decision of the D. Barthélemy, ed., <i>Preliminary and Interim Report on the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project</i>, 4:263). The mood of prayer also shows up in v. 9 and again in vv. 17-18.</p>
