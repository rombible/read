<A NAME="3193"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">93</span><note=1844><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the city will be built to [or for] the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The words &#8220;of Jerusalem&#8221; are not in the text but are implicit from the context. They have been supplied in the translation for clarity. However, the word occurs in a first person speech so the translation has accommodated the switch in person as it has in a number of other places (compare also NIV, TEV, ICV).</p>
