<A NAME="3123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1774><b>tc</b> The translation follows the reading of the LXX (Greek version). The Hebrew reads &#8220;will dance and be glad, young men and old men together.&#8221; The Greek version presupposes a Qal imperfect of a rare verb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</font> [<font face="Scholar">yakhdu</font>] from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">khadah</font>]; see BDB 292 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font> Qal) as opposed to the Hebrew text which reads a common adverb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yakhdav</font>). The consonantal text is the same but the vocalization is different. There are no other examples of the syntax of the adverb used this way (i.e., of a compound subject added to a third subject) and the vocalization of the Hebrew text can be explained on the basis of a scribe misvocalizing the text based on his greater familiarity with the adverb.</p>
