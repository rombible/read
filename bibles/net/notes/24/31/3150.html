<A NAME="3150"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1801><b><i>sn</i></b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;create.&#8221; This word is always used with God as the subject and refers to the production of something new or unique, like the creation of the world and the first man and woman (Gen 1:1; 2:3; 1:27; 5:1) or the creation of a new heavens and a new earth in a new age (Isa 65:17), or the bringing about of new and unique circumstances (Num 16:30). Here reference is made contextually to the new exodus, that marvelous deliverance which will be so great that the old will pale in comparison (see the first note on v. 9).</p>
