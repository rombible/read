<A NAME="3179"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">79</span><note=1830><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;and minds&#8221; is not in the text but is supplied in the translation to bring the English psychology more into line with the Hebrew where the &#8220;heart&#8221; is the center both of knowing/thinking/reflecting and deciding/willing.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Two contexts are relevant for understanding this statement. First is the context of the first or old covenant which was characterized by a law written on stone tablets (e.g., Exod 32:15-16; 34:1, 28; Deut 4:13; 5:22; 9:10) or in a &#8220;book&#8221; or &#8220;scroll&#8221; (Deut 31:9-13) which could be lost (cf. 2 Kgs 22:8), forgotten (Hos 4:6), ignored (Jer 6:19; Amos 4:2), or altered (Jer 8:8). Second is the context of the repeated fault that Jeremiah has found with their stubborn (3:17; 7:24; 9:14; 11:8; 13:10; 16:12; 18:12; 23:17), uncircumcised (4:4; 9:26), and desperately wicked hearts (4:4; 17:9). Radical changes were necessary to get the people to obey the law from the heart and not just pay superficial or lip service to it (3:10; 12:2). Deut 30:1-6; Ezek 11:17-20; 36:24-28 speak of these radical changes. The <sc>Lord will remove the &#8220;foreskin&#8221; of their heart and give them a circumcised heart, or take away their &#8220;stony&#8221; heart and give them a new heart. With this heart they will be able to obey his laws, statutes, ordinances, and commands (Deut 30:8; Ezek 11:20; 36:27). The new covenant does not entail a new law; it is the same law that Jeremiah has repeatedly accused them of rejecting or ignoring (6:19; 9:13; 16:11; 26:4; 44:10). What does change is their inner commitment to keep it. Jeremiah has already referred to this in Jer 24:7 and will refer to it again in Jer 32:39.</p>
