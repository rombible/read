<A NAME="311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1752><b>sn</b> This verse repeats v. 22 but with specific reference to <i>all the clans of Israel</i>, i.e., to all Israel and Judah. It functions here as a transition to the next section which will deal with the restoration of Israel (31:3-20) and Judah (31:21-25) and their reunification in the land (31:27-29) under a new covenant relation with God (31:31-37). See also the study note on 30:3 for further reference to this reunification in Jeremiah and the other prophets.</p>
