<A NAME="3161"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=1812><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Behold, the days are coming and [= when] I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of people and of animals.&#8221; For the significance of the metaphor see the study note.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The metaphor used here presupposes that drawn in Hos 2:23 (2:25 HT) which is in turn based on the wordplay with Jezreel (meaning &#8220;God sows&#8221;) in Hos 2:22. The figure is that of plant seed in the ground which produces a crop; here what are sown are the &#8220;seeds of people and animals.&#8221; For a similar picture of the repopulating of Israel and Judah see Ezek 36:10-11. The promise here reverses the scene of devastation that Jeremiah had depicted apocalyptically and hyperbolically in Jer 4:23-29 as judgment for Judah&#8217;s sins.</p>
