<A NAME="3118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1769><b>sn</b> <i>Ephraim</i> was the second son of Joseph who was elevated to a place of prominence in the family of Jacob by the patriarch&#8217;s special blessing. It was the strongest tribe in northern Israel and Samaria lay in its territory. It is often used as a poetic parallel for Israel as here. The poetry is not speaking of two separate entities here; it is a way of repeating an idea for emphasis. Moreover, there is no intent to show special preference for northern Israel over Judah. All Israel is metaphorically God&#8217;s son and the object of his special care and concern (Exod 4:22; Deut 32:6).</p>
