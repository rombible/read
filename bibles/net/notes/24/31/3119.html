<A NAME="3119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1770><b>sn</b> Two rather theologically significant metaphors are used in this verse. The Hebrew word translated &#8220;will set&#8230;free&#8221; is a word used in the legal sphere for paying a redemption price to secure the freedom of a person or thing (see, e.g., Exod 13:13, 15). It is used metaphorically and theologically to refer to Israel&#8217;s deliverance from Egyptian bondage (Deut 15:15; Mic 6:4) and its deliverance from Babylonian exile (Isa 35:10). The word translated &#8220;secure their release&#8221; is a word used in the sphere of family responsibility where a person paid the price to free an indentured relative (Lev 25:48, 49) or paid the price to restore a relative&#8217;s property seized to pay a debt (Lev 25:25, 33). This word, too, was used to refer metaphorically and theologically to Israel&#8217;s deliverance from Egyptian bondage (Exod 6:6) or release from Babylonian exile (Isa 43:1-4; 44:22). These words are traditionally translated &#8220;ransom&#8221; and &#8220;redeem&#8221; and are a part of traditional Jewish and Christian vocabulary for physical and spiritual deliverance.</p>
