<A NAME="3156"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=1807><b>tn</b> The translation &#8220;those who move about with their flocks&#8221; is based on an emendation of the Hebrew text which reads a third plural Qal perfect (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1505;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nos</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">u</font>) to a masculine plural Qal participle in the construct (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1465;&#1505;&#1456;&#1506;&#1461;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nosÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">e</font>) as suggested in the <i>BHS</i> fn. For the use of the construct participle before a noun with a preposition see GKC 421 §130.<i>a</i>. It is generally agreed that three classes of people are referred to here, townspeople, farmers, and shepherds. But the syntax of the Hebrew sentence is a little awkward: &#8220;And they [i.e., &#8220;people&#8221; (the indefinite plural, GKC 460 §144.<i>g</i>)] will live in it, Judah and all its cities [an apposition of nearer definition (GKC 425-26 §131.<i>n</i>)], [along with] farmers and those who move about with their flocks.&#8221; The first line refers awkwardly to the townspeople and the other two classes are added asyndetically (i.e., without the conjunction &#8220;and&#8221;).</p>
