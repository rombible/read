<A NAME="3137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1788><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Bring me back in order that I may come back.&#8221; For the use of the plural pronouns see the marginal note at the beginning of the verse. The verb &#8220;bring back&#8221; and &#8220;come back&#8221; are from the same root in two different verbal stems and in the context express the idea of spiritual repentance and restoration of relationship not physical return to the land. (See BDB 999 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font> Hiph.2.a for the first verb and 997 s.v. Qal.6.c for the second.) For the use of the cohortative to express purpose after the imperative see GKC 320 §108.<i>d</i> or <i>IBHS</i> 575 §34.5.2b.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> There is a wordplay on several different nuances of the same Hebrew verb in vv. 16-19. The Hebrew verb <i>shub</i> refers both to their turning away from God (v. 19) and to their turning back to him (v. 18). It is also the word that is used for their return to their homeland (vv. 16-17).</p>
