<A NAME="3158"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=1809><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;When I, Jeremiah, heard this, I woke up and looked around. My sleep had been very pleasant.&#8221; The text is somewhat enigmatic. It has often been explained as an indication that Jeremiah had received this communication (30:3&#8211;31:26) while in a prophetic trance (compare Dan 10:9). However, there is no other indication that this is a vision or a vision report. G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, and T. G. Smothers (<i>Jeremiah 26-52 </i>[WBC],<i> </i>124, 128-29) suggest that this is a speech of the restored (and refreshed) exiles like that which is formally introduced in v. 23. This speech, however, is not formally introduced. This interpretation is also reflected in TEV, CEV and is accepted here as fitting the context better and demanding less presuppositions. The Hebrew text reads literally, &#8220;Upon this I awoke and looked and my sleep was sweet to me.&#8221; Keown, Scalise, and Smothers have the best discussion of these two options as well as several other options.</p>
