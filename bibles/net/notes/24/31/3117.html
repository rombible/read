<A NAME="3117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1768><b>sn</b> Jer 31:8-9 are reminiscent of the &#8220;New Exodus&#8221; motif of Isa 40-66 which has already been referred to in Jer 16:14-15; 23:7-8. See especially Isa 35:3-10; 40:3-5, 11; 41:17-20; 42:14-17; 43:16-21; 49:9-13. As there, the New Exodus will so outstrip the old that the old will pale in comparison and be almost forgotten (see Jer 23:7-8).</p>
