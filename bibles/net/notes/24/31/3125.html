<A NAME="3125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1776><b>sn</b> <i>Ramah</i> is a town in Benjamin approximately five miles (8 km) north of Jerusalem. It was on the road between Bethel and Bethlehem. Traditionally, Rachel&#8217;s tomb was located near there at a place called Zelzah (1 Sam 10:2). Rachel was the mother of Joseph and Benjamin and was very concerned about having children because she was barren (Gen 30:1-2) and went to great lengths to have them (Gen 30:3, 14-15, 22-24). She was the grandmother of Ephraim and Manasseh which were two of the major tribes in northern Israel. Here Rachel is viewed metaphorically as weeping for her &#8220;children,&#8221; the descendants of Ephraim and Manasseh, who had been carried away into captivity in 722 <sc>b.c.</p>
