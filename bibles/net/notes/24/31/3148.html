<A NAME="3148"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1799><b>sn</b> Israel&#8217;s backsliding is forgotten and forgiven. They had once been characterized as an apostate people (3:14, 22; the word &#8220;apostate&#8221; and &#8220;unfaithful&#8221; are the same in Hebrew) and figuratively depicted as an adulterous wife (3:20). Now they are viewed as having responded to his invitation (compare 31:18-19 with 3:22-25). Hence they are no longer depicted as an unfaithful daughter but as an unsullied virgin (see the literal translation of &#8220;my dear children&#8221; in vv. 4, 21 and the study note on v. 4.)</p>
