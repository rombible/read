<A NAME="314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1755><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;The people of Israel who survived the onslaughts of Egypt and Amalek found favor in the wilderness as they journeyed to find rest. At that time long ago the <sc>Lord manifested himself to them. He said, &#8216;I have&#8230;That is why I have drawn you to myself through my unfailing kindness.&#8217;&#8221; For the basis for each of these translations see the translator&#8217;s note. There is debate whether the reference here is to God&#8217;s preservation of Israel during their wandering in the Sinai desert or his promise to protect and preserve them on their return through the Arabian desert on the way back from Assyria and Babylon (see e.g., Isa 42:14-16; 43:16-21; Jer 16:14-15; 23:7-8). The only finite verbs in vv. 2-3a before the introduction of the quote are perfects which can denote either a past act or a future act viewed as certain of fulfillment (the prophetic perfect; see GKC 312-13 §106.<i>n</i> and see examples in Jer 11:16; 13:17; 25:14; 28:4). The phrase at the beginning of v. 3 can either refer to temporal (cf. BDB 935 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1511;</font> 2.b and Isa 22:11) or spatial distance (cf. BDB 935 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1511;</font> 2.a[2] and Isa 5:29; 59:14). The verb in the final clause in v. 3 can refer to either the continuance of God&#8217;s love as in Ps 36:10 (cf. BDB 604 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> Qal.5) or drawing someone to him in electing, caring love as in Hos 11:4 (cf. BDB 604 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> Qal.1). The translation has opted for the prophetic reference to future deliverance because of the preceding context, the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1512;&#1464;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">merakhoq</font>) to refer to the far off land of exile in Jer 30:10; 46:27; 51:50, and the reference to survivors from the sword being called on to remember the <sc>Lord in that far off land in 51:50.</p>
