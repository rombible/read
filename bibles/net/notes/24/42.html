<A NAME="421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2323><b>sn</b> <i>Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah</i> may have been the same as the Jezaniah son of the Maacathite mentioned in 40:8. The title &#8220;the Maacathite&#8221; would identify the locality from which his father came, i.e., a region in northern Transjordan east of Lake Huleh. Many think he is also the same man who is named &#8220;Azariah&#8221; in Jer 43:2 (the Greek version has Azariah both here and in 43:2). It was not uncommon for one man to have two names, e.g., Uzziah who was also named Azariah (compare 2 Kgs 14:21 with 2 Chr 26:1).</p>
<A NAME="422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2324><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;without distinction,&#8221; or &#8220;All the people from the least important to the most important&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from the least to the greatest.&#8221; This is a figure of speech that uses polar opposites as an all-inclusive designation of everyone without exception (i.e., it included all the people from the least important or poorest to the most important or richest.)</p>
<A NAME="423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2325><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;please let our petition fall before you.&#8221; For the idiom here see 37:20 and the translator&#8217;s note there.</p>
<A NAME="424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2326><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;on behalf of us, [that is] on behalf of all this remnant.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This refers to the small remnant of people who were left of those from Mizpah who had been taken captive by Ishmael after he had killed Gedaliah and who had been rescued from him at Gibeon. There were other Judeans still left in the land of Judah who had not been killed or deported by the Babylonians.</p>
<A NAME="425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2327><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;For we are left a few from the many as your eyes are seeing us.&#8221; The words &#8220;used to be&#8221; are not in the text but are implicit. These words are supplied in the translation for clarity and smoothness of English style.</p>
<A NAME="426"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2328><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I have heard&#8221; = &#8220;I agree.&#8221; For this nuance of the verb see BDB 1034 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;</font> Qal.1.j and compare the usage in Gen 37:27 and Judg 11:17 listed there.</p>
<A NAME="427"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2329><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all the word which the <sc>Lord will answer you.</p>
<A NAME="428"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2330><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;do according to all the word which.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="429"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2331><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Whether good or whether evil we will hearken to the voice of the <sc>Lord our God to whom we are sending you in order that it may go well for us because/when we hearken to the voice of the <sc>Lord our God.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;whether good or whether evil&#8221; is an abbreviated form of the idiomatic expressions &#8220;to be good in the eyes of&#8221; = &#8220;to be pleasing to&#8221; (BDB 374 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;</font> 2.f and see 1 Kgs 21:2) and &#8220;to be bad in the eyes of&#8221; = &#8220;to be displeasing to&#8221; (BDB 948 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1506;</font> 3 and see Num 22:34). The longer Hebrew sentence has been broken down and restructured to better conform with contemporary English style.</p>
<A NAME="4210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2332><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;without distinction,&#8221; or &#8220;All the people from the least important to the most important&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from the least to the greatest.&#8221; This is a figure of speech that uses polar opposites as an all-inclusive designation of everyone without exception (i.e., it included all the people from the least important or poorest to the most important or richest.)</p>
<A NAME="4211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2333><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Thus says the <sc>Lord God of Israel to whom you sent me to present your petition before him, &#8216;&#8230;&#8217;&#8221; The sentence has been restructured to cut down on the length of the introduction leading in to the long quote.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Their &#8220;request&#8221; is that Jeremiah would tell them where to go and what to do (v. 3).</p>
<A NAME="4212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2334><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;just&#8221; is intended to reflect the infinitive absolute before the finite verb emphasizing here the condition rather than the verb root (see Joüon 2:423 §123.g, and compare the usage in Exod 15:26). The form looks like the infinitive absolute of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shuv</font>), but all the versions interpret it as though it is from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yashav</font>) which is the root of the verb that follows it. Either this is a textual error of the loss of a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yod</font>) or this is one of the cases that GKC 69 §19.<i>i</i> list as the possible loss of a weak consonant at the beginning of a word.</p>
<A NAME="4213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2335><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I will firmly plant you in the land,&#8221; or &#8220;I will establish you.&#8221; This is part of the metaphor that has been used of God (re)establishing Israel in the land. See 24:6; 31:28; 32:41.</p>
<A NAME="4214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2336><b>sn</b> See Jer 41:18 for their reason for fear.</p>
<A NAME="4215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2337><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;oracle of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2338><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;see [or experience] war.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2339><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;hear the sound of the trumpet.&#8221; The trumpet was used to gather the troops and to sound the alarm for battle.</p>
<A NAME="4218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2340><b>tn</b> Jer 42:13-14 are a long complex condition (protasis) whose consequence (apodosis) does not begin until v. 15. The Hebrew text of vv. 13-14 reads: <b>42:13</b> &#8220;But if you say [or continue to say (the form is a participle)], &#8216;We will not stay in this land&#8217; with the result that you do not obey [or &#8220;more literally, do not hearken to the voice of] the <sc>Lord your God, <b>42:14</b> saying, &#8216;No, but to the land of Egypt we will go where we&#8230;and there we will live,&#8217; <b>42:15</b> now therefore hear the word of the <sc>Lord&#8230;&#8221; The sentence has been broken up and restructured to better conform with contemporary English style but an attempt has been made to maintain the contingencies and the qualifiers that are in the longer Hebrew original.</p>
<A NAME="4219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2341><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Yahweh of armies, the God of Israel.&#8221; See the study note on 2:19 for the translation and significance of this title.</p>
<A NAME="4220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2342><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;set your face to.&#8221; See Jer 42:17; 44:11; Dan 11:17; 2 Kgs 12:17 (12:18 HT) for parallel usage.</p>
<A NAME="4221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2343><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;will follow you right into Egypt,&#8221; or &#8220;will dog your steps all the way to Egypt&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;cling after.&#8221; This is the only case of this verb with this preposition in the Qal stem. However, it is used with this preposition several times in the Hiphil, all with the meaning of &#8220;to pursue closely.&#8221; See BDB 180 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1511;</font> Hiph.2 and compare Judg 20:45; 1 Sam 14:22; 1 Chr 10:2.</p>
<A NAME="4222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2344><b>tn</b> The repetition of the adverb &#8220;there&#8221; in the translation of vv. 14, 16 is to draw attention to the rhetorical emphasis on the locale of Egypt in the original text of both v. 14 and v. 16. In v. 14 they say, &#8220;to the land of Egypt we will go&#8230;and there we will live.&#8221; In v. 16 God says, &#8220;wars&#8230;there will catch up with you&#8230;the hunger&#8230;there will follow after you&#8230;and there you will die.&#8221; God rhetorically denies their focus on Egypt as a place of safety and of relative prosperity. That can only be found in Judah under the protective presence of the <sc>Lord (vv. 10-12).</p>
<A NAME="4223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2345><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Indeed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2346><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Yahweh of armies, the God of Israel.&#8221; See the study note on 2:19 for the translation and significance of this title.</p>
<A NAME="4225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2347><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="4226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2348><b>tn</b> See the study note on 24:9 and the usage in 29:22 for the meaning and significance of this last phrase.</p>
<A NAME="4227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2349><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;land.&#8221; The reference is, of course, to the land of Judah.</p>
<A NAME="4228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2350><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Know for certain that I warn you&#8230;&#8221; The idea of &#8220;for certain&#8221; is intended to reflect the emphatic use of the infinitive absolute before the volitive use of the imperfect (see <i>IBHS</i> 587-88 §35.3.1h and 509 §31.5b). The substitution &#8220;of this:&#8221; for &#8220;that&#8221; has been made to shorten the sentence in conformity with contemporary English style.</p>
<A NAME="4229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2351><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;today.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2352><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you are erring at the cost of your own lives&#8221; (BDB 1073 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> Hiph.3 and <i>HALOT</i> 1626 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> Hif 4, and cf. BDB 90 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font> 3 and see parallels in 1 Kgs 2:23; 2 Sam 23:17 for the nuance of &#8220;at the cost of your lives&#8221;). This fits the context better than &#8220;you are deceiving yourselves&#8221; (KBL 1035 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> Hif 4). The reading here follows the <i>Qere</i> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1506;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hit</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">etem</font>) rather than the <i>Kethib</i> which has a metathesis of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yod</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tav</font>), i.e., <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1506;&#1461;&#1514;&#1462;&#1497;&#1501;</font>. The Greek text presupposes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1458;&#1512;&#1461;&#1506;&#1465;&#1514;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hare</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">otem</font>, &#8220;you have done evil&#8221;), but that reading is generally rejected as secondary.</p>
<A NAME="4231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2353><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;According to all which the <sc>Lord our God says so tell us and we will do.&#8221; The restructuring of the sentence is intended to better reflect contemporary English style.</p>
<A NAME="4232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2354><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Today.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2355><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;what he said&#8221; are not in the text but are implicit and seem necessary for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="4234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2356><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;But you have not hearkened to the voice of [idiomatic for &#8220;obeyed&#8221; see BDB 1034 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;</font> Qal.1.m] the <sc>Lord your God, namely [cf. BDB 252 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;</font> 1.b] with respect [cf. BDB 514 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font> 5.f(c)] all which he has sent to us.&#8221; The verb is translated &#8220;don&#8217;t seem to want to obey&#8221; because they have not yet expressed their refusal or their actual disobedience. Several commentaries sensing this apparent discrepancy suggest that 42:19-22 are to be transposed after 43:1-3 (see, e.g., <i>BHS</i> note 18a, W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah </i>[Hermeneia], 2:275; J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah </i>[AB], 252, 256, 258). However, there is absolutely no textual evidence for the transposition and little reason to suspect an early scribal error (in spite of Holladay&#8217;s suggestion). It is possible that Jeremiah here anticipates this answer in 43:1-3 through the response on their faces (so Bright, 256; F. B. Huey, <i>Jeremiah, Lamentations </i>[NAC], 361). G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, and T. G. Smothers (<i>Jeremiah 26-52 </i>[WBC],<i> </i>249) also call attention to the stated intention in 41:17 and the fact that the strong warning in 42:15-17 seems to imply that a negative response is expected). The use of the perfect here is perhaps to be related to the perfect expressing resolve or determination (see <i>IBHS</i> 489 §30.5.1d). It is also conceivable that these two verses are part of a conditional sentence which has no formal introduction. I.e., &#8220;And if you will not obey&#8230;then you should know for certain that&#8230;&#8221; For examples of this kind of conditional clause introduced by two <i>vav</i>s (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) see Joüon 2:628-29 §167.b, and compare Jer 18:4; Judg 6:13. However, though this interpretation is within the possibilities of Hebrew grammar, I know of no translation or commentary that follows it. So it has not been followed in the translation or given as an alternate translation.</p>
