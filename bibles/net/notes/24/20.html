<A NAME="201"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1155><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;chief overseer/officer.&#8221; The translation follows the suggestion of P. C. Craigie, P. H. Kelley, J. F. Drinkard, <i>Jeremiah 1-25 </i>(WBC),<i> </i>267, based on the parallel passage in 29:26-27 where this official appears to have been in charge of maintaining order in the temple.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Judging from a comparison of this passage with Jer 29:26-27 and that passage in turn with 2 Kgs 25:18, Pashhur held an office second in rank only to the high priest. He was in charge of keeping order in the temple and took offense at what he heard Jeremiah saying.</p>
<A NAME="202"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1156><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And Pashhur son of Immer, the priest and he [= who] was chief overseer [or officer] in the house of the <sc>Lord heard Jeremiah prophesying these words/things <b>20:2</b> and Pashhur had the prophet Jeremiah flogged.&#8221; This verse and the previous one has been restructured in the translation to better conform with contemporary English style.</p>
<A NAME="203"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1157><b>tn</b> The meaning of this word is uncertain. It occurs only here, in 29:26 where it is followed by a parallel word that occurs only there and is generally translated &#8220;collar,&#8221; and in 2 Chr 16:10 where it is preceded by the word &#8220;house of.&#8221; It is most often translated &#8220;stocks&#8221; and explained as an instrument of confinement for keeping prisoners in a crooked position (from its relation to a root meaning &#8220;to turn.&#8221; See BDB 246 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1492;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1499;&#1462;&#1514;</font> and KBL 500 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1492;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1499;&#1462;&#1514;</font> for definition and discussion.) For a full discussion including the interpretation of the ancient versions see W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah </i>(Hermeneia), 1:542-43.</p>
<A NAME="204"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1158><b>sn</b> A comparison of Ezek 8:3 and 9:2 in their contexts will show that this probably refers to the northern gate to the inner court of the temple. It is called Upper because it was on higher ground above the gate in the outer court. It is qualified by &#8220;in the <sc>Lord&#8217;s temple&#8221; to distinguish it from the Benjamin Gate in the city wall (cf. 37:13; 38:7). Like the Benjamin Gate in the city wall it faced north toward the territory of the tribe of Benjamin.</p>
<A NAME="205"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1159><b>tn</b> This name is translated rather than transliterated to aid the reader in understanding this name and connect it clearly with the explanation that follows in the next verse. For a rather complete discussion on the significance of this name and an attempt to explain it as a pun on the name &#8220;Pashhur&#8221; see J. A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah </i>(NICOT), 455, n. 35.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The name <font face="Scholar">Pashhur</font><i> </i>is essentially a curse pronounced by Jeremiah invoking the <sc>Lord&#8217;s authority. The same phrase occurs in Jer 6:25; 46:5; 49:29 which are all in the context of war. In ancient Israelite culture the change in name denoted a change in status or destiny. See, for example, the shift from Jacob (&#8220;He grabs the heel&#8221; and &#8220;Cheater&#8221; or &#8220;Deceiver,&#8221; Gen 25:26; 27:36) to Israel (&#8220;He perseveres with God,&#8221; Gen 32:28).</p>
<A NAME="206"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1160><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will make you an object of terror to both you and your friends.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="207"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1161><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And they will fall by the sword of their enemies and [with] your eyes seeing [it].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="208"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1162><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Take them [the goods, etc.] as plunder and seize them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="209"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1163><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all who live in your house.&#8221; This included his family and his servants.</p>
<A NAME="2010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1164><b>sn</b> As a member of the priesthood and the protector of order in the temple, Pashhur was undoubtedly one of those who promulgated the deceptive belief that the <sc>Lord&#8217;s presence in the temple was a guarantee of Judah&#8217;s safety (cf. 7:4, 8). Judging from the fact that two other men held the same office after the leading men in the city were carried into exile in 597 <sc>b.c. (see Jer 29:25-26 and compare 29:1-2 for the date and 2 Kgs 24:12-16 for the facts), this prophecy was probably fulfilled in 597. For a similar kind of oracle of judgment see Amos 7:10-17.</p>
<A NAME="2011"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1165><b>tn</b> The translation is admittedly interpretive but so is every other translation that tries to capture the nuance of the verb rendered here &#8220;coerced.&#8221; Here the Hebrew text reads: &#8220;You [ &#8211; ]ed me and I let myself be [ &#8211; ]ed. You overpowered me and prevailed.&#8221; The value one assigns to [ &#8211; ] is in every case interpretive based on what one thinks the context is referring to. The word is rendered &#8220;deceived&#8221; or &#8220;tricked&#8221; by several English versions (see, e.g., KJV, NASB, TEV, ICV) as though God had misled him. It is rendered &#8220;enticed&#8221; by some (see, e.g., NRSV, NJPS) as though God had tempted him with false hopes. Some go so far as to accuse Jeremiah of accusing God of metaphorically &#8220;raping&#8221; him. It is true that the word is used of &#8220;seducing&#8221; a virgin in Exod 22:15 and that it is used in several places to refer to &#8220;deceiving&#8221; someone with false words (Prov 24:28; Ps 78:36). It is also true that it is used of &#8220;coaxing&#8221; someone to reveal something he does not want to (Judg 14:15; 16:5) and of &#8220;enticing&#8221; someone to do something on the basis of false hopes (1 Kgs 22:20-22; Prov 1:10). However, it does not always have negative connotations or associations. In Hos 2:14 (2:16 HT) God &#8220;charms&#8221; or &#8220;woos&#8221; Israel, his estranged &#8216;wife,&#8217; into the wilderness where he hopes to win her back to himself. What Jeremiah is alluding to here is crucial for translating and interpreting the word. There is no indication in this passage that Jeremiah is accusing God of misleading him or raising false hopes; God informed him at the outset that he would encounter opposition (1:17-19). Rather, he is alluding to his call to be a prophet, a call which he initially resisted but was persuaded to undertake because of God&#8217;s persistence (Jer 1:7-10). The best single word to translate &#8216;&#8230;&#8217; with is thus &#8220;persuaded&#8221; or &#8220;coerced.&#8221; The translation spells out the allusion explicitly so the reader is not left wondering about what is being alluded to when Jeremiah speaks of being &#8220;coerced.&#8221; The translation &#8220;I let you do it&#8221; is a way of rendering the Niphal of the same verb which must be tolerative rather than passive since the normal passive for the Piel would be the Pual (See <i>IBHS</i> 389-90 §23.4g for discussion and examples.). The translation &#8220;you overcame my resistance&#8221; is based on allusion to the same context (1:7-10) and the parallel use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khazaq</font>) as a transitive verb with a direct object in 1 Kgs 16:22.</p>
<A NAME="2012"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1166><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;speak,&#8221; but the speaking is in the context of speaking as a prophet.</p>
<A NAME="2013"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1167><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I cry out, I proclaim.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2014"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1168><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Violence and destruction.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The words &#8220;<i>Violence and destruction&#8230;</i>&#8221; are a synopsis of his messages of judgment. Jeremiah is lamenting that his ministry up to this point has been one of judgment and has brought him nothing but ridicule because the <sc>Lord has not carried out his threats. He appears in the eyes of the people to be a false prophet.</p>
<A NAME="2015"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1169><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the word of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; For the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font>&#8230;<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>&#8230;<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) here in the sense of &#8220;for&#8230;and&#8221; see KBL 432 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;</font> 10.</p>
<A NAME="2016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1170><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;speak in his name.&#8221; This idiom occurs in passages where someone functions as the messenger under the authority of another. See Exod 5:23; Deut 18:19, 29:20; Jer 14:14. The antecedent in the first line is quite commonly misidentified as being &#8220;him,&#8221; i.e., the <sc>Lord. Comparison, however, with the rest of the context, especially the consequential clause &#8220;then it becomes&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">vÿhayah</font>), and Jer 23:36 shows that it is &#8220;the word of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2017"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1171><b>tn</b> The English sentence has again been restructured for the sake of English style. The Hebrew construction involves two <i>vav</i> consecutive perfects in a condition and consequence relation, &#8220;If I say to myself&#8230;then it [his word] becomes.&#8221; See GKC 337 §112.<i>kk</i> for the construction.</p>
<A NAME="2018"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1172><b>sn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;It is in my heart like a burning fire, shut up in my bones.&#8221; In addition to standing as part for the whole, the &#8220;bones&#8221; for the person (e.g., Ps 35:10), the bones were associated with fear (e.g., Job 4:14) and with pain (e.g., Job 33:19, Ps 102:3 [102:4 HT]) and joy or sorrow (e.g., Ps 51:8 [51:10 HT]). As has been mentioned several times, the heart was connected with intellectual and volitional concerns.</p>
<A NAME="2019"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1173><b>tn</b> It would be difficult to render accurately the Hebrew particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) that introduces this verse without lengthening the English line unduly. It probably means something like &#8220;This is true even though I&#8230;,&#8221; i.e., the particle is concessive (cf. BDB s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 2.c). No other nuance seems appropriate. The particle is left out of the translation, but its presence is acknowledged here.</p>
<A NAME="2020"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1174><b>tn</b> The phrase translated &#8220;Those who would cause me terror are everywhere&#8221; has already occurred in 6:25 in the context of the terror caused by the enemy from the north and in 20:3 in reference to the curse pronounced on Pashhur who would experience it first hand. Some have seen the phrase here not as Jeremiah&#8217;s ejaculation of terror but of his assailant&#8217;s taunts of his message or even their taunting nickname for him. But comparison of this passage with the first two lines of Ps 31:13 (31:14 HT) which are word for word the same as these two will show that it refers to the terror inspired by the plots of his enemies to do away with him. It is also clear from the context of that passage and the following context here that the &#8220;whispering of many&#8221; (the literal translation of &#8220;many whispering words of intrigue against me) refers to intrigues to take vengeance on him and do away with him.</p>
<A NAME="2021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1175><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Denounce and let us denounce him.&#8221; The verb which is translated &#8220;denounce&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nagad</font>) does not take an accusative object of person as it does here very often. When it does it usually means to inform someone. The only relevant passage appears to be Job 17:5 where it means something like &#8220;denounce.&#8221; What is probably involved here are the attempts to portray Jeremiah as a traitor (Jer 26:10) and a false prophet (see his conflict with Hananiah in Jer 28).</p>
<A NAME="2022"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1176><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the men of my peace [who are concerned about my welfare].&#8221; For this phrase compare Ps 41:9 (41:10 HT); Jer 38:22. It is generally agreed that irony is being invoked here, hence &#8220;so-called&#8221; is supplied in the translation to bring out the irony.</p>
<A NAME="2023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1177><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;watching my stumbling [for me to stumble].&#8221; Metaphorically they were watching for some slip-up that would lead to his downfall. Compare the use in Pss 35:15 and 38:17 (38:18 HT).</p>
<A NAME="2024"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1178><b>tn</b> All the text says literally is &#8220;Perhaps he can be enticed so that we can prevail over him.&#8221; However the word &#8220;enticed&#8221; needs some qualification. As W. McKane (<i>Jeremiah </i>[ICC], 1:479) notes it should probably be read in the context of the &#8220;stumbling&#8221; (= &#8220;something that would lead to my downfall&#8221;). Hence &#8220;slipping up&#8221; has been supplied as an object. It is vague enough to avoid specifics as the original text does but suggests some reference to &#8220;something that would lead to my downfall.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> There is an interesting ironical play on words here with the earlier use of these same Hebrew words in v. 7 to refer to the <sc>Lord coercing him into being his spokesman and overcoming his resistance. Jeremiah is lamenting that it was God&#8217;s call to speak his word which he could not (and still cannot) resist that has led ironically to his predicament, which is a source of terror to him.</p>
<A NAME="2025"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1179><b>sn</b> This line has some interesting ties with Jer 15:20-21 where Jeremiah is assured by God that he is indeed with him as he promised him when he called him (1:8, 19) and will deliver him from the clutches of wicked and violent people. The word translated here &#8220;awe-inspiring&#8221; is the same as the word &#8220;violent people&#8221; there. Jeremiah is confident that his &#8220;awe-inspiring&#8221; warrior will overcome &#8220;violent people.&#8221; The statement of confidence here is, by the way, a common element in the psalms of petition in the Psalter. The common elements of that type of psalm are all here: invocation (v. 7), lament (vv. 7-10), confession of trust/confidence in being heard (v. 11), petition (v. 12), thanksgiving or praise (v. 13). For some examples of this type of psalm see Pss 3, 7, 26.</p>
<A NAME="2026"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1180><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Yahweh of armies.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> See the study note on 2:19 for explanation of this title for God.</p>
<A NAME="2027"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1181><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;<sc>Lord of armies, the one who tests the righteous, who sees kidneys and heart.&#8221; The sentence has been broken up to avoid a long and complex English sentence. The translation is more in keeping with contemporary English style.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This verse is almost an exact duplication of the petition in one of Jeremiah&#8217;s earlier prayers and complaints. See Jer 11:20 and notes there for explanation of the Hebrew psychology underlying the use of &#8220;kidneys and heart&#8221; here. For the thoughts expressed here see Ps 17.</p>
<A NAME="2028"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1182><b>sn</b> While it may be a little confusing to modern readers to see the fluctuation in moods and the shifts in addressee in a prayer and complaint like this, it was not at all unusual for Israel where these were often offered in the temple in the conscious presence of God before fellow worshipers. For another example of these same shifts see Ps 22 which is a prayer of David in a time of deep distress.</p>
<A NAME="2029"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1183><b>sn</b> From the heights of exaltation, Jeremiah returns to the depths of despair. For similar mood swings in the psalms of lament compare Ps 102. Verses 14-18 are similar in tone and mood to Job 3:1-10. They are very forceful rhetorical ways of Job and Jeremiah expressing the wish that they had never been born.</p>
<A NAME="2030"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1184><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Cursed be the man who brought my father the news saying, &#8216;A son, a male, has been born to you,&#8217; making glad his joy.&#8221; This verse has been restructured for English stylistic purposes.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The birth of a child was an occasion of great joy. This was especially true if the child was a boy because it meant the continuance of the family line and the right of retention of the family property. See Ruth 4:10, 13-17.</p>
<A NAME="2031"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1185><b>sn</b> The <i>cities</i> alluded to are Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities of the Jordan plain which had become proverbial for their wickedness and for the destruction that the <sc>Lord brought on them because of it. See Isa 1:9-10; 13:19; Jer 23:14; 49:18.</p>
<A NAME="2032"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1186><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;because he did not kill me from the womb so my mother might be to me for my grave and her womb eternally pregnant.&#8221; The sentence structure has been modified and the word &#8220;womb&#8221; moved from the last line to the next to the last line for English stylistic purposes and greater clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2033"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1187><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Why did I come forth from the womb to see [= so that I might see] trouble and grief and that my days might be consumed in shame.&#8221;</p>
