<A NAME="3438"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2035><b>tn</b> This verse is not actually a sentence in the Hebrew original but is a prepositioned object to the verb in v. 20, &#8220;I will hand them over.&#8221; This construction is called <i>casus pendens</i> in the older grammars and is used to call attention to a subject or object (cf. GKC 458 §143.<i>d</i> and compare the usage in 33:24). The same nondescript &#8220;I will punish&#8221; which was used to resolve the complex sentence in the previous verse has been chosen to introduce the objects here before the more specific &#8220;I will hand them over&#8221; in the next verse.</p>
