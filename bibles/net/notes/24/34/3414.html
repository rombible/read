<A NAME="3414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2011><b>tn</b> Usually translated &#8220;covenant.&#8221; See the study note on 11:2 for the rationale for the translation here.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> There are no details regarding the nature of this covenant, but it was probably a parity covenant in which the people agreed to free their slaves in exchange for some concessions from the king (see the study note on 11:2 for more details on the nature of ancient Near Eastern covenants). More details about this covenant are given in vv. 15, 18-19 where it is said to have been made before the <sc>Lord in the temple and involved passing between the pieces of a cut-up calf. Hence it involved their swearing an oath invoking the <sc>Lord&#8217;s name (cf. Gen 21:23; 31:51-53; 1 Sam 20:42) and pronouncing self-maledictory curses on themselves calling down on themselves a fate similar to that of the dead calf if they failed to keep it. (This latter practice is illustrated in treaty documents from the ancient Near East and is reflected in the covenant ceremony in Gen 15:8-16.)</p>
