<A NAME="3413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2010><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah which were left, [namely] against Lachish and Azekah for they alone were left of the cities of Judah as fortified cities.&#8221; The intent of this sentence is to serve as a circumstantial sentence to v. 6 (= &#8220;while the army&#8230;&#8221;). That thought is picked up by &#8220;he did this while&#8230;.&#8221; The long complex sentence in v. 7 has been broken down and qualifying material placed in the proper places to convey the same information in shorter English sentences in conformity with contemporary English style.</p>
