<A NAME="3429"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2026><b>sn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you profaned my name.&#8221; His name had been invoked in the oath confirming the covenant. Breaking the covenant involved taking his name in vain (cf. Exod 20:7; Deut 5:11; Jer 5:2). Hence the one who bore the name was not treated with the special honor and reverence due him (see the study note on 23:27 for the significance of &#8220;name&#8221; in the OT).</p>
