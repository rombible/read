<A NAME="3417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2014><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And they complied, [that is] all the leaders and all the people who entered into the covenant that they would each let his male slave and his female slave go free so as not to hold them in bondage any longer; they complied and they let [them] go.&#8221; The verb &#8220;they complied&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;they hearkened&#8221;) is repeated at the end after the lengthy description of the subject. This is characteristic of Hebrew style. The translation has resolved the complex sentence by making the relative clauses modifying the subject independent sentences describing the situational background before mentioning the main focus, &#8220;they had complied and let them go.&#8221;</p>
