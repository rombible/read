<A NAME="251"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1401><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The word was to Jeremiah.&#8221; It is implicit from the context that it was the <sc>Lord&#8217;s word. The verbal expression is more in keeping with contemporary English style.</p>
<A NAME="252"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1402><b>sn</b> The year referred to would be 605 <sc>b.c. Jehoiakim had been placed on the throne of Judah as a puppet king by Pharaoh Necho after the defeat of Josiah at Megiddo in 609 <sc>b.c. (2 Kgs 23:34-35). According to Jer 46:2 Nebuchadnezzar defeated Necho at Carchemish in that same year. After defeating Necho, Nebuchadnezzar had hurried back to Babylon where he was made king. After being made king he then returned to Judah and attacked Jerusalem (Dan 1:1. The date given there is the third year of Jehoiakim but scholars are generally agreed that the dating there is based on a different system than the one here. It did not count the part of the year before New Year&#8217;s day as an official part of the king&#8217;s official rule. Hence, the third year there is the fourth year here.) The identity of the foe from the north referred to in general terms (4:6; 6:1; 15:12) now becomes clear.</p>
<A NAME="253"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1403><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="254"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1404><b>sn</b> The year referred to would be 627 <sc>b.c. The same year is referred to in 1:2 in reference to his call to be a prophet.</p>
<A NAME="255"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1405><b>tn</b> For the idiom involved here see the notes at 7:13 and 11:7.</p>
<A NAME="256"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1406><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;what he said&#8221; are not in the text but are implicit. They are supplied in the translation for clarity. </p>
<A NAME="257"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1407><b>tn</b> For the idiom involved here see the notes at 7:13 and 11:7.</p>
<A NAME="258"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1408><b>tn</b> The <i>vav</i> consecutive with the perfect in a past narrative is a little unusual. Here it is probably indicating repeated action in past time in keeping with the idiom that precedes and follows it. See GKC 332 §112.<i>f</i> for other possible examples.</p>
<A NAME="259"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1409><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;inclined your ear to hear.&#8221; This is idiomatic for &#8220;paying attention.&#8221; It is often parallel with &#8220;listen&#8221; as here or with &#8220;pay attention&#8221; (see, e.g., Prov 4:20; 51:1).</p>
<A NAME="2510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1410><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;saying.&#8221; The infinitive goes back to &#8220;he sent&#8221;; i.e., &#8220;he sent, saying.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1411><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Turn [masc. pl.] each person from his wicked way and from the evil of your [masc. pl.] doings.&#8221; See the same demand in 23:22.</p>
<A NAME="2512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1412><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;gave to you and your fathers with reference to from ancient times even unto forever.&#8221; See the same idiom in 7:7.</p>
<A NAME="2513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1413><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;follow after.&#8221; See the translator&#8217;s note on 2:5 for this idiom.</p>
<A NAME="2514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1414><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;make me angry with the work of your hands.&#8221; The term &#8220;work of your own hands&#8221; is often interpreted as a reference to idolatry as is clearly the case in Isa 2:8; 37:19. However, the parallelism in 25:14 and the context in 32:30 show that it is more general and refers to what they have done. That is likely the meaning here as well.</p>
<A NAME="2515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1415><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Oracle of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1416><b>tn</b> This is a rather clear case where the Hebrew particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿma</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">an</font>) introduces a consequence and not a purpose, contrary to the dictum of BDB 775 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</font> note 1. They have not listened to him <i>in order to</i> make him angry but <i>with the result that</i> they have made him angry by going their own way. Jeremiah appears to use this particle for result rather than purpose on several other occasions (see, e.g., 7:18, 19; 27:10, 15; 32:29).</p>
<A NAME="2517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1417><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;make me angry with the work of your hands.&#8221; The term &#8220;work of your own hands&#8221; is often interpreted as a reference to idolatry as is clearly the case in Isa 2:8; 37:19. However, the parallelism in 25:14 and the context in 32:30 show that it is more general and refers to what they have done. That is likely the meaning here as well.</p>
<A NAME="2518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1418><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Yahweh of armies.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> See the study note on 2:19 for an explanation of this title.</p>
<A NAME="2519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1419><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;You have not listened to my words.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1420><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Oracle of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1421><b>sn</b> The many allusions to trouble coming from the north are now clarified: it is the armies of Babylon which included within it contingents from many nations. See 1:14, 15; 4:6; 6:1, 22; 10:22; 13:20 for earlier allusions.</p>
<A NAME="2522"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1422><b>sn</b> Nebuchadnezzar is called the <sc>Lord&#8217;s <i>servant</i> also in Jer 27:6; 43:10. He was the <sc>Lord&#8217;s servant in that he was the agent used by the <sc>Lord to punish his disobedient people. Assyria was earlier referred to as the <sc>Lord&#8217;s &#8220;rod&#8221; (Isa 10:5-6) and Cyrus is called his &#8220;shepherd&#8221; and his &#8220;anointed&#8221; (Isa 44:28; 45:1). P. C. Craigie, P. H. Kelley, and J. F. Drinkard (<i>Jeremiah 1-25 </i>[WBC],<i> </i>364) make the interesting observation that the terms here are very similar to the terms in v. 4. The people of Judah ignored the servants, the prophets, he sent to turn them away from evil. So he will send other servants whom they cannot ignore.</p>
<A NAME="2523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1423><b>tn</b> The word used here was used in the early years of Israel&#8217;s conquest for the action of killing all the men, women, and children in the cities of Canaan, destroying all their livestock, and burning their cities down. This policy was intended to prevent Israel from being corrupted by paganism (Deut 7:2; 20:17-18; Josh 6:18, 21). It was to be extended to any city that led Israel away from worshiping God (Deut 13:15) and any Israelite who brought an idol into his house (Deut 7:26). Here the policy is being directed against Judah as well as against her neighbors because of her persistent failure to heed God&#8217;s warnings through the prophets. For further usage of this term in application to foreign nations in the book of Jeremiah see 50:21, 26; 51:3.</p>
<A NAME="2524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1424><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;will utterly destroy them.&#8221; The referent (this land, its inhabitants, and the nations surrounding it) has been specified in the translation for clarity, since the previous &#8220;them&#8221; referred to Nebuchadnezzar and his armies.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This is essentially the introduction to the &#8220;judgment on the nations&#8221; in vv. 15-29 which begins with Jerusalem and Judah (v. 18) and ultimately ends with Babylon itself (&#8220;Sheshach&#8221; in v. 26; see note there for explanation of the term).</p>
<A NAME="2525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1425><b>sn</b> The Hebrew word translated &#8220;everlasting&#8221; is the word often translated &#8220;eternal.&#8221; However, it sometimes has a more limited time reference. For example it refers to the lifetime of a person who became a &#8220;lasting slave&#8221; to another person (see Exod 21:6; Deut 15:17). It is also used to refer to the long life wished for a king (1 Kgs 1:31; Neh 2:3). The time frame here is to be qualified at least with reference to Judah and Jerusalem as seventy years (see 29:10-14 and compare v. 12).</p>
<A NAME="2526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1426><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will make them an object of horror and a hissing and everlasting ruins.&#8221; The sentence has been broken up to separate the last object from the first two which are of slightly different connotation, i.e., they denote the reaction to the latter.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Compare Jer 18:16 and 19:8 and the study note at 18:16.</p>
<A NAME="2527"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1427><b>sn</b> Compare Jer 7:24 and 16:9 for this same dire prediction limited to Judah and Jerusalem.</p>
<A NAME="2528"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1428><b>sn</b> The <i>sound of people grinding meal</i> and the presence of <i>lamps shining in their houses</i> were signs of everyday life. The <sc>Lord is going to make these lands desolate (v. 11) destroying all signs of life. (The statement is, of course, hyperbolic or poetic exaggeration; even after the destruction of Jerusalem many people were left in the land.) For these same descriptions of everyday life applying to the end of life see the allegory in Eccl 12:3-6.</p>
<A NAME="2529"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1429><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;All this land.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2530"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1430><b>sn</b> It should be noted that the text says that the nations will be subject to the king of Babylon for seventy years, not that they will lie desolate for seventy years. Though several proposals have been made for dating this period, many ignore this fact. This most likely refers to the period beginning with Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s defeat of Pharaoh Necho at Carchemish in 605 <sc>b.c. and the beginning of his rule over Babylon. At this time Babylon became the dominant force in the area and continued to be so until the fall of Babylon in 538 <sc>b.c. More particularly Judah became a vassal state (cf. Jer 46:2; 2 Kgs 24:1) in 605 <sc>b.c. and was allowed to return to her homeland in 538 when Cyrus issued his edict allowing all the nations exiled by Babylon to return to their homelands. (See 2 Chr 36:21 and Ezra 1:2-4; the application there is made to Judah but the decree of Cyrus was broader.)</p>
<A NAME="2531"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1431><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;that nation.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2532"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1432><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the land of the Chaldeans.&#8221; See the study note on 21:4 for the use of the term &#8220;Chaldeans.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2533"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1433><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will visit upon the king of Babylon and upon that nation, oracle of the <sc>Lord, their iniquity even upon the land of the Chaldeans and I will make it everlasting ruins.&#8221; The sentence has been restructured to avoid ambiguity and to conform the style more to contemporary English.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Compare Isa 13:19-22 and Jer 50:39-40.</p>
<A NAME="2534"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1434><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Oracle of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2535"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1435><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I will bring upon it everything that is to be written in this book. I will bring upon it everything that Jeremiah is going to prophesy concerning all the nations.&#8221; The reference to &#8220;this book&#8221; and &#8220;what Jeremiah has prophesied against the nations&#8221; raises issues about the editorial process underlying the current form of the book of Jeremiah. As the book now stands there is no earlier reference to any judgments against Babylon or any book (really &#8220;scroll&#8221;; books were a development of the first or second century <sc>a.d.) containing them. A common assumption is that this &#8220;book&#8221; of judgment refers to the judgments against Babylon and the other nations contained at the end of the book of Jeremiah (46:1&#8211;51:58). The Greek version actually inserts the prophecies of 46:1&#8211;51:58 here (but in a different order) and interprets &#8220;Which (= What) Jeremiah prophesied concerning all the nations&#8221; as a title. It is possible that the Greek version may represent an earlier form of the book. At least two earlier forms of the book are known that date roughly to the period dealt with here (Compare 36:1 with 25:1 and see 36:2, 4 and 36:28, 32). Whether reference here is made to the first or second of these scrolls and whether the Greek version represents either is impossible to determine. It is not inconceivable that the referent here is the prophecies which Jeremiah has already uttered in vv. 8-12 and is about to utter in conjunction with the symbolical act that the <sc>Lord commands him to perform (vv. 15-26, 30-38) and that these are proleptic of the latter prophecies which will be given later and will be incorporated in a future book. That is the tenor of the alternate translation. The verb forms involved are capable of either a past/perfect translation or a proleptic/future translation. For the use of the participle (in the alternate translation = <i>Heb </i>&#8220;that is to be written&#8221;; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hakkatuv</font>) to refer to what is proleptic see GKC 356-57 §116.<i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, and compare usage in Jonah 1:3; 2 Kgs 11:2. For the use of the perfect to refer to a future act (in the alternate translation &#8220;is going to prophesy,&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nibba</font>&#8217;) see GKC 312 §106.<i>m</i> and compare usage in Judg 1:2. In support of this interpretation is the fact that the first verb in the next verse (<i>Heb </i>&#8220;they will be subjected,&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1456;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">ovdu</font>) is undoubtedly prophetic [it is followed by a <i>vav</i> consecutive perfect; cf. Isa 5:14]). Reading the text this way has the advantage of situating it within the context of the passage itself which involves prophecies against the nations and against Babylon. Babylon is both the agent of wrath (the cup from which the nations drink, cf. 51:7) and the recipient of it (cf. v. 26). However, this interpretation admittedly does not explain the reference to &#8220;this book,&#8221; except as a proleptic reference to some future form of the book and there would be clearer ways of expressing this view if that were what was definitely intended.</p>
<A NAME="2536"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1436><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;make slaves of them.&#8221; The verb form here indicates that the action is as good as done (the Hebrew prophetic perfect). For the use of the verb rendered &#8220;makes slaves&#8221; see parallel usage in Lev 25:39, 46 (cf. BDB 713 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1491;</font> 3).</p>
<A NAME="2537"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1437><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;according to their deeds and according to the work of their hands.&#8221; The two phrases are synonymous; it would be hard to represent them both in translation without being redundant. The translation attempts to represent them by the qualifier &#8220;all&#8221; before the first phrase.</p>
<A NAME="2538"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1438><b>tn</b> This is an attempt to render the Hebrew particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) which is probably being used in the sense that BDB 473-74 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 3.c notes, i.e., the causal connection is somewhat loose, related here to the prophecies against the nations. &#8220;So&#8221; seems to be the most appropriate way to represent this.</p>
<A NAME="2539"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1439><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Thus said the <sc>Lord, the God of Israel, to me.&#8221; It is generally understood that the communication is visionary. God does not have a &#8220;hand&#8221; and the action of going to the nations and making them drink of the cup are scarcely literal. The words are supplied in the translation to show the figurative nature of this passage.</p>
<A NAME="2540"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1440><b>sn</b> &#8220;Drinking from the cup of wrath&#8221; is a common figure to represent being punished by God. Isaiah had used it earlier to refer to the punishment which Judah was to suffer and from which God would deliver her (Isa 51:17, 22) and Jeremiah&#8217;s contemporary Habakkuk uses it of Babylon &#8220;pouring out its wrath&#8221; on the nations and in turn being forced to drink the bitter cup herself (Hab 2:15-16). In Jer 51:7 the <sc>Lord will identify Babylon as the cup which makes the nations stagger. In v. 16 drinking from the cup will be identified with the sword (i.e., wars) that the <sc>Lord will send against the nations. Babylon is also to be identified as the sword (cf. Jer 51:20-23). What is being alluded to here in highly figurative language is the judgment that the <sc>Lord will wreak on the nations listed here through the Babylonians. The prophecy given here in symbolical form is thus an expansion of the one in vv. 9-11.</p>
<A NAME="2541"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1441><b>tn</b> There is some debate about the meaning of the verb here. Both BDB 172 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> Hithpo and KBL 191 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> Hitpol interpret this of the back and forth movement of staggering. <i>HALOT</i> 192 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> Hitpo interprets it as vomiting. The word is used elsewhere of the up and down movement of the mountains (2 Sam 22:8) and the up and down movement of the rolling waves of the Nile (Jer 46:7, 8). The fact that a different verb is used in v. 27 for vomiting would appear to argue against it referring to vomiting (contra W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah </i>[Hermeneia], 1:674; it is &#8220;they&#8221; that do this not their stomachs).</p>
<A NAME="2542"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1442><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;because of the sword that I will send among them.&#8221; Here, as often elsewhere in Jeremiah, the sword is figurative for warfare which brings death. See, e.g., 15:2. The causal particle here is found in verbal locutions where it is the cause of emotional states or action. Hence there are really two &#8220;agents&#8221; which produce the effects of &#8220;staggering&#8221; and &#8220;acting insane,&#8221; the cup filled with God&#8217;s wrath and the sword. The sword is the &#8220;more literal&#8221; and the actual agent by which the first agent&#8217;s action is carried out.</p>
<A NAME="2543"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1443><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;the wine of his wrath&#8221; are not in the text but are implicit in the metaphor (see vv. 15-16). They are supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>

<A NAME="2545"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1445><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;I made&#8221; and &#8220;drink it&#8221; are not in the text. The text from v. 18 to v. 26 contains a list of the nations that Jeremiah &#8220;made drink it.&#8221; The words are supplied in the translation here and at the beginning of v. 19 for the sake of clarity. See also the note on v. 26.</p>
<A NAME="2546"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1446><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in order to make them a ruin, an object of&#8230;&#8221; The sentence is broken up and the antecedents are made specific for the sake of clarity and English style.</p>
<A NAME="2547"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1447><b>tn</b> See the study note on 24:9 for explanation.</p>
<A NAME="2548"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1448><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;as it is today.&#8221; This phrase would obviously be more appropriate after all these things had happened as is the case in 44:6, 23 where the verbs referring to these conditions are past. Some see this phrase as a marginal gloss added after the tragedies of 597 <sc>b.c. or 586 <sc>b.c. However, it may refer here to the beginning stages where Judah has already suffered the loss of Josiah, of its freedom, of some of its temple treasures, and of some of its leaders (Dan 1:1-3. The different date for Jehoiakim there is due to the different method of counting the king&#8217;s first year; the third year there is the same as the fourth year in 25:1).</p>
<A NAME="2549"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1449><b>sn</b> See further Jer 46:2-28 for the judgment against Egypt.</p>
<A NAME="2550"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1450><b>tn</b> The meaning of this term and its connection with the preceding is somewhat uncertain. This word is used of the mixture of foreign people who accompanied Israel out of Egypt (Exod 12:38) and of the foreigners that the Israelites were to separate out of their midst in the time of Nehemiah (Neh 13:3).

(See Jer 23:1-4 and the notes there.) Here the figure has some irony involved in it. It is the shepherds who are to be slaughtered like sheep. They may have considered themselves &#8220;choice vessels&#8221; (the literal translation of &#8220;fine pottery&#8221;), but they would be slaughtered and lie scattered on the ground (v. 33) like broken pottery.</p>
<A NAME="2594"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">94</span><note=1494><b>tn</b> The meaning of this line is debated.

The word translated &#8220;lie scattered&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1508;&#1493;&#1465;&#1510;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tÿfotsah</font>) occurs nowhere else and the switch to the simile of &#8220;choice vessels&#8221; is rather abrupt. However, this section has been characterized by switching metaphors. The key to the interpretation and translation here is the consequential nature of the verbal actions involved. &#8220;Fall&#8221; does not merely refer to the action but the effect, i.e., &#8220;lie fallen&#8221; (cf. BDB 657 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1500;</font> 7 and compare Judg 3:25; 1 Sam 31:8). Though the noun translated &#8220;lie scattered&#8221; does not occur elsewhere, the verb does. It is quite commonly used of dispersing people and that has led many to see that as the reference here. The word, however, can be used of scattering other things like seed (Isa 28:25), arrows (2 Sam 22:15; metaphorical for lightning), etc. Here it follows &#8220;slaughtered&#8221; and refers to their dead bodies. The simile (<i>Heb</i> &#8220; fallen like choice vessels&#8221;) is elliptical, referring to &#8220;broken pieces&#8221; of choice vessels. In this sense the simile fits in perfectly with v. 33.</p>
