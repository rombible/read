<A NAME="1138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=721><b>tn</b> The meaning of this line is also uncertain. The Hebrew text reads somewhat literally, &#8220;holy meat they pass over from upon you.&#8221; The question of the subject of the verb is the main problem here. The verb is masculine plural and the only subject available is &#8220;holy meat&#8221; which is singular, a &#8220;they&#8221; which goes back to &#8220;the many,&#8221; or a noun from the end of the preceding line which is combined with &#8220;holy meat.&#8221; The latter is the solution of the Greek version which reads &#8220;Will votive offerings [or pieces of fat (following the Old Latin)] and holy meats take away from you your wickedness?&#8221; However, that resolution has been rejected in the preceding note as smoothing out the difficulties of the first two lines. It also leaves out the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) at the beginning of the following line and takes the noun &#8220;your wickedness&#8221; as the object of the verb. That certainly would make for an easier reading of both this line and the next and the assumption that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> may not be in the text is possible because it could be explained as a double writing of the pronoun on the end of the preceding phrase &#8220;from upon you&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1497;&#1460;&#1498;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">me</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alayikh</font>). However, besides being the smoother reading it leaves the last line too short poetically. The solution of the UBS, <i>Preliminary Report</i>, 4:209 is that &#8220;they&#8221; (referring back to &#8220;the many&#8221;?) is the subject. They read: &#8220;so that they carry away from you even sacrificial flesh.&#8221; But who are &#8220;they&#8221; and &#8220;you?&#8221; Is the &#8220;they&#8221; the priests and the &#8220;you&#8221; the people? (See 1 Sam 2:10-17 for a possible parallel.) This, however, introduces too many unknowns into the text. The translation adopted is based on a revocalization of the form &#8220;from upon you&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1497;&#1460;&#1498;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">me</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alayikh</font>) to &#8220;your treacherous acts&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1464;&#1497;&#1460;&#1498;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ma</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alayikh</font>; for this noun cf. BDB 591 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> 2), a solution which is also proposed in the margin of the NJPS which reads: &#8220;Can your treacheries be canceled by sacral flesh?&#8221; For the nuance of the verb presupposed here (= be removed, cease to exist) see BDB 718 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;</font> Qal.6.c and compare usage in Job 30:15. While this solution does preserve the consonantal text and is accepted here, it should be acknowledged that there is no ancient support for it and the reading of the noun &#8220;treacheries&#8221; in place of the compound preposition &#8220;from upon&#8221; is purely speculative.</p>
