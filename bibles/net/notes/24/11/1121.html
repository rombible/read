<A NAME="1121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=704><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;So I brought on them all the terms of this covenant which I commanded to do and they did not do.&#8221; There is an interesting polarity that is being exploited by two different nuances implicit in the use of the word &#8220;terms&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;</font> [<font face="Scholar">divre</font>], literally &#8220;words&#8221;), i.e., what the <sc>Lord &#8220;brings on&#8221; them, namely, the curses that are the penalty for disobedience and the stipulations that they are &#8220;to do,&#8221; that is, to carry out. The sentence is broken up this way in keeping with contemporary English style to avoid the long and complicated style of the original.</p>
