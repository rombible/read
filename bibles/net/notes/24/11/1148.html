<A NAME="1148"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=731><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;caused me to know that I might know.&#8221; Many English versions supply an unstated object &#8220;their plots&#8221; which is referred to later in the context (cf. v. 19). The presupposition of this kind of absolute ellipsis is difficult to justify and would create the need for understanding an ellipsis of &#8220;it&#8221; also after &#8220;I knew.&#8221; It is better to see a bipolar use of the verb &#8220;know&#8221; here. For the second use of the verb &#8220;know&#8221; meaning &#8220;have understanding&#8221; see BDB 394 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1464;&#1497;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</font> Qal.5.</p>
