<A NAME="1136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=719><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;What to my beloved [being] in my house?&#8221; The text has been restructured to avoid possible confusion by the shift from third person in the first two lines to second person in the last two lines and the lines of the following verse. The reference to Judah as his &#8220;beloved&#8221; is certainly ironic and perhaps even sarcastic.</p>
