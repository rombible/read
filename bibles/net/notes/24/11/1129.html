<A NAME="1129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=712><b>tn</b> This is again an attempt to render the Hebrew particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) contextually. The nuance is a little hard to establish due to the nature of the rhetoric of the passage which utilizes the figure of apostrophe where the <sc>Lord turns from talking about Judah to addressing her directly, probably in condemnatory tones. Something like &#8220;the very idea that you should&#8230;&#8221; might best represent the mood. The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> is probably asseverative or intensive (cf. BDB 472 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 1.e).</p>
