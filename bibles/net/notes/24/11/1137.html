<A NAME="1137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=720><b>tc</b> The meaning of this line is uncertain. The text reads somewhat literally either &#8220;her doing the wicked thing the many&#8221; or &#8220;doing it, the wicked thing, the many.&#8221; The text, relationship between words, and meaning of this whole verse have been greatly debated. Wholesale emendation based on the ancient versions is common in both the commentaries and the modern English versions. Many follow the lead of the Greek version which in many cases offers a smoother reading but for that very reason may not be original. The notes that follow will explain some of these emendations but will also attempt to explain the most likely meaning of the MT which is the more difficult and probably the more original text. Since it is presumed to be the original the text will be dealt with in the notes line for line in the MT even though the emendations often relate to more than one line. For example the Greek of the first two lines reads: &#8220;Why has the beloved done abomination in my house?&#8221; This ignores the preposition before &#8220;my beloved&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">lididi</font>) and treats the form &#8220;her doing&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1492;&#1468;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asotah</font>], Qal infinitive plus suffix) as a finite verb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">astah</font>], Qal perfect third feminine). The forms are similar but the Greek is smoother. Moreover, it is difficult to explain the presence of &#8220;to&#8221; in the MT if the Greek is the original. The Greek text likewise does not have the difficulty that is exhibited in the MT by the word &#8220;the many&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">harabbim</font>). It reads a word for &#8220;vows/votive offerings&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8016;&#967;&#945;&#943; </font>[<font face="Greektl">eucai</font>] regularly = <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> [<font face="Scholar">gÿdarim</font>]) in place of the word &#8220;many&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">harabbim</font>) and takes it as part of a compound subject of the verb in the following line meaning &#8220;take away.&#8221; However, this word is far removed graphically from that in the MT and it would be difficult to explain how the MT arose from it. The Old Latin apparently reads a word for &#8220;fat&#8221; (<font face="Scholar">adipes</font> = <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khalavim</font>) which is closer in script to the MT and would be more likely original than the Greek. However, both of these resolutions look like attempts to smooth out a difficult text. Because there is no solid support for any single reading, it is probably best to retain the MT&#8217;s &#8220;the many.&#8221; Many do retain it and take it as a second accusative of &#8220;doing it&#8221; and read &#8220;she does the wicked thing with many [i.e., many false gods],&#8221; a use of the accusative which is hard to justify. Another alternative, taking the adjective &#8220;the many&#8221; to modify the noun &#8220;the wicked thing&#8221; is sometimes suggested but is not possible because the adjective is masculine plural and the noun is feminine singular which is contrary to Hebrew style. Hence one cannot read &#8220;she has done many wicked things.&#8221; The present translation follows the suggestion in D. Barthélemy, ed., <i>Preliminary and Interim Report on the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project</i>, 4:209, that it is the subject of the infinitive construct with an object suffix which is anticipatory of the noun &#8220;wickedness&#8221; that follows (cf. GKC 425 §131.<i>m</i>), i.e., &#8220;the many do it, namely the wickedness&#8221; (for the meaning of the noun see BDB 273 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1494;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> 3.b).</p>
