<A NAME="1139"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=722><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;for [or when] your wickedness then you rejoice.&#8221; The meaning of this line is uncertain. The Greek version, which reads &#8220;or will you escape by these things&#8221; (presupposing a Hebrew text <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501; &#1506;&#1463;&#1500; &#1494;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514; &#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">im </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al zot ta</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">uzi</font>) is far removed from the reading in the MT (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1494; &#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1465;&#1494;&#1460;&#1497;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">az ta</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alozi</font>]; the rest of the Hebrew line has been left out because the Greek reads it with the preceding line) and again appears to be an attempt to smooth out a difficult text. The translation retains the MT but rewords it so it makes better sense in English. The translation presupposes that the phrase &#8220;your wickedness&#8221; is the object of the verb &#8220;take joy&#8221; and the adverb &#8220;then&#8221; refers back to the offering of sacred flesh, i.e., &#8220;even then [or at that time]&#8221; as a <i>constructio ad sensum</i>. For a similar use of the adverb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1494;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">az</font>) compare Gen 13:7. For the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) meaning &#8220;that&#8221; after a question see BDB 472 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 1.f. A possible alternative would be to read as UBS, <i>Preliminary Report</i>, 4:209 do: &#8220;When trouble reaches you, then will you exult?&#8221; If the text of the whole verse followed here, the more difficult text, is not the original one, the most likely alternative would be: &#8220;What right does my beloved have to be in my house? She has does wicked things [reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1492; &#1502;&#1456;&#1494;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1465;&#1514;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">ostah mÿzimot</font>]. Can fat pieces [reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hakhalavim</font>] and sacred meat take away your wickedness from you [reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1489;&#1460;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1502;&#1461;&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1498;&#1456; &#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1514;&#1461;&#1499;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aviru me</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alayikh ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">atekhi</font>]? [If it could] then you could rejoice.&#8221; It should be emphasized that the text of the verse is uncertain in a number of places and open to more than one interpretation. However, regardless of which text or interpretation of it is followed, the Masoretic as interpreted here, the Greek as given in the notes, or an emended text based on both, the overall meaning is much the same. Judah has done evil and the <sc>Lord rejects their superficial attempts to placate him through ritual without change of behavior. The particulars are different; the point is the same.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> For the argument of this verse compare the condemnatory questions in Jer 7:9-11.</p>
