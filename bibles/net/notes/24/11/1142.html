<A NAME="1142"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=725><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;At the sound of a mighty roar he will set fire to it.&#8221; For the shift from third person &#8220;he&#8221; to the first person &#8220;I&#8221; see the preceding note. The Hebrew use of the pronouns in vv. 16-17 for the olive tree and the people that it represents is likely to cause confusion if retained. In v. 16 the people are &#8220;you&#8221; and the olive tree is &#8220;it.&#8221; The people are again &#8220;you&#8221; in v. 17 but part of the metaphor is carried over, i.e., &#8220;he &#8216;planted&#8217; you.&#8221; It creates less confusion in the flow of the passage if the metaphorical identification is carried out throughout by addressing the people/plant as &#8220;you.&#8221;</p>
