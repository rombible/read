<A NAME="1115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=698><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;a land flowing with milk and honey&#8221; is very familiar to readers in the Jewish and Christian traditions as a proverbial description of the agricultural and pastoral abundance of the land of Israel. However, it may not mean too much to readers outside those traditions; an equivalent expression would be &#8220;a land of fertile fields and fine pastures.&#8221; E. W. Bullinger (<i>Figures of Speech</i>, 626) identifies this as a figure of speech called synecdoche where the species is put for the genus, &#8220;a region&#8230;abounding with pasture and fruits of all kinds.&#8221;</p>
