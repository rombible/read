<A NAME="1159"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=742><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Therefore thus says the <sc>Lord.&#8221; This phrase is anticipatory of the same phrase at the beginning of v. 22 and is introductory to what the <sc>Lord says about them. The translation seeks to show the connection of the &#8220;therefore&#8221; which is sometimes rather loose (cf. BDB 487 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503;</font> 3.d[b]) with the actual response which is not given until v. 22.</p>
