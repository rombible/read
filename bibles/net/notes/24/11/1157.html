<A NAME="1157"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=740><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;<sc>Lord of armies, just judge, tester of kidneys and heart.&#8221; The sentence has been broken up to avoid a long and complex English sentence. The translation is more in keeping with contemporary English style. In Hebrew thought the &#8220;kidneys&#8221; were thought of as the seat of the emotions and passions and the &#8220;heart&#8221; was viewed as the seat of intellect, conscience, and will. The &#8220;heart&#8221; and the &#8220;kidneys&#8221; are often used figuratively for the thoughts, emotions, motives, and drives that are thought to be seated in them.</p>
