<A NAME="117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=690><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Cursed is the person who does not listen to the terms of this covenant.&#8221; &#8220;This covenant&#8221; is further qualified in the following verse by a relative clause. The form of the sentence and the qualification &#8220;my&#8221; before covenant were chosen for better English idiom and to break up a long sentence which really extends to the middle of v. 5.</p>
