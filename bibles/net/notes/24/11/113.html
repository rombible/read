<A NAME="113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=686><b>sn</b> <i>The covenant</i> <i>I made with Israel</i>. Apart from the legal profession and Jewish and Christian tradition the term &#8220;covenant&#8221; may not be too familiar. There were essentially three kinds of &#8220;covenants&#8221; that were referred to under the Hebrew term used here: (1) &#8220;Parity treaties&#8221; or &#8220;covenants&#8221; between equals in which each party pledged itself to certain agreed upon stipulations and took an oath to it in the name of their god or gods (cf. Gen 31:44-54); (2) &#8220;Suzerain-vassal treaties&#8221; or &#8220;covenants&#8221; in which a great king pledged himself to protect the vassal&#8217;s realm and his right to rule over his own domain in exchange for sovereignty over the vassal, including the rendering of absolute loyalty and submission to the great king&#8217;s demands spelled out in detailed stipulations; (3) &#8220;Covenants of grant&#8221; in which a great king granted to a loyal servant or vassal king permanent title to a piece of land or dominion over a specified realm in recognition of past service. It is generally recognized that the Mosaic covenant which is being referred to here is of the second type and that it resembles in kind the ancient Near Eastern suzerain-vassal treaties. These treaties typically contained the following elements: (1) a preamble identifying the great king (cf. Exod 20:2a; Deut 1:1-4); (2) a historical prologue summarizing the great king&#8217;s past benefactions as motivation for future loyalty (cf. Exod 20:2b; Deut 1:5&#8211;4:43); (3) the primary stipulation of absolute and unconditional loyalty (cf. Exod 20:3-8; Deut 5:1&#8211;11:32); (4) specific stipulations governing future relations between the vassal and the great king and the vassal&#8217;s relation to other vassals (cf. Exod 20:22&#8211;23:33; Deut 12:1&#8211;26:15); (5) the invoking of curses on the vassal for disloyalty and the pronouncing of blessing on him for loyalty (cf. Lev 26; Deut 27-28); (6) the invoking of witnesses to the covenant, often the great king&#8217;s and the vassal&#8217;s gods (cf. Deut 30:19; 31:28 where the reference is to the &#8220;heavens and the earth&#8221; as enduring witnesses). It is also generally agreed that the majority of the threats of punishment by the prophets refer to the invocation of these covenant curses for disloyalty to the basic stipulation, that of absolute loyalty. </p>
