<A NAME="1152"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=735><b>tn</b> This word and its pronoun (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;</font>, <font face="Scholar">lakhmo</font>, &#8220;its bread&#8221;) is often emended to read &#8220;in/with its sap&#8221; = &#8220;in its prime&#8221; (either <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1461;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;</font> [<font face="Scholar">lekho</font>] or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1461;&#1495;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;</font> [<font face="Scholar">lekhÿmo</font>]); the latter would be more likely and the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mo</font>) could be explained as a rare use of the old poetic third plural suffix for the third singular; cf. GKC 258 §91.<i>l</i> for general use and Ps 11:7 and Job 27:23 for third singular use. Though this fits the context nicely the emendation is probably unnecessary since the word &#8220;bread&#8221; is sometimes used of other foodstuff than grain or its products (cf. BDB 537 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1462;&#1495;&#1462;&#1501;</font> 2.a).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The word <i>fruit</i> refers contextually here to the prophecies that Jeremiah was giving, not (as some suppose) his progeny. Jeremiah was not married and had no children.</p>
