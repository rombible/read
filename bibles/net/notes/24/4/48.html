<A NAME="48"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=188><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Plow up your unplowed ground and do not sow among the thorns.&#8221; The translation is an attempt to bring out the force of a metaphor. The idea seems to be that they are to plow over the thorns and make the ground ready for the seeds which will produce a new crop where none had been produced before.</p>
