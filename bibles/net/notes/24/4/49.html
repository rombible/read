<A NAME="49"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=189><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Circumcise yourselves to the <sc>Lord and remove the foreskin of your heart.&#8221; The translation is again an attempt to bring out the meaning of a metaphor. The mention of the &#8220;foreskin of the heart&#8221; shows that the passage is obviously metaphorical and involves heart attitude, not an external rite.</p>
