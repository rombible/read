<A NAME="417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=197><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;A lion has left its lair.&#8221; The metaphor is turned into a simile for clarification. The word translated &#8220;lair&#8221; has also been understood to refer to a hiding place. However, it appears to be cognate in meaning to the word translated &#8220;lair&#8221; in Ps 10:9; Jer 25:38, a word which also refers to the abode of the <sc>Lord in Ps 76:3.</p>
