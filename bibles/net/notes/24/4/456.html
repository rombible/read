<A NAME="456"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=236><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my.&#8221; This is probably not a reference to Jeremiah&#8217;s own tents since he foresees the destruction of the whole land. Jeremiah so identifies with the plight of his people that he sees the destruction of their tents as though they were his very own. It would probably lead to confusion to translate literally and it is not uncommon in Hebrew laments for the community or its representative to speak of the community as an &#8220;I.&#8221; See for example the interchange between first singular and first plural pronouns in Ps 44:4-8.</p>
