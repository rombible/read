<A NAME="425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=205><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Jerusalem, saying, &#8216;You will have peace&#8217;&#8221;; or &#8220;You have deceived the people of Judah and Jerusalem, saying, &#8216;You will have peace.&#8217;&#8221; The words &#8220;you will be safe&#8221; are, of course, those of the false prophets (cf., Jer 6:14; 8:11; 14:13; 23:16-17). It is difficult to tell whether the charge here is meant literally as the emotional outburst of the prophet (compare for example, Jer 15:18) or whether it is to be understood as a figure of speech in which a verb of direct causation is to be understood as permissive or tolerative, i.e., God did not command the prophets to say this but allowed them to do so. While it is not beyond God to use false prophets to accomplish his will (cf., e.g., 1 Kgs 22:19-23), he elsewhere in the book of Jeremiah directly denies having sent the false prophets to say such things as this (cf., e.g., Jer 14:14-15; 23:21, 32). For examples of the use of this figure of speech, see E. W. Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, 571, 823 and compare Ezek 20:25. The translation given attempts to resolve the issue.</p>
