<A NAME="454"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=234><b>tc</b> The translation reflects a different division of the last two lines than that suggested by the Masoretes. The written text (the <i>Kethib</i>) reads &#8220;for the sound of the ram&#8217;s horn I have heard [or &#8220;you have heard,&#8221; if the form is understood as the old second feminine singular perfect] my soul&#8221; followed by &#8220;the battle cry&#8221; in the last line. The translation is based on taking &#8220;my soul&#8221; with the last line and understanding an elliptical expression &#8220;the battle cry [to] my soul.&#8221; Such an elliptical expression is in keeping with the elliptical nature of the exclamations at the beginning of the verse (cf. the literal translations of the first two lines of the verse in the notes on the words &#8220;stomach&#8221; and &#8220;heart&#8221;).</p>
