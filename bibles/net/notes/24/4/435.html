<A NAME="435"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=215><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;I cry out&#8221; are not in the text, but the words that follow are obviously not the <sc>Lord&#8217;s. They are either those of the people or of Jeremiah. Taking them as Jeremiah&#8217;s parallels the interjection of Jeremiah&#8217;s response in 4:10 which is formally introduced.</p>
