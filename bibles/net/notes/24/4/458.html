<A NAME="458"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=238><b>tn</b> It is not altogether clear what Jeremiah intends by the use of this metaphor. In all likelihood he means that the defenses of Israel&#8217;s cities and towns have offered no more resistance than nomads&#8217; tents. However, in light of the fact that the word &#8220;tent&#8221; came to be used generically for a person&#8217;s home (cf. 1 Kgs 8:66; 12:16), it is possible that Jeremiah is here referring to the destruction of their homes and the resultant feeling of homelessness and loss of even elementary protection. Given the lack of certainty the present translation is rather literal here.</p>
