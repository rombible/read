<A NAME="412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=192><b>tn</b> It is unclear who the addressees of the masculine plural imperatives are here. They may be the citizens of Jerusalem and Judah who are sounding the alarm to others. However, the first person reference to the <sc>Lord in v. 6 and Jeremiah&#8217;s response in v. 10 suggest that this is a word from the <sc>Lord that he is commanded to pass on to the citizens of Jerusalem and Judah. If the imperatives are not merely rhetorical plurals they may reflect the practice referred to in Jer 23:18, 22; Amos 3:7. A similar phenomenon also occurs in Jer 5:1 and also in Isa 40:1-2. This may also be the explanation for the plural imperatives in Jer 31:6. For further discussion see the translator&#8217;s note on Jer 5:1.</p>
