<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;This is a record of what Jeremiah prophesied and did&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The words [or affairs] of Jeremiah.&#8221; The phrase could refer to either the messages of Jeremiah recorded in the book or to both his messages and the biographical (and autobiographical) narratives recorded about him in the book. Since the phrase is intended to serve as the title or superscription for the whole book and recurs again in 51:64 at the end of the book before the final appendix, it might refer to the latter. The expression &#8220;The words of [someone]&#8221; is a standard introductory formula (Deut 29:1[28:69]; 2 Sam 23:1; Amos 1:1; Eccl 1:1; Neh 1:1).</p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2><b>sn</b> The translation reflects the ancient Jewish tradition of substituting the word for &#8220;Lord&#8221; for the proper name for Israel&#8217;s God which is now generally agreed to have been Yahweh. Jewish scribes wrote the consonants<span class="smallcaps"> YHWH </span>but substituted the vowels for the word &#8220;Lord.&#8221; The practice of calling him &#8220;Lord&#8221; rather than using his proper name is also reflected in the Greek translation which is the oldest translation of the Hebrew Bible. The meaning of the name Yahweh occurs in Exod 3:13-14 where God identifies himself as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and tells Moses that his name is &#8220;I am&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1492;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">ehyeh</font>). However, he instructs the Israelites to refer to him as <span class="smallcaps">YHWH</span> (&#8220;Yahweh&#8221; = &#8220;He is&#8221;); see further Exod 34:5-6.</p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to whom the word of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> came.&#8221; The present translation is more in keeping with contemporary English idiom. The idea of &#8220;<i>began</i> to speak&#8221; comes from the context where the conclusion of his speaking is signaled by the phrases &#8220;until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah&#8221; and &#8220;until the people of Jerusalem were taken into exile&#8221; in v. 3.</p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4><b>sn</b> This would have been August, 586 <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span> according to modern reckoning.</p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=6><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and it [the word of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>] came in the days of Jehoiakim&#8230;until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah&#8230;until the carrying away captive of Jerusalem in the fifth month.&#8221;</p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=7><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the womb.&#8221; The words &#8220;your mother&#8217;s&#8221; are implicit and are supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=8><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I knew you.&#8221; The parallelism here with &#8220;set you apart&#8221; and &#8220;appointed you&#8221; make clear that Jeremiah is speaking of his foreordination to be a prophet. For this same nuance of the Hebrew verb see Gen 18:19; Amos 3:2.</p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=9><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Lord Yahweh.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The translation follows the ancient Jewish tradition of substituting the Hebrew word for &#8220;God&#8221; for the proper name Yahweh in this compound name. See the study note on v. 2 for the substitution of &#8220;Lord&#8221; in a similar kind of situation.</p>
<a name="110"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=10><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Behold, I do not know how to speak.&#8221; The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>, commonly rendered &#8220;behold&#8221;) often introduces a speech and calls special attention to a specific word or the statement as a whole (see <i>IBHS</i> 675-78 §40.2.1).</p>
<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;well enough for that&#8221; are implicit and are supplied in the translation for clarity. Jeremiah is not claiming an absolute inability to speak.</p>
<a name="112"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=12><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I am a boy/youth.&#8221; The Hebrew word can refer to an infant (Exod 2:6), a young boy (1 Sam 2:11), a teenager (Gen 21:12), or a young man (2 Sam 18:5). The translation is deliberately ambiguous since it is unclear how old Jeremiah was when he was called to begin prophesying. </p>
<a name="113"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=13><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;For you must go and say.&#8221; The Hebrew particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) is likely adversative here after a negative statement (cf. BDB 474 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 3.e). The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is probably not giving a rationale for the denial of Jeremiah&#8217;s objection but redirecting his focus, i.e., &#8220;do not say&#8230;but go&#8230;and say.&#8221;</p>
<a name="114"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=14><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;be afraid of them.&#8221; The antecedent is the &#8220;whomever&#8221; in v. 7.</p>
<a name="115"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=15><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;rescue.&#8221;</p>
<a name="116"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=16><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Behold, I have put my words in your mouth.&#8221; This is an example of the Hebrew &#8220;scheduling&#8221; perfect or the &#8220;prophetic&#8221; perfect where a future event is viewed as so certain it is spoken of as past. The Hebrew particle rendered here &#8220;assuredly&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>) underlines the certitude of the promise for the future. See the translator&#8217;s note on v. 6.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The passage is reminiscent of Deut 18:18 which refers to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s promise of future revelation through a line of prophets who, like Moses, would speak God&#8217;s word.</p>
<a name="117"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=17><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;See!&#8221; The Hebrew imperative of the verb used here (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>) functions the same as the particle in v. 9. See the translator&#8217;s note there.</p>
<a name="118"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=18><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I appoint you today over nations and kingdoms to uproot&#8230;.&#8221; The phrase refers to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> giving Jeremiah authority as a prophet to declare what he, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, will do; it does not mean that Jeremiah himself will do these things. The expression involves a figure of speech where the subject of a declaration is stated instead of the declaration about it. Compare a similar use of the same figure in Gen 41:13.</p>
<a name="119"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=19><b>sn</b> These three pairs represent the twofold nature of Jeremiah&#8217;s prophecies, prophecies of judgment and restoration. For the further programmatic use of these pairs for Jeremiah&#8217;s ministry see 18:7-10 and 31:27-28.</p>
<a name="120"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=20><b>tn</b> This represents the Hebrew particle (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ki</font>) that is normally rendered &#8220;for&#8221; or &#8220;because.&#8221; The particle here is meant to give the significance of the vision, not the rationale for the statement &#8220;you have observed correctly.&#8221;</p>
<a name="121"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=21><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;watching over my word to do it.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> There is a play on the Hebrew word for &#8220;almond tree&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1511;&#1461;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shaqed</font>), which blossoms in January/February and is the harbinger of spring, and the Hebrew word for &#8220;watching&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1511;&#1461;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shoqed</font>), which refers to someone watching over someone or something in preparation for action. The play on words announces the certainty and imminence of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> carrying out the covenant curses of Lev 26 and Deut 28 threatened by the earlier prophets.</p>
<a name="122"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=22><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a blown upon [= heated; boiling] pot and its face from the face of the north [= it is facing away from the north].&#8221;</p>
<a name="123"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=23><b>tn</b> There is nothing in the Hebrew text for these words but it is implicit in the connection. Once again the significance of the vision is spelled out. Compare the translator&#8217;s note on v. 12.</p>
<a name="124"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=24><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they will each set up.&#8221; The pronoun &#8220;they&#8221; refers back to the &#8220;kingdoms&#8221; in the preceding sentence. However, kingdoms do not sit on thrones; their kings do. This is an example of a figure of speech called metonymy where the kingdom is put for its king. For a similar use see 2 Chr 12:8. </p>
<a name="125"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=25><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<a name="126"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=26><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;They will come and set up their thrones in the entrances of the gates of Jerusalem. They will destroy all the walls surrounding it and also destroy all the towns in Judah.&#8221; The text of v. 15b reads in Hebrew, &#8220;they will each set up his throne [near? in?] the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem and against all its walls&#8230;and against all the towns&#8230;.&#8221; Commentators are divided over whether the passage refers to the kings setting up their thrones after victory in preparation for passing judgment on their defeated enemies in the city or whether it refers to setting up siege against it. There is no Hebrew preposition before the word for &#8220;the entrance&#8221; so that it could be &#8220;in&#8221; (which would imply victory) or &#8220;at/near&#8221; (which would imply siege), and the same verb + object (i.e., &#8220;they will set up their thrones&#8221;) governs all the locative statements. It is most often taken to refer to the aftermath of victory because of the supposed parallel in Jer 43:8-13 and the supposed fulfillment in Jer 39:3. Though this may fit well with the first part of the compound expression, it does not fit well with the latter part which is most naturally taken to refer to hostile attacks against Jerusalem and the other cities of Judah. The translation given in the text is intended to reflect the idea of an army setting up for siege. The alternate translation is intended to reflect the other view. </p>
<a name="127"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=27><b>tn</b> The Hebrew particle (the <i>vav</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>] consecutive), which is often rendered in some English versions as &#8220;and&#8221; and in others is simply left untranslated, is rendered here epexegetically, reflecting a summary statement.</p>
<a name="128"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=28><b>sn</b> The Hebrew idiom (literally &#8220;I will speak my judgments against&#8221;) is found three other times in Jeremiah (4:12; 39:5; 52:9), where it is followed by the carrying out of the sentence. Here the carrying out of the sentence precedes in v. 15. </p>
<a name="129"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=29><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;on them.&#8221; The antecedent goes back to Jerusalem and the cities of Judah (i.e., the people in them) in v. 15.</p>
<a name="130"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=30><b>tn</b> I.e., idols.</p>
<a name="131"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=31><b>tn</b> The name &#8220;Jeremiah&#8221; is not in the text. The use of the personal pronoun followed by the proper name is an attempt to reflect the correlative emphasis between Jeremiah&#8217;s responsibility noted here and the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s promise noted in the next verse. The emphasis in the Hebrew text is marked by the presence of the subject pronouns at the beginning of each of the two verses.</p>
<a name="132"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=32><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;gird up your loins.&#8221; For the literal use of this idiom to refer to preparation for action see 2 Kgs 4:29; 9:1. For the idiomatic use to refer to spiritual and emotional preparation as here, see Job 38:3, 40:7, and 1 Pet 1:13 in the NT.</p>
<a name="133"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=33><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will make you terrified in front of them.&#8221; There is a play on words here involving two different forms of the same Hebrew verb and two different but related prepositional phrases, &#8220;from before/of,&#8221; a preposition introducing the object of a verb of fearing, and &#8220;before, in front of,&#8221; a preposition introducing a spatial location.</p>
<a name="134"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=34><b>tn</b> See the note on &#8220;Jeremiah&#8221; at the beginning of v. 17.</p>
<a name="135"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=35><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;today I have made you.&#8221; The Hebrew verb form here emphasizes the certainty of a yet future act; the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is promising to protect Jeremiah from any future attacks which may result from his faithfully carrying out his commission. See a similar use of the same Hebrew verb tense in v. 9, and see the translator&#8217;s note there.</p>
<a name="136"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=36><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I make you a fortified city&#8230;against all the land&#8230;.&#8221; The words &#8220;as strong as&#8221; and &#8220;so you will be able to stand against all the people of&#8230;&#8221; are given to clarify the meaning of the metaphor.</p>
