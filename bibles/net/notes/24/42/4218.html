<A NAME="4218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2340><b>tn</b> Jer 42:13-14 are a long complex condition (protasis) whose consequence (apodosis) does not begin until v. 15. The Hebrew text of vv. 13-14 reads: <b>42:13</b> &#8220;But if you say [or continue to say (the form is a participle)], &#8216;We will not stay in this land&#8217; with the result that you do not obey [or &#8220;more literally, do not hearken to the voice of] the <sc>Lord your God, <b>42:14</b> saying, &#8216;No, but to the land of Egypt we will go where we&#8230;and there we will live,&#8217; <b>42:15</b> now therefore hear the word of the <sc>Lord&#8230;&#8221; The sentence has been broken up and restructured to better conform with contemporary English style but an attempt has been made to maintain the contingencies and the qualifiers that are in the longer Hebrew original.</p>
