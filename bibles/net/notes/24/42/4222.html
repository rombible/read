<A NAME="4222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2344><b>tn</b> The repetition of the adverb &#8220;there&#8221; in the translation of vv. 14, 16 is to draw attention to the rhetorical emphasis on the locale of Egypt in the original text of both v. 14 and v. 16. In v. 14 they say, &#8220;to the land of Egypt we will go&#8230;and there we will live.&#8221; In v. 16 God says, &#8220;wars&#8230;there will catch up with you&#8230;the hunger&#8230;there will follow after you&#8230;and there you will die.&#8221; God rhetorically denies their focus on Egypt as a place of safety and of relative prosperity. That can only be found in Judah under the protective presence of the <sc>Lord (vv. 10-12).</p>
