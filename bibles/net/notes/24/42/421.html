<A NAME="421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2323><b>sn</b> <i>Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah</i> may have been the same as the Jezaniah son of the Maacathite mentioned in 40:8. The title &#8220;the Maacathite&#8221; would identify the locality from which his father came, i.e., a region in northern Transjordan east of Lake Huleh. Many think he is also the same man who is named &#8220;Azariah&#8221; in Jer 43:2 (the Greek version has Azariah both here and in 43:2). It was not uncommon for one man to have two names, e.g., Uzziah who was also named Azariah (compare 2 Kgs 14:21 with 2 Chr 26:1).</p>
