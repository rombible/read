<A NAME="4234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2356><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;But you have not hearkened to the voice of [idiomatic for &#8220;obeyed&#8221; see BDB 1034 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;</font> Qal.1.m] the <sc>Lord your God, namely [cf. BDB 252 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;</font> 1.b] with respect [cf. BDB 514 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font> 5.f(c)] all which he has sent to us.&#8221; The verb is translated &#8220;don&#8217;t seem to want to obey&#8221; because they have not yet expressed their refusal or their actual disobedience. Several commentaries sensing this apparent discrepancy suggest that 42:19-22 are to be transposed after 43:1-3 (see, e.g., <i>BHS</i> note 18a, W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah </i>[Hermeneia], 2:275; J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah </i>[AB], 252, 256, 258). However, there is absolutely no textual evidence for the transposition and little reason to suspect an early scribal error (in spite of Holladay&#8217;s suggestion). It is possible that Jeremiah here anticipates this answer in 43:1-3 through the response on their faces (so Bright, 256; F. B. Huey, <i>Jeremiah, Lamentations </i>[NAC], 361). G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, and T. G. Smothers (<i>Jeremiah 26-52 </i>[WBC],<i> </i>249) also call attention to the stated intention in 41:17 and the fact that the strong warning in 42:15-17 seems to imply that a negative response is expected). The use of the perfect here is perhaps to be related to the perfect expressing resolve or determination (see <i>IBHS</i> 489 §30.5.1d). It is also conceivable that these two verses are part of a conditional sentence which has no formal introduction. I.e., &#8220;And if you will not obey&#8230;then you should know for certain that&#8230;&#8221; For examples of this kind of conditional clause introduced by two <i>vav</i>s (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) see Joüon 2:628-29 §167.b, and compare Jer 18:4; Judg 6:13. However, though this interpretation is within the possibilities of Hebrew grammar, I know of no translation or commentary that follows it. So it has not been followed in the translation or given as an alternate translation.</p>
