<A NAME="4212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2334><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;just&#8221; is intended to reflect the infinitive absolute before the finite verb emphasizing here the condition rather than the verb root (see Joüon 2:423 §123.g, and compare the usage in Exod 15:26). The form looks like the infinitive absolute of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shuv</font>), but all the versions interpret it as though it is from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yashav</font>) which is the root of the verb that follows it. Either this is a textual error of the loss of a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yod</font>) or this is one of the cases that GKC 69 §19.<i>i</i> list as the possible loss of a weak consonant at the beginning of a word.</p>
