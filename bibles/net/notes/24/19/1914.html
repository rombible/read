<A NAME="1914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1132><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the blood of innocent ones.&#8221; This must be a reference to child sacrifice as explained in the next verse. Some have seen a reference to the sins of social injustice alluded to in 2 Kgs 21:16 and 24:4 but those are connected with the city itself. Hence the word children is supplied in the translation to make the referent explicit.</p>
