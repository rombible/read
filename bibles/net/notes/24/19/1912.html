<A NAME="1912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1130><b>sn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;have made this city foreign.&#8221; The verb here is one that is built off of the noun and adjective which relate to foreign nations. Comparison may be made to Jer 2:21 where the adjective refers to the strange, wild vine as opposed to the choice vine the <sc>Lord planted and to 5:19 and 8:19 where the noun is used of worshiping foreign gods. Israel through its false worship has &#8220;denationalized&#8221; itself in its relation to God.</p>
