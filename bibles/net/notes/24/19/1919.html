<A NAME="1919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1137><b>sn</b> There is perhaps a two-fold wordplay in the use of this word. One involves the sound play with the word for &#8220;jar,&#8221; which has been explained as a water decanter. The word here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1465;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vaqqoti</font>). The word for jar in v. 1 is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1463;&#1511;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1467;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vaqbuq</font>). There may also be a play on the literal use of this word to refer to the laying waste or destruction of a land (see Isa 24:3; Nah 2:3). Many modern commentaries think that at this point Jeremiah emptied out the contents of the jar, symbolizing the &#8220;emptying&#8221; out of their plans.</p>
