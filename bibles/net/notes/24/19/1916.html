<A NAME="1916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1134><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;such sacrifices&#8221; are not in the text. The text merely says &#8220;to burn their children in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal which I did not command.&#8221; The command obviously refers not to the qualification &#8220;to Baal&#8221; but to burning the children in the fire as burnt offerings. The words are supplied in the translation to avoid a possible confusion that the reference is to sacrifices to Baal. Likewise the words should not be translated so literally that they leave the impression that God never said anything about sacrificing their children to other gods. The fact is he did. See Lev 18:21; Deut 12:30; 18:10.</p>
