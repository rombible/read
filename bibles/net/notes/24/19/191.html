<A NAME="191"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1119><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;Jeremiah&#8221; is not in the text. Some Hebrew <sc>mss and some of the versions have &#8220;to me.&#8221; This section, 19:1&#8211;20:6 appears to be one of the biographical sections of the book of Jeremiah where incidents in his life are reported in third person. See clearly 9:14 and 20:1-3. The <sc>mss and versions do not represent a more original text but are translational or interpretive attempts to fill in a text which had no referent. They are like the translational addition that has been supplied on the basis of contextual indicators.</p>
