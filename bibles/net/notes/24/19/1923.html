<A NAME="1923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1141><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all its smitings.&#8221; This word has been used several times for the metaphorical &#8220;wounds&#8221; that Israel has suffered as a result of the blows from its enemies. See, e.g., 14:17. It is used in the Hebrew Bible of scourging, both literally and metaphorically (cf. Deut 25:3; Isa 10:26), and of slaughter and defeat (1 Sam 4:10; Josh 10:20). Here it refers to the results of the crushing blows at the hands of her enemies which has made her the object of scorn.</p>
