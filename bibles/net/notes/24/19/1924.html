<A NAME="1924"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1142><b>tn</b> This verse has been restructured to try to bring out the proper thought and subordinations reflected in the verse without making the sentence too long and complex in English: <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and daughters. And they will eat one another&#8217;s flesh in the siege and in the straits which their enemies who are seeking their lives reduce them to.&#8221; This also shows the agency through which God&#8217;s causation was effected, i.e., the siege.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Cannibalism is one of the penalties for disobedience to their covenant with the <sc>Lord effected through the Mosaic covenant. See Deut 28:53, 55, 57. For examples of this being carried out see 2 Kgs 6:28-29; Lam 4:10.</p>
