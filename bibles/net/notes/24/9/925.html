<A NAME="925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=583><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;I said&#8221; are not in the text, but there is general agreement that Jeremiah is the speaker. Cf. the lament in 8:18-9:1. These words are supplied in the translation for clarity. Some English versions follow the Greek text which reads a plural imperative here. Since this reading would make the transition between 9:10 and 9:11 easier it is probably not original but a translator&#8217;s way of smoothing over a difficulty.</p>
