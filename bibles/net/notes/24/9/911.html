<A NAME="911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=569><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;do not acknowledge me&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;do not know me.&#8221; But &#8220;knowing&#8221; in Hebrew thought often involves more than intellectual knowledge; it involves emotional and volitional commitment as well. For <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</font> meaning &#8220;acknowledge&#8221; see 1 Chr 28:9; Isa 29:21; Hos 2:20; Prov 3:6. This word is also found in ancient Near Eastern treaty contexts where it has the idea of a vassal king acknowledging the sovereignty of a greater king (cf. H. Huffmon, &#8220;The Treaty Background of Hebrew yada,&#8221; <i>BASOR</i> 181 [1966]: 31-37).</p>
