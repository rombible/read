<A NAME="953"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=611><b>tn</b> It is a little difficult to explain how the Hebrew particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) is functioning here. W. L. Holladay (<i>Jeremiah </i>[Hermeneia], 1:311) may be correct in seeing it as introducing the contents of what those who call for the mourning women are to say. In this case, Jeremiah picks up the task as representative of the people.</p>
