<A NAME="931"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=589><b>tn</b> The words, &#8220;I said&#8221; are not in the text. It is not clear that a shift in speaker has taken place. However, the words of the verse are very unlikely to be a continuation of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s threat. It is generally assumed that these are the words of Jeremiah and that a dialogue is going on between him and the <sc>Lord in vv. 9-14. That assumption is accepted here.</p>
