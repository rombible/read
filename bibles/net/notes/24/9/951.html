<A NAME="951"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=609><b>tn</b> The order of these two lines has been reversed for English stylistic reasons. The text reads in Hebrew &#8220;because we have left our land because they have thrown down our dwellings.&#8221; The two clauses offer parallel reasons for the cries &#8220;How ruined we are! [How] we are greatly disgraced!&#8221; But the first line must contain a prophetic perfect (because the lament comes from Jerusalem) and the second a perfect referring to a destruction that is itself future. This seems the only way to render the verse that would not be misleading.</p>
