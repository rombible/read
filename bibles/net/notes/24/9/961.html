<A NAME="961"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=619><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;fairness and justice, because these things give me pleasure.&#8221; Verse 24 reads in Hebrew, &#8220;But let the one who brags brag in this: understanding and knowing me that I, the <sc>Lord, do faithfulness, justice, and righteousness in the earth for/that I delight in these.&#8221; It is uncertain whether the Hebrew particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) before the clause &#8220;I delight in these things&#8221; is parallel to the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> introducing the clause &#8220;that I, the <sc>Lord, act&#8230;&#8221; or causal giving the grounds for the <sc>Lord acting the way he does. In the light of the contrasts in the passage and the emphasis that Jeremiah has placed on obedience to the covenant and ethical conduct in conjunction with real allegiance to the <sc>Lord not mere lip service, it is probable that the clauses are parallel. For the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> to introduce clauses of further definition after a direct object as here see GKC 365 §117.<i>h</i> and see BDB 393 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</font> Qal.1.a. For parallels to the idea of Yahweh requiring these characteristics in people see Hos 6:6, Mic 6:8.</p>
