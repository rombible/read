<A NAME="1330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=838><b>tn</b> The Greek version is likely right in interpreting the construction of two perfects preceded by the conjunction as contingent or consequential here, i.e., &#8220;and when they say&#8230;then say.&#8221; See GKC 494 §159.<i>g</i>. However, to render literally would create a long sentence. Hence, the words &#8220;will probably&#8221; have been supplied in v. 12 in the translation to set up the contingency/consequential sequence in the English sentences.</p>
