<A NAME="1325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=833><b>tn</b> It would be somewhat unnatural in English to render the play on the word translated here &#8220;cling tightly&#8221; and &#8220;bound tightly&#8221; in a literal way. They are from the same root word in Hebrew (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1511;</font>, <font face="Scholar">davaq</font>), a word that emphasizes the closest of personal relationships and the loyalty connected with them. It is used, for example, of the relationship of a husband and a wife and the loyalty expected of them (cf. Gen 2:24; for other similar uses see Ruth 1:14; 2 Sam 20:2; Deut 11:22).</p>
