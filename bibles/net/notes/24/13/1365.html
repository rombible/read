<A NAME="1365"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=873><b>tn</b> This is a common proverb in English coming from this biblical passage. For cultures where it is not proverbial perhaps it would be better to translate &#8220;Can black people change the color of their skin?&#8221; Strictly speaking these are &#8220;Cushites&#8221; inhabitants of a region along the upper Nile south of Egypt. The Greek text is responsible for the identification with Ethiopia. The term in Greek is actually a epithet = &#8220;burnt face.&#8221;</p>
