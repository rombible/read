<A NAME="1322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=830><b>tn</b> The structure of this verse is a little unusual. It consists of a subject, &#8220;this wicked people&#8221; qualified by several &#8220;which&#8221; clauses preceding a conjunction and a form which would normally be taken as a third person imperative (a Hebrew jussive; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1460;&#1497;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">vihi</font>). This construction, called <i>casus pendens</i> by Hebrew grammarians, lays focus on the subject, here calling attention to the nature of Israel&#8217;s corruption which makes it rotten and useless to God. See GKC 458 §143.<i>d</i> for other examples of this construction.</p>
