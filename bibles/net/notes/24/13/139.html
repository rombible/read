<A NAME="139"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=817><b>tn</b> There has been a great deal of debate about whether the place referred to here is a place (Parah [= Perath] mentioned in Josh 18:23, modern Khirbet Farah, near a spring &#8217;<font face="Scholar">ain Farah</font>) about three and a half miles from Anathoth which was Jeremiah&#8217;s home town or the Euphrates River. Elsewhere the word &#8220;Perath&#8221; always refers to the Euphrates but it is either preceded by the word &#8220;river of&#8221; or there is contextual indication that the Euphrates is being referred to. Because a journey to the Euphrates and back would involve a journey of more than 700 miles (1,100 km) and take some months, scholars both ancient and modern have questioned whether &#8220;Perath&#8221; refers to the Euphrates here and if it does whether a real journey was involved. Most of the attempts to identify the place with the Euphrates involve misguided assumptions that this action was a symbolic message to Israel about exile or the corrupting influence of Assyria and Babylon. However, unlike the other symbolic acts in Jeremiah (and in Isaiah and Ezekiel) the symbolism is not part of a message to the people but to Jeremiah; the message is explained to him (vv. 9-11) not the people. In keeping with some of the wordplays that are somewhat common in Jeremiah it is likely that the reference here is to a place, Parah, which was near Jeremiah&#8217;s hometown, but whose name would naturally suggest to Jeremiah later in the <sc>Lord&#8217;s explanation in vv. 9-11 Assyria-Babylon as a place connected with Judah&#8217;s corruption (see the notes on vv. 9-10). For further discussion the reader should consult the commentaries, especially W. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah </i>(Hermeneia), 1:396 and W. McKane, <i>Jeremiah </i>(ICC), 1:285-92 who take opposite positions on this issue.</p>
