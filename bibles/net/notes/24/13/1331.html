<A NAME="1331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=839><b>sn</b> It is probably impossible to convey in a simple translation all the subtle nuances that are wrapped up in the words of this judgment speech. The word translated &#8220;stupor&#8221; here is literally &#8220;drunkenness&#8221; but the word has in the context an undoubted intended double reference. It refers first to the drunken like stupor of confusion on the part of leaders and citizens of the land which will cause them to clash with one another. But it also probably refers to the reeling under God&#8217;s wrath that results from this (cf. Jer 25:15-29, especially vv. 15-16). Moreover there is still the subtle little play on wine jars. The people are like the wine jars which were supposed to be filled with wine. They were to be a special people to bring glory to God but they had become corrupt. Hence, like wine jars they would be smashed against one another and broken to pieces (v. 14). All of this, both &#8220;fill them with the stupor of confusion&#8221; and &#8220;make them reel under God&#8217;s wrath,&#8221; cannot be conveyed in one translation.</p>
