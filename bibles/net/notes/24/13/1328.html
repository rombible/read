<A NAME="1328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=836><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Every wine jar is supposed to be filled with wine.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Some scholars understand this as a popular proverb like that in Jer 31:29 and Ezek 18:2. Instead this is probably a truism; the function of wine jars is to be filled with wine. This may relate to the preceding where the <sc>Lord has set forth his intention for Israel. It forms the basis for a ironic threat of judgment because they have failed to fulfill his purpose.</p>
