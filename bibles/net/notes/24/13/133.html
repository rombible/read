<A NAME="133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=811><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Do not ever put them in water,&#8221; i.e., &#8220;Do not even wash them.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The fact that the garment was not to be put in water is not explained. A possible explanation within the context is that it was to be worn continuously, not even taken off to wash it. That would illustrate that the close relationship that the <sc>Lord had with his people was continuous and indissoluble. Other explanations are that it was not to be gotten wet because (1) that would have begun the process of rotting (This assumes that the rotting was done by the water of the Euphrates. But it was buried in a crack in the rocks, not in the river itself); (2) that would have made it softer and easier to wear; or (3) that showed that the garment was new, clean, and fresh from the merchant. For this latter interpretation see J. A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah </i>(NICOT), 64. For a fuller discussion of most of the issues connected with this acted out parable see W. McKane, <i>Jeremiah </i>(ICC), 1:285-92. However, the reason is not explained in the text and there is not enough evidence in the text to come to a firm conclusion, though the most likely possibility is that it was not to be taken off and washed but worn continuously.</p>
