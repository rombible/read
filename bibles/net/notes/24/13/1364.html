<A NAME="1364"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=872><b>tn</b> The translation has been restructured to break up a long sentence involving a conditional clause and an elliptical consequential clause. It has also been restructured to define more clearly what &#8220;these things&#8221; are. The Hebrew text reads: &#8220;And if you say, &#8216;Why have these things happened to me?&#8217; Because of the greatness of your iniquity your skirts [= what your skirt covers] have been uncovered and your heels have been treated with violence.&#8221;</p>
