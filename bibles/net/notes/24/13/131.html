<A NAME="131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=809><b>tn</b> The term here (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1494;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">ezor</font>) has been rendered in various ways: &#8220;girdle&#8221; (KJV, ASV), &#8220;waistband&#8221; (NASB), &#8220;waistcloth&#8221; (RSV), &#8220;sash&#8221; (NKJV), &#8220;belt&#8221; (NIV, NCV, NLT), and &#8220;loincloth&#8221; (NAB, NRSV, NJPS, REB). The latter is more accurate according to J. M. Myers, &#8220;Dress and Ornaments,&#8221; <i>IDB </i>1:870, and W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah </i>(Hermeneia), 1:399. It was a short, skirt-like garment reaching from the waist to the knees and worn next to the body (cf. v. 9). The modern equivalent is &#8220;shorts&#8221; as in TEV/GNB, CEV.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The <i>linen shorts</i> (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;loincloth&#8221;) were representative of Israel and the wearing of them was to illustrate the <sc>Lord&#8217;s close relation to his people (v. 11). Since the priests&#8217; garments were to be made wholly of linen (cf. Exod 28; Ezek 44:17-18), the fact that the shorts were to be made of linen probably was to symbolize the nature of Israel&#8217;s calling: they were to be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation (Exod 19:5-6). Just as the linen garments of the priest were to give him special honor and glory (Exod 28:40), so the linen garment was to be a source of praise and glory to the <sc>Lord (v. 11).</p>
