<A NAME="1372"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=880><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[I have seen] your adulteries, your neighings, and your shameless prostitution.&#8221; The meanings of the metaphorical references have been incorporated in the translation for the sake of clarity for readers of all backgrounds.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The sentence is rhetorically loaded. It begins with three dangling objects of the verb all describing their adulterous relationship with the false gods under different figures and which are resumed later under the words &#8220;your disgusting acts.&#8221; The Hebrew sentence reads: &#8220;Your adulteries, your neighings, your shameful prostitution, upon the hills in the fields I have seen your disgusting acts.&#8221; This sentence drips with explosive disgust at their adulterous betrayal.</p>
