<A NAME="1368"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=876><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;them.&#8221; This is another example of the rapid shift in pronouns seen several times in the book of Jeremiah. The pronouns in the preceding and the following are second feminine singular. It might be argued that &#8220;them&#8221; goes back to the &#8220;flock&#8221;/&#8220;sheep&#8221; in v. 20, but the next verse refers the fate described here to &#8220;you&#8221; (feminine singular). This may be another example of the kind of metaphoric shifts in referents discussed in the notes on 13:20 above. Besides, it would sound a little odd in the translation to speak of scattering one person like chaff.</p>
