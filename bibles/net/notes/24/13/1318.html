<A NAME="1318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=826><b>tn</b> Many of the English versions have erred in rendering this word &#8220;pride&#8221; or &#8220;arrogance&#8221; with the resultant implication that the <sc>Lord is going to destroy Israel&#8217;s pride, i.e., humble them through the punishment of exile. However, BDB 144-45 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> 1 is more probably correct when they classify this passage among those that deal with the &#8220;&#8216;<i>majesty, excellence</i>&#8217; of nations, their wealth, power, magnificence of buildings&#8230;.&#8221; The closest parallels to the usage here are in Zech 10:11 (parallel to scepter of Egypt); Ps 47:4 (47:5 HT; parallel to &#8220;our heritage&#8221; = &#8220;our land&#8221;); Isa 14:11; and Amos 8:7. The term is further defined in v. 11 where it refers to their special relationship and calling. To translate it &#8220;pride&#8221; or &#8220;arrogance&#8221; also ruins the wordplay on &#8220;ruin&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;</font> [<font face="Scholar">nishkhat</font>] in v. 7 and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ashkhit</font>] in v. 9).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Scholars ancient and modern are divided over the significance of the statement <i>I will ruin the highly exalted position in which Judah and Jerusalem take pride </i>(<i>Heb </i>&#8220;I will ruin the pride of Judah and Jerusalem&#8221;). Some feel that it refers to the corrupting influence of Assyria and Babylon and others feel that it refers to the threat of Babylonian exile. However, F. B. Huey (<i>Jeremiah, Lamentations </i>[NAC], 144) is correct in observing that the Babylonian exile did not lead to the rottenness of Judah, the corrupting influence of the foreign nations did. In Jeremiah&#8217;s day these came through the age-old influences of the Canaanite worship of Baal but also the astral worship introduced by Ahaz and Manasseh. For an example of the corrupting influence of Assyria on Judah through Ahaz&#8217;s political alliances see 2 Kgs 16 and also compare the allegory in Ezek 23:14-21. It was while the &#8220;linen shorts&#8221; were off Jeremiah&#8217;s body and buried in the rocks that the linen shorts were ruined. So the <sc>Lord &#8220;ruined&#8221; the privileged status that resulted from Israel&#8217;s close relationship to him (cf. v. 11). For the &#8220;problem&#8221; created by the <sc>Lord ruining Israel through corrupting influence compare the notes on Jer 4:10 and compare also passages like Isa 63:17 and Isa 6:10.</p>
