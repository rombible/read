<A NAME="95"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=563><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;bunch,&#8221; but this loses the irony; the word is used for the solemn assemblies at the religious feasts.</p>
<A NAME="96"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=564><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they are all adulterers, a congregation of unfaithful people.&#8221; However, spiritual adultery is, of course, meant, not literal adultery. So the literal translation would be misleading.</p>
<A NAME="97"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=565><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;The <sc>Lord says&#8221; have been moved up from the end of the verse to make clear that a change in speaker has occurred.</p>
<A NAME="98"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=566><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;They have readied [or strung] their tongue as their bow for lies.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=569><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;do not acknowledge me&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;do not know me.&#8221; But &#8220;knowing&#8221; in Hebrew thought often involves more than intellectual knowledge; it involves emotional and volitional commitment as well. For <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</font> meaning &#8220;acknowledge&#8221; see 1 Chr 28:9; Isa 29:21; Hos 2:20; Prov 3:6. This word is also found in ancient Near Eastern treaty contexts where it has the idea of a vassal king acknowledging the sovereignty of a greater king (cf. H. Huffmon, &#8220;The Treaty Background of Hebrew yada,&#8221; <i>BASOR</i> 181 [1966]: 31-37).</p>
<A NAME="912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=570><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Be on your guard&#8230;Do not trust.&#8221; The verbs are second masculine plural of direct address and there seems no way to translate literally and not give the mistaken impression that Jeremiah is being addressed. This is another example of the tendency in Hebrew style to turn from description to direct address (a figure of speech called apostrophe).</p>
<A NAME="913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=571><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;cheating, each of them will cheat.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> There is perhaps an intentional pun and allusion here to Gen 27:36 and the wordplay on the name Jacob there. The text here reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1511;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489; &#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1511;&#1465;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aqob ya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">qob</font>).</p>
<A NAME="914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=572><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;their tongues.&#8221; However, this is probably not a natural idiom in contemporary English and the tongue may stand as a part for the whole anyway.</p>
<A NAME="915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=573><b>tc</b> An alternate reading for vv. 5d-6b is: &#8220;They wear themselves out doing wrong. Jeremiah, you live in the midst of deceitful people. They deceitfully refuse to take any thought of/acknowledge me.&#8221; The translation which has been adopted is based on a redivision of the lines, a redivision of some of the words, and a revocalization of some of the consonants. The MT reads literally &#8220;doing wrong they weary themselves. Your sitting in the midst of deceit; in deceit they refuse to know me&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1493;&#1461;&#1492; &#1504;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1475; &#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464; &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;&#1498;&#1456; &#1502;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492; &#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1491;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font>). The Greek version reads literally &#8220;they do wrong and they do not cease to turn themselves around. Usury upon usury and deceit upon deceit. They do not want to know me.&#8221; This suggests that one should read the Hebrew text as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1489;&#1475; &#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1498;&#1456; &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;&#1498;&#1456; &#1502;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1470;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1470;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492; &#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1491;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514; &#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497; &#1492;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1493;&#1461;&#1492; &#1504;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;</font>, which translated literally yields &#8220;doing evil [= &#8220;they do evil&#8221; using the Hiphil infinitive absolute as a finite verb (cf. GKC 346 §113.<i>ff</i>)] they are not able [cf. KBL 468 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font> Niph.3 and see Exod 7:18 for parallel use] to repent. Oppression on oppression [cf. BDB 1067 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1498;&#1456;</font>, II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1498;&#1456;</font>]; deceit on deceit. They refuse to know me.&#8221; This reading has ancient support and avoids the introduction of an unexpected second masculine suffix into the context. It has been adopted here along with a number of modern commentaries (cf., e.g., W. McKane, <i>Jeremiah </i>[ICC], 1:201) and English versions as the more likely reading.</p>
<A NAME="916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=574><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;do not acknowledge me&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;do not know me.&#8221; See the note on the phrase &#8220;do not take any thought of me&#8221; in 9:3.</p>

<A NAME="918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=576><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will refine/purify them.&#8221; The words &#8220;in the fires of affliction&#8221; are supplied in the translation to give clarity to the metaphor.</p>
<A NAME="919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=577><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;daughter of my people.&#8221; For the translation given here see 4:11 and the note on the phrase &#8220;dear people&#8221; there.</p>
<A NAME="920"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=578><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;For how else shall I deal because of the wickedness of the daughter of my people.&#8221; The MT does not have the word &#8220;wickedness.&#8221; The word, however, is read in the Greek version. This is probably a case of a word dropping out because of its similarities to the consonants preceding or following it (i.e., haplography). The word &#8220;wickedness&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">at</font>) has dropped out before the words &#8220;my dear people&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bat-</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ammi</font>). The causal nuance which is normal for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mippÿne</font>) does not make sense without some word like this, and the combination of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mippÿne ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">at</font>) does occur in Jer 7:12 and one very like it occurs in Jer 26:3.</p>
<A NAME="921"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=579><b>tc</b> This reading follows the Masoretic consonants (the <i>Kethib</i>, a Qal active participle from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1496;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shakhat</font>). The Masoretes preferred to read &#8220;a sharpened arrow&#8221; (the <i>Qere</i>, a Qal passive participle from the same root or a homonym, meaning &#8220;hammered, beaten&#8221;). See <i>HALOT</i> 1354 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1496;</font> for discussion. The exact meaning of the word makes little difference to the meaning of the metaphor itself.</p>
<A NAME="922"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=580><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;They speak deceit.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=581><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;With his mouth a person speaks peace to his neighbor, but in his heart he sets an ambush for him.&#8221;</p>

Should I not bring retribution&#8230;?&#8221; The rhetorical questions function as emphatic declarations.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> See 5:9, 29. This is somewhat of a refrain at the end of a catalog of Judah&#8217;s sins.</p>
<A NAME="925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=583><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;I said&#8221; are not in the text, but there is general agreement that Jeremiah is the speaker. Cf. the lament in 8:18-9:1. These words are supplied in the translation for clarity. Some English versions follow the Greek text which reads a plural imperative here. Since this reading would make the transition between 9:10 and 9:11 easier it is probably not original but a translator&#8217;s way of smoothing over a difficulty.</p>
<A NAME="926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=584><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will lift up weeping and mourning.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=585><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for the mountains.&#8221; However, the context makes clear that it is the grasslands or pastures on the mountains that are meant. The words &#8220;for the grasslands&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="928"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=586><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;the <sc>Lord said&#8221; are not in the text, but it is obvious from the content that he is the speaker. These words are supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>

<A NAME="930"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=588><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a heap of ruins, a haunt for jackals.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="931"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=589><b>tn</b> The words, &#8220;I said&#8221; are not in the text. It is not clear that a shift in speaker has taken place. However, the words of the verse are very unlikely to be a continuation of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s threat. It is generally assumed that these are the words of Jeremiah and that a dialogue is going on between him and the <sc>Lord in vv. 9-14. That assumption is accepted here.</p>
<A NAME="932"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=590><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Who is the wise man that he may understand this?&#8221;</p>

See, e.g., BDB 542 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font>.</p>

<A NAME="942"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=600><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will send the sword after them.&#8221; The sword here is probably not completely literal but refers to death by violent means, including death by the sword.</p>
<A NAME="943"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=601><b>sn</b> He will destroy them but not completely. See Jer 5:18; 30:11; 46:28.</p>

<A NAME="945"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=603><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Thus says Yahweh of armies.&#8221; However, without some addition it is not clear to whom the command is addressed. The words are supplied in the translation for clarity and to help resolve a rather confusing issue of who is speaking throughout vv. 16-21. As has been evident throughout the translation, the speaker is not always indicated. Sometimes it is not even clear who the speaker is. In general the translation and the notes have reflected the general consensus in identifying who it is. Here, however, there is a good deal of confusion about who is speaking in vv. 18, 20-21. The Greek translation has the <sc>Lord speaking throughout with second plural pronouns in vv. 18, 21 and the absence of the first line in v. 22. It would be hard to explain how the MT arose if it were the original text. Critical commentators such as J. Bright, W. Holladay, and W. McKane resolve the issue by dropping out the introductory formula in v. 17 and the first line of v. 22 and assigning the whole lament to Jeremiah. It seems obvious from the first plural pronouns and the content of v. 18 (and probably v. 21 as well) and the fact that the <sc>Lord is referred to in other than the first person in v. 20 that he is not the speaker of those verses. I have attempted to resolve the issue by having Jeremiah report the <sc>Lord&#8217;s command in v. 17 and have the rest of the speech be essentially that of Jeremiah. It should be admitted, however, that the issue is far from resolved. Most English versions simply ignore the problem. The GNB (= TEV) is a rare exception.</p>
<A NAME="946"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=604><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Consider!&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="950"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=608><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;How we are ruined!&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="951"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=609><b>tn</b> The order of these two lines has been reversed for English stylistic reasons. The text reads in Hebrew &#8220;because we have left our land because they have thrown down our dwellings.&#8221; The two clauses offer parallel reasons for the cries &#8220;How ruined we are! [How] we are greatly disgraced!&#8221; But the first line must contain a prophetic perfect (because the lament comes from Jerusalem) and the second a perfect referring to a destruction that is itself future. This seems the only way to render the verse that would not be misleading.</p>
<A NAME="952"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=610><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;I said&#8221; are not in the text. The text merely has &#8220;Indeed, yes.&#8221; The words are supplied in the translation to indicate that the speaker is still Jeremiah though he now is not talking about the mourning woman but is talking to them. See the notes on 9:17-18 for further explanation.</p>
<A NAME="953"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=611><b>tn</b> It is a little difficult to explain how the Hebrew particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) is functioning here. W. L. Holladay (<i>Jeremiah </i>[Hermeneia], 1:311) may be correct in seeing it as introducing the contents of what those who call for the mourning women are to say. In this case, Jeremiah picks up the task as representative of the people.</p>

<A NAME="956"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=614><b>sn</b> Here <i>Death</i> is personified (treated as though it were a person). Some have seen as possible background to this lament an allusion to Mesopotamian mythology where the demon Lamastu climbs in through the windows of houses and over their walls to kill children and babies.</p>

So tell your daughters and neighbors, &#8216;The <sc>Lord wants you to say, &#8220;The dead bodies of people lie scattered&#8230;They lie scattered&#8230;has not been gathered.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221; The main causes of ambiguity are the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) introducing v. 21 and the verb form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dabber</font>) at the beginning of v. 22. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> may be interpreted as introducing a causal sentence giving Jeremiah&#8217;s grounds for the commands of v. 19 in which case the verbs would best be understood as prophetic perfects (as in the second alternate translation). Or it may be interpreted as introducing the content of the lament the women are to teach their daughters and neighbors (as in the translation adopted and in the first alternate translation). The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;</font> may be interpreted as a Piel masculine singular imperative addressed to Jeremiah (as in the first alternate translation where it is placed at the end for the sake of clarity) or as a Piel infinitive absolute either explaining what the woman are to teach their daughters and neighbors (as in the second alternate translation; cf. GKC 341 §113.<i>h</i>, <i>i</i> for this use of the infinitive absolute) or as equivalent to an imperative addressed to the women telling them to tell their daughters and neighbors the reason for the lament, i.e., the <sc>Lord&#8217;s promise of widespread death (cf. GKC 346 §113.<i>bb</i> for this use of the infinitive absolute). The translation chosen has opted for v. 21 as the content of the lament and v. 22 as the further explanation that Jeremiah has the women pass on to their neighbors and daughters. This appears to this interpreter to create the least confusion and dislocation in the flow of the passage.</p>
<A NAME="958"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=616><b>sn</b> It is not always clear why verses were placed in their present position in the editorial process of collecting Jeremiah&#8217;s sermons and the words the <sc>Lord spoke to him (see Jer 36:4, 32 for reference to two of these collections). Here it is probable that vv. 23-26 were added as a further answer to the question raised in v. 12.</p>

<A NAME="961"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=619><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;fairness and justice, because these things give me pleasure.&#8221; Verse 24 reads in Hebrew, &#8220;But let the one who brags brag in this: understanding and knowing me that I, the <sc>Lord, do faithfulness, justice, and righteousness in the earth for/that I delight in these.&#8221; It is uncertain whether the Hebrew particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) before the clause &#8220;I delight in these things&#8221; is parallel to the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> introducing the clause &#8220;that I, the <sc>Lord, act&#8230;&#8221; or causal giving the grounds for the <sc>Lord acting the way he does. In the light of the contrasts in the passage and the emphasis that Jeremiah has placed on obedience to the covenant and ethical conduct in conjunction with real allegiance to the <sc>Lord not mere lip service, it is probable that the clauses are parallel. For the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> to introduce clauses of further definition after a direct object as here see GKC 365 §117.<i>h</i> and see BDB 393 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</font> Qal.1.a. For parallels to the idea of Yahweh requiring these characteristics in people see Hos 6:6, Mic 6:8.</p>

The people of these nations practiced circumcision but not as a sign of the covenant. The people of Israel engaged in it as a religious practice but without any obedience to the covenant that it was a sign of or any real commitment to the <sc>Lord.</p>
