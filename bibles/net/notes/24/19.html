<A NAME="191"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1119><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;Jeremiah&#8221; is not in the text. Some Hebrew <sc>mss and some of the versions have &#8220;to me.&#8221; This section, 19:1&#8211;20:6 appears to be one of the biographical sections of the book of Jeremiah where incidents in his life are reported in third person. See clearly 9:14 and 20:1-3. The <sc>mss and versions do not represent a more original text but are translational or interpretive attempts to fill in a text which had no referent. They are like the translational addition that has been supplied on the basis of contextual indicators.</p>
<A NAME="192"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1120><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;an earthenware jar of the potter.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The word translated &#8220;clay&#8221; here refers to a clay which has been baked or fired in a kiln. In Jer 18 the clay was still soft and pliable, capable of being formed into different kinds of vessels. Here the clay is set, just as Israel is set in its ways. The word for jar refers probably to a water jug or decanter and is onomatopoeic, <i>baqbuq</i>, referring to the gurgling sound made by pouring out the water.</p>
<A NAME="193"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1121><b>tc</b> The words &#8220;Take with you&#8221; follow the reading of the Syriac version and to a certain extent the reading of the Greek version (the latter does not have &#8220;with you&#8221;). The Hebrew text does not have these words but they are undoubtedly implicit.</p>
<A NAME="194"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1122><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;elders&#8221; both here and before &#8220;of the people.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The civil and religious leaders are referred to here. They were to be witnesses of the symbolic act and of the message that Jeremiah proclaimed to the leaders of Jerusalem and its citizens (see v. 3).</p>
<A NAME="195"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1123><b>sn</b> The exact location of the <i>Potsherd Gate</i> is unknown since it is nowhere else mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. It is sometimes identified with the Dung Gate mentioned in Neh 2:13; 3:13-14; 12:31 on the basis of the Jerusalem Targum. It is probably called &#8220;Potsherd Gate&#8221; because that is where the potter threw out the broken pieces of pottery which were no longer of use to him. The Valley of Ben Hinnom has already been mentioned in 7:31-32 in connection with the illicit religious practices, including child sacrifice, which took place there. The Valley of Ben Hinnom (or sometimes Valley of Hinnom) runs along the west and south sides of Jerusalem.</p>
<A NAME="196"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1124><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the words that I will speak to you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="197"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1125><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="198"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1126><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Yahweh of armies, the God of Israel.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> See the study notes on 2:19 and 7:3 for explanation of this title.</p>
<A NAME="199"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1127><b>sn</b> Careful comparison of the use of this term throughout this passage and comparison with 7:31-33 which is parallel to several verses in this passage will show that the reference is to the Valley of Ben Hinnom which will become a Valley of Slaughter (see v. 6 and 7:32).</p>
<A NAME="1910"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1128><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;which everyone who hears it [or about it] his ears will ring.&#8221; This is proverbial for a tremendous disaster. See 1 Sam 3:11; 2 Kgs 21:12 for similar prophecies.</p>
<A NAME="1911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1129><b>tn</b> The text merely has &#8220;they.&#8221; But since a reference is made later to &#8220;they&#8221; and &#8220;their ancestors,&#8221; the referent must be to the people that the leaders of the people and leaders of the priests represent.</p>
<A NAME="1912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1130><b>sn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;have made this city foreign.&#8221; The verb here is one that is built off of the noun and adjective which relate to foreign nations. Comparison may be made to Jer 2:21 where the adjective refers to the strange, wild vine as opposed to the choice vine the <sc>Lord planted and to 5:19 and 8:19 where the noun is used of worshiping foreign gods. Israel through its false worship has &#8220;denationalized&#8221; itself in its relation to God.</p>
<A NAME="1913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1131><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fathers.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1132><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the blood of innocent ones.&#8221; This must be a reference to child sacrifice as explained in the next verse. Some have seen a reference to the sins of social injustice alluded to in 2 Kgs 21:16 and 24:4 but those are connected with the city itself. Hence the word children is supplied in the translation to make the referent explicit.</p>
<A NAME="1915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1133><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;here&#8221; is not in the text. However, it is implicit from the rest of the context. It is supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1134><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;such sacrifices&#8221; are not in the text. The text merely says &#8220;to burn their children in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal which I did not command.&#8221; The command obviously refers not to the qualification &#8220;to Baal&#8221; but to burning the children in the fire as burnt offerings. The words are supplied in the translation to avoid a possible confusion that the reference is to sacrifices to Baal. Likewise the words should not be translated so literally that they leave the impression that God never said anything about sacrificing their children to other gods. The fact is he did. See Lev 18:21; Deut 12:30; 18:10.</p>
<A NAME="1917"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1135><b>tn</b> This phrase (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;Oracle of the <sc>Lord&#8221;) has been handled this way on several occasions when it occurs within first person addresses where the <sc>Lord is the speaker. See, e.g., 16:16; 17:24; 18:6.</p>
<A NAME="1918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1136><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;it will no longer be called to this place Topheth or the Valley of Ben Hinnom but the Valley of Slaughter.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> See Jer 7:31-32 for an almost word for word repetition of vv. 5-6.</p>
<A NAME="1919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1137><b>sn</b> There is perhaps a two-fold wordplay in the use of this word. One involves the sound play with the word for &#8220;jar,&#8221; which has been explained as a water decanter. The word here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1465;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vaqqoti</font>). The word for jar in v. 1 is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1463;&#1511;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1467;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vaqbuq</font>). There may also be a play on the literal use of this word to refer to the laying waste or destruction of a land (see Isa 24:3; Nah 2:3). Many modern commentaries think that at this point Jeremiah emptied out the contents of the jar, symbolizing the &#8220;emptying&#8221; out of their plans.</p>
<A NAME="1920"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1138><b>sn</b> This refers to the fact that they will die in battle. The sword would be only one of the weapons that strikes them down. It is one of the trio of &#8220;sword,&#8221; &#8220;starvation,&#8221; and &#8220;disease&#8221; which were the concomitants of war referred to so often in the book of Jeremiah. Starvation is referred to in v. 9.</p>
<A NAME="1921"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1139><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies and in the hand of those who seek their soul [= life].&#8221; In this context the two are meant as obvious qualifications of one entity, not two. Some rearrangement of the qualifiers had to be made in the English translation to convey this.</p>
<A NAME="1922"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1140><b>sn</b> See 18:16 and the study note there.</p>
<A NAME="1923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1141><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all its smitings.&#8221; This word has been used several times for the metaphorical &#8220;wounds&#8221; that Israel has suffered as a result of the blows from its enemies. See, e.g., 14:17. It is used in the Hebrew Bible of scourging, both literally and metaphorically (cf. Deut 25:3; Isa 10:26), and of slaughter and defeat (1 Sam 4:10; Josh 10:20). Here it refers to the results of the crushing blows at the hands of her enemies which has made her the object of scorn.</p>
<A NAME="1924"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1142><b>tn</b> This verse has been restructured to try to bring out the proper thought and subordinations reflected in the verse without making the sentence too long and complex in English: <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and daughters. And they will eat one another&#8217;s flesh in the siege and in the straits which their enemies who are seeking their lives reduce them to.&#8221; This also shows the agency through which God&#8217;s causation was effected, i.e., the siege.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Cannibalism is one of the penalties for disobedience to their covenant with the <sc>Lord effected through the Mosaic covenant. See Deut 28:53, 55, 57. For examples of this being carried out see 2 Kgs 6:28-29; Lam 4:10.</p>
<A NAME="1925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1143><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;And the <sc>Lord continued&#8221; are not in the text. However, they are necessary to take us clearly back to the flow of the narrative begun in vv. 1-2 and interrupted by the long speech in vv. 3-9.</p>
<A NAME="1926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1144><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Thus says Yahweh of armies.&#8221; For this title see the study note on 2:19. The translation attempts to avoid the confusion of embedding quotes within quotes by reducing this one to an indirect quote.</p>
<A NAME="1927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1145><b>tn</b> The adverb &#8220;Thus&#8221; or &#8220;Like this&#8221; normally points back to something previously mentioned. See, e.g., Exod 29:35; Num 11:15; 15:11; Deut 25:9.</p>
<A NAME="1928"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1146><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Like this I will break this people and this city, just as one breaks the vessel of a potter which is not able to be repaired.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1929"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1147><b>sn</b> See Jer 7:22-23 for parallels.</p>
<A NAME="1930"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1148><b>tn</b> This phrase (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;Oracle of the <sc>Lord&#8221;) has been handled this way on several occasions when it occurs within first person addresses where the <sc>Lord is the speaker. See, e.g., 16:16; 17:24; 18:6.</p>
<A NAME="1931"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1149><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;by dead bodies&#8221; is not in the text but is implicit from the context. They are supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1932"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1150><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the host of heaven.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1933"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1151><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And Jeremiah entered from Topheth where the <sc>Lord had sent him to prophesy and he stood in the courtyard of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s temple.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1934"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1152><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Yahweh of armies, the God of Israel.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> See the study notes on 2:19 and 7:3 for explanation of this title.</p>
<A NAME="1935"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1153><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all its towns.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1936"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1154><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;They hardened [or made stiff] their neck so as not to.&#8221;</p>
