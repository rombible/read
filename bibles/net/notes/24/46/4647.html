<A NAME="4647"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=2494><b>tn</b> The precise meaning of this verse is uncertain. The Hebrew text reads: &#8220;They [those who enter in great force] will cut down her forest, oracle of the <sc>Lord, though it [the forest] cannot be searched out/through for they [those who come in great force] are more numerous than locusts and there is no number to them.&#8221; Some see the reference to the forest as metaphorical of Egypt&#8217;s population which the Babylonian army decimates (H. Freedman, <i>Jeremiah </i>[SoBB], 298, and see BDB 420 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</font> 1.a which refers to the forest as a figure of foes to be cut down and destroyed and compare Isa 10:34). Others see the reference to literal trees and see the decimation of Egypt in general (C. von Orelli, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 329). And some see it as a continuation of the simile of the snake fleeing, the soldiers cutting down the trees because they cannot find it (J. A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah </i>[NICOT], 693). However, the simile of v. 22a has already been dropped in v. 22b-d; they come against her. Hence it is probably best to see this as a continuation of the simile in v. 22c-d and see the reference to the Babylonian army coming against her, i.e., Egypt (the nation or people of Egypt), like woodcutters cutting down trees.</p>
