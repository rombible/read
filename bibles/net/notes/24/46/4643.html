<A NAME="4643"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2490><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;pampered&#8221; is not in the text. It is supplied in the translation to explain the probable meaning of the simile. The mercenaries were well cared for like stall-fed calves, but in the face of the danger they will prove no help because they will turn and run away without standing their ground. Some see the point of the simile to be that they too are fattened for slaughter. However, the next two lines do not fit that interpretation too well.</p>
