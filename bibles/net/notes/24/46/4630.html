<A NAME="4630"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2477><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the <sc>Lord will thrust them down.&#8221; However, the <sc>Lord is speaking (cf. clearly in v. 18), so the first person is adopted for the sake of consistency. This has been a consistent problem in the book of Jeremiah where the prophet is so identified with the word of the <sc>Lord that he sometimes uses the first person and sometimes the third. It creates confusion for the average reader who is trying to follow the flow of the argument and has been shifted to the first person like this on a number of occasions. TEV and CEV have generally adopted the same policy as have some other modern English versions at various points.</p>
