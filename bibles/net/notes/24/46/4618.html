The <sc>Lord does not have a literal &#8220;sword,&#8221; but he uses agents of destruction like the Assyrian armies (called his &#8220;rod&#8221; in Isa 10:5-6) and the Babylonian armies (called his war club in Jer 51:20) to wreak vengeance on his foes. Likewise, swords do not &#8220;eat&#8221; or &#8220;drink.&#8221; What is meant here is that God will use this battle against the Egyptians to kill off many Egyptians until his vengeance is fully satisfied.</p>
