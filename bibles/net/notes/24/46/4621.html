<A NAME="4621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2468><b>sn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Virgin Daughter of Egypt.&#8221; See the study note on Jer 14:17 for the significance of the use of this figure. The use of the figure here perhaps refers to the fact that Egypt&#8217;s geographical isolation allowed her safety and protection that a virgin living at home would enjoy under her father&#8217;s protection (so F. B. Huey, <i>Jeremiah, Lamentations </i>[NAC], 379). By her involvement in the politics of Palestine she had forfeited that safety and protection and was now suffering for it.</p>
