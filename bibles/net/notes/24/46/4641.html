The exact meaning of the word translated &#8220;stinging fly&#8221; is uncertain due to the fact that it occurs nowhere else in Hebrew literature. For a discussion of the meaning of the word which probably refers to the &#8220;gadfly,&#8221; which bites and annoys livestock, see W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah </i>(Hermeneia), 2:331, who also suggests, probably correctly, that the word is a collective referring to swarms of such insects (cf. the singular <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arbeh</font>] in v. 23 which always refers to swarms of locusts). The translation presupposes the emendation of the second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bah</font>) with a number of Hebrew <sc>mss and a number of the versions (cf. <i>BHS</i>, fn b).</p>
