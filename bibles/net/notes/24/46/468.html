<A NAME="468"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2455><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Their soldiers.&#8221; These words are actually at the midpoint of the stanza as the subject of the third of the five verbs. However, as G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, and T. G. Smothers (<i>Jeremiah 26-52 </i>[WBC],<i> </i>291) note, this is the subject of all five verbs &#8220;are terrified,&#8221; &#8220;are retreating,&#8221; &#8220;have been defeated,&#8221; &#8220;have run away,&#8221; and &#8220;have not looked back.&#8221; The subject is put at the front to avoid an unidentified &#8220;they.&#8221;</p>
