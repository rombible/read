<A NAME="4629"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2476><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word used here only occurs here (in the Niphal) and in Prov 28:3 (in the Qal) where it refers to a rain that beats down grain. That idea would fit nicely with the idea of the soldiers being beaten down, or defeated. It is possible that the rarity of this verb (versus the common verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nus</font>, &#8220;flee&#8221;) and the ready identification of Apis with the bull calf (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">abbir</font>) has led to the reading of the Greek text (so C. von Orelli, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 327). The verbs in this verse and the following are in the perfect tense but should be understood as prophetic perfects since the text is dealing with what will happen when Nebuchadnezzar comes into Egypt. The text of vv. 18-24 shows a greater mixture with some perfects and some imperfects, sometimes even within the same verse (e.g., v. 22).</p>
