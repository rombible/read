<A NAME="4632"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2479><b>tc</b> The words &#8220;in their hurry to flee&#8221; are not in the text but appear to be necessary to clarify the point that the stumbling and falling here is not the same as that in vv. 6, 12 where they occur in the context of defeat and destruction. Reference here appears to be to the mercenary soldiers who in their hurried flight to escape stumble over one another and fall. This is fairly clear from the literal translation &#8220;he multiplies the stumbling one. Also [= and] a man falls against a man and they say [probably = &#8220;saying&#8221;; an epexegetical use of the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive (<i>IBHS</i> 551 §33.2.2a, and see Exod 2:10 as a parallel)] &#8216;Get up! Let&#8217;s go&#8230;&#8217;&#8221; A reference to the flight of the mercenaries is also seen in v. 21. Many of the modern commentaries and a few of the modern English versions follow the Greek text and read vv. 15a-16 very differently. The Greek reads &#8220;Why has Apis fled from you? Your choice calf [i.e., Apis] has not remained. For the Lord has paralyzed him. And your multitudes have fainted and fallen; and each one said to his neighbor&#8230;&#8221; (reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1467;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464; &#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1501;&#1470;&#1504;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1500; &#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;&#1512;&#1461;&#1506;&#1461;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</font> instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1500; &#1492;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492; &#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1501;&#1470;&#1504;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1500; &#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;&#1512;&#1461;&#1506;&#1461;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</font>). One would expect <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;&#1512;&#1461;&#1506;&#1461;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ish </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el-re</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ehu</font>) to go with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">mÿru</font>) because it is idiomatic in this expression (cf., e.g., Gen 11:3; Judg 6:29). However, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;&#1512;&#1461;&#1506;&#1461;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ish </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el-re</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ehu</font>) is also found with singular verbs as here in Exod 22:9; 33:11; 1 Sam 10:11. There is no doubt that the Hebrew text is the more difficult and thus probably original. The reading of the Greek version is not supported by any other text or version and looks like an attempt to smooth out a somewhat awkward Hebrew original.</p>
