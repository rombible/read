<A NAME="4628"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2475><b>tn</b> The word translated &#8220;soldiers&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">abbirim</font>) is not the Hebrew word that has been used of soldiers elsewhere in these oracles (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">gibborim</font>). It is an adjective used as a noun that can apply to animals, i.e., of a bull (Ps 50:13) or a stallion (Judg 5:22). Moreover, the form is masculine plural and the verbs are singular. Hence, many modern commentaries and English versions follow the redivision of the first line presupposed by the Greek version, &#8220;Apis has fled&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1505; &#1495;&#1463;&#1507;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nas khaf</font>) and see this as a reference to the bull god of Memphis. However, the noun is used of soldiers in Lam 1:15 and the plural could be the distributive plural, i.e., each and every one (cf. GKC 464 §145.<i>l</i> and compare usage in Gen 27:29).</p>
