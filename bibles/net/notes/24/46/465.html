<A NAME="465"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2452><b>tn</b> This is often translated &#8220;prepare your shields, both small and large.&#8221; However, the idea of &#8220;prepare&#8221; is misleading because the Hebrew word here (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">arakh</font>) refers in various senses to arranging or setting things in order, such as altars in a row, dishes on a table, soldiers in ranks. Here it refers to the soldiers lining up in rank with ranks of soldiers holding at the ready the long oval or rectangular &#8220;shield&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">tsinnah</font>]; cf. BDB 857 s.v. III <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font>) which protected the whole body and the smaller round &#8220;buckler&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1490;&#1461;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">magen</font>) which only protected the torso (the relative size of these two kinds of shields can be seen from the weight of each in 1 Kgs 10:16-17). These were to be arranged in solid ranks to advance into battle. It would be pedantic and misleading to translate here &#8220;Fall into ranks with your large and small shields at the ready&#8221; because that might suggest that soldiers had more than one kind. It is uncertain who is issuing the commands here. TEV adds &#8220;The Egyptian officers shout,&#8221; which is the interpretation of J. A. Thompson (<i>Jeremiah </i>[NICOT], 688).</p>
