<A NAME="4624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2471><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;In the panic of their flight&#8221; and &#8220;defeated&#8221; are not in the text but are supplied in the translation to give clarity to the metaphor for the average reader. The verbs in this verse are all in the tense that emphasizes that the action is viewed as already having been accomplished (i.e., the Hebrew prophetic perfect). This is consistent with the <i>vav</i> consecutive perfects in v. 10 which look to the future.</p>
