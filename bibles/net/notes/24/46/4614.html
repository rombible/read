<A NAME="4614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2461><b>sn</b> The peoples that are referred to here are all known to have been mercenaries in the army of Egypt (see Nah 3:9; Ezek 30:5). The place names in Hebrew are actually Cush, Put, and Lud. &#8220;Cush&#8221; has already been identified in Jer 13:23 as the region along the Nile south of Egypt most commonly referred to as Ethiopia. The identification of &#8220;Put&#8221; and &#8220;Lud&#8221; are both debated though it is generally felt that Put was a part of Libya and Lud is to be identified with Lydia in Asia Minor. For further discussion see M. J. Mellink, &#8220;Lud, Ludim&#8221; <i>IDB</i> 3:178, and T. O. Lambdin, &#8220;Put,&#8221; <i>IDB</i> 3:971.</p>
