<A NAME="4651"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=2498><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Behold I will punish Amon of No and Pharaoh and Egypt and its gods and its kings and Pharaoh and all who trust in him.&#8221; There appears to be a copyist slip involving a double writing of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al-par</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">oh</font>). The present translation has followed the suggestion of <i>BHS</i> and deleted the first one since the second is necessary for the syntactical connection, &#8220;Pharaoh and all who trust in him.&#8221;</p>
