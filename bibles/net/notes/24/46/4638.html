<A NAME="4638"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2485><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Like Tabor among the mountains and like Carmel by the sea he will come.&#8221; The addition of &#8220;conqueror&#8221; and &#8220;imposing&#8221; are implicit from the context and from the metaphor. They have been supplied in the translation to give the reader some idea of the meaning of the verse.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Most of the commentaries point out that neither Tabor nor Carmel are all that tall in terms of sheer height. Mount Tabor, on the east end of the Jezreel Valley, is only about 1800 feet (540 m) tall. Mount Carmel, on the Mediterranean Coast, is only about 1700 feet (510 m) at its highest. However, all the commentators point out that the idea of imposing height and majesty are due to the fact that they are rugged mountains that stand out dominantly over their surroundings. The point of the simile is that Nebuchadnezzar and his army will stand out in power and might over all the surrounding kings and their armies.</p>
