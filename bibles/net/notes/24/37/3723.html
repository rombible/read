<A NAME="3723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2149><b>tn</b> The meaning of this last sentence is somewhat uncertain. The Hebrew expression here occurs nowhere else in the Hebrew Bible and its meaning is debated. The verb is pointed as a shortened form of the Hiphil infinitive construct of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khalaq</font>; see GKC 148 §53.<i>q</i> for explanation of the phenomenon and other examples). There are, however, no other examples of the use of this verb in the Hiphil. BDB 324 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1511;</font> Hiph defines it as &#8220;receive a portion&#8221; and explains it as a denominative from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1461;&#1500;&#1462;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kheleq</font>, &#8220;portion&#8221;) but says that the form is dubious. KBL s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1511;</font> Hif defines it as &#8220;take part in dividing&#8221; but that does not fit the prepositional phrase that follows (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">misham</font>, &#8220;from there&#8221;) as well as &#8220;to receive a portion.&#8221; The Greek version did not understand this of dividing property but of conducting business. Later revisions of the Greek and the Latin version, however, did understand it of &#8220;taking a share.&#8221; The translation of BDB has been expanded to better reflect the probable situation. For the meaning of &#8220;his family&#8221; for the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">am</font>) compare the usage in Job 18:19. For a fuller discussion of the probable situation see J. A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah </i>(NICOT), 633-34.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Though some commentators disagree, this transaction should not be viewed as subsequent to the transaction recorded in Jer 32 and seen as an attempt to take possession of a field that he had already bought. That transaction took place sometime later after he had been confined to the courtyard of the guardhouse (compare 32:2 with 37:21) and involved his buying a near relative&#8217;s field. The word used here refers to &#8220;getting one&#8217;s own share&#8221; (compare 1 Sam 30:24; Josh 15:13, and see also Mic 2:4) not taking possession of someone else&#8217;s. &#8220;There&#8221; refers to the territory of Benjamin just mentioned but more specifically to Jeremiah&#8217;s hometown, Anathoth (cf. 1:1).</p>
