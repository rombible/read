<A NAME="3729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2155><b>sn</b> The officials mentioned here are not the same as those mentioned in Jer 36:12, most of whom were favorably disposed toward Jeremiah, or at least regarded what he said with enough trepidation to try to protect Jeremiah and preserve the scroll containing his messages (36:16, 19, 24). All those officials had been taken into exile with Jeconiah in 597 <sc>b.c. (2 Kgs 24:14).</p>
