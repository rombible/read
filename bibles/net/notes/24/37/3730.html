<A NAME="3730"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2156><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for they had made it into the house of confinement.&#8221; The causal particle does not fit the English sentence very well and &#8220;house of confinement&#8221; needs some explanation. Some translate this word &#8220;prison&#8221; but that creates redundancy with the earlier word translated &#8220;prison&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bet ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">esur</font>, &#8220;house of the band/binding&#8221;] which is more closely related to the concept of prison [cf. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1505;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">asir</font>, &#8220;prisoner&#8221;]). It is clear from the next verse that Jeremiah was confined in a cell in the dungeon of this place.</p>
