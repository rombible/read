GKC 460 §144.<i>d</i>). This text also has another example of the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) + infinitive absolute continuing a finite verbal form (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1465;&#1503;</font> [<font face="Scholar">vÿnaton</font>] = &#8220;and they gave&#8221;; cf. GKC 345 §113.<i>y</i> and see Jer 32:44; 36:23).</p>
