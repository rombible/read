<A NAME="3717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2143><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Thus says the <sc>Lord, &#8216;Do not deceive yourselves, saying, &#8220;The Chaldeans will surely go away from against us&#8221; because they will not go away.&#8217;&#8221; The first person &#8220;I, the <sc>Lord,&#8221; has been used because the whole of vv. 7-8 has been a quote from the <sc>Lord and it would be confusing to go back and start a separate quote. The indirect quote has been used instead of the direct quote to avoid the proliferation of quote marks at the end and the possible confusion that creates.</p>
