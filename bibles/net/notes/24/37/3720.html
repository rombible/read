<A NAME="3720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2146><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;The following events also occurred&#8221; are not in the text. They are a way to introduce the incidents recorded in 37:11-21 without creating a long complex sentence in English like the Hebrew does. The Hebrew of vv. 11-12a reads &#8220;And it was/happened while the army of the Chaldeans had taken themselves up from against Jerusalem, Jeremiah set out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to take part&#8230;&#8221; For the rendering &#8220;temporarily withdrawn from Jerusalem&#8221; see the translator&#8217;s note on v. 5. The words &#8220;was coming&#8221; are not in the text either but are implicit and have been supplied in the translation for clarity and smoothness of English expression.</p>
