<A NAME="3713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2139><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;to ask me what will happen.&#8221; The dominant usage of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">darash</font>) is to &#8220;inquire&#8221; in the sense of gaining information about what will happen (cf., e.g., 1 Kgs 14:5; 2 Kgs 8:8; 22:7-8) but it is also used in the sense of &#8220;seeking help&#8221; from (cf., e.g., Isa 31:1; 2 Chr 16:12; 20:3). The latter nuance appears appropriate in Jer 20:2 where Zedekiah is hoping for some miraculous intervention. That nuance also appears appropriate here where Zedekiah has sent messengers to ask Jeremiah to intercede on their behalf. However, it is also possible that the intent of both verbs is to find out from God whether the Egyptian mission will succeed and more permanent relief from the siege will be had.</p>
