<A NAME="3711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2137><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And the army of Pharaoh had set out from Egypt and the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard a report about them and they went up from besieging them.&#8221; The sentence has been restructured and reworded to give greater emphasis to the most pertinent fact, i.e., that the siege had been temporarily lifted. The word &#8220;temporarily&#8221; is not in the text but is implicit from the rest of the context. It is supplied in the translation here to better show that the information in vv. 4-5 is all parenthetical, providing a background for the oracle that will follow. For the meaning &#8220;given up their siege against&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;had taken themselves away from against&#8221;) see BDB 749 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> Niph.1.c(2); 759 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> IV.2.b.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Pharaoh referred to here is Pharaoh Hophra who is named in Jer 44:30. He ruled from 589-570 <sc>b.c. Shortly after he began to rule, Zedekiah had been enticed by some of the officials in his court to appeal to him for aid. This act of rebellion quickly brought Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s wrath and he invaded Judah, blockading Jerusalem and reducing the fortified cities of Judah one by one. According to Jer 39:1 the siege began in Zedekiah&#8217;s ninth year (589/88 <sc>b.c.) and lasted until his eleventh year when Jerusalem fell (587/86 <sc>b.c.). The army of Pharaoh likely came sometime during 588 <sc>b.c.</p>
