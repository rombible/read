<A NAME="5156"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=2851><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I am against you, oh destroying mountain that destroys all the earth. I will reach out my hand against you and roll you down from the cliffs and make you a mountain of burning.&#8221; The interpretation adopted here follows the lines suggested by S. R. Driver, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 318, n. c and reflected also in BDB 977 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1508;&#1464;&#1492;</font>. Babylon is addressed as a destructive mountain because it is being compared to a volcano. The <sc>Lord, however, will make it a &#8220;burned-out mountain,&#8221; i.e., an extinct volcano which is barren and desolate. This interpretation seems to this translator to fit the details of the text more consistently than alternative ones which separate the concept of &#8220;destroying/destructive&#8221; from &#8220;mountain&#8221; and explain the figure of the mountain to refer to the dominating political position of Babylon and the reference to a &#8220;mountain of burning&#8221; to be a &#8220;burned [or burned over] mountain.&#8221; The use of similes in place of metaphors makes it easier for the modern reader to understand the figures and also more easily incorporates the dissonant figure of &#8220;rolling you down from the cliffs&#8221; which involves the figure of personification.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The figure here involves comparing Babylon to a destructive volcano which the <sc>Lord makes burned-out, i.e., he will destroy her power to destroy. The figure of personification is also involved because the <sc>Lord is said to roll her off the cliffs; that would not be applicable to a mountain.</p>
