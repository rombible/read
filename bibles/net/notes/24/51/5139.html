<A NAME="5139"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2834><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;You who live upon [or beside] many waters, rich in treasures, your end has come, the cubit of your cutting off.&#8221; The sentence has been restructured and paraphrased to provide clarity for the average reader. The meaning of the last phrase is debated. For a discussion of the two options see W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah </i>(Hermeneia), 2:423. Most modern commentaries and English versions see an allusion to the figure in Isa 38:12 where the reference is to the end of life compared to a tapestry which is suddenly cut off from the loom. Hence, NRSV renders the last line as &#8220;the thread of your life is cut&#8221; and TEV renders &#8220;its thread of life is cut.&#8221; That idea is accepted also in <i>HALOT</i> 141 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1510;&#1506;</font> Qal.1. </p>
