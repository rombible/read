<A NAME="5125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2820><b>tn</b> This is an admittedly very paraphrastic translation that tries to make the figurative nuance of the Hebrew original understandable for the average reader. The Hebrew text reads: &#8220;For her judgment [or punishment (cf. BDB 1078 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1496;</font> 1.f) = &#8216;execution of judgment&#8217;] touches the heavens, and is lifted up as far as the clouds.&#8221; The figure of hyperbole or exaggeration is being used here to indicate the vastness of Babylon&#8217;s punishment which is the reason to escape (vv. 6, 9c). For this figure see Deut 1:28 in comparison with Num 13:28 and see also Deut 9:1. In both of the passages in Deut it refers to an exaggeration about the height of the walls of fortified cities. The figure also may be a play on Gen 11:4 where the nations gather in Babylon to build a tower that reaches to the skies. The present translation has interpreted the perfects here as prophetic because it has not happened yet or they would not be encouraging one another to leave and escape. For the idea here compare 50:16.</p>
