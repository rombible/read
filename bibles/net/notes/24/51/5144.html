<A NAME="5144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=2839><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;For he is the former of all [things] and the tribe of his inheritance.&#8221; This is the major exception to the verbatim repetition of 10:12-16 in 51:15-19. The word &#8220;Israel&#8221; appears before &#8220;the tribe of his inheritance&#8221; in 10:16. It is also found in a number of Hebrew <sc>mss, in the Lucianic recension of the LXX (the Greek version), the Aramaic Targums, and the Latin Vulgate. Most English versions and many commentaries assume it here. However, it is easier to explain why the word is added in a few of the versions and some Hebrew than to explain why it was left out. It is probable that the word is not original here because the addressees are different and the function of this hymnic piece is slightly different (see the study note on the next line for details). Here it makes good sense to understand that the <sc>Lord is being called the creator of the special tribe of people he claims as his own property (see the study note on the first line of 10:16).</p>
