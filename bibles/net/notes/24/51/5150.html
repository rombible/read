<A NAME="5150"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=2845><b>tn</b> These two words are Akkadian loan words into Hebrew which often occur in this pairing (cf. Ezek 23:6, 12, 23; Jer 51:23, 28, 57). BDB 688 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1490;&#1464;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sagan</font>) gives &#8220;prefect, ruler&#8221; as the basic definition for the second term but neither works very well in a modern translation because &#8220;prefect&#8221; would be unknown to most readers and &#8220;ruler&#8221; would suggest someone along the lines of a king, which these officials were not. The present translation has chosen &#8220;leaders&#8221; by default, assuming there is no other term that would be any more appropriate in light of the defects noted in &#8220;prefect&#8221; and &#8220;ruler.&#8221;</p>
