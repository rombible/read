<A NAME="5161"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=2856><b>tn</b> The translation of this line is uncertain because it includes a word which only occurs here and in Nah 3:17 where it is found in parallelism with a word that is only used once and whose meaning in turn is uncertain. It is probably related to the Akkadian word <font face="Scholar">tupsharru</font><i> </i>which refers to a scribe (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;a tablet writer&#8221;). The exact function of this official is disputed. KBL 356 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1505;&#1464;&#1512;</font> relates it to a &#8220;recruiting officer,&#8221; a sense which is reflected in NAB. The majority of modern English versions render &#8220;commander&#8221; or &#8220;marshal&#8221; following the suggestion of BDB 381 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1505;&#1464;&#1512;</font>. G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, T. G. Smothers (<i>Jeremiah 26-52 </i>[WBC],<i> </i>351) translate &#8220;recruiter (scribe)&#8221; but explain the function on p. 371 as that of recording the plunder captured in war. The rendering here follows that of TEV and God&#8217;s Word and is the nuance suggested by the majority of modern English versions who rendered &#8220;appoint a marshal/commander against it.&#8221;</p>
