<A NAME="515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2800><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;They will strip her land bare like a wind blowing away chaff.&#8221; The alternate translation would be necessary if one were to adopt the alternate reading of the first line (the reading of the Hebrew text). The explanation of &#8220;winnow&#8221; would then be necessary in the second line. The verb translated &#8220;strip&#8230;bare&#8221; means literally &#8220;to empty out&#8221; (see BDB 132 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1511;</font> Polel). It has been used in 19:7 in the Qal of &#8220;making void&#8221; Judah&#8217;s plans in a wordplay on the word for &#8220;bottle.&#8221; See the study note on 19:7 for further details.</p>
