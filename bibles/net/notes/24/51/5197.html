That may be the case here, the turmoil outlined in v. 46 serving as the catalyst for the culminating divine judgment described in v. 47. Another possibility is that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1461;&#1503;</font> here has an asseverative force (&#8220;certainly&#8221;), as in Isa 26:14 and perhaps Jer 5:2 (see the note there).
