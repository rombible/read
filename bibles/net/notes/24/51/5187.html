<A NAME="5187"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">87</span><note=2882><b>sn</b> The central figure here is the figure of the cup of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s wrath (cf. 25:15-29, especially v. 26). Here the Babylonians have been made to drink so deeply of it that they fall into a drunken sleep from which they will never wake up (i.e., they die, death being compared to sleep [cf. Ps 13:3 (13:4 HT); 76:5 (76:6 HT); 90:5]). Compare the usage in Jer 51:57 for this same figure.</p>
