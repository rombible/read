<A NAME="5146"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=2841><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Media.&#8221; The referent is not identified in the text; the text merely says &#8220;you are my war club.&#8221; Commentators in general identify the referent as Babylon because Babylon has been referred to as a hammer in 50:23 and Babylon is referred to in v. 25 as a &#8220;destroying mountain&#8221; (compare v. 20d). However, S. R. Driver, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 317, n. c maintains that v. 24 speaks against this. It does seem a little inconsistent to render the <i>vav</i> consecutive perfect at the beginning of v. 24 as future while rendering those in vv. 20b-23 as customary past. However, change in person from second masculine singular (vv. 20b-23) to the second masculine plural in &#8220;before your very eyes&#8221; and its position at the end of the verse after &#8220;which they did in Zion&#8221; argue that a change in address occurs there. Driver has to ignore the change in person and take &#8220;before your eyes&#8221; with the verb &#8220;repay&#8221; at the beginning to maintain the kind of consistency he seeks. The <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive imperfect can be used for either the customary past (GKC 335-36 §112.<i>dd</i> with cross reference back to GKC 331-32 §112.<i>e</i>) or the future (GKC 334 §112.<i>x</i>). Hence the present translation has followed the majority of commentaries (and English versions like TEV, NCV, CEV, NIrV) in understanding the referent as Babylon and v. 24 being a transition to vv. 25-26 (cf., e.g., J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah </i>[AB], 356-57, and J. A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah </i>[NICOT], 756-57). If the referent is understood as Media then the verbs in vv. 20-23 should all be translated as futures. See also the translator&#8217;s note on v. 24.</p>
