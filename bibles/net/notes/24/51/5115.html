<A NAME="5115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2810><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;all, though their land was&#8230;&#8221; The majority of the modern English versions understand the land here to refer to the land of Israel and Judah (the text reads &#8220;their land&#8221; and Israel and Judah are the nearest antecedents). In this case the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) is concessive (cf. BDB 473 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 2.c[b]). Many of the modern commentaries understand the referent to be the land of the Chaldeans/Babylonians. However, most of them feel that the line is connected as a causal statement to 51:2-4 and see the line as either textually or logically out of place. However, it need not be viewed as logically out of place. It is parallel to the preceding and gives a second reason why they are to be destroyed. It also forms an excellent transition to the next lines where the exiles and other foreigners are urged to flee and not get caught up in the destruction which is coming &#8220;because of her sin.&#8221; It might be helpful to note that both the adjective &#8220;widowed&#8221; and the suffix on &#8220;their God&#8221; are masculine singular, looking at Israel and Judah as one entity. The &#8220;their&#8221; then goes back not to Israel and Judah of the preceding lines but to the &#8220;them&#8221; in v. 4. This makes for a better connection with the following and understands the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> in its dominant usage not an extremely rare one (see the comment in BDB 473 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 2.c[b]). This interpretation is also reflected in RSV.</p>
