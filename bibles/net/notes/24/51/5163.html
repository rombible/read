<A NAME="5163"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=2858><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Bring up horses like bristly locusts.&#8221; The meaning of the Hebrew word &#8220;bristly&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">samar</font>) is uncertain because the word only occurs here. It is generally related to a verb meaning &#8220;to bristle&#8221; which occurs in Job 4:15 and Ps 119:120. Exactly what is meant by &#8220;bristly&#8221; in connection with &#8220;locust&#8221; is uncertain, though most relate it to a stage of the locust in which its wings are still encased in a rough, horny casing. J. A. Thompson (<i>Jeremiah </i>[NICOT], 759) adds that this is when the locust is very destructive. However, no other commentary mentions this. Therefore the present translation omits the word because it is of uncertain meaning and significance. For a fuller discussion of the way the word has been rendered see W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah </i>(Hermeneia), 2:427.</p>
