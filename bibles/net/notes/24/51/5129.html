<A NAME="5129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2824><b>tn</b> The meaning of this word is debated. The most thorough discussion of this word including etymology and usage in the OT and Qumran is in <i>HALOT</i> 1409-10 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1496;</font>, where the rendering &#8220;quiver&#8221; is accepted for all the uses of this word in the OT. For a more readily accessible discussion for English readers see W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah </i>(Hermeneia), 2:422-23. The meaning &#8220;quiver&#8221; fits better with the verb &#8220;fill&#8221; than the meaning &#8220;shield&#8221; which is adopted in BDB 1020 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1496;</font>. &#8220;Quiver&#8221; is the meaning adopted also in NRSV, REB, NAB, and NJPS.</p>
