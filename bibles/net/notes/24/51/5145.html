<A NAME="5145"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=2840><b>sn</b> With the major exception discussed in the translator&#8217;s note on the preceding line vv. 15-19 are a verbatim repetition of 10:12-16 with a few minor variations in spelling. There the passage was at the end of a section in which the <sc>Lord was addressing the Judeans and trying to convince them that the worship of idols was vain &#8211; the idols were impotent but he is all powerful. Here the passage follows a solemn oath by the <sc>Lord who rules over all and is apparently directed to the Babylonians, emphasizing the power of the <sc>Lord to carry out his oath.</p>
