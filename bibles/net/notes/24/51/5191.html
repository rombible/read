How Babylon has become an object of horror among the nations!&#8221; For the usage of &#8220;How&#8221; here see the translator&#8217;s note on 50:23.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This is part of a taunt song (see Isa 14:4) and assumes prophetically that the city has already been captured. The verbs in vv. 41-43a are all in the Hebrew tense that the prophets often use to look at the future as &#8220;a done deal&#8221; (the so-called prophetic perfect). In v. 44 which is still a part of this picture the verbs are in the future. The Hebrew tense has been retained here and in vv. 42-43 but it should be remembered that the standpoint is prophetic and future.</p>
