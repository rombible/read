<A NAME="513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2798><b>sn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the people who live in Leb-qamai.&#8221; &#8220;Leb-qamai&#8221; is a code name for &#8220;Chaldeans&#8221; formed on the principle of substituting the last letter of the alphabet for the first, the next to the last for the second, and so on. This same principle is used in referring to Babylon in 25:26 and 51:41 as &#8220;Sheshach.&#8221; See the study note on 25:26 where further details are given. There is no consensus on why the code name is used because the terms Babylon and Chaldeans (= Babylonians) have appeared regularly in this prophecy or collection of prophecies.</p>
