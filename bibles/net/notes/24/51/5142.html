<A NAME="5142"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=2837><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will fill you with men like locusts.&#8221; The &#8220;you&#8221; refers to Babylon (Babylon is both the city and the land it ruled, Babylonia) which has been alluded to in the preceding verses under descriptive titles. The words &#8220;your land&#8221; have been used because of the way the preceding verse has been rendered, alluding to people rather than to the land or city. The allusion of &#8220;men&#8221; is, of course, to enemy soldiers and they are here compared to locusts both for their quantity and their destructiveness (see Joel 1:4). For the use of the particles <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497; &#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>) to introduce an oath see BDB 475 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497; &#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> 2.c and compare usage in 2 Kgs 5:20; one would normally expect <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501; &#1500;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (cf.
