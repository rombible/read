<A NAME="5151"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=2846><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Media, you are my war club&#8230;I will use you to smash&#8230;leaders. So before your very eyes I will repay&#8230;for all the wicked things they did in Zion.&#8221; For explanation see the translator&#8217;s note on v. 20. The position of the phrase &#8220;before your eyes&#8221; at the end of the verse after &#8220;which they did in Zion&#8221; and the change in person from second masculine singular in vv. 20b-23 (&#8220;I used you to smite&#8221;) to second masculine plural in &#8220;before your eyes&#8221; argue that a change in referent/addressee occurs in this verse. To maintain that the referent in vv. 20-23 is Media/Cyrus requires that this position and change in person be ignored; &#8220;before your eyes&#8221; then is attached to &#8220;I will repay.&#8221; The present translation follows J. A. Thompson (<i>Jeremiah </i>[NICOT], 757) and F. B. Huey (<i>Jeremiah, Lamentations </i>[NAC], 423) in seeing the referent as the Judeans who had witnessed the destruction of Zion/Jerusalem. The word &#8220;Judean&#8221; has been supplied for the sake of identifying the referent for the modern reader.</p>
