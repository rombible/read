Her bars [i.e., the bars on the gates of her cities] have been broken.&#8221; The present translation has substituted the word &#8220;gates&#8221; for &#8220;bars&#8221; because the intent of the figure is to show that the bars of the gates have been broken giving access to the city. &#8220;Gates&#8221; makes it easier for the modern reader to understand the figure.</p>
