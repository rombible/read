<A NAME="5127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2822><b>tn</b> There is some difference of opinion as to the best way to render the Hebrew expression here. Literally it means &#8220;brought forth our righteousnesses.&#8221; BDB 842 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1492;</font> 7.b interprets this of the &#8220;righteous acts&#8221; of the people of Judah and compares the usage in Isa 64:6; Ezek 3:20; 18:24; 33:13. However, Judah&#8217;s acts of righteousness (or more simply, their righteousness) was scarcely revealed in their deliverance. Most of the English versions and commentaries refer to &#8220;vindication&#8221; i.e., that the <sc>Lord has exonerated or proven Israel&#8217;s claims to be true. However, that would require more explanation than the idea of &#8220;deliverance&#8221; which is a perfectly legitimate usage of the term (cf. BDB 842 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1492;</font> 6.a and compare the usage in Isa 46:13; 51:6, 8; 56:1). The present translation interprets the plural form here as a plural of intensity or amplification (GKC 397-98 §124.<i>e</i>) and the suffix as a genitive of advantage (<i>IBHS</i> 147 §9.5.2e). This interpretation is also reflected in REB and God&#8217;s Word.</p>
