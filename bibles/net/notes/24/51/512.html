<A NAME="512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2797><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I will arouse the spirit of hostility of a destroying nation&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will stir up against Babylon&#8230;a destroying wind [or the spirit of a destroyer].&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ruakh</font>) can refer to either a wind (BDB 924 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> 2.a) or a spirit (BDB 925 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> 2.g). It can be construed as either a noun followed by an adjectival participle (so, &#8220;a destroying wind&#8221;) or a noun followed by another noun in the &#8220;of&#8221; relationship (a construct or genitival relationship; so, &#8220;spirit of a destroyer&#8221;). The same noun with this same verb is translated &#8220;stir up the spirit of&#8221; in 1 Chr 5:26; 2 Chr 21:16; 36:22; Hag 1:14; and most importantly in Jer 51:11 where it refers to the king of the Medes. However, the majority of the exegetical tradition (all the commentaries consulted and all the English versions except NASB and NIV) opt for the &#8220;destructive wind&#8221; primarily because of the figure of winnowing that is found in the next verse. The translation follows the main line exegetical tradition here for that same reason.</p>
