<A NAME="5178"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=2873><b>tn</b> This verse is extremely difficult to translate because of the shifting imagery, the confusion over the meaning of one of the verbs, and the apparent inconsistency of the pronominal suffixes here with those in the following verse which everyone agrees is connected with it. The pronominal suffixes are first common plural but the versions all read them as first common singular which the Masoretes also do in the <i>Qere</i>. That reading has been followed here for consistency with the next verse which identifies the speaker as the person living in Zion and the personified city of Jerusalem. The Hebrew text reads: &#8220;Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon devoured me [cf. 50:7, 17] and threw me into confusion. He set me down an empty dish. He swallowed me like a monster from the deep [cf. BDB 1072 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> 3 and compare usage in Isa 27:1; Ezek 29:3; 32:2]. He filled his belly with my dainties. He rinsed me out [cf. BDB s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;</font> Hiph.2 and compare the usage in Isa 4:4].&#8221; The verb &#8220;throw into confusion&#8221; has proved troublesome because its normal meaning does not seem appropriate. Hence various proposals have been made to understand it in a different sense. The present translation has followed W. L. Holladay (<i>Jeremiah </i>[Hermeneia], 2:428) in understanding the verb to mean &#8220;disperse&#8221; or &#8220;route&#8221; (see NAB). The last line has seemed out of place and has often been emended to read &#8220;he has spewed me out&#8221; (so NIV, NRSV, a reading that presupposes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> [<font face="Scholar">hiddikhani</font>] for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1457;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> [<font face="Scholar">hedikhani</font>]). The reading of the MT is not inappropriate if it is combined with the imagery of an empty jar and hence is retained here (see F. B. Huey, <i>Jeremiah, Lamentations </i>[NAC], 425, n. 59; H. Freedman, <i>Jeremiah</i> [SoBB], 344; NJPS). The lines have been combined to keep the imagery together.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The speaker in this verse and the next is the personified city of Jerusalem. She laments her fate at the hands of the king of Babylon and calls down a curse on Babylon and the people who live in Babylonia. Here Nebuchadnezzar is depicted as a monster of the deep who has devoured Jerusalem, swallowed her down, and filled its belly with her riches, leaving her an empty dish, which has been rinsed clean.</p>
