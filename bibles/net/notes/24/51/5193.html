<A NAME="5193"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">93</span><note=2888><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The sea has risen up over Babylon. She has been covered by the multitude of its waves.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This is a poetic and figurative reference to the enemies of Babylon, the foe from the north (see 50:3, 9, 51:27-28), which has attacked Babylon in wave after wave. This same figure is used in Isa 17:12. In Isa 8:7-8 the king of Assyria (and his troops) are compared to the Euphrates which rises up and floods over the whole land of Israel and Judah. This same figure, but with application to Babylon, is assumed in Jer 47:2-3. In Jer 46:7-8 the same figure is employed in a taunt of Egypt which had boasted that it would cover the earth like the flooding of the Nile.</p>
