<A NAME="5159"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=2854><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Raise up a standard on the earth. Blow a ram&#8217;s horn among the nations. Consecrate nations against her.&#8221; According to BDB 651 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1461;&#1505;</font> 1, the raising of a standard was a signal of a war &#8211; a summons to assemble and attack (see usage in Isa 5:26; 13:2; Jer 51:12). The &#8220;blowing of the ram&#8217;s horn&#8221; was also a signal to rally behind a leader and join in an attack (see Judg 3:27; 6:34). For the meaning of &#8220;consecrate nations against her&#8221; see the study note on 6:4. The usage of this phrase goes back to the concept of holy war where soldiers had to be consecrated for battle by the offering of a sacrifice. The phrase has probably lost its ritual usage in later times and become idiomatic for making necessary preparations for war.</p>
