<A NAME="5166"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=2861><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text has a confusing switch of possessive pronouns in this verse: &#8220;Consecrate the nations against her, the kings of the Medes, her governors and prefects, and all the land of his dominion.&#8221; This has led to a number of different resolutions. The LXX (the Greek version) renders the word &#8220;kings&#8221; as singular and levels all the pronouns to &#8220;his,&#8221; paraphrasing the final clause and combining it with &#8220;king of the Medes&#8221; to read &#8220;and of all the earth.&#8221; The Latin Vulgate levels them all to the third masculine plural, and this is followed by the present translation as well as a number of other modern English versions (NASB, NIV, NRSV, TEV, NCV). The ASV and NJPS understand the feminine to refer to Media, i.e., &#8220;her governors and all her prefects&#8221; and understand the masculine in the last line to be a distributive singular referring back to the lands each of the governors and prefects ruled over. This is probably correct but since governors and prefects refer to officials appointed over provinces and vassal states it amounts to much the same interpretation that the Latin Vulgate, the present translation, and other modern English versions have given.</p>
