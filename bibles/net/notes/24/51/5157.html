<A NAME="5157"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=2852><b>tn</b> This is a fairly literal translation of the original which reads &#8220;No one will take from you a stone for a cornerstone nor a stone for foundations.&#8221; There is no unanimity of opinion in the commentaries, many feeling that the figure of the burned mountain continues and others feeling that the figure here shifts to a burned city whose stones are so burned that they are useless to be used in building. The latter is the interpretation adopted here (see, e.g., F. B. Huey, <i>Jeremiah, Lamentations </i>[NAC], 423; W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah </i>[Hermeneia], 2:426; NCV).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The figure here shifts to that of a burned-up city whose stones cannot be used for building. Babylon will become a permanent heap of ruins.</p>
