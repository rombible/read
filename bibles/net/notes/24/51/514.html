<A NAME="514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2799><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I will send foreign people against Babylonia.&#8221; The translation follows the reading of the Greek recensions of Aquila and Symmachus and the Latin version (the Vulgate). That reading is accepted by the majority of modern commentaries and several of the modern versions (e.g., NRSV, REB, NAB, and God&#8217;s Word). It fits better with the verb that follows it than the reading of the Hebrew text and the rest of the versions. The difference in the two readings is again only the difference in vocalization, the Hebrew text reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<i>zarim</i>) and the versions cited reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1465;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<i>zorim</i>). If the Hebrew text is followed, there is a wordplay between the two words, &#8220;foreigners&#8221; and &#8220;winnow.&#8221; The words &#8220;like a wind blowing away chaff&#8221; have been supplied in the translation to clarify for the reader what &#8220;winnow&#8221; means.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Winnowing involved throwing a mixture of grain and chaff (or straw) into the air and letting the wind blow away the lighter chaff, leaving the grain to fall on the ground. Since God considered all the Babylonians chaff, they would all be &#8220;blown away.&#8221;</p>
