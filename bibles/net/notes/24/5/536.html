<A NAME="536"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=295><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;for they do not belong to the <sc>Lord.&#8221; In the light of the context and Jeremiah&#8217;s identification of Israel as a vine (cf., e.g., 2:21) and a vineyard (cf., e.g., 12:10), it is likely that this verse has a totally metaphorical significance. The enemy is to go through the vineyard that is Israel and Judah and destroy all those who have been unfaithful to the <sc>Lord. It is not impossible, however, that the verse has a double meaning, a literal one and a figurative one: the enemy is not only to destroy Israel and Judah&#8217;s vines but to destroy Israel and Judah, lopping off the wicked Israelites who, because of their covenant unfaithfulness, the <sc>Lord has disowned. If the verse is totally metaphorical one might translate: &#8220;Pass through my vineyard, Israel and Judah, wreaking destruction. But do not destroy all of the people. Cut down like branches those unfaithful people because they no longer belong to the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
