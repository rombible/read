<A NAME="581"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">81</span><note=340><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;they shall rule at their hands.&#8221; Since the word &#8220;hand&#8221; can be used figuratively for authority or mean &#8220;side&#8221; and the pronoun &#8220;them&#8221; can refer to the priests themselves or the prophets, the following translations have also been suggested: &#8220;the priests rule under their [the prophets&#8217;] directions,&#8221; or &#8220;the priests rule in league with them [the prophets].&#8221; From the rest of the book it would appear that the prophets did not exercise authority over the priests nor did they exercise the same authority over the people that the priests did. Hence it probably mean &#8220;by their own hand/power/authority.&#8221;</p>
