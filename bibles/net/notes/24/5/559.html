<A NAME="559"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=318><b>tn</b> The MT reads the second masculine plural; this is probably a case of attraction to the second masculine plural pronoun in the preceding line. An alternative would be to understand a shift from speaking first to the people in the first half of the verse and then speaking to Jeremiah in the second half where the verb is second masculine singular. E.g., &#8220;When you [people] say, &#8220;Why&#8230;?&#8221; then you, Jeremiah, tell them&#8230;&#8221;</p>
