<A NAME="528"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=287><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they committed adultery.&#8221; It is difficult to decide whether literal adultery with other women or spiritual adultery with other gods is meant. The word for adultery is used for both in the book of Jeremiah. For examples of its use for spiritual adultery see 3:8, 9; 9:2. For examples of its use for literal adultery see 7:9; 23:14. The context here could argue for either. The swearing by other gods and the implicit contradiction in their actions in contrast to the expected gratitude for supplying their needs argues for spiritual adultery. However, the reference to prostitution in the next line and the reference to chasing after their neighbor&#8217;s wives argues for literal adultery. The translation opts for spiritual adultery because of the contrast implicit in the concessive clause.</p>
