<A NAME="561"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=320><b>sn</b> This is probably a case of deliberate ambiguity (double entendre). The adjective &#8220;foreigners&#8221; is used for both foreign people (so Jer 30:8; 51:51) and foreign gods (so Jer 2:25; 3:13). See also Jer 16:13 for the idea of having to serve other gods in the lands of exile.</p>
