<A NAME="4024"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2292><b>tn</b> This plus &#8220;Things will go well with you&#8221; is in essence the substance of the oath. The pronouns are emphatic, &#8220;And I, behold I will stay&#8230;and you, you may gather.&#8221; The imperatives in the second half of the verse are more a form of permission than of command or advice (cf. NJPS, REB, TEV and compare the usage in 40:4 and the references in the translator&#8217;s note there).</p>
