<A NAME="402"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2270><b>sn</b> Some commentators see the account of Jeremiah&#8217;s release here in 40:1-6 as an alternate and contradictory account to that of Jeremiah&#8217;s release in 39:11-14. However, most commentators see them as complementary and sequential. Jeremiah had been released from the courtyard of the guardhouse on orders of the military tribunal there shortly after Nebuzaradan got to Jerusalem and passed on Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s orders to them. He had been released to the custody of Gedaliah who was to take him back to the governor&#8217;s residence and look after him there. However, Jeremiah remained in Jerusalem among the people there. He was mistakenly rounded up with them and led off as a prisoner to be deported with the rest of the exiles. However, when he got to Ramah which was a staging area for deportees, Nebuzaradan recognized him among the prisoners and released him a second time.</p>
