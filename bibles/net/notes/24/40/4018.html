<A NAME="4018"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2286><b>tn</b> Verse 6 consists of a very long conditional clause whose main clause is found in v. 7. The text reads literally &#8220;When all the officers of the forces who were in the countryside heard, they and their men, that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah&#8230;over the land and that he had committed to him men, women, and children, even from the poorest of the land from those who had not been carried off into exile to Babylon, they came.&#8221; The sentence has been broken up to better conform with contemporary English style. The phrase &#8220;the forces who were in the countryside&#8221; has been translated to reflect the probable situation, i.e., they had escaped and were hiding in the hills surrounding Jerusalem waiting for the Babylonians to leave (cf. Judg 6:2).</p>
