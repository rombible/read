<A NAME="263"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1504><b>tn</b> It is often thought that the term here is equivalent to a technical term in Akkadian (<font face="Scholar">reshsharruti</font>) which refers to the part of the year remaining from the death or deposing of the previous king until the beginning of the calendar year when the new king officially ascended the throne. In this case it would refer to the part of the year between September, 609 <sc>b.c. when Jehoiakim was placed on the throne as a puppet king by Pharaoh Necho (2 Kgs 23:34-35) and April, 608 <sc>b.c. when he would have been officially celebrated as king. However, it will be suggested below in conjunction with the textual problems in 27:1 and 28:1 that the term does not necessarily refer to this period.</p>
