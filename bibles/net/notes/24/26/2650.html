<A NAME="2650"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1551><b>sn</b> The <i>burial place of the common people</i> was the public burial grounds, distinct from the family tombs, where poor people without any distinction were buried. It was in the Kidron Valley east of Jerusalem (2 Kgs 23:6). The intent of reporting this is to show the ruthlessness of Jehoiakim.</p>
