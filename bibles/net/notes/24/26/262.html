<A NAME="262"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1503><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;to Jeremiah&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text. They are added by the Old Latin (not the Vulgate) and the Syriac versions. They are implicit, however, to the narrative style which speaks of Jeremiah in the third person (cf. vv. 7, 12). They have been supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
