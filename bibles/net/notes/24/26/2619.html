<A NAME="2619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1520><b>tn</b> The translation follows many Hebrew <sc>mss and ancient versions in reading the word &#8220;house&#8221; (= temple) here. The majority of Hebrew <sc>mss do not have this word. It is, however, implicit in the construction &#8220;the New Gate of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The location of the <i>New Gate</i> is uncertain. It is mentioned again in Jer 36:10 where it is connected with the upper (i.e., inner) court of the temple. Some equate it with the Upper Gate that Jotham rebuilt during his reign (2 Kgs 15:35; Jotham reigned from 750-735 <sc>b.c.). That gate, however, has already been referred to as the Upper Gate of Benjamin in Jer 20:2 (for more detail see the study note there) and would not likely have been called something different here.</p>
