<A NAME="2613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1514><b>tn</b> The translation again represents an attempt to break up a long complex Hebrew sentence into equivalent English ones that conform more to contemporary English style: <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And as soon as Jeremiah finished saying all that&#8230;the priests&#8230;grabbed him and said&#8230;&#8221; The word &#8220;some&#8221; has been supplied in the translation, because obviously it was not all the priests, the prophets, and all the people, but only some of them. There is, of course, rhetorical intent here to show that all were implicated, although all may not have actually participated. (This is a common figure called synecdoche where all is put for a part &#8211; all for all kinds or representatives of all kinds. See E. W. Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, 614-19, and compare usage in Acts 10:12; Matt 3:5.)</p>
