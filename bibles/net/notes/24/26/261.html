<A NAME="261"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1502><b>sn</b> Beginning with Jer 26 up to Jer 45 the book narrates in third person style incidents in the life of Jeremiah and prophecies (or sermons) he gave in obedience to the <sc>Lord&#8217;s commands. Baruch is the probable narrator, passing on information gleaned from Jeremiah himself. (See Jer 36:4, 18, 32; 45:1 and also 32:13-14 where it is clear that Baruch is Jeremiah&#8217;s scribe or secretary.) Chapters 26-29 contain narratives concerning reactions to Jeremiah&#8217;s prophecies and his conflict with the prophets who were prophesying that things would be all right (see, e.g., 14:14-15; 23:21).</p>
