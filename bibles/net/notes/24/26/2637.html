<A NAME="2637"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1538><b>sn</b> There is irony involved in this statement. The text reads literally &#8220;high places of a forest/thicket.&#8221; The &#8220;high places&#8221; were the illicit places of worship that Jerusalem was supposed to replace. Because of their sin, Jerusalem would be like one of the pagan places of worship with no place left sacrosanct. It would even be overgrown with trees and bushes. So much for its inviolability!</p>
