<A NAME="2635"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1536><b>sn</b> <i>Zion</i> was first of all the citadel that David captured (2 Sam 5:6-10), then the city of David and the enclosed temple area, then the whole city of Jerusalem. It is often in poetic parallelism with Jerusalem as it is here (see, e.g., Ps 76:2; Amos 1:2).</p>
