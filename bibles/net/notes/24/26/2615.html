<A NAME="2615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1516><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Why have you prophesied in the <sc>Lord&#8217;s name, saying, &#8216;This house will become like Shiloh and this city will become a ruin without inhabitant?&#8217;&#8221; It is clear from the context here and in 7:1-15 that the emphasis is on &#8220;in the <sc>Lord&#8217;s name&#8221; and that the question is rhetorical. The question is not a quest for information but an accusation, a remonstrance. (For this figure see E. W. Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, 953-54, who calls a question like this a rhetorical question of remonstrance or expostulation. For good examples see Pss 11:1; 50:16.) For the significance of &#8220;prophesying in the <sc>Lord&#8217;s name&#8221; see the study note on 14:14. The translation again utilizes the indirect quote to eliminate one level of embedded quotation.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> They are questioning his right to claim the <sc>Lord&#8217;s authority for what they see as a false prophecy. They believed that the presence of the <sc>Lord in the temple guaranteed their safety (7:4, 10, 14) and that the <sc>Lord could not possibly be threatening its destruction. Hence they were ready to put him to death as a false prophet according to the law of Moses (Deut 18:20).</p>
