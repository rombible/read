<A NAME="2651"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1552><b>sn</b> <i>Ahikam son of Shaphan</i> was an official during the reign of Jehoiakim&#8217;s father, Josiah (2 Kgs 22:12, 14). He was also the father of Gedaliah who became governor of Judah after the fall of Jerusalem (Jer 40:5). The particle at the beginning of the verse is meant to contrast the actions of this man with the actions of Jehoiakim. The impression created by this verse is that it took more than just the royal officials&#8217; opinion and the elders&#8217; warnings to keep the priests and prophets from swaying popular opinion to put Jeremiah to death.</p>
