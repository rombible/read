<A NAME="271"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1554><b>sn</b> The names of Jeremiah and of Nebuchadnezzar are spelled differently in the Hebrew of chapter 27-29. That and other literary features show that these three chapters are all closely related. The events of these three chapters all take place within the space of one year (cf. 28:1; 29:17).</p>
<A NAME="272"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1555><b>tc</b> The reading here is based on a few Hebrew <sc>mss and the Syriac and Arabic versions. The majority of Hebrew <sc>mss and most of the versions read &#8220;At the beginning of the reign of Josiah&#8217;s son, Jehoiakim king of Judah&#8221; as in 26:1. The LXX does not have this whole verse. It has long been recognized that the text of 27:1 is textually corrupt. The date formula in the majority of Hebrew <sc>mss at 27:1 is contradictory both with the context of the passage which deals with an event in the reign of Zedekiah (see vv. 3, 13 and v. 20 which presupposes that Jeconiah, Jehoiakim&#8217;s son, has been taken captive [i.e., after the death of Jehoiakim!]) and the date formula in 28:1 which refers to an event &#8220;in that same year&#8221; and then qualifies it with &#8220;Early in the reign of Zedekiah.&#8221; Hence it is preferable to read &#8220;Zedekiah&#8221; here in place of &#8220;Jehoiakim&#8221; and explain the error in the Hebrew manuscripts as an erroneous copying of 26:1.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> If the text of 28:1 is correct, the date here would be sometime in the fourth year of Zedekiah which would be 594/3 <sc>b.c. Zedekiah had been placed on the throne as a puppet king by Nebuchadnezzar after he deposed Zedekiah&#8217;s nephew, Jeconiah (Jehoiachin) and sent him, his family, some of the temple treasures, and some of the Judean leaders away to Babylon (2 Kgs 23:8-17). The author does not state directly why the envoys from the nations mentioned in v. 3 were in Jerusalem, but the implication is that they were there trying to interest Zedekiah in rebelling. Modern scholars have used the data here and in 28:1 and in the Babylonian Chronicles (it contains a record of major events of Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s reign) to suggest a plausible background for such a meeting. Nebuchadnezzar had to put down an uprising in the east and quell a rebellion in Babylon itself in the two years prior to this meeting. Some &#8220;prophets&#8221; in the nation of Israel and in these other nations (see vv. 9-10) saw in these events hopes for not having to pay tribute to (i.e., submit to the yoke of) Nebuchadnezzar and were counseling rebellion. Jeremiah saw this as foolhardy and counseled otherwise. Again, there is a conflict between &#8220;prophets&#8221; which is what this whole section (Jer 27&#8211;29) is all about.</p>
<A NAME="273"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1556><b>tn</b> There is some disjunction in the narrative of this chapter. The introduction in v. 1 presents this as a third person narrative. But the rest of the passage reports the narrative in first person. Thus the text reads here &#8220;Thus the <sc>Lord said to me&#8230;&#8221; In vv. 12, 16 the narrative picks up in first person report and never indicates that Jeremiah carried out the command in vv. 2-4 that introduces the message which he repeats in summary form himself to Zedekiah. The report is thus an &#8220;unedited&#8221; first person report. This may create some confusion for some readers, but it is best to leave it in first person here because of the continuation in vv. 12, 16.</p>
<A NAME="274"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1557><b>sn</b> The <i>yoke</i> is a common biblical symbol of political servitude (see, e.g., Deut 28:48; 1 Kgs 12:4, 9, 10). From the context of 1 Kgs 12 it is clear that it applied to taxation and the provision of conscript labor. In international political contexts it involved the payment of heavy tribute which was often conscripted from the citizens (see, e.g., 2 Kgs 15:19-20; 23:34-35) and the furnishing of military contingents for the sovereign&#8217;s armies (see, e.g., 2 Kgs 24:2). Jeremiah&#8217;s message here combines both a symbolic action (the wearing of a yoke) and words of explanation as in Jer 19:1-13. (See Isa 20:1-6 for an example outside of Jeremiah.) The casting off of the yoke has been used earlier in Jer 2:20, 5:5 to refer to Israel&#8217;s failure to remain spiritually &#8220;subject&#8221; or faithful to God.</p>

<A NAME="276"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1559><b>sn</b> The nations of <i>Edom</i>, <i>Moab</i>, and<i> Ammon</i> were east of Judah. They were sometimes allies and sometimes enemies. The nations of <i>Tyre </i>and<i> Sidon</i> were on the sea coast north and west of Judah. They are best known for their maritime trade during the reign of Solomon. They were more commonly allies of Israel and Judah than enemies.</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For the location of Sidon see Map1-A1; JP3-F3; JP4-F3.</p>
<A NAME="277"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1560><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;send by means of them&#8221; [i.e., the straps and crossbars made into a yoke] to&#8230;through.&#8221; The text is broken up in conformity with contemporary English style. Many English versions ignore the suffix on the end of &#8220;send&#8221; and find some support for this on the basis of its absence in the Lucianic Greek text. However, it is probably functioning metonymically here for the message which they see symbolized before them and is now explained clearly to them.</p>

<A NAME="2712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1565><b>sn</b> See Dan 4:17 for a similar statement.</p>

<A NAME="2714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1567><b>sn</b> See the study note on 25:9 for the significance of the application of this term to Nebuchadnezzar.</p>
<A NAME="2715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1568><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I have given&#8230;to him to serve him.&#8221; The verb &#8220;give&#8221; in this syntactical situation is functioning like the Hiphil stem, i.e., as a causative. See Dan 1:9 for parallel usage. For the usage of &#8220;serve&#8221; meaning &#8220;be subject to&#8221; compare 2 Sam 22:44 and BDB 713 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1491;</font> 3.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This statement is rhetorical, emphasizing the totality of Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s dominion. Neither here nor in Dan 2:38 is it to be understood literally.</p>
<A NAME="2716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1569><b>sn</b> This is a figure that emphasizes that they will serve for a long time but not for an unlimited duration. The kingdom of Babylon lasted a relatively short time by ancient standards. It lasted from 605 <sc>b.c. when Nebuchadnezzar defeated Necho at Carchemish until the fall of Babylon in 538 <sc>b.c. There were only four rulers. Nebuchadnezzar was succeeded by his son, Evil Merodach (cf. 52:31), and two other rulers who were not descended from him.</p>
<A NAME="2717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1570><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;until the time of his land, even his, comes.&#8221; The independent pronoun is placed here for emphasis on the possessive pronoun. The word &#8220;time&#8221; is used by substitution for the things that are done in it (compare in the NT John 2:4; 7:30; 8:20 &#8220;his hour had not yet come&#8221;).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> See Jer 25:12-14, 16.</p>
<A NAME="2718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1571><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;him.&#8221; This is a good example of the figure of substitution where the person is put for his descendants or the nation or subject he rules. (See Gen 28:13-14 for another good example and Acts 22:7 in the NT.)</p>
<A NAME="2719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1572><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;put their necks in the yoke of.&#8221; See the study note on v. 2 for the figure.</p>

The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1514;</font>, the sign of the accusative, before &#8220;which will not put&#8230;&#8221; is a little unusual here.

<A NAME="2723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1576><b>tc</b> The verb translated &#8220;destroy&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tamam</font>) is usually intransitive in the stem of the verb used here. It is found in a transitive sense elsewhere only in Ps 64:7. BDB 1070 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1501;</font> 7 emends both texts.

The Greek translation supports reading the verb &#8220;destroy&#8221; but treats it as though it were intransitive &#8220;until they are destroyed by his hand&#8221; (reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1467;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> [<font face="Scholar">tummam</font>]). The MT here is accepted as the more difficult reading and support is seen in the transitive use of the verb in Ps 64:7.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will punish that nation until I have destroyed them [i.e., its people] by his hand.&#8221; &#8220;Hand&#8221; here refers to agency.

<A NAME="2724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1577><b>sn</b> Various means of <i>divination</i> are alluded to in the OT. For example, Ezek 21:26-27 alludes to throwing down arrows to see which way they fall and consulting the shape of the liver of slaughtered animals. Gen 44:5 alludes to reading the future through pouring liquid in a cup. The means alluded to in this verse were all classified as pagan and prohibited as illegitimate in Deut 18:10-14. The <sc>Lord had promised that he would speak to them through prophets like Moses (Deut 18:15, 18). But even prophets could lie. Hence, the <sc>Lord told them that the test of a true prophet was whether what he said came true or not (Deut 18:20-22). An example of false prophesying and the vindication of the true as opposed to the false will be given in the chapter that follows this.</p>
<A NAME="2725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1578><b>sn</b> An example of this is seen in 1 Sam 28.</p>

The priests would have been very concerned especially about the big bronze basin and the movable stands and their basins because they involved their ritual purification apart from which they would have had no sanctity. These articles (or furnishings in this case) were broken up and the bronze carried away to Babylon along with all the other bronze, silver, and gold furnishings when the temple and the city were destroyed in 587 <sc>b.c.

I.e., all the objects in v. 19 are all objects of the one verb &#8220;has spoken about&#8221; and the description in v. 20 is one long relative or descriptive clause. The introductory &#8220;For the <sc>Lord&#8230;has already spoken&#8221; is repeated in v. 21 from v. 19 and reference is made to the same articles once again, only in the terms that were used in v. 18b. By this means, attention is focused for these people (here the priests and the people) on articles which were of personal concern for them and the climax or the punch line is delayed to the end. The point being made is that the false prophets are mistaken; not only will the articles taken to Babylon not be returned &#8220;very soon&#8221; but the <sc>Lord had said that the ones that remained would be taken there as well. They ought rather pray that the <sc>Lord will change his mind and not carry them off as well.</p>
<A NAME="2759"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=1612><b>tn</b> This verb is a little difficult to render here. The word is used in the sense of taking note of something and acting according to what is noticed. It is the word that has been translated several times throughout Jeremiah as &#8220;punish [someone].&#8221; It is also used in the opposite of sense of taking note and &#8220;show consideration for&#8221; (or &#8220;care for;&#8221; see, e.g., Ruth 1:6). Here the nuance is positive and is further clarified by the actions that follow, bringing them back and restoring them.</p>
