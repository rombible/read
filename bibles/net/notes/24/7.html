In this instance the title appears to emphasize the <sc>Lord as the heavenly King who drags his disobedient vassals into court (and threatens them with judgment).</p>
<A NAME="75"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=424><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Make good your ways and your actions.&#8221; J. Bright&#8217;s translation (&#8220;Reform the whole pattern of your conduct&#8221;; <i>Jeremiah </i>[AB], 52) is excellent.</p>

<A NAME="79"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=428><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The temple of the <sc>Lord, the temple of the <sc>Lord, the temple of the <sc>Lord are these (i.e., these buildings).&#8221; Elsewhere triple repetition seems to mark a kind of emphasis (cf. Isa 6:3; Jer 22:29; Ezek 21:27 [32 HT]). The triple repetition that follows seems to be Jeremiah&#8217;s way of mocking the (false) sense of security that people had in the invincibility of Jerusalem because God dwelt in the temple. They appeared to be treating the temple as some kind of magical charm. A similar feeling had grown up around the ark in the time of the judges (cf. 1 Sam 3:3) and the temple and city of Jerusalem in Micah&#8217;s day (cf. Mic 3:11). It is reflected also in some of the Psalms (cf., e.g., Ps 46, especially v. 5).</p>

<A NAME="716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=435><b>tn</b> The translation uses imperatives in vv. 5-6 followed by the phrase, &#8220;If you do all this,&#8221; to avoid the long and complex sentence structure of the Hebrew sentence which has a series of conditional clauses in vv. 5-6 followed by a main clause in v. 7.</p>

<A NAME="724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=443><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;over which my name is called.&#8221; For this nuance of this idiom cf. BDB 896 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;</font> Niph.2.d(4) and see the usage in 2 Sam 12:28.</p>
<A NAME="725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=444><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;&#8216;We are safe!&#8217; &#8211; safe, you think, to go on doing all those hateful things.&#8221; Verses 9-10 are all one long sentence in the Hebrew text. It has been broken up for English stylistic reasons. Somewhat literally it reads &#8220;Will you steal&#8230;then come and stand&#8230;and say, &#8216;We are safe&#8217; so as to/in order to do&#8230;&#8221; The Hebrew of v. 9 has a series of infinitives which emphasize the bare action of the verb without the idea of time or agent. The effect is to place a kind of staccato like emphasis on the multitude of their sins all of which are violations of one of the Ten Commandments. The final clause in v. 8 expresses purpose or result (probably result) through another infinitive. This long sentence is introduced by a marker (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;</font> interrogative in Hebrew) introducing a rhetorical question in which God expresses his incredulity that they could do these sins, come into the temple and claim the safety of his protection, and then go right back out and commit the same sins. J. Bright (<i>Jeremiah </i>[AB], 52) catches the force nicely: &#8220;What? You think you can steal, murder&#8230;and then come and stand&#8230;and say, &#8216;We are safe&#8230;&#8217; just so that you can go right on&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="726"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=445><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;over which my name is called.&#8221; For this nuance of this idiom cf.

<A NAME="727"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=446><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Is this house&#8230;a den/cave of robbers in your eyes?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="728"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=447><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Behold!&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=448><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;where I caused my name to dwell.&#8221; The translation does not adequately represent the theology of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s deliberate identification with a place where he chose to manifest his presence and desired to be worshiped (cf. Exod 20:25; Deut 16:2, 6, 11).</p>
<A NAME="730"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=449><b>sn</b> <i>The place in Shiloh&#8230;see what I did to it</i>. This refers to the destruction of Shiloh by the Philistines circa 1050 <sc>b.c. (cf. Ps 78:60). The destruction of Shiloh is pertinent to the argument. The presence of the tabernacle and ark of the covenant did not prevent Shiloh from being destroyed when Israel sinned. The people of Israel used the ark as a magic charm but it did not prevent them from being defeated or the ark being captured (1 Sam 4:3, 11, 21-22).</p>
<A NAME="731"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=450><b>tn</b> This reflects a Hebrew idiom (e.g., 7:25; 11:7; 25:3, 4), i.e., an infinitive of a verb meaning &#8220;to do something early [or eagerly]&#8221; followed by an infinitive of another verb of action. Cf. <i>HALOT</i> 1384 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1501;</font> Hiph.2.</p>

The other ancient and modern versions generally, however, accept it as a biform for the word &#8220;queen.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The <i>Queen of Heaven</i> is probably a reference to the goddess known as Ishtar in Mesopotamia, Anat in Canaan, Ashtoreth in Israel. She was the goddess of love and fertility. For further discussion, see G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, T. G. Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52 </i>(WBC),<i> </i>266-68.</p>
<A NAME="743"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=462><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;to provoke me.&#8221; There is debate among grammarians and lexicographers about the nuance of the Hebrew particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿma</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">an</font>). Some say it always denotes purpose, while others say it may denote either purpose or result, depending on the context. For example, BDB 775 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</font> note 1 says that it always denotes purpose, never result, but that sometimes what is really a result is represented ironically as though it were a purpose. That explanation fits nicely here in the light of the context of the next verse. The translation is intended to reflect some of that ironic sarcasm.</p>
<A NAME="744"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=463><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Is it I whom they provoke?&#8221; The rhetorical question expects a negative answer which is made explicit in the translation.</p>

<A NAME="746"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=465><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Lord Yahweh.&#8221; The translation follows the ancient Jewish tradition of substituting the Hebrew word for God for the proper name Yahweh.</p>
<A NAME="747"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=466><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;this place.&#8221; Some see this as a reference to the temple but the context has been talking about what goes on in the towns of Judah and Jerusalem and the words that follow, meant as a further explanation, are applied to the whole land.</p>

Amos 4:4, &#8220;Go to Bethel and sin!&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> All of the burnt offering, including the meat, was to be consumed on the altar (e.g., Lev 1:6-9). The meat of the other sacrifices could be eaten by the priest who offered the sacrifice and the person who brought it (e.g., Lev 7:16-18, 32). Since, however, the people of Judah were making a mockery of the sacrificial system by offering sacrifices while disobeying the law, the <sc>Lord rejected the sacrifices (cf. 6:20). Since they were violating the moral law they might as well go ahead and violate the cultic law by eating the meat dedicated to God because he rejected it anyway.</p>
<A NAME="752"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=471><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;For&#8221; but this introduces a long explanation about the relative importance of sacrifice and obedience.</p>
<A NAME="753"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=472><b>tn</b> Verses 22-23a read in Hebrew, &#8220;I did not speak with your ancestors and I did not command them when I brought them out of Egypt about words/matters concerning burnt offering and sacrifice, but I commanded them this word:&#8221; Some modern commentators have explained this passage as an evidence for the lateness of the Pentateuchal instruction regarding sacrifice or a denial that sacrifice was practiced during the period of the wilderness wandering. However, it is better explained as an example of what R. de Vaux calls a dialectical negative, i.e., &#8220;not so much this as that&#8221; or &#8220;not this without that&#8221; (<i>Ancient Israel</i>, 454-56). For other examples of this same argument see Isa 1:10-17; Hos 6:4-6; Amos 5:21-25.</p>
<A NAME="754"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=473><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Obey me and I will be.&#8221; The translation is equivalent syntactically but brings out the emphasis in the command.</p>

Bright, <i>Jeremiah </i>(AB), 57. Another option is &#8220;they turned their backs to me, not their faces,&#8221; understanding the line as a variant of a line in 2:27.</p>
<A NAME="757"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=476><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from the day your ancestors&#8230;until this very day.&#8221; However, &#8220;day&#8221; here is idiomatic for &#8220;the present time.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="759"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=478><b>tc</b> There is some textual debate about the legitimacy of this expression here. The text reads merely &#8220;day&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yom</font>). <i>BHS</i> suggests the word is to be deleted as a dittography of the plural ending of the preceding word. The word is in the Greek and Latin, and the Syriac represents the typical idiom &#8220;day after day&#8221; as though the noun were repeated. Either <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> has dropped out by haplography or a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mem</font>) has been left out, i.e., reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1502;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yomam</font>, &#8220;daily&#8221;).</p>

What is involved here are four levels of referents, the &#8220;you&#8221; of the present generation (vv. 21-22a), the ancestors who were delivered from Egypt (i.e., the &#8220;they&#8221; of vv. 22b-24), the &#8220;you&#8221; of v. 25 which involves all the Israelites from the Exodus to the time of speaking, and the &#8220;they&#8221; of v. 26 which cannot be the ancestors of vv. 22-24 (since they cannot be more wicked than themselves) but must be an indefinite entity which is a part of the &#8220;you&#8221; of v. 25, i.e., the more immediate ancestors of the present generation. If this is kept in mind, there is no need to level the pronouns to &#8220;they&#8221; and &#8220;them&#8221; or to &#8220;you&#8221; and &#8220;your&#8221; as some of the ancient versions and modern English versions have done.</p>

Many English versions supply, &#8220;Jerusalem.&#8221; The address shifts from second masculine singular addressing Jeremiah (vv. 27-28a) to second feminine singular. It causes less disruption in the flow of the context to see the nation as a whole addressed here as a feminine singular entity (as, e.g., in 2:19, 23; 3:2, 3; 6:26) than to introduce a new entity, Jerusalem.</p>

<A NAME="770"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=489><b>sn</b> Compare, e.g., 2 Kgs 21:3, 5, 7; 23:4, 6; Ezek 8:3, 5, 10-12, 16. Manasseh had desecrated the temple by building altars, cult symbols, and idols in it. Josiah had purged the temple of these pagan elements. But it is obvious from both Jeremiah and Ezekiel that they had been replaced shortly after Josiah&#8217;s death. They were a primary cause of Judah&#8217;s guilt and punishment (see beside this passage, 19:5; 32:34-35).</p>

<A NAME="772"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=491><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;high places.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> These <i>places of worship</i> were essentially open air shrines often located on hills or wooded heights. They were generally connected with pagan worship and equipped with altars of sacrifice and of incense and cult objects such as wooden poles and stone pillars which were symbols of the god and/or goddess worshiped at the sight. The Israelites were commanded to tear down these Canaanite places of worship (Num 33:52) but they did not do so, often taking over the site for the worship of Yahweh but even then incorporating some of the pagan cult objects and ritual into their worship of Yahweh (1 Kgs 12:31, 32; 14:23). The prophets were especially opposed to these places and to this kind of syncretism (Hos 10:8; Amos 7:9) and to the pagan worship that was often practiced at them (Jer 7:31; 19:5; 32:35).</p>
<A NAME="773"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=492><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the high places of [or in] Topheth.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The noun <i>Topheth</i> is generally explained as an artificial formation of a word related to the Aramaic word for &#8220;cooking stove&#8221; combined with the vowels for the word for &#8220;shame.&#8221; Hence, Jewish piety viewed it as a very shameful act, one that was contrary to the law (see Lev 18:21; 20:2-6). Child sacrifice was practiced during the reigns of the wicked kings Ahaz and Manasseh and apparently during Jeremiah&#8217;s day (cf. 2 Kgs 16:3; 21:6; Jer 32:35).</p>
