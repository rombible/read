<A NAME="2759"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=1612><b>tn</b> This verb is a little difficult to render here. The word is used in the sense of taking note of something and acting according to what is noticed. It is the word that has been translated several times throughout Jeremiah as &#8220;punish [someone].&#8221; It is also used in the opposite of sense of taking note and &#8220;show consideration for&#8221; (or &#8220;care for;&#8221; see, e.g., Ruth 1:6). Here the nuance is positive and is further clarified by the actions that follow, bringing them back and restoring them.</p>
