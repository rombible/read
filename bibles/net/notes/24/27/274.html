<A NAME="274"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1557><b>sn</b> The <i>yoke</i> is a common biblical symbol of political servitude (see, e.g., Deut 28:48; 1 Kgs 12:4, 9, 10). From the context of 1 Kgs 12 it is clear that it applied to taxation and the provision of conscript labor. In international political contexts it involved the payment of heavy tribute which was often conscripted from the citizens (see, e.g., 2 Kgs 15:19-20; 23:34-35) and the furnishing of military contingents for the sovereign&#8217;s armies (see, e.g., 2 Kgs 24:2). Jeremiah&#8217;s message here combines both a symbolic action (the wearing of a yoke) and words of explanation as in Jer 19:1-13. (See Isa 20:1-6 for an example outside of Jeremiah.) The casting off of the yoke has been used earlier in Jer 2:20, 5:5 to refer to Israel&#8217;s failure to remain spiritually &#8220;subject&#8221; or faithful to God.</p>
