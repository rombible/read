<A NAME="2756"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=1609><b>tn</b> 27:19-20 are all one long sentence in Hebrew. It has been broken up for the sake of English style. Some of the sentences still violate contemporary English style (e.g., v. 20) but breaking them down any further would lose the focus. For further discussion see the study note on v. 21.</p>
