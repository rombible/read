<A NAME="277"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1560><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;send by means of them&#8221; [i.e., the straps and crossbars made into a yoke] to&#8230;through.&#8221; The text is broken up in conformity with contemporary English style. Many English versions ignore the suffix on the end of &#8220;send&#8221; and find some support for this on the basis of its absence in the Lucianic Greek text. However, it is probably functioning metonymically here for the message which they see symbolized before them and is now explained clearly to them.</p>
