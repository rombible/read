<A NAME="273"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1556><b>tn</b> There is some disjunction in the narrative of this chapter. The introduction in v. 1 presents this as a third person narrative. But the rest of the passage reports the narrative in first person. Thus the text reads here &#8220;Thus the <sc>Lord said to me&#8230;&#8221; In vv. 12, 16 the narrative picks up in first person report and never indicates that Jeremiah carried out the command in vv. 2-4 that introduces the message which he repeats in summary form himself to Zedekiah. The report is thus an &#8220;unedited&#8221; first person report. This may create some confusion for some readers, but it is best to leave it in first person here because of the continuation in vv. 12, 16.</p>
