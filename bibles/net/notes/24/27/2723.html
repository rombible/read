<A NAME="2723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1576><b>tc</b> The verb translated &#8220;destroy&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tamam</font>) is usually intransitive in the stem of the verb used here. It is found in a transitive sense elsewhere only in Ps 64:7. BDB 1070 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1501;</font> 7 emends both texts. In this case they recommend <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">titi</font>): &#8220;until I give them into his hand.&#8221; That reading is suggested by the texts of the Syriac and Targumic translations (see <i>BHS</i> fn c). The Greek translation supports reading the verb &#8220;destroy&#8221; but treats it as though it were intransitive &#8220;until they are destroyed by his hand&#8221; (reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1467;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> [<font face="Scholar">tummam</font>]). The MT here is accepted as the more difficult reading and support is seen in the transitive use of the verb in Ps 64:7.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will punish that nation until I have destroyed them [i.e., its people] by his hand.&#8221; &#8220;Hand&#8221; here refers to agency. Hence, &#8220;I will use him.&#8221;</p>
