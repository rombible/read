<A NAME="2748"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1601><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;I also told them&#8221; are not in the text, but it is obvious from the fact that the <sc>Lord is spoken about in the third person in vv. 18, 19, 21 that he is not the speaker. This is part of Jeremiah&#8217;s own speech to the priests and the people (v. 16). These words are supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
