<A NAME="271"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1554><b>sn</b> The names of Jeremiah and of Nebuchadnezzar are spelled differently in the Hebrew of chapter 27-29. That and other literary features show that these three chapters are all closely related. The events of these three chapters all take place within the space of one year (cf. 28:1; 29:17).</p>
