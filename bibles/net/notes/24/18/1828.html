<A NAME="1828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1102><b>tn</b> There may be a deliberate double meaning involved here. The word translated here &#8220;an object of horror&#8221; refers both to destruction (cf. 2:15; 4:17) and the horror or dismay that accompanies it (cf. 5:30; 8:21). The fact that there is no conjunction or preposition in front of the noun &#8220;hissing&#8221; that follows this suggests that the reaction is in view here, not the cause.</p>
