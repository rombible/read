<A NAME="185"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1079><b>sn</b> <i>At his wheel</i> (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;at the two stones&#8221;). The Hebrew expression is very descriptive of the construction of a potter&#8217;s wheel which consisted of two stones joined by a horizontal shaft. The potter rotated the wheel with his feet on the lower wheel and worked the clay with his hands on the upper. For a picture of a potter working at his wheel see I. Ben-Dor, &#8220;Potter&#8217;s Wheel,&#8221; <i>IDB</i> 3:846. See also the discussion regarding the making of pottery in J. L. Kelso, &#8220;Pottery,&#8221; <i>IDB</i> 3:846-53. </p>
