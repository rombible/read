<A NAME="188"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1082><b>tn</b> The usage of the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font> (<i>bet</i>) to introduce the material from which something is made in Exod 38:8 and 1 Kgs 15:22 should lay to rest the rather forced construction that some (like J. Bright, Jeremiah [AB], 121) put on the variant <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1465;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kakhomer</font>) found in a few Hebrew <sc>mss. Bright renders that phrase as an elliptical &#8220;as clay sometimes will.&#8221; The phrase is missing from the Greek version.</p>
