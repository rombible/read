<A NAME="1825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1099><b>tn</b> The precise translation of this verse is somewhat uncertain. Two phrases in this verse are the primary cause of discussion and the source of numerous emendations, none of which has gained consensus. The phrase which is rendered here &#8220;rocky slopes&#8221; is in Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsur saday</font>), which would normally mean something like &#8220;rocky crag of the field&#8221; (see BDB 961 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1497;</font> 1.g). Numerous emendations have been proposed, most of which are listed in the footnotes of J. A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah </i>(NICOT), 436. The present translation has chosen to follow the proposal of several scholars that the word here is related to the Akkadian word <i>shadu</i> meaning mountain. The other difficulty is the word translated &#8220;cease&#8221; which in the MT is literally &#8220;be uprooted&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yinnatshu</font>). The word is usually emended to read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yinnashtu</font>, &#8220;are dried up&#8221;) as a case of transposed letters (cf., e.g., BDB 684 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> Niph). This is probably a case of an error in hearing and the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1496;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">natash</font>) which is often parallel to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">azav</font>), translated here &#8220;vanish,&#8221; should be read in the sense that it has in 1 Sam 10:2. Whether one reads &#8220;are plucked up&#8221; and understands it figuratively of ceasing (&#8220;are dried&#8221; or &#8220;cease&#8221;), the sense is the same. For the sense of &#8220;distant&#8221; for the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zarim</font>) see 2 Kgs 19:24.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Israel&#8217;s actions are contrary to nature. See the same kind of argumentation in Jer 2:11; 8:7.</p>
