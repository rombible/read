<A NAME="1814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1088><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;Jeremiah&#8221; is not in the text but it is implicit from the introduction in v. 5 that he is being addressed. It is important to see how the rhetoric of this passage is structured. The words of vv. 7-10 lead up to the conclusion &#8220;So now&#8221; in v. 11 which in turns leads to the conclusion &#8220;Therefore&#8221; in v. 13. The tense of the verb in v. 12 is very important. It is a <i>vav</i> consecutive perfect indicating the future (cf. GKC 333 §112.<i>p</i>, <i>r</i>); their response is predictable. The words of vv. 7-10 are addressed to Jeremiah (v. 5) in fulfillment of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s promise to speak to him (v. 2) and furnish the basis for the <sc>Lord&#8217;s words of conditional threat to a people who show no promise of responding positively (vv. 11-12). Verse six then must be seen as another example of the figure of apostrophe (the turning aside from description about someone to addressing them directly; cf., e.g., Ps 6:8-9 (6:9-10 HT). Earlier examples of this figure have been seen in 6:20; 9:4; 11:13; 12:13; 15:6.</p>
