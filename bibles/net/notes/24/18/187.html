<A NAME="187"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1081><b>sn</b> Something was wrong with the clay &#8211; either there was a lump in it, or it was too moist or not moist enough, or it had some other imperfection. In any case the vessel was &#8220;ruined&#8221; or &#8220;spoiled&#8221; or defective in the eyes of the potter. This same verb has been used of the linen shorts that were &#8220;ruined&#8221; and hence were &#8220;good for nothing&#8221; in Jer 13:7. The nature of the clay and how it responded to the potter&#8217;s hand determined the kind of vessel that he made of it. He did not throw the clay away. This is the basis for the application in vv. 7-10 to any nation and to the nation of Israel in particular vv. 10-17.</p>
