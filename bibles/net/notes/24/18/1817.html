<A NAME="1817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1091><b>tn</b> There is a good deal of debate about how the word translated here &#8220;revoke&#8221; should be translated. There is a good deal of reluctance to translate it &#8220;change my mind&#8221; because some see that as contradicting Num 23:19 and thus prefer &#8220;relent.&#8221; However, the English word &#8220;relent&#8221; suggests the softening of an attitude but not necessarily the change of course.

This same play is carried further in Jonah 3:10-4:1 where Jonah becomes very displeased (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;it was very evil to Jonah with great evil&#8221;) when God forgoes bringing disaster (evil) on Nineveh because they have repented of their wickedness (evil).</p>
