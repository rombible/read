<A NAME="1820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1094><b>sn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I am forming disaster and making plans against you.&#8221; The word translated &#8220;forming&#8221; is the same as that for &#8220;potter,&#8221; so there is a wordplay taking the reader back to v. 5.
