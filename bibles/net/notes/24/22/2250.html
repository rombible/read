<A NAME="2250"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1272><b>tn</b> There is no certain explanation for the triple repetition of the word &#8220;land&#8221; here. F. B. Huey (<i>Jeremiah, Lamentations </i>[NAC], 209) suggests the idea of exasperation, but exasperation at what? Their continued apostasy which made these exiles necessary? Or exasperation at their pitiful hopes of seeing Jeconiah restored? Perhaps &#8220;pitiful, pitiful, pitiful land of Judah&#8221; would convey some of the force of the repetition without being any more suggestive of why the land is so addressed.</p>
