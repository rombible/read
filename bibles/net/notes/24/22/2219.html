<A NAME="2219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1241><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Woe to the one who builds his house by unrighteousness and its upper rooms with injustice using his neighbor [= countryman] as a slave for nothing and not giving to him his wages.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This was a clear violation of covenant law (cf. Deut 24:14-15) and a violation of the requirements set forth in Jer 22:3. The allusion is to Jehoiakim who is not mentioned until v. 18. He was placed on the throne by Pharaoh Necho and ruled from 609-598 <sc>b.c. He became a vassal of Nebuchadnezzar but rebelled against him, bringing about the siege of 597 <sc>b.c. in which his son and many of the Judean leaders were carried off to Babylon (2 Kgs 23:34&#8211;24:16). He was a wicked king according to the author of the book of Kings (2 Kgs 23:37). He had Uriah the prophet killed (Jer 26:23) and showed no regard for Jeremiah&#8217;s prophecies, destroying the scroll containing them (Jer 36:23) and ordering Jeremiah&#8217;s arrest (Jer 36:23).</p>
