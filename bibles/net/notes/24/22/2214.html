<A NAME="2214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1236><b>sn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will sanctify destroyers against it.&#8221; If this is not an attenuated use of the term &#8220;sanctify&#8221; the traditions of Israel&#8217;s holy wars are being turned against her. See also 6:4. In Israel&#8217;s early wars in the wilderness and in the conquest, the <sc>Lord fought for her against the enemies (cf., e.g., Josh 10:11, 14, 42; 24:7; Judg 5:20; 1 Sam 7:10). Now he is going to fight against them (21:5, 13) and use the enemy as his instruments of destruction. For a similar picture of destruction in the temple see the lament in Ps 74:3-7.</p>
