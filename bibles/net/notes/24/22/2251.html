<A NAME="2251"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1273><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Write this man childless.&#8221; For the explanation see the study note. The word translated &#8220;childless&#8221; has spawned some debate because Jeconiah was in fact not childless. There is record from both the Bible and ancient Near Eastern texts that he had children (see, e.g., 1 Chr 3:17). G. R. Driver, &#8220;Linguistic and Textual Problems: Jeremiah,&#8221; <i>JQR</i> 28 (1937-38): 115, has suggested that the word both here and in Lev 20:20-21 should be translated &#8220;stripped of honor.&#8221; While that would relieve some of the difficulties here, the word definitely means &#8220;childless&#8221; in Gen 15:2 and also in Sir 16:3 where it is contrasted with having godless children. The issue is not one of childlessness but of having &#8220;one of his sons&#8221; succeed to the Davidic throne. The term for &#8220;one of his sons&#8221; is literally &#8220;from his seed a man&#8221; and the word &#8220;seed&#8221; is the same one that is used to refer to his &#8220;children&#8221; who were forced into exile with him (v. 28).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The figure here is of registering a person on an official roll of citizens, etc. (cf. Num 11:26; 1 Chr 4:41; Ps 87:6). Here it probably refers to the &#8220;king list&#8221; of dynastic succession. While Jeconiah did have children (2 Chr 3:17) none of them ever returned to Judah or ruled over it. What is being denied here is his own succession and that of his immediate sons contrary to the popular hopes expressed in Jer 28:4. His grandson Zerubbabel did return to Judah, became governor (Hag 1:1; 2:2), and along with the high priest Joshua was responsible for rebuilding the second temple (e.g., Ezra 5:2).</p>
