<A NAME="2249"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1271><b>sn</b> The question &#8220;Why?&#8221; is a common rhetorical feature in the book of Jeremiah. See Jer 2:14, 31; 8:5, 19, 22; 12:1; 13:22; 14:19. In several cases like this one no answer is given, leaving a sense of exasperation and hopelessness with the sinfulness of the nation that calls forth such punishment from God.</p>
