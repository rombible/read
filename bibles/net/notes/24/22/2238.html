<A NAME="2238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1260><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;You who dwell in Lebanon, you who are nested in its cedars, how you&#8230;.&#8221; The metaphor has been interpreted for the sake of clarity. The figure here has often been interpreted of the people of Jerusalem living in paneled houses or living in a city dominated by the temple and palace which were built from the cedars of Lebanon. Some even interpret this as a reference to the king who has been characterized as living in a cedar palace, in a veritable Lebanon (cf. vv. 6-7, 14 and see also the alternate interpretation of 21:13-14). However, the reference to &#8220;nesting in the cedars&#8221; and the earlier reference to &#8220;feeling secure&#8221; suggests that the figure is rather like that of Ezek 31:6 and Dan 4:12. See also Hab 2:9 where a related figure is used. The forms for &#8220;you who dwell&#8221; and &#8220;you who are nested&#8221; in the literal translation are feminine singular participles referring again to personified Jerusalem. (The written forms of these participles are to be explained as participles with a <i>hireq campaginis </i>according to GKC 253 §90.<i>m</i>. The use of the participle before the preposition is to be explained according to GKC 421 §130.<i>a</i>.)</p>
