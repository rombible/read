<A NAME="2223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1245><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Your father, did he not eat and drink and do justice and right.&#8221; The copulative <i>vav</i> in front of the verbs here (all Hebrew perfects) shows that these actions are all coordinate not sequential. The contrast drawn here between the actions of Jehoiakim and Josiah show that the phrase eating and drinking should be read in the light of the same contrasts in Eccl 2 which ends with the note of contentment in Eccl 2:24 (see also Eccl 3:13; 5:18 [5:17 HT]; 8:15). The question is, of course, rhetorical setting forth the positive role model against which Jehoiakim&#8217;s actions are to be condemned. The key terms here are &#8220;then things went well with him&#8221; which is repeated in the next verse after the reiteration of Josiah&#8217;s practice of justice.</p>
