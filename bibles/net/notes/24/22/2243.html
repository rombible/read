<A NAME="2243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1265><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;As surely as I live, Jeconiah, King of Judah, son of Jehoiakim will not be a signet ring on my right hand. Indeed I will tear you off from it [i.e., pull you off of my finger as a signet ring].&#8221; The signet ring was the king&#8217;s seal by which he verified all his legal and political transactions. To have the signet ring was to exercise authority in the king&#8217;s name. For examples of this see Gen 41:42, 43; 1 Kgs 21:8; Esth 3:10; 8:2. The figure has been interpreted in the translation for the sake of clarity. The particles <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497; &#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>) that stand after the oath formula &#8220;As I live&#8221; introduce a negative statement according to the usage of Hebrew grammar (cf. BDB 474 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497; &#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> 1.a and BDB 50 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> 1.b[2] and compare 2 Sam 3:35). The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> that stands in front of &#8220;I will tear you off&#8221; introduces a positive affirmation according to the same rules of Hebrew grammar (cf. BDB 472 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 1.c and compare 1 Sam 14:39, 44). The <sc>Lord is swearing emphatically that Jeconiah will not be the earthly representative of his rule; i.e., not carry the authority of the signet ring bearer. As in several other places in Jeremiah there is a sudden shift from the third person to the second person which runs throughout vv. 24-27. The pronouns are leveled in the translation to the second person to avoid confusion. The figures are interpreted in the translation to convey the proper significance. See the study note for explanation.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> According to the Davidic covenant the Davidic king sat on God&#8217;s throne over God&#8217;s kingdom, Israel (cf. 2 Chr 29:30; 28:5). As God&#8217;s representative he ruled in God&#8217;s stead and could even be addressed figuratively as God (cf. Ps 45:6 [45:7 HT]) and compare the same phenomenon for the earthly judges, Exod 22:7-8; Ps 82:1, 6). Jeconiah is being denied the right to function any longer as the Davidic king and any hopes of ever regaining that right in his lifetime or through the succession of his sons is also denied. This oracle is reversed by the later oracle of the prophet Haggai to his grandson Zerubbabel in Hag 2:20-23 and both Jeconiah and Zerubbabel are found in the genealogy of Christ in Matt 1:12-13.</p>
