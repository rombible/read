<A NAME="2247"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1269><b>tn</b> The word translated &#8220;clay vessel&#8221; occurs only here. Its meaning, however, is assured on the basis of the parallelism and on the basis of the verb root which is used for shaping or fashioning in Job 10:8. The KJV renders it as &#8220;idol,&#8221; but that word, while having the same consonants, never appears in the singular. The word is missing in the Greek version but is translated &#8220;vessel&#8221; in the Latin version. The word &#8220;clay&#8221; is supplied in the translation to clarify what sort of vessel is meant; its inclusion is justified based on the context and the use of the same verb root in Job 10:8 to refer to shaping or fashioning, which would imply clay pots or vessels.</p>
