<A NAME="2221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1243><b>tn</b> The word translated &#8220;red&#8221; only occurs here and in Ezek 23:14 where it refers to the pictures of the Babylonians on the wall of the temple. Evidently this was a favorite color for decoration. It is usually identified as vermilion, a mineral product from red ocher (cf. C. L. Wickwire, &#8220;Vermilion,&#8221; <i>IDB</i> 4:748).</p>
