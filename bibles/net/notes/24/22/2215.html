<A NAME="2215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1237><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;king&#8221; is not in the original text of either the first or the third line. It is implicit in the connection and is supplied in the translation for clarity.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> As the next verse makes clear, the king who will never return to see his native land is Shallum, also known as Jehoahaz (cf. 1 Chr 3:15; 2 Kgs 23:30, 33-34). He was made king by popular acclaim after the death of his father, Josiah, who was killed at Megiddo trying to stop Pharaoh Necho from going to the aid of the Assyrians. According to 2 Kgs 23:32 he was a wicked king. He was deposed by Necho and carried into exile where he died. The dead king alluded to is his father, Josiah, who was a godly king and was accordingly spared from seeing the destruction of his land (2 Kgs 22:20).</p>
