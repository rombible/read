<A NAME="2236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1258><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;A wind will shepherd away all your shepherds.&#8221; The figures have all been interpreted in the translation for the sake of clarity. For the use of the word &#8220;wind&#8221; as a metaphor or simile for God&#8217;s judgment (using the enemy forces) see 4:11-12; 13:24; 18:17. For the use of the word &#8220;shepherd&#8221; to refer to rulers/leaders 2:8; 10:21; and 23:1-4. For the use of the word &#8220;shepherd away&#8221; in the sense of carry off/drive away see BDB 945 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> 2.d and compare Job 20:26. There is an obvious wordplay involved in two different senses of the word &#8220;shepherd,&#8221; one referring to their leaders and one referring to the loss of those leaders by the wind driving them off. There may even be a further play involving the word &#8220;wickedness&#8221; which comes from a word having the same consonants. If the oracles in this section are chronologically ordered this threat was fulfilled in 597 <sc>b.c. when many of the royal officials and nobles were carried away captive with Jehoiachin (see 2 Kgs 24:15) who is the subject of the next oracle.</p>
