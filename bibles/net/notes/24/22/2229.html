<A NAME="2229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1251><b>tn</b> The translation follows the majority of scholars who think that the address of brother and sister are the address of the mourners to one another, lamenting their loss. Some scholars feel that all four terms are parallel and represent the relation that the king had metaphorically to his subjects; i.e., he was not only Lord and Majesty to them but like a sister or a brother. In that case something like: &#8220;How sad it is for the one who was like a brother to us! How sad it is for the one who was like a sister to us.&#8221; This makes for poor poetry and is not very likely. The lover can call his bride sister in Song of Solomon (Song 4:9, 10) but there are no documented examples of a subject ever speaking of a king in this way in Israel or the ancient Near East.</p>
