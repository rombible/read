<A NAME="311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1752><b>sn</b> This verse repeats v. 22 but with specific reference to <i>all the clans of Israel</i>, i.e., to all Israel and Judah. It functions here as a transition to the next section which will deal with the restoration of Israel (31:3-20) and Judah (31:21-25) and their reunification in the land (31:27-29) under a new covenant relation with God (31:31-37). See also the study note on 30:3 for further reference to this reunification in Jeremiah and the other prophets.</p>

<A NAME="313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1754><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;who survived the sword.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This refers to the remnant of northern Israel who had not been killed when Assyria conquered Israel in 722 <sc>b.c. or who had not died in exile. References to Samaria in v. 5 and to Ephraim in vv. 6, 9 make clear that northern Israel is in view here.</p>
<A NAME="314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1755><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;The people of Israel who survived the onslaughts of Egypt and Amalek found favor in the wilderness as they journeyed to find rest. At that time long ago the <sc>Lord manifested himself to them. He said, &#8216;I have&#8230;That is why I have drawn you to myself through my unfailing kindness.&#8217;&#8221; For the basis for each of these translations see the translator&#8217;s note. There is debate whether the reference here is to God&#8217;s preservation of Israel during their wandering in the Sinai desert or his promise to protect and preserve them on their return through the Arabian desert on the way back from Assyria and Babylon (see e.g., Isa 42:14-16; 43:16-21; Jer 16:14-15; 23:7-8). The only finite verbs in vv. 2-3a before the introduction of the quote are perfects which can denote either a past act or a future act viewed as certain of fulfillment (the prophetic perfect; see GKC 312-13 §106.<i>n</i> and see examples in Jer 11:16; 13:17; 25:14; 28:4). The phrase at the beginning of v. 3 can either refer to temporal (cf. BDB 935 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1511;</font> 2.b and Isa 22:11) or spatial distance (cf. BDB 935 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1511;</font> 2.a[2] and Isa 5:29; 59:14). The verb in the final clause in v. 3 can refer to either the continuance of God&#8217;s love as in Ps 36:10 (cf. BDB 604 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> Qal.5) or drawing someone to him in electing, caring love as in Hos 11:4 (cf. BDB 604 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> Qal.1). The translation has opted for the prophetic reference to future deliverance because of the preceding context, the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1512;&#1464;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">merakhoq</font>) to refer to the far off land of exile in Jer 30:10; 46:27; 51:50, and the reference to survivors from the sword being called on to remember the <sc>Lord in that far off land in 51:50.</p>
<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1756><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Virgin Israel.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> For the significance of this metaphor see the note on Jer 14:17. Here the emphasis appears on his special love and care for his people and the hint (further developed in vv. 21-22) that, though guilty of sin, he considers them like an innocent young virgin.</p>
<A NAME="316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1757><b>sn</b> Contrast Jer 7:34 and 25:10.</p>
<A NAME="317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1758><b>map</b> For location see Map2-B1; Map4-D3; Map5-E2; Map6-A4; Map7-C1.</p>
<A NAME="318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1759><b>sn</b> The terms used here refer to the enjoyment of a period of peace and stability and the reversal of the curse (contrast, e.g., Deut 28:30). The Hebrew word translated &#8220;enjoy its fruit&#8221; is a technical one that refers to the owner of a vineyard getting to enjoy its fruit in the fifth year after it was planted, the crops of the first three years lying fallow, and that of the fourth being given to the <sc>Lord (cf. Lev 19:23-25).</p>
<A NAME="319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1760><b>sn</b> <i>Watchmen</i> were stationed at vantage points to pass on warning of coming attack (Jer 6:17; Ezek 33:2, 6) or to spread the news of victory (Isa 52:8). Here reference is made to the watchmen who signaled the special times of the year such as the new moon and festival times when Israel was to go to Jerusalem to worship. Reference is not made to these in the Hebrew Bible but there is a good deal of instruction regarding them in the later Babylonian Talmud.</p>
<A NAME="3110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1761><b>sn</b> Not only will Israel and Judah be reunited under one ruler (cf. 23:5-6), but they will share a unified place and practice of worship once again in contrast to Israel using the illicit places of worship, illicit priesthood, and illicit feasts instituted by Jeroboam (1 Kgs 12:26-31) and continued until the downfall of Samaria in 722 <sc>b.c.</p>
<A NAME="3111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1762><b>tn</b> See the translator&#8217;s notes on 30:5, 12.</p>
<A NAME="3112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1763><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for the head/chief of the nations.&#8221; See BDB 911 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1465;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;</font> 3.c and compare usage in Ps 18:44 referring to David as the &#8220;chief&#8221; or &#8220;foremost ruler&#8221; of the nations.</p>
<A NAME="3113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1764><b>tn</b> It is unclear who the addressees of the masculine plural imperatives are in this verse. Possibly they are the implied exiles who are viewed as in the process of returning and praying for their fellow countrymen.</p>
<A NAME="3114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1765><b>tc</b> Or &#8220;The <sc>Lord will rescue his people. He will deliver those of Israel who remain alive.&#8221; The translation used in the text follows the Hebrew: &#8220;Rescue your people, O <sc>Lord, the remnant of Israel.&#8221; The alternate translation which is preferred by several modern English versions (e.g., REB, TEV) and a majority of modern commentaries (see, e.g., J. A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah </i>[NICOT], 569; J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah </i>[AB], 273, n. s-s) follows the reading of the Greek version and the Aramaic Targum and appears more appropriate to the context of praise presupposed by the preceding imperatives. The difference in the two readings are the omission of one vowel letter and the confusion of a final <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kaf</font>) and a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">holem-vav</font>) which are very similar in form. (The Greek presupposes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1506;&#1463; &#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492; &#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;</font> [<font face="Scholar">hoshi</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">a yÿhvah </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et-</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ammo</font>] for the Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1506; &#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492; &#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1456;</font> [<font face="Scholar">hosha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> yÿhvah </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et-</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ammÿkh</font>].) The key to a decision here is the shift from the verbs of praise to the imperative &#8220;say&#8221; which introduces the quotation; there is a shift from praise to petition. The shift in mood is not uncommon, occurring, for example, in Ps 118:25 and 126:4; it is the shift in mood between praise for what has begun to petition for what is further hoped for. It is easier to explain the origin contextually of the Greek and Targum than it is the Hebrew text, thus the Greek and Targum are probably a secondary smoothing of the text (this is the decision of the D. Barthélemy, ed., <i>Preliminary and Interim Report on the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project</i>, 4:263). The mood of prayer also shows up in v. 9 and again in vv. 17-18.</p>
<A NAME="3115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1766><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;And I will reply&#8221; are not in the text but the words vv. 8-9 appear to be the answer to the petition at the end of v. 7. These words are supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1767><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;They will come with weeping; I will bring them with supplication.&#8221; The ideas of contrition and repentance are implicit from the context (cf. vv. 18-19) and are supplied for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1768><b>sn</b> Jer 31:8-9 are reminiscent of the &#8220;New Exodus&#8221; motif of Isa 40-66 which has already been referred to in Jer 16:14-15; 23:7-8. See especially Isa 35:3-10; 40:3-5, 11; 41:17-20; 42:14-17; 43:16-21; 49:9-13. As there, the New Exodus will so outstrip the old that the old will pale in comparison and be almost forgotten (see Jer 23:7-8).</p>
<A NAME="3118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1769><b>sn</b> <i>Ephraim</i> was the second son of Joseph who was elevated to a place of prominence in the family of Jacob by the patriarch&#8217;s special blessing. It was the strongest tribe in northern Israel and Samaria lay in its territory. It is often used as a poetic parallel for Israel as here. The poetry is not speaking of two separate entities here; it is a way of repeating an idea for emphasis. Moreover, there is no intent to show special preference for northern Israel over Judah. All Israel is metaphorically God&#8217;s son and the object of his special care and concern (Exod 4:22; Deut 32:6).</p>
<A NAME="3119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1770><b>sn</b> Two rather theologically significant metaphors are used in this verse. The Hebrew word translated &#8220;will set&#8230;free&#8221; is a word used in the legal sphere for paying a redemption price to secure the freedom of a person or thing (see, e.g., Exod 13:13, 15). It is used metaphorically and theologically to refer to Israel&#8217;s deliverance from Egyptian bondage (Deut 15:15; Mic 6:4) and its deliverance from Babylonian exile (Isa 35:10). The word translated &#8220;secure their release&#8221; is a word used in the sphere of family responsibility where a person paid the price to free an indentured relative (Lev 25:48, 49) or paid the price to restore a relative&#8217;s property seized to pay a debt (Lev 25:25, 33). This word, too, was used to refer metaphorically and theologically to Israel&#8217;s deliverance from Egyptian bondage (Exod 6:6) or release from Babylonian exile (Isa 43:1-4; 44:22). These words are traditionally translated &#8220;ransom&#8221; and &#8220;redeem&#8221; and are a part of traditional Jewish and Christian vocabulary for physical and spiritual deliverance.</p>
<A NAME="3120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1771><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from the hand/power of the one too strong for him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1772><b>tn</b> Reading a Qal perfect from the root II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nahar</font>; so KBL 509 s.v. and <i>HALOT</i> 639 s.v.) rather than I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (so BDB 625 s.v.).</p>
<A NAME="3122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1773><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Oracle of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; This phrase has been brought up to the beginning of v. 13 from the end of v. 14 to introduce the transition from third person description by Jeremiah to first person address by the <sc>Lord.</p>
<A NAME="3123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1774><b>tc</b> The translation follows the reading of the LXX (Greek version). The Hebrew reads &#8220;will dance and be glad, young men and old men together.&#8221; The Greek version presupposes a Qal imperfect of a rare verb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</font> [<font face="Scholar">yakhdu</font>] from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">khadah</font>]; see BDB 292 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font> Qal) as opposed to the Hebrew text which reads a common adverb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yakhdav</font>). The consonantal text is the same but the vocalization is different. There are no other examples of the syntax of the adverb used this way (i.e., of a compound subject added to a third subject) and the vocalization of the Hebrew text can be explained on the basis of a scribe misvocalizing the text based on his greater familiarity with the adverb.</p>
<A NAME="3124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1775><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will satiate the priests with fat.&#8221; However, the word translated &#8220;fat&#8221; refers literally to the fat ashes of the sacrifices (see Lev 1:16; 4:2 and cf. BDB 206 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1503;</font> 2. The word is used more abstractly for &#8220;abundance&#8221; or &#8220;rich food&#8221; (see Job 36:16 and BDB 206 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1503;</font> 1). The people and the priests were prohibited from eating the fat (Lev 7:23-24).</p>
<A NAME="3125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1776><b>sn</b> <i>Ramah</i> is a town in Benjamin approximately five miles (8 km) north of Jerusalem. It was on the road between Bethel and Bethlehem. Traditionally, Rachel&#8217;s tomb was located near there at a place called Zelzah (1 Sam 10:2). Rachel was the mother of Joseph and Benjamin and was very concerned about having children because she was barren (Gen 30:1-2) and went to great lengths to have them (Gen 30:3, 14-15, 22-24). She was the grandmother of Ephraim and Manasseh which were two of the major tribes in northern Israel. Here Rachel is viewed metaphorically as weeping for her &#8220;children,&#8221; the descendants of Ephraim and Manasseh, who had been carried away into captivity in 722 <sc>b.c.</p>
<A NAME="3126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1777><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;gone into exile&#8221; (cf. v. 16), though some English versions take this as meaning &#8220;dead&#8221; (e.g., NCV, CEV, NLT), presumably in light of Matt 2:18.</p>
<A NAME="3127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1778><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;to her&#8221; are not in the text but are implicit from the context. They are supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>

Others translate &#8220;your future&#8221; but the &#8220;future&#8221; lies with the return of her descendants, her posterity.</p>

<A NAME="3133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1784><b>tn</b> The use of &#8220;indeed&#8221; is intended to reflect the infinitive absolute which precedes the verb for emphasis (see <i>IBHS</i> 585-86 §35.3.1f).</p>
<A NAME="3134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1785><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Ephraim.&#8221; See the study note on 31:9.

<A NAME="3135"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1786><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;like an untrained calf.&#8221; The metaphor is that of a calf who has never been broken to bear the yoke (cf.

Here Israel expresses that she has learned from the discipline of exile and is ready to bear his yoke.</p>
<A NAME="3136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1787><b>tn</b> The verb here is from the same root as the preceding and is probably an example of the &#8220;tolerative Niphal,&#8221; i.e., &#8220;I let myself be disciplined/I responded to it.&#8221; See <i>IBHS</i> 389-90 §23.4g and note the translation of some of the examples there, especially Isa 19:22; 65:1.</p>
<A NAME="3137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1788><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Bring me back in order that I may come back.&#8221; For the use of the plural pronouns see the marginal note at the beginning of the verse. The verb &#8220;bring back&#8221; and &#8220;come back&#8221; are from the same root in two different verbal stems and in the context express the idea of spiritual repentance and restoration of relationship not physical return to the land. (See BDB 999 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font> Hiph.2.a for the first verb and 997 s.v. Qal.6.c for the second.) For the use of the cohortative to express purpose after the imperative see GKC 320 §108.<i>d</i> or <i>IBHS</i> 575 §34.5.2b.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> There is a wordplay on several different nuances of the same Hebrew verb in vv. 16-19. The Hebrew verb <i>shub</i> refers both to their turning away from God (v. 19) and to their turning back to him (v. 18). It is also the word that is used for their return to their homeland (vv. 16-17).</p>
<A NAME="3138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1789><b>tn</b> For this meaning of the verb see <i>HAL</i> 374 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</font> Nif 5 or W. L. Holladay, <i>Concise Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon</i>, 129. REB translates &#8220;Now that I am submissive&#8221; relating the verb to a second root meaning &#8220;be submissive.&#8221; (See <i>HALOT</i> 375 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</font> and J. Barr, <i>Comparative Philology and the Text of the Old Testament</i>, 19-21, for evidence for this verb. Other passages cited with this nuance are Judg 8:16; Prov 10:9; Job 20:20.)</p>
<A NAME="3139"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1790><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I struck my thigh.&#8221; This was a gesture of grief and anguish (cf. Ezek 21:12 [21:17 HT]). The modern equivalent is &#8220;to beat the breast.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3140"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1791><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;because I bear the reproach of my youth.&#8221; For the plural referents see the note at the beginning of v. 18.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The expression <i>the disgraceful things we did in our earlier history</i> refers to the disgrace that accompanied the sins that Israel did in her earlier years before she learned the painful lesson of submission to the <sc>Lord through the discipline of exile. For earlier references to the sins of her youth (i.e., in her earlier years as a nation) see 3:24-25; 22:21 and see also 32:29. At the time that these verses were written, neither northern Israel or Judah had expressed the kind of contrition voiced in vv. 18-19. As one commentator notes, the words here are both prophetic and instructive.</p>
<A NAME="3141"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1792><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Is Ephraim a dear son to me or a child of delight?&#8221; For the substitution of Israel for Ephraim and the plural pronouns for the singular see the note on v. 18. According to BDB 210 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1458;</font> 1.c the question is rhetorical having the force of an impassioned affirmation. See 1 Sam 2:27; Job 41:9 (41:1 HT) for parallel usage.</p>

However, Jeremiah had repeatedly warned his own generation that they were as guilty or even more so than their ancestors.

The primary biblical passages explicating this covenant are Exod 19&#8211;24 and the book of Deuteronomy; see as well the study note on Jer 11:2 for the form this covenant took and its relation to the warnings of the prophets. The renewed document of Deuteronomy was written down and provisions made for periodic public reading and renewal of commitment to it (Deut 31:9-13). Josiah had done this after the discovery of the book of the law (which was either Deuteronomy or a synopsis of it) early in the ministry of Jeremiah (2 Kgs 23:1-4; the date would be near 622 <sc>b.c. shortly after Jeremiah began prophesying in 627 [see the note on Jer 1:2]). But it is apparent from Jeremiah&#8217;s confrontation with Judah after that time that the commitment of the people was only superficial (cf. Jer 3:10). The prior history of the nations of Israel and Judah and Judah&#8217;s current practice had been one of persistent violation of this covenant despite repeated warnings of the prophets that God would punish them for that (see especially Jer 7, 11). Because of that, Israel had been exiled (cf., e.g., Jer 3:8), and now Judah was threatened with the same (cf., e.g., Jer 7:15). Jer 30&#8211;31 look forward to a time when both Israel and Judah will be regathered, reunited, and under a new covenant which includes the same stipulations but with a different relationship (v. 32).</p>

Second is the context of the repeated fault that Jeremiah has found with their stubborn (3:17; 7:24; 9:14; 11:8; 13:10; 16:12; 18:12; 23:17), uncircumcised (4:4; 9:26), and desperately wicked hearts (4:4; 17:9). Radical changes were necessary to get the people to obey the law from the heart and not just pay superficial or lip service to it (3:10; 12:2). Deut 30:1-6; Ezek 11:17-20; 36:24-28 speak of these radical changes. The <sc>Lord will remove the &#8220;foreskin&#8221; of their heart and give them a circumcised heart, or take away their &#8220;stony&#8221; heart and give them a new heart. With this heart they will be able to obey his laws, statutes, ordinances, and commands (Deut 30:8; Ezek 11:20; 36:27). The new covenant does not entail a new law; it is the same law that Jeremiah has repeatedly accused them of rejecting or ignoring (6:19; 9:13; 16:11; 26:4; 44:10). What does change is their inner commitment to keep it. Jeremiah has already referred to this in Jer 24:7 and will refer to it again in Jer 32:39.</p>

They have been supplied in the translation for clarity. However, the word occurs in a first person speech so the translation has accommodated the switch in person as it has in a number of other places (compare also NIV, TEV, ICV).</p>
<A NAME="3194"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">94</span><note=1845><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;westward&#8221; is not in the text but is supplied in the translation to give some orientation.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The <i>Tower of Hananel</i> is referred to in Neh 3:1; 12:39; Zech 14:10. According to the directions given in Neh 3 it was in the northern wall, perhaps in the northeast corner, north of the temple mount. The <i>Corner Gate</i> is mentioned again in 2 Kgs 14:13; 2 Chr 25:23; 26:9; Zech 14:10. It is generally agreed that it was located in the northwest corner of the city.</p>

The location of Goah is generally placed south of that near the southwest corner of the Hinnom Valley which is referred to in the next verse.</p>
<A NAME="3196"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">96</span><note=1847><b>sn</b> It is generally agreed that this refers to the Hinnom Valley which was on the southwestern and southern side of the city. It was here where the people of Jerusalem had burned their children as sacrifices and where the <sc>Lord had said that there would be so many dead bodies when he punished them that they would be unable to bury all of them (cf. Jer 7:31-32). Reference here may be to those dead bodies and to the ashes of the cremated victims. This defiled place would be included within the holy city.</p>
