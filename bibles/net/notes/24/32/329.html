<A NAME="329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1861><b>tn</b> This is the verb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">paqad</font>) that has been met with several times in the book of Jeremiah, most often in the ominous sense of &#8220;punish&#8221; (e.g., 6:15; 11:22; 23:24) but also in the good sense of &#8220;resume concern for&#8221; (e.g., 27:22; 29:10). Here it is obviously in the ominous sense referring to his imprisonment and ultimate death (52:11).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Compare Jer 34:2-3 for this same prophecy. The incident in Jer 34:1-7 appears to be earlier than this one. Here Jeremiah is confined to the courtyard of the guardhouse; there he appears to have freedom of movement.</p>
