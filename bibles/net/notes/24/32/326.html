<A NAME="326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1858><b>tn</b> The translation represents an attempt to break up a very long Hebrew sentence with several levels of subordination and embedded quotations and also an attempt to capture the rhetorical force of the question &#8220;Why&#8230;&#8221; which is probably an example of what E. W. Bullinger (<i>Figures of Speech</i>, 953-54) calls a rhetorical question of expostulation or remonstrance (cf. the note on 26:9 and compare also the question in 36:29. In all three of these cases NJPS translates &#8220;How dare you&#8230;&#8221; which captures the force nicely). The Hebrew<i> </i>text reads, &#8220;For Zedekiah king of Judah had confined him, saying, &#8216;Why are you prophesying, saying, &#8220;Thus says the <sc>Lord, &#8216;Behold I am giving this city into the hands of the king of Babylon and he will capture it.&#8217;&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;</p>
