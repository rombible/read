<A NAME="3215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1867><b>sn</b> Underlying this request are the laws of redemption of property spelled out in Lev 25:25-34 and illustrated in Ruth 4:3-4. Under these laws, if a property owner became impoverished and had to sell his land, the nearest male relative had the right and duty to buy it so that it would not pass out of the use of the extended family. The land, however, would not actually belong to Jeremiah because in the year of Jubilee it reverted to its original owner. All Jeremiah was actually buying was the right to use it (Lev 25:13-17). Buying the field, thus, did not make any sense (thus Jeremiah&#8217;s complaint in v. 25) other than the fact that the <sc>Lord intended to use Jeremiah&#8217;s act as a symbol of a restored future in the land.</p>
