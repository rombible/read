<A NAME="322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1854><b>sn</b> Jer 32:2-5 are parenthetical, giving the background for the actual report of what the <sc>Lord said in v. 7. The background is significant because it shows that Jeremiah was predicting the fall of the city and the kingdom and was being held prisoner for doing so. Despite this pessimistic outlook, the <sc>Lord wanted Jeremiah to demonstrate his assurance of the future restoration (which has been the topic of the two preceding chapters) by buying a field as a symbolic act that the Israelites would again one day regain possession of their houses, fields, and vineyards (vv. 15, 44). (For other symbolic acts with prophetic import see Jer 13, 19.)</p>
