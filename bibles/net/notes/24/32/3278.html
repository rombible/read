<A NAME="3278"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=1930><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And now therefore thus says the <sc>Lord, the God of Israel, concerning this city which you [masc. pl.] are saying has been given [prophetic perfect = will be given] into the hand of the king of Babylon through sword, starvation, and disease.&#8221; The translation attempts to render the broader structure mentioned in the study note and to break the sentence down in a way that conforms more to contemporary English style and that will lead into the speech which does not begin until the next verse. As in v. 28 the third person introduction has been changed to first person for smoother narrative style in a first person speech (i.e., vv. 27-44 are all the <sc>Lord&#8217;s answer to Jeremiah&#8217;s prayer). The words &#8220;right in&#8221; added to &#8220;are saying&#8221; are intended to reflect the connection between v. 28 and the statement here (which is a repetition of v. 24). I.e., God does not deny that Jeremiah&#8217;s assessment is correct; he affirms it but has something further to say in answer to Jeremiah&#8217;s prayer.</p>
