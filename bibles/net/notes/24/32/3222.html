<A NAME="3222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1874><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I took the deed of purchase, both that which was sealed [and contained] the order and the regulations and that which was open [i.e., unsealed], and I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch&#8230;in the presence of my cousin Hanamel and in the presence of&#8230;and in the presence of&#8230;.&#8221; It is awkward to begin a sentence with &#8220;I took&#8230;&#8221; without finishing the thought, and the long qualifiers in v. 12 make that sentence too long. The sentence is broken up in accordance with contemporary English style. The reference to the &#8220;deed of purchase&#8221; in v. 12 should be viewed as a plural consisting of both written and sealed copies as is clear from v. 11 and also v. 14. Part of the confusion is due to the nature of this document which consisted of a single papyrus scroll, half of which was rolled up and sealed and the other half which was left &#8220;opened&#8221; or unsealed. J. Bright (<i>Jeremiah </i>[AB], 237-38) is probably incorrect in assuming that the copies were duplicate since the qualification &#8220;containing the order of transfer and the regulations&#8221; is only applied to the appositional participle, &#8220;the sealed one [or copy].&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Aramaic documents from a slightly later period help us understand the nature of such deeds. The document consisted of a single papyrus sheet divided in half. One half contained all the particulars and was tightly rolled up, bound with strips of cloth or thread, sealed with wax upon which the parties affixed their seal, and signed by witnesses. The other copy consisted of an abstract and was left loosely rolled and unsealed (i.e., open to be consulted at will). If questions were raised about legality of the contract then the sealed copy could be unsealed and consulted.</p>
