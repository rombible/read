<A NAME="3264"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=1916><b>tn</b> The statements in vv. 28-29 regarding the certain destruction of the city are motivated by three parallel causal clauses in vv. 30a, b, 31, the last of which extends through subordinate and coordinate clauses until the end of v. 35. An attempt has been made to bring out this structure by repeating the idea &#8220;This/it will happen&#8221; in front of each of these causal clauses in the English translation.</p>
