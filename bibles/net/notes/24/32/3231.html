<A NAME="3231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1883><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;to thousands of generations.&#8221; The contrast of showing steadfast love to &#8220;thousands&#8221; to the limitation of punishing the third and fourth generation of children for their parents&#8217; sins in Exod 20:5-6; Deut 5:9-10; Exod 34:7 has suggested to many commentators and translators (cf., e.g., NRSV, TEV, NJPS) that reference here is to &#8220;thousands of generations.&#8221; The statement is, of course, rhetorical emphasizing God&#8217;s great desire to bless as opposed to the reluctant necessity to punish. It is part of the attributes of God spelled out in Exod 34:6-7.</p>
