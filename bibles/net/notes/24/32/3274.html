<A NAME="3274"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=1926><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;They built high places to Baal which are in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to cause their sons and daughters to pass through [the fire] to Molech [a thing] which I did not command them and [which] did not go up into my heart [= &#8220;mind&#8221; in modern psychology] to do this abomination so as to make Judah liable for punishment.&#8221; For the use of the Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1496;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khata</font>&#8217;) to refer to the liability for punishment see BDB s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1496;&#1464;&#1488;</font> Hiph.3 and compare the usage in Deut 24:8. Coming at the end as this does, this nuance is much more likely than &#8220;cause Judah to sin&#8221; which is the normal translation assigned to the verb here. The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿma</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">an</font>) that precedes it is here once again introducing a result and not a purpose (compare other clear examples in 27:10, 15). The sentence has been broken down in conformity to contemporary English style and an attempt has been made to make clear that what is detestable and not commanded is not merely child sacrifice to Molech but child sacrifice in general.</p>
