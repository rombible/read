<A NAME="3253"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1905><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Behold, I am the <sc>Lord, the God of all flesh. Is anything too hard for me?&#8221; The question is rhetorical expecting an emphatic negative answer (cf. E. W. Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, 949, citing the parallel in Gen 18:14). The Hebrew particle &#8220;Behold&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>) introduces the grounds for this rhetorical negative (cf. T. O. Lambdin, <i>Introduction to Biblical Hebrew</i>, 170, §135 [3]), i.e., &#8220;Since I am the <sc>Lord, the God of all mankind, there is indeed nothing too hard for me [or is there anything too hard for me?].&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This statement furnishes the grounds both for the assurance that the city will indeed be delivered over to Nebuchadnezzar (vv. 28-29a) and that it will be restored and repopulated (vv. 37-41). This can be seen from the parallel introductions in vv. 28, &#8220;Therefore the <sc>Lord says&#8221; and &#8220;Now therefore the <sc>Lord says.&#8221; As the creator of all and God of all mankind he has the power and authority to do with his creation what he wishes (cf. Jer 27:5-6).</p>
