<A NAME="3237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1889><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;You did miracles and amazing deeds in the land of Egypt. And you continue to do them until this day both in Israel and among mankind. By this mean you have gained a renown&#8230;&#8221; The translation here follows the syntactical understanding reflected also in NJPS. The Hebrew<i> </i>text reads: &#8220;you did miracles and marvelous acts in the land of Egypt until this day and in Israel and in mankind and you made for yourself a name as this day.&#8221; The majority of English versions and commentaries understand the phrases &#8220;until this day and in Israel and in mankind&#8221; to be an elliptical sentence with the preceding verb and objects supplied as reflected in the alternate translation. However, the emphasis on the miraculous deeds in Egypt in this section both before and after this elliptical phrase and the dominant usage of the terms &#8220;signs and wonders&#8221; to refer to the plagues and other miraculous signs in Egypt calls this interpretation into question. The key here is understanding &#8220;both in Israel and in mankind&#8221; as an example of a <i>casus pendens </i>construction (a dangling subject, object, or other modifier) before a conjunction introducing the main clause (cf. GKC 327 §111.<i>h</i> and 458 §143.<i>d</i> and compare the usage in Jer 6:19; 33:24; 1 Kgs 15:13). This verse is the topic sentence which is developed further in v. 21 and initiates a narrative history of the distant past that continues until v. 22b where reference is made to the long history of disobedience which has led to the present crisis.</p>
