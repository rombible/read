<A NAME="3270"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=1922><b>tn</b> For the idiom involved here see the translator&#8217;s note on 7:13. The verb that introduces this clause is a Piel infinitive absolute which is functioning in place of the finite verb (see, e.g., GKC 346 §113.<i>ff</i> and compare usage in Jer 8:15; 14:19. This grammatical point means that the versions cited in <i>BHS</i> fn a may not be reading a different text after all, but may merely be interpreting the form as syntactically equivalent to a finite verb as the present translation has done.).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This refers to God teaching them through the prophets whom he has sent as indicated by the repeated use of this idiom elsewhere in 7:13, 25; 11:7; 25:3, 4; 26:5, 19.</p>
