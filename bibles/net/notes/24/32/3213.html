<A NAME="3213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1865><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The word of the <sc>Lord came to me, saying.&#8221; This verse resumes the narrative introduction in v. 1 which was interrupted by the long parenthetical note about historical background. There is again some disjunction in the narrative (compare the translator&#8217;s notes on 27:2 and 28:1). What was begun as a biographical (third person) narrative turns into an autobiographical (first person) narrative until v. 26 where the third person is again resumed. Again this betrays the hand of the narrator, Baruch.</p>
