<A NAME="3233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1885><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Nothing is too hard for you who show&#8230;and who punishes&#8230;the great [and] powerful God whose name is Yahweh of armies, [you who are] great in counsel&#8230;whose eyes are open&#8230;who did signs&#8230;&#8221; Jer 32:18-22 is a long series of relative clauses introduced by participles or relative pronouns in vv. 18-20a followed by second person <i>vav</i> consecutive imperfects carrying on the last of these relative clauses in vv. 20b-22. This is typical of hymnic introductions to hymns of praise (cf., e.g., Ps 136) but it is hard to sustain the relative subordination which all goes back to the suffix on &#8220;hard for you.&#8221; The sentences have been broken up but the connection with the end of v. 17 has been sacrificed for conformity to contemporary English style.</p>
