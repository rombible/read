<A NAME="324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1856><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the courtyard of the guarding&#8221; or &#8220;place of guarding.&#8221; This expression occurs only in the book of Jeremiah (32:2, 8, 12; 33:1; 37:21; 38:6, 12, 28; 39:14, 15) and in Neh 3:25. It is not the same as an enclosed prison which is where Jeremiah was initially confined (37:15-16; literally a &#8220;house of imprisoning&#8221; [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bet ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">esur</font>] or &#8220;house of confining&#8221; [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bet hakkele</font>&#8217;]). It is said to have been in the palace compound (32:2) near the citadel or upper palace (Neh 3:25). Though it was a place of confinement (32:2; 33:1; 39:15) Jeremiah was able to receive visitors, e.g., his cousin Hanamel (32:8) and the scribe Baruch (32:12), and conduct business there (32:12). According to 32:12 other Judeans were also housed there. A cistern of one of the royal princes, Malkijah, was located in this courtyard, so this is probably not a &#8220;prison compound&#8221; as NJPS interpret but a courtyard adjacent to a guardhouse or guard post (so G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, T. G. Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52 </i>[WBC],<i> </i>151, and compare Neh 12:39 where reference is made to a Gate of the Guard/Guardhouse) used here for housing political prisoners who did not deserve death or solitary confinement as some of the officials though Jeremiah did.</p>
