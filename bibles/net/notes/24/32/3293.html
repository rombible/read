<A NAME="3293"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">93</span><note=1945><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;They will buy fields with silver and write in the deed and seal [it] and have witnesses witness [it] in the land of Benjamin, in the environs of Jerusalem, in the towns in Judah, in the towns in the hill country, in the towns in the Shephelah, and in the towns in the Negev.&#8221; The long Hebrew sentence has again been restructured to better conform to contemporary English style. The indefinite &#8220;they will buy&#8221; is treated as a passive. It is followed by three infinitive absolutes which substitute for the finite verb (cf. GKC 345 §113.<i>y</i>) which is a common feature of the style of the book of Jeremiah.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> For the geographical districts mentioned here compare Jer 17:26.</p>
