<A NAME="3277"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=1929><b>sn</b> Compare Jer 32:24, 28. In 32:24 this is Jeremiah&#8217;s statement just before he expresses his perplexity about the <sc>Lord&#8217;s command to buy the field of his cousin in spite of the certainty of the city&#8217;s demise. In 32:28 it is the <sc>Lord&#8217;s affirmation that the city will indeed fall. Here, the <sc>Lord picks up Jeremiah&#8217;s assessment only to add a further prophesy (vv. 37-41) of what is just as sure to happen (v. 42). This is the real answer to Jeremiah&#8217;s perplexity. Verses 28-35 are an assurance that the city will indeed be captured and a reiteration again of the reason for its demise. The structure of the two introductions in v. 28 and v. 36 are parallel and flow out of the statement that the <sc>Lord is God of all mankind and nothing is too hard for him (neither destruction nor restoration [cf. 1:10]).</p>
