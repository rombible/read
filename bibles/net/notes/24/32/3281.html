<A NAME="3281"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">81</span><note=1933><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will give to them one heart and one way to [= in order that they may] fear me all the days for good to them.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;one heart&#8221; refers both to unanimity of will and accord (cf. 1 Chr 12:38 [12:39 HT]; 2 Chr 30:12) and to singleness of purpose or intent (cf. Ezek 11:19 and see BDB 525 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1461;&#1500;&#1489;</font> 4 where reference is made to &#8220;inclinations, resolutions, and determinations of the will&#8221;). The phrase &#8220;one way&#8221; refers to one way of life or conduct (cf. BDB 203 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> 6.a where reference is made to moral action and character), a way of life that is further qualified by the goal of showing &#8220;fear, reverence, respect&#8221; for the <sc>Lord. The Hebrew sentence has been broken up to avoid a long complex sentence in English which is contrary to contemporary English style. However, an attempt has been made to preserve all the connections of the original.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Other passages also speak about the &#8220;single-minded purpose&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;one heart&#8221;) and &#8220;living in a way that shows respect for me.&#8221; Deut 30:6-8 speaks of a circumcised heart that will love him, obey him, and keep his commands. Ezek 11:20-21 speaks of the removal of a stony heart and the giving of a single-minded, &#8220;fleshy&#8221; heart and a new spirit that will follow his decrees and keep his laws. Ezek 36:26-27 speaks of the removal of a stony heart and the giving of a new, &#8220;fleshy&#8221; heart and a new spirit and an infusion of God&#8217;s own spirit so that they will be able to follow his decrees and keep his laws. Jer 24:7 speaks of the giving of a (new) heart so that they might &#8220;know&#8221; him. And Jer 31:33 speaks of God writing his law on their hearts. All this shows that there is a new motivation and a new enablement for fulfilling the old stipulations, especially that of whole-hearted devotion to him (cf. Deut 6:4-6).</p>
