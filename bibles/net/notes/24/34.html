<A NAME="342"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1999><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The word which came to Jeremiah from the <sc>Lord while Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms of the earth under the dominion of his hand and all the peoples were fighting against Jerusalem and against all its towns, saying.&#8221; The sentence is obviously too long and the qualifiers obviously too ill-defined to translate literally. This same introductory formula has occurred in 7:1; 11:1; 18:1; 21:1; 30:1; 32:1 but without such a long introductory phrase. It is generally agreed that the phrase &#8220;all the peoples&#8221; should be seen as a parallel term to &#8220;all the kingdoms&#8221; under the qualifying &#8220;under the dominion of his hand/ control&#8221; and what is referred to are contingent forces supplied by these vassal kingdoms and peoples under the terms of their vassal treaties with Nebuchadnezzar. Some of the nature of the make-up of these forces may be seen from a reference to Babylonian, Aramean, Moabite, and Ammonite raiders in the earlier attacks on Jerusalem during the reign of Jehoiakim (2 Kgs 24:2).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> It is difficult to assign dates to passages which have no dating formulas but there is sufficient detail in this passage to show that this incident occurred sometime early in the siege of Jerusalem while Jeremiah was still free to come and go (see v. 2 and compare 37:4 and see the second study note on 32:2). The Babylonian forces blockaded Jerusalem and attacked the outlying cities, reducing them one by one until Jerusalem had no further help. According to v. 7 Azekah and Lachish in the western foothills still held out and there is evidence from some of the correspondence from Lachish at this period that help was being sought from Egypt.</p>
<A NAME="343"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2000><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;told him&#8221;; the referent (Jeremiah) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="344"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2001><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;told him&#8221;; the referent (Jeremiah) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="345"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2002><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> <b>34:1</b> &#8220;The word which came to Jeremiah from the <sc>Lord&#8230;saying, &#8216;Thus says the <sc>Lord God of Israel, &#8220;Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah and say to him, &#8216;Thus says the <sc>Lord, &#8220;I am going to&#8230;.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;&#8217;&#8221; The translation has tried to avoid some of the confusion that is created by embedding quotations within quotations by using indirect quotation in some instances; the conceptualization is the same but the style is simpler.</p>
<A NAME="346"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2003><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Your eyes will see the eyes of the king of Babylon and his mouth will speak with your mouth.&#8221; For this same idiom in reverse order see 32:4 and consult the translator&#8217;s note there for the obligatory nuance given to the verbs.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> For the fulfillment of this see Jer 52:7-11.</p>
<A NAME="347"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2004><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;However, hear the word of the <sc>Lord, Zedekiah king of Judah, &#8216;Thus says the <sc>Lord to you, &#8220;You will not die by the sword.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221; The translation has tried to avoid the complexity created by embedding quotes within quotes and has used the first person address within the <sc>Lord&#8217;s speech as has also been done elsewhere.</p>
<A NAME="348"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2005><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;by the sword.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The contrast is between death in battle or by execution and death in the normal course of life. Zedekiah was captured, had to witness the execution of his sons, had his eyes put out, and was taken to Babylon where he died after a lengthy imprisonment (Jer 52:10-11).</p>
<A NAME="349"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2006><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And like the burning [of incense] for your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so will they burn [incense] for you.&#8221; The sentence has been reversed for easier style and the technical use of the terms interpreted.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> For the custom referred to compare 2 Chr 16:14; 21:19.</p>
<A NAME="3410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2007><b>sn</b> The intent of this oracle may have been to contrast the fate of Zedekiah with that of Jehoiakim who was apparently executed, went unmourned, and was left unburied (contrast Jer 22:18-19).</p>
<A NAME="3411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2008><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;For [or Indeed] I myself have spoken [this] word.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2009><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Oracle of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2010><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah which were left, [namely] against Lachish and Azekah for they alone were left of the cities of Judah as fortified cities.&#8221; The intent of this sentence is to serve as a circumstantial sentence to v. 6 (= &#8220;while the army&#8230;&#8221;). That thought is picked up by &#8220;he did this while&#8230;.&#8221; The long complex sentence in v. 7 has been broken down and qualifying material placed in the proper places to convey the same information in shorter English sentences in conformity with contemporary English style.</p>
<A NAME="3414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2011><b>tn</b> Usually translated &#8220;covenant.&#8221; See the study note on 11:2 for the rationale for the translation here.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> There are no details regarding the nature of this covenant, but it was probably a parity covenant in which the people agreed to free their slaves in exchange for some concessions from the king (see the study note on 11:2 for more details on the nature of ancient Near Eastern covenants). More details about this covenant are given in vv. 15, 18-19 where it is said to have been made before the <sc>Lord in the temple and involved passing between the pieces of a cut-up calf. Hence it involved their swearing an oath invoking the <sc>Lord&#8217;s name (cf. Gen 21:23; 31:51-53; 1 Sam 20:42) and pronouncing self-maledictory curses on themselves calling down on themselves a fate similar to that of the dead calf if they failed to keep it. (This latter practice is illustrated in treaty documents from the ancient Near East and is reflected in the covenant ceremony in Gen 15:8-16.)</p>
<A NAME="3415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2012><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="3416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2013><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;after King Zedekiah made a covenant&#8230;to proclaim liberty to them [the slaves mentioned in the next verse] so that each would send away free his male slave and his female slave, the Hebrew man and the Hebrew woman, so that a man would not hold them in bondage, namely a Judean, his brother [this latter phrase is explicative of &#8220;them&#8221; because it repeats the preposition in front of &#8220;them&#8221;].&#8221; The complex Hebrew syntax has been broken down into shorter English sentences but an attempt has been made to retain the proper subordinations.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Through economic necessity some of the poorer people of the land had on occasion to sell themselves or their children to wealthier Hebrew landowners. The terms of their servitude were strictly regulated under Hebrew law (cf. Exod 21:2-11; Lev 25:39-55; Deut 15:12-18). In brief, no Hebrew was to serve a fellow Hebrew for any longer than six years. In the seventh year he or she was to go free. The period could even be shortened if the year of jubilee intervened since all debts were to be canceled, freedom restored, and indentured property returned in that year. Some see the covenant here coming in conjunction with such a jubilee year since it involved the freedom of all slaves regardless of how long they had served. Others see this covenant as paralleling an old Babylonian practice of a king declaring liberty for slaves and canceling all debts generally at the beginning of his reign (but also at other significant times within it) in order to ingratiate himself with his subjects.</p>
<A NAME="3417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2014><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And they complied, [that is] all the leaders and all the people who entered into the covenant that they would each let his male slave and his female slave go free so as not to hold them in bondage any longer; they complied and they let [them] go.&#8221; The verb &#8220;they complied&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;they hearkened&#8221;) is repeated at the end after the lengthy description of the subject. This is characteristic of Hebrew style. The translation has resolved the complex sentence by making the relative clauses modifying the subject independent sentences describing the situational background before mentioning the main focus, &#8220;they had complied and let them go.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2015><b>sn</b> Most commentators are agreed that the incident referred to here occurred during the period of relief from the siege provided by the Babylonians going off to fight against the Egyptians who were apparently coming to Zedekiah&#8217;s aid (compare vv. 21-22 with 37:5, 7). The freeing of the slaves had occurred earlier, under the crisis of the siege while the people were more responsive to the <sc>Lord due to the threat of destruction (cf. v. 15).</p>
<A NAME="3419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2016><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they had brought them into subjection for male and female slaves.&#8221; However, the qualification of &#8220;male and female&#8221; is already clear from the preceding and is unnecessary to the English sentence.</p>
<A NAME="3420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2017><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And the word of the <sc>Lord came to Jeremiah from the <sc>Lord, saying.&#8221; This is the resumption of the introduction in v. 8 after the lengthy description of the situation that had precipitated the <sc>Lord&#8217;s message to Jeremiah. &#8220;That was when&#8221; is intended to take the reader back to v. 8.</p>
<A NAME="3421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2018><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Thus says the <sc>Lord, the God of Israel, &#8216;&#8230;&#8217;&#8221; The style adopted here has been used to avoid a longer, more complex English sentence.</p>
<A NAME="3422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2019><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fathers&#8221; (also in vv. 14, 15).</p>
<A NAME="3423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2020><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;out of the house of bondage.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This refers to the Mosaic covenant, initiated at Mount Sinai and renewed on the plains of Moab. The statement &#8220;I brought you out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage&#8221; functions as the &#8220;historical prologue&#8221; in the Ten Commandments which is the <sc>Lord&#8217;s vassal treaty with Israel in miniature. (See the study note on 11:2 and see Exod 20:2; Deut 5:6 and Exod 34:8. As such it was a motivating factor in their pledge of loyalty to him. This statement was also invoked within the law itself as a motivation for kindly treatment of slaves including their emancipation (see Deut 15:15).)</p>
<A NAME="3424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2021><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;made a covenant, saying.&#8221; This was only one of several stipulations of the covenant. The form used here has been chosen as an indirect way of relating the specific stipulation that is being focused upon to the general covenant that is referred to in v. 13.</p>
<A NAME="3425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2022><b>sn</b> Compare Deut 15:12-18 for the complete statement of this law. Here only the first part of it is cited.</p>
<A NAME="3426"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2023><b>tn</b> The presence of the independent pronoun in the Hebrew text is intended to contrast their actions with those of their ancestors.</p>
<A NAME="3427"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2024><b>sn</b> This refers to the temple. See Jer 7:10, 11, 14, 30 and see the translator&#8217;s note on 7:10 and the study note on 10:25 for the explanation of the idiom involved here.</p>
<A NAME="3428"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2025><b>sn</b> The verb at the beginning of v. 15 and v. 16 are the same in the Hebrew. They had two changes of heart (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;you turned&#8221;), one that was pleasing to him (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;right in his eyes&#8221;) and one that showed they did not honor him (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;profaned [or belittled] his name&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="3429"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2026><b>sn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you profaned my name.&#8221; His name had been invoked in the oath confirming the covenant. Breaking the covenant involved taking his name in vain (cf. Exod 20:7; Deut 5:11; Jer 5:2). Hence the one who bore the name was not treated with the special honor and reverence due him (see the study note on 23:27 for the significance of &#8220;name&#8221; in the OT).</p>
<A NAME="3430"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2027><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and you brought them into subjection to be to you for male and female slaves.&#8221; See the translator&#8217;s note on v. 11 for the same redundant repetition which is not carried over into the contemporary English sentence.</p>
<A NAME="3431"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2028><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has a compound object, the two terms of which have been synonyms in vv. 14, 15. G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, and T. G. Smothers (<i>Jeremiah 26-52 </i>[WBC],<i> </i>189) make the interesting observation that these two terms (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;brother&#8221; and &#8220;neighbor&#8221;) emphasize the relationships that should have taken precedence over their being viewed as mere slaves.</p>
<A NAME="3432"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2029><b>sn</b> This is, of course, a metaphorical and ironical use of the term &#8220;to grant freedom to.&#8221; It is, however, a typical statement of the concept of talionic justice which is quite often operative in God&#8217;s judgments in the OT (cf., e.g., Obad 15).</p>
<A NAME="3433"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2030><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Oracle of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3434"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2031><b>sn</b> Compare Jer 15:4; 24:9; 29:18.</p>
<A NAME="3435"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2032><b>sn</b> See the study note on v. 8 for explanation and parallels.</p>
<A NAME="3436"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2033><b>tn</b> There is a little confusion in the syntax of this section because the noun &#8220;the calf&#8221; does not have any formal conjunction or preposition with it showing how it relates to the rest of the sentence. KJV treats it and the following words as though they were a temporal clause modifying &#8220;covenant which they made.&#8221; The majority of modern English versions and commentaries, however, understand it as a second accusative after the verb + object &#8220;I will make the men.&#8221; This fits under the category of what GKC 375 §118.<i>r</i> calls an accusative of comparison (compare usage in Isa 21:8; Zech 2:8). Stated baldly, &#8220;I will make the people&#8230;the calf,&#8221; it is, however, more forceful than the formal use of the noun + preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;</font> just as metaphors are generally more forceful than similes. The whole verse is one long, complex sentence in Hebrew: &#8220;I will make the men who broke my covenant [referring to the Mosaic covenant containing the stipulation to free slaves after six years] [and] who did not keep the terms of the covenant which they made before me [referring to their agreement to free their slaves] [like] the calf which they cut in two and passed between its pieces.&#8221; The sentence has been broken down into shorter sentences in conformity with contemporary English style.</p>
<A NAME="3437"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2034><b>tn</b> For the rendering of this term see the translator&#8217;s note on 29:2.</p>
<A NAME="3438"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2035><b>tn</b> This verse is not actually a sentence in the Hebrew original but is a prepositioned object to the verb in v. 20, &#8220;I will hand them over.&#8221; This construction is called <i>casus pendens</i> in the older grammars and is used to call attention to a subject or object (cf. GKC 458 §143.<i>d</i> and compare the usage in 33:24). The same nondescript &#8220;I will punish&#8221; which was used to resolve the complex sentence in the previous verse has been chosen to introduce the objects here before the more specific &#8220;I will hand them over&#8221; in the next verse.</p>
<A NAME="3439"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2036><b>sn</b> See this same phrase in Jer 7:33; 16:4; 19:7.</p>
<A NAME="3440"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=2037><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials I will give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their lives and into the hands of the army of the king of Babylon which has gone up from against them.&#8221; The last two &#8220;and into the hand&#8221; phrases are each giving further explication of &#8220;their enemies&#8221; (the conjunction is explicative [cf. BDB 252 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;</font> 1.b]). The sentence has been broken down into shorter English sentences in conformity with contemporary English style.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This refers to the relief offered by the withdrawal of the Babylonian troops to fight against the Egyptians which were coming to Zedekiah&#8217;s aid (cf. 37:5, 7, 11).</p>
<A NAME="3441"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=2038><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Oracle of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
