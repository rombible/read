<A NAME="501"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2683><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the land of the Chaldeans.&#8221; See the study note on 21:4 for explanation.</p>
<A NAME="502"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2684><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The word which the <sc>Lord spoke concerning Babylon, concerning the land of the Chaldeans by the hand of Jeremiah the prophet.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="503"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2685><b>tn</b> The verbs are masculine plural. Jeremiah is calling on other unnamed messengers to spread the news.</p>
<A NAME="504"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2686><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Raise a signal flag.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="505"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2687><b>sn</b> <i>Bel</i> was originally the name or title applied to the Sumerian storm god. During the height of Babylon&#8217;s power it became a title that was applied to Marduk who was Babylon&#8217;s chief deity. As a title it means &#8220;Lord.&#8221; Here it is a poetical parallel reference to Marduk mentioned in the next line.</p>
<A NAME="506"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2688><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word used here (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">gillulim</font>) is always used as a disdainful reference to idols. It is generally thought to have originally referred to &#8220;dung pellets&#8221; (cf. KBL 183 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>). It is only one of several terms used in this way, such as &#8220;worthless things&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">alilim</font>), &#8220;vanities,&#8221; or &#8220;empty winds&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1458;&#1489;&#1464;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">havalim</font>).</p>
<A NAME="507"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2689><b>tn</b> The verbs here are all in the tense that views the actions as though they were already done (the Hebrew prophetic perfect). The verbs in the next verse are a mixture of prophetic perfects and imperfects which announce future actions.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This refers to the fact that the idols that the Babylonians worshiped will not be able to protect them, but will instead be carried off into exile with the Babylonians themselves (cf. Isa 46:1-2).</p>
<A NAME="508"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2690><b>sn</b> <i>A nation from the north</i> refers to Medo-Persia which at the time of the conquest of Babylon in 539 <sc>b.c. had conquered all the nations to the north, the northwest, and the northeast of Babylon forming a vast empire to the north and east of Babylon. Contingents of these many nations were included in her army and reference is made to them in 50:9 and 51:27-28. There is also some irony involved here because the &#8220;enemy from the north&#8221; referred to so often in Jeremiah (cf. 1:14; 4:6; 6:1) has been identified with Babylon (cf. 25:9). Here in a kind of talionic justice Judah&#8217;s nemesis from the north will be attacked and devastated by an enemy from the north.</p>
<A NAME="509"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2691><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;oracle of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2692><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the children of Israel will come, they and the children of Judah together. They shall go, weeping as they go, and they will seek the <sc>Lord their God.&#8221; The concept of &#8220;seeking&#8221; the <sc>Lord often has to do with seeking the <sc>Lord in worship (by sacrifice [Hos 5:6; 2 Chr 11:16]; prayer [Zech 8:21, 22; 2 Sam 12:16; Isa 65:1; 2 Chr 15:4]). In Hos 7:10 it is in parallel with returning to the <sc>Lord. In Ps 69:6 it is in parallel with hoping in or trusting in the <sc>Lord. Perhaps the most helpful parallels here, however, are Hos 3:5 (in comparison with Jer 30:9) and 2 Chr 15:15 where it is in the context of a covenant commitment to be loyal to the <sc>Lord which is similar to the context here (see the next verse). The translation is admittedly paraphrastic but &#8220;seeking the <sc>Lord&#8221; does not mean here looking for God as though he were merely a person to be found.</p>
<A NAME="5011"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2693><b>tc</b> The translation here assumes that the Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">u</font>; a Qal imperative masculine plural) should be read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">u</font>; a Qal perfect third plural). This reading is presupposed by the Greek version of Aquila, the Latin version, and the Targum (see <i>BHS</i> note a, which mistakenly assumes that the form must be imperfect).</p>
<A NAME="5012"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2694><b>sn</b> See Jer 32:40 and the study note there for the nature of this lasting agreement.</p>
<A NAME="5013"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2695><b>sn</b> The <i>shepherds</i> are the priests, prophets, and leaders who have led Israel into idolatry (2:8).</p>
<A NAME="5014"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2696><b>sn</b> The allusion here, if it is not merely a part of the metaphor of the wandering sheep, is to the worship of the false gods on the high hills (2:20, 3:2).</p>
<A NAME="5015"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2697><b>tn</b> This same Hebrew phrase &#8220;the habitation of righteousness&#8221; is found in Jer 31:23 in relation to Jerusalem in the future as &#8220;the place where righteousness dwells.&#8221; Here, however, it refers to the same entity as &#8220;their resting place&#8221; in v. 6 and means &#8220;true pasture.&#8221; For the meaning of &#8220;pasture&#8221; for the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1493;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">naveh</font>) see 2 Sam 7:8 and especially Isa 65:10 where it is parallel with &#8220;resting place&#8221; for the flocks. For the meaning of &#8220;true&#8221; for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1462;&#1491;&#1462;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsedeq</font>) see BDB 841 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1462;&#1491;&#1462;&#1511;</font> 1. For the interpretation adopted here see G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, T. G. Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52 </i>(WBC),<i> </i>365. The same basic interpretation is reflected in NRSV, NJPS, and God&#8217;s Word.</p>
<A NAME="5016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2698><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fathers.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5017"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2699><b>sn</b> These two verses appear to be a poetical summary of the argument of Jer 2 where the nation is accused of abandoning its loyalty to God and worshiping idols. Whereas those who tried to devour Israel were liable for punishment when Israel was loyal to God (2:3), the enemies of Israel who destroyed them (i.e., the Babylonians [but also the Assyrians], 50:17) argue that they are not liable for punishment because the Israelites have sinned against the <sc>Lord and thus deserve their fate.</p>
<A NAME="5018"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2700><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;People of Judah&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text but are implicit from the context. They have been supplied in the translation to clarify the subject of the address.</p>

<A NAME="5021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2703><b>sn</b> Some of these are named in Jer 51:27-28.</p>
<A NAME="5022"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2704><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;She will be captured from there (i.e., from the north).&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="5027"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2709><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;People of Babylonia&#8221; are not in the text but they are implicit in the reference in the next verse to &#8220;your mother&#8221; which refers to the city and the land as the mother of its people. These words have been supplied in the translation to identify the referent of &#8220;you&#8221; and have been added for clarity.</p>

This variant reading is also accepted by J. Bright, J. A. Thompson, F. B. Huey, and G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, T. G. Smothers.</p>
<A NAME="5030"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2712><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Though you rejoice, though you exult, you who have plundered my heritage, though you frolic like calves in a pasture and neigh like stallions, your mother&#8230;&#8221; The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) introduces a concessive protasis according to BDB 473 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 2.c(a). Many interpret the particle as introducing the grounds for the next verse, i.e., &#8220;because&#8230;&#8221; The translation here will reflect the concessive by beginning the next verse with &#8220;But.&#8221; The long protasis has been broken up and restructured to better conform with contemporary English style.</p>
<A NAME="5031"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2713><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Your mother will be utterly shamed, the one who gave you birth&#8230;&#8221; The word &#8220;mother&#8221; and the parallel term &#8220;the one who gave you birth&#8221; are used metaphorically for the land of Babylonia. For the figure compare the usage in Isa 50:1 (Judah) and Hos 2:2, 5 (2:4, 7 HT) and see BDB 52 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1501;</font> 2 and 408 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1491;</font> Qal.2.c.</p>

<A NAME="5036"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2718><b>tc</b> The verb here should probably be read as a Qal imperative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿru</font>) from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yarah</font>) with a few Hebrew <sc>mss rather than a Qal imperative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yidu</font>) from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yadah</font>) with the majority of Hebrew <sc>mss. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yadah</font>) does not otherwise occur in the Qal and only elsewhere in the Piel with a meaning &#8220;cast&#8221; (cf. KBL 363 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font>). The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yarah</font>) is common in both the Qal and the Hiphil with the meaning of shooting arrows (cf. BDB 435 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> Qal.3 and Hiph.2). The confusion between <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dalet</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">resh</font>) is very common.</p>
<A NAME="5037"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2719><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Shoot at her! Don&#8217;t save any arrows!&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5038"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2720><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;She has given her hand.&#8221; For the idiom here involving submission/surrender see BDB 680 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1503;</font> Qal.1.z and compare the usage in 1 Chr 29:24; 2 Chr 30:8. For a different interpretation, however, see the rather complete discussion in G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, and T. G. Smothers (<i>Jeremiah 26-52 </i>[WBC],<i> </i>366) who see this as a reference to making a covenant. The verb in this line and the next two lines are all Hebrew perfects and most translators and commentaries see them as past. God&#8217;s Word, however, treats them as prophetic perfects and translates them as future. This is more likely in the light of the imperatives both before and after.</p>
<A NAME="5039"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2721><b>tn</b> The meaning of this word is uncertain. The definition here follows that of <i>HALOT</i> 91 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, which defines it on the basis of an Akkadian word and treats it as a loanword.</p>
<A NAME="5040"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=2722><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Because it is the <sc>Lord&#8217;s vengeance.&#8221; The first person has again been used because the <sc>Lord is the speaker and the nominal expression has been turned into a verbal one more in keeping with contemporary English style.</p>
<A NAME="5041"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=2723><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Cut off the sower from Babylon, and the one who wields the sickle at harvest time.&#8221; For the meaning &#8220;kill&#8221; for the root &#8220;cut off&#8221; see BDB 503 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1514;</font> Qal.1.b and compare usage in Jer 11:19.

Here it refers most likely to foreigners who are counseled to leave Babylon before they are caught up in the destruction. Many of the commentaries and English versions render the verbs as futures but they are more likely third person commands (jussives). Compare the clear commands in v. 8 followed by essentially the same motivation. The &#8220;sword of the oppressor,&#8221; of course, refers to death at the hands of soldiers wielding all kinds of weapons, chief of which has been a reference to the bow (v. 14).</p>
<A NAME="5043"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2725><b>sn</b> <i>The king of Assyria devoured them</i>.

If on the other hand, the prophecy related there refers to something less than this final form, the destruction of 587/6 <sc>b.c. could be referred to as well.</p>

The same word appears in conjunction with the word for &#8220;diviners&#8221; in Isa 44:25 and probably also in Hos 11:6 in conjunction with the sword consuming them &#8220;because of their counsel.&#8221; BDB 95 s.v. III <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1491;</font> b sees this as a substitution of &#8220;empty talk&#8221; for &#8220;empty talkers&#8221; (the figure of metonymy) and refer to them as false prophets. KBL 108 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1491;</font> emends the form in both places to read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">barim</font>) in place of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">baddim</font>) and defines the word on the basis of Akkadian to mean &#8220;soothsayer&#8221; (KBL 146 s.v. V <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;</font>). <i>HALOT</i> 105 s.v. V <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1491;</font> retains the pointing, derives it from an Amorite word found in the Mari letters, and defines it as &#8220;oracle priest.&#8221; However, G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, and T. G. Smothers (<i>Jeremiah 26-52 </i>[WBC],<i> </i>368) call this identification into question because the word only occurs in one letter from Mari and its meaning is uncertain there. It is hazardous to emend the text in two places, perhaps even three, in light of no textual evidence in any of the passages and to define the word on the basis of an uncertain parallel. Hence the present translation opts here for the derivation and extended definition given in BDB.</p>
<A NAME="5093"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">93</span><note=2775><b>tn</b> This translation follows the suggestion of BDB 383 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;</font> Niph.2. Compare the usage in Isa 19:13 and Jer 5:4.</p>
<A NAME="5094"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">94</span><note=2776><b>tn</b> The verb here (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khatat</font>) could also be rendered &#8220;be destroyed&#8221; (cf. BDB 369 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1514;</font> Qal.1 and compare the usage in Jer 48:20, 39). However, the parallelism with &#8220;shown to be fools&#8221; argues for the more dominant usage of &#8220;be dismayed&#8221; or &#8220;be filled with terror.&#8221; The verb is found in parallelism with both <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bosh</font>, &#8220;be ashamed, dismayed&#8221;) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1512;&#1461;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yare</font>&#8217;, &#8220;be afraid&#8221;) and can refer to either emotion. Here it is more likely that they are filled with terror because of the approaching armies.</p>
<A NAME="5095"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">95</span><note=2777><b>tn</b> Hebrew has &#8220;his&#8221; in both cases here whereas the rest of the possessive pronouns throughout vv. 35-37 are &#8220;her.&#8221; There is no explanation for this switch unless the third masculine singular refers as a distributive singular to the soldiers mentioned in the preceding verse (cf. GKC 464 §145.<i>l</i>). This is probably the case here, but to refer to &#8220;their horses and their chariots&#8221; in the midst of all the &#8220;her&#8230;&#8221; might create more confusion than what it is worth to be that pedantic.</p>
<A NAME="5096"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">96</span><note=2778><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;in the country,&#8221; or &#8220;in her armies&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in her midst.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5097"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">97</span><note=2779><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;A sword against his horses and his chariots and against all the mixed company [or mixed multitude] in her midst and they will become like women.&#8221; The sentence had to be split up because it is too long and the continuation of the second half with its consequential statement would not fit together with the first half very well. Hence the subject and verb have been repeated. The Hebrew word translated &#8220;foreign troops&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489;</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">erev</font>) is the same word that is used in 25:20 to refer to the foreign peoples living in Egypt and in Exod 12:38 for the foreign people that accompanied Israel out of Egypt. Here the word is translated contextually to refer to foreign mercenaries, an identification that most of the commentaries and many of the modern English versions accept (see, e.g., J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah </i>[AB], 355; NRSV; NIV). The significance of the simile &#8220;they will become like women&#8221; has been spelled out for the sake of clarity.</p>
<A NAME="5098"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">98</span><note=2780><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a drought against her waters and they will dry up.&#8221; Several of the commentaries and modern English versions accept the emendation proposed by <i>BHS</i> and read here &#8220;sword&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489;</font> [<font face="Scholar">kherev</font>] in place of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489;</font> [<font face="Scholar">khorev</font>], the change of only one vowel) in keeping with the rest of the context. According to <i>BHS</i> this reading is supported by the Lucianic and Hexaplaric recensions of the LXX (the Greek version) and the Syriac version. In this case the drying up of the waters (of the canals) is attributed to neglect brought about by war conditions. However, it is just as likely that these versions are influenced by the repetition of the word &#8220;sword&#8221; as the Hebrew and the other versions are influenced by the concept of &#8220;drying up&#8221; of the waters to read &#8220;drought.&#8221; Hence the present translation, along with the majority of modern English versions, retains the Hebrew &#8220;drought.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5099"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">99</span><note=2781><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for it is a land of idols.&#8221; The &#8220;for,&#8221; however, goes back to the whole context not just to the preceding prediction (cf. BDB 473-74 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 1.c and compare usage in Isa 21:6 listed there).</p>
<A NAME="50100"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">100</span><note=2782><b>tc</b> Or &#8220;Her people boast in.&#8221; This translation is based on the reading of the majority of Hebrew <sc>mss which read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1492;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yitholalu</font>; cf. usage in Jer 46:9 and see also 25:16; 51:7). Two Hebrew <sc>mss and the versions read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yithallalu</font>; cf. usage in Jer 4:2; 9:23, 24 and Ps 97:7 where a parallel expression is found with &#8220;idols&#8221;). The reading is again basically the difference in one Hebrew vowel. All of the modern commentaries consulted and all the modern English versions except NEB, REB follow the Hebrew text here rather than the versions.</p>
<A NAME="50101"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">101</span><note=2783><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;by the terrors.&#8221; However, as <i>HALOT</i> 40 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> indicates these are &#8220;images that cause terror&#8221; (a substitution of the effect for the cause). The translation of this line follows the interpretation of the majority of modern English versions and all the commentaries consulted. NIV, NCV, and God&#8217;s Word reflect a different syntax, understanding the subject to be the idols just mentioned rather than &#8220;her people&#8221; which is supplied here for the sake of clarity (the Hebrew text merely says &#8220;they.&#8221;) Following that lead, one could render &#8220;but those idols will go mad with terror.&#8221; This makes excellent sense in the context which often refers to effects (vv. 36b, d, 37c, 38b) of the war that is coming. However, that interpretation does not fit as well with the following &#8220;therefore/so,&#8221; which basically introduces a judgment or consequence after an accusation of sin.</p>
<A NAME="50102"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">102</span><note=2784><b>tn</b> The identification of this bird has been called into question by G. R. Driver, &#8220;Birds in the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>PEQ </i>87 (1955): 137-38. He refers to this bird as an owl. That identification, however, is not reflected in any of the lexicons including the most recent, which still gives &#8220;ostrich&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 402 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font>) as does W. S. McCullough, &#8220;Ostrich,&#8221; <i>IDB</i> 3:611. REB, NIV, NCV, and God&#8217;s Word all identify this bird as &#8220;owl/desert owl.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="50103"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">103</span><note=2785><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Therefore desert creatures will live with jackals and ostriches will live in it.&#8221;</p>

Since the first half of the verse has spoken of animals living there, it is necessary to add &#8220;people&#8221; and turn the passive verbs into active ones.</p>
<A NAME="50105"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">105</span><note=2787><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;&#8216;Like [when] God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighboring towns,&#8217; oracle of the <sc>Lord, &#8216;no man will live there.&#8217;&#8221; The <sc>Lord is speaking so the first person has been substituted for &#8220;God.&#8221; The sentence has again been broken up to better conform with contemporary English style.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Compare Jer 49:18 where the same prophecy is applied to Edom.</p>

<A NAME="50110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">110</span><note=2792><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The king of Babylon hears report of them and his hands hang limp.&#8221; The verbs are translated as future because the passage is prophetic and the verbs may be interpreted as prophetic perfects (the action viewed as if it were as good as done). In the parallel passage in 6:24 the verbs could be understood as present perfects because the passage could be viewed as in the present. Here it is future.</p>
<A NAME="50111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">111</span><note=2793><b>sn</b> Compare Jer 6:22-24 where almost the same exact words as 50:41-43 are applied to the people of Judah. The repetition of prophecies here and in the following verses emphasizes the talionic nature of God&#8217;s punishment of Babylon; as they have done to others, so it will be done to them (cf. 25:14; 50:15).</p>
<A NAME="50112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">112</span><note=2794><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;of Babylonia&#8221; are not in the text but are implicit from the context. They have been supplied in the translation to clarify the referent.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The verbs in vv. 22-25 are all descriptive of the present, but all of this is really to take place in the future. Hebrew poetry has a way of rendering future actions as though they were already accomplished. The poetry of this section makes it difficult, however, to render the verbs as future as the present translation has regularly done.</p>
<A NAME="50113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">113</span><note=2795><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;among the nations.&#8221; With the exception of this phrase, the different verb in v. 46a, the absence of a suffix on the word for &#8220;land&#8221; in v. 45d, the third plural suffix instead of the third singular suffix on the verb for &#8220;chase&#8230;off of,&#8221; this passage is identical with 49:19-21 with the replacement of Babylon or the land of the Chaldeans for Edom. For the translation notes explaining the details of the translation here see the translator&#8217;s notes on 49:19-21.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This passage is virtually identical with Jer 49:19-21 with the replacement of Babylon, land of Babylonia for Edom. As God used Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians to destroy Edom, so he would use Cyrus and the Medes and Persians and their allies to destroy Babylon (cf. 25:13, 14). As Nebuchadnezzar was God&#8217;s servant to whom all would be subject (25:9; 27:6), so Cyrus is called in Isaiah &#8220;his anointed one,&#8221; i.e., his chosen king whom he will use to shatter other nations and set Israel free (Isa 45:1-4).</p>
