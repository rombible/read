<A NAME="4818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2538><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The valley will be destroyed and the tableland be laid waste.&#8221; However, in the context this surely refers to the towns and not to the valley and the tableland itself.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Most commentaries see a reference to the towns in the Jordan valley referred to in Josh 13:27 and the towns mentioned in Josh 13:15-17 which were on the high tableland or high plateau or plain north of the Arnon. The mention of the towns in the first half of the verse is broader than that because it would include all the towns in the southern half of Moab between the Arnon and Zered as well as those mentioned in the second half in conjunction with the valley and the high plateau north of the Arnon.</p>
