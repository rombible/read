<A NAME="4870"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=2590><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;of those noisy boasters.&#8221; Or &#8220;They will burn up the frontiers of Moab. They will burn up the mountain heights of those war-loving people.&#8221; The meaning of this verse is not entirely certain because of the highly figurative nature of the last two lines. The Hebrew text has been translated somewhat literally here. The Hebrew text reads: &#8220;In the shadow of Heshbon those fleeing stand without strength. For a fire goes forth from Heshbon, a flame from the midst of Sihon. And it devours the forehead of Moab and the skull of the sons of noise.&#8221; The meaning of the first part is fairly clear because v. 2 has already spoken of the conquest of Heshbon and a plot formed there to conquer the rest of the nation. The fire going forth from Heshbon would hence refer here to the conflagrations of war spreading from Heshbon to the rest of the country. The reference to the &#8220;midst of Sihon&#8221; is to be understood metonymically as a reference for the ruler to what he once ruled (cf. E. W. Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, 583). The last two lines must refer to more than the fugitives who stopped at Heshbon for protection because it refers to the forehead of Moab (a personification of the whole land or nation). It is unclear, however, why reference is made to the foreheads and skulls of the Moabites, other than the fact that this verse seems to be a readaptation or reuse of Num 24:17 where the verb used with them is &#8220;smite&#8221; which fits nicely in the sense of martial destruction. Translated rather literally, it appears here to refer to the destruction by the fires of war of the Moabites, the part (forehead and skulls) put for the whole. TEV sees a reference here to the &#8220;frontiers&#8221; and &#8220;mountain heights&#8221; of Moab and this would work nicely for &#8220;foreheads&#8221; which is elsewhere used of the corner or border of a land in Neh 9:22. The word &#8220;crown&#8221; or &#8220;skull&#8221; might be a picturesque metaphor for the mountain heights of a land, but the word is never used elsewhere in such a figurative way. TEV (and CEV) which follows it might be correct here but there is no way to validate it. The meaning &#8220;war-loving people&#8221; for the phrase &#8220;sons of noise&#8221; is based on the suggestion of BDB 981 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> 1 which relates the phrase to the dominant use for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">on</font>) and is adopted also by TEV, CEV, and C. von Orelli, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 341. REB &#8220;braggarts&#8221; and NIV &#8220;noisy boasters&#8221; seem to base the nuance on the usage of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">on</font>) in Jer 46:17 where Pharaoh is referred to as an empty noise and the reference to Moab&#8217;s arrogance and boasting in 48:29.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This verse and the next are an apparent adaptation and reuse of a victory song in Num 21:28-29 and a prophecy in Num 24:17. That explains the reference to Sihon who was the Amorite king who captured Heshbon and proceeded from there to capture most of northern Moab (the area between Heshbon and the Arnon) which has been referred to earlier in this prophecy. This prophecy appears to speak of the destruction of Moab beginning from the same place under the picture of a destructive fire which burns up all the people. The fire is a reference to the conflagrations of war in which the enemy captures the cities and sets them on fire and burns all the people in them. What Sihon once did (Num 21:28-29) and what Balaam prophesied would happen to Moab in the future (by David? Num 24:17) are being reapplied to a new situation.</p>
