<A NAME="4825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2545><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Moab will be ashamed because of Chemosh as the house of Israel was ashamed because of Bethel, their [source of] confidence.&#8221; The &#8220;shame&#8221; is, of course, the disappointment, disillusionment because of the lack of help from these gods in which they trusted (for this nuance of the verb see BDB 101 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;</font> Qal.2 and compare usage in Jer 2:13; Isa 20:5). Because of the parallelism, some see the reference to Bethel to be a reference to a West Semitic god worshiped by the people of Israel (see J. P. Hyatt, &#8220;Bethel [Deity],&#8221; <i>IDB</i> 1:390 for the arguments). However, there is no evidence in the OT that such a god was worshiped in Israel, and there is legitimate evidence that northern Israel placed its confidence in the calf god that Jeroboam set up in Bethel (cf. 1 Kgs 12:28-32; Hos 10:5; 8:5-6; Amos 7:10-17).</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map4-G4; Map5-C1; Map6-E3; Map7-D1; Map8-G3.</p>
