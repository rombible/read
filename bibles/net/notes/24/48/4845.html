<A NAME="4845"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=2565><b>tn</b> The meaning of this verse is somewhat uncertain: <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I know, oracle of the <sc>Lord,/ his arrogance and [that it is?] not true; // his boastings accomplish that which is not true.&#8221; Several of the modern English versions and commentaries redivide the verse and read something like, &#8220;I know his insolence&#8230;his boastings are false; his deeds are false (NRSV, REB).&#8221; However, the word translated &#8220;deeds&#8221; in the last line is a verb in the third person plural and can only have as its logical grammatical subject the word &#8220;boastings.&#8221; The adjective <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ken</font>) + the negative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;) is evidently repeated here and applied to two different subjects &#8220;arrogance&#8221; and &#8220;boasting&#8221; to emphasize that Moab&#8217;s arrogant boasts will prove &#8220;untrue&#8221; (Cf. <i>HALOT</i> 459 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503;</font> 2.c for the meaning &#8220;untrue&#8221; for both this passage and the parallel one in Isa 16:6). There is some difference of opinion about the identification of the &#8220;I&#8221; in this verse. Most commentators see it as referring to the prophet. However, F. B. Huey (<i>Jeremiah, Lamentations </i>[NAC], 395) is probably correct in seeing it as referring to the <sc>Lord. He points to the fact that the &#8220;I&#8221; in vv. 33, 35, 38 can only refer to God. The &#8220;I know&#8221; in v. 30 also clearly has the <sc>Lord as its subject. There are other cases in the book of Jeremiah where the <sc>Lord expresses his lament over the fate of a people (cf. 14:1-6, 17-18).</p>
