<A NAME="4813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2533><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Indeed her fugitives will&#8230;&#8221; It is unclear what the subject of the verbs are in this verse. The verb in the first two lines &#8220;climb&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1462;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aleh</font>) is third masculine singular and the verb in the second two lines &#8220;will hear&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1461;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shame</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">u</font>) is third common plural. The causal particles at the beginning of the two halves of the verse suggest some connection with the preceding, so the translation assumes that the children are still the subject. In this case the singular verb would be a case of the distributive singular already referred to in the translator&#8217;s note on 46:15. The parallel passage in Isa 15:5 refers to the &#8220;fugitives&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1462;&#1492;&#1464;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bÿrikheha</font>) with the same singular verb as here and that may be the implied subject here.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The location of <i>Luhith</i> and <i>Horonaim</i> are uncertain, though, from their connection with Zoar in Isa 15:5, they appear to be located in southern Moab. Zoar was at the southern tip of the Dead Sea.</p>
