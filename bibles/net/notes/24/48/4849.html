<A NAME="4849"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=2569><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;reached the sea of Jazer.&#8221; The Sea is generally taken to be a reference to the Dead Sea. The translation presupposes that the word &#8220;sea&#8221; is to be omitted before &#8220;Jazer.&#8221; The word is missing from two Hebrew <sc>mss, from the parallel passage in Isa 16:8, and from the Greek version. It may have arisen from a mistaken copying of the same word in the preceding line.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Though there is some doubt about the precise location of these places, <i>Sibmah</i> is generally considered to have been located slightly north and west of Heshbon and <i>Jazer</i> further north toward the border of Ammon not far from the city of Amman. Most commentators see the reference here (and in the parallel in Isa 16:8) to the spread of viticulture westward and northward from the vineyards of Sibmah. G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, and T. G. Smothers (<i>Jeremiah 26-52 </i>[WBC],<i> </i>318-19), however, see the reference rather to the spread of trade in wine westward beyond the coast of the Mediterranean and eastward into the desert.</p>
