<A NAME="4812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2532><b>tc</b> The reading here follows the <i>Qere</i> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1456;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1462;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ireha</font>) which is the same noun found in Jer 14:3 in the sense of &#8220;servants.&#8221; Here it refers to the young ones, i.e., the children (cf. the use of the adjective BDB 859 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font> 2 and see Gen 43:33). Many of the modern commentaries and a few of the modern English versions follow the Greek version and read &#8220;their cry is heard as far as Zoar&#8221; (reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1465;&#1506;&#1458;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tso</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arah</font>; see, for example, J. A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah </i>[NICOT], 699, n. 4, and BDB 858 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1465;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</font>). However, that leaves the verb with an indefinite subject (the verb is active 3rd plural not passive) not otherwise identified in the preceding context. Many of the modern English versions such as NRSV, NJPS, NIV retain the Hebrew as the present translation has done. In this case the masculine plural noun furnishes a logical subject for the verb.</p>
