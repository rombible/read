<A NAME="4815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2535><b>tc</b> The meaning of this line is uncertain. The translation follows one reading of the Hebrew text. The Greek version reads &#8220;Be like a wild donkey in the desert!&#8221; There are three points of debate in this line: the syntax of the verb form &#8220;be&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1497;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tihyenah</font>) and the text and meaning of the word translated &#8220;shrub&#8221; in the Hebrew text. This word only occurs with this meaning here and in Jer 17:6. A related word occurs in Ps 102:17 (102:18 HT). Elsewhere this spelling refers to the place name Aroer which was a place in Moab on the edge of the Arnon River. Most commentators do not feel that a reference to that place is appropriate here because it was not in the desert. The Greek version reads &#8220;like a wild donkey&#8221; (reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</font> [<font face="Scholar">kÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arod</font>] in place of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1506;&#1461;&#1512;</font> [<font face="Scholar">ka</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aro</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">er</font>]). That would make an appropriate simile here because the wild donkey enjoys its freedom and is hard to capture. G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, and T. G. Smothers (<i>Jeremiah 26-52 </i>[WBC],<i> </i>312) explain the simile of the &#8220;shrub&#8221; as referring to the marginal and rudimentary existence of a displaced person. That may not be as optimistic as the reference to the wild donkey but it does give an appropriate meaning. The third feminine plural has been explained as the singular noun + suffix = &#8220;yourselves&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1462;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nafshÿkhem</font>) used as a collective (so S. R. Driver, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 368, with cross reference to GKC 462-63 §145.<i>c</i>). J. Bright (<i>Jeremiah </i>[AB], 314, n. e-e) follows a suggestion of D. N. Freedman in seeing the form (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1497;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tihyenah</font>) as a mistake for the 2nd masculine plural plus energic (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tihyun</font>). Given the number of other textual corruptions in this passage, this is possible. The resultant meaning in either case is the same.</p>
