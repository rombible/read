<A NAME="483"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2523><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Woe to Nebo for it is destroyed.&#8221; For the use of the Hebrew particle &#8220;Woe&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hoy</font>) see the translator&#8217;s note on 22:13. The translation has taken this form because the phrase &#8220;Woe to&#8221; probably does not convey the proper meaning or significance to the modern reader. The verbs again are in the tense (Hebrew prophetic perfect) that views the action as if it were as good as done. The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) probably is causal but the asseverative works better in the modified translation.</p>
