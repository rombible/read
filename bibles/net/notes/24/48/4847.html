<A NAME="4847"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=2567><b>tc</b> Or &#8220;I will weep for the grapevines of Sibmah more than I will weep over the town of Jazer.&#8221; The translation here assumes that there has been a graphic confusion of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mem</font>) with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kaf</font>) or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet</font>). The parallel passage in Isa 16:9 has the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font> and the Greek version presupposes a comparative idea &#8220;as with.&#8221; Many of the modern English versions render the passage with the comparative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">min</font>) as in the alternate translation, but it is unclear what the force of the comparison would be here. The verse is actually in the second person, an apostrophe or direct address to the grapevine(s) of Sibmah. However, the translation has retained the third person throughout because such sudden shifts in person are uncommon in contemporary English literature and retaining the third person is smoother. The Hebrew text reads: &#8220;From/With the weeping of Jazer I will weep for you, vine of Sibmah. Your tendrils crossed over the sea. They reached unto the sea of Jazer. Upon your summer fruit and your vintage [grape harvest] the destroyer has fallen.&#8221;</p>
