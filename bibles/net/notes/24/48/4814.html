<A NAME="4814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2534><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the distresses of the cry of destruction.&#8221; Many commentaries want to leave out the word &#8220;distresses&#8221; because it is missing from the Greek version and the parallel passage in Isa 15:5. However, it is in all the Hebrew <sc>mss and in the other early versions, and it is hard to see why it would be added here if it were not original.</p>
