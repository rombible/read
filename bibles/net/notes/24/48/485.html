<A NAME="485"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2525><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Misgab.&#8221; The translation here follows the majority of commentaries and English versions. Only REB sees this as a place name, &#8220;Misgab,&#8221; which is otherwise unknown. The constant use of this word to refer to a fortress, the presence of the article on the front of it, and the lack of any reference to a place of this name anywhere else argues against it being a place name. However, the fact that the verbs that accompany it are feminine while the noun for &#8220;fortress&#8221; is masculine causes some pause.</p>
