<A NAME="4816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2536><b>sn</b> <i>Chemosh</i> was the national god of Moab (see also Numb 21:29). Child sacrifice appears to have been a part of his worship (2 Kgs 3:27). Solomon built a high place in Jerusalem for him (1 Kgs 11:7), and he appears to have been worshiped in Israel until Josiah tore that high place down (2 Kgs 23:13).</p>
