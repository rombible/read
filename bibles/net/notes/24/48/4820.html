<A NAME="4820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2540><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Scatter salt over Moab for it will certainly be laid in ruins.&#8221; The meaning of these two lines is very uncertain. The Hebrew of these two lines presents several difficulties. It reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1509; &#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1489; &#1504;&#1464;&#1510;&#1465;&#1488; &#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1510;&#1461;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tÿnu-tsits lÿmo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">av natso</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> tetse</font>&#8217;). Of the five words two are extremely problematic and the meaning of the second affects also the meaning of the last word which normally means &#8220;go out.&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsits</font>) regularly refers to a blossom or flower or the diadem on the front of Aaron&#8217;s mitre. BDB 851 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1509;</font> gives a nuance &#8220;wings (coll)&#8221; based on the interpretation of Abu Walid and some medieval Jewish interpreters who related it to an Aramaic root. But BDB says that meaning is dubious and refers to the Greek which reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#951;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">shmeia</font>, &#8220;sign&#8221; or &#8220;sign post&#8221;). Along with KBL 802 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1509;</font> and <i>HALOT</i> 959 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1509;</font>, BDB suggests that the Greek presupposes the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsiyyun</font>) which refers to a road marker (Jer 31:21) or a gravestone (2 Kgs 23:17). That is the meaning followed here. Several modern commentaries and English versions have followed a proposal by W. Moran that the word is related to a Ugaritic word meaning salt (cf., e.g., J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah </i>[AB], 320). However, <i>HALOT</i> 959 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1509;</font> questions the validity of this on philological grounds saying that the meaning of salt does not really fit the Ugaritic either. The present translation follows the suggestions of the lexicons here and reads the word as though the Greek supported the meaning &#8220;gravestone.&#8221; The other difficulty is with the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1510;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">natso</font>&#8217;), which looks like a Qal infinitive absolute of an otherwise unattested root which BDB s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font> says is defined in Gesenius&#8217; Thesaurus as &#8220;fly.&#8221; However, see the meaning and the construction of an infinitive absolute of one root with that of another as highly improbable. Hence, most modern lexicons either emend the forms to read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1510;&#1465;&#1492; &#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">natsoh titseh</font>) from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">natsah</font>) meaning &#8220;to fall into ruins&#8221; (so KBL 629 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1492;</font> Qal, and see among others J. A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah </i>[NICOT], 700, n. 10, who notes that final <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> [<font face="Scholar">aleph</font>] and final <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">hey</font>] are often confused; see the discussion and examples in GKC 216-17 §75.<i>nn</i>-<i>rr</i>). This is the option that this translation as well as a number of modern ones have taken. A second option is to see <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1510;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">natso</font>&#8217;) as an error for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatso</font>&#8217;) and read the text in the sense of &#8220;she will certainly surrender,&#8221; a meaning that the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatsa</font>&#8217;) has in 1 Sam 11:3; Isa 36:6. The best discussion of this option as well as a discussion on the problem of reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsits</font>) as salt is found in G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, T. G. Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52 </i>(WBC),<i> </i>313-14.</p>
