<A NAME="4854"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=2574><b>tn</b> The meaning of this verse is very uncertain. The ambiguity of the syntax and the apparent elliptical nature of this text makes the meaning of this verse uncertain. The Hebrew text reads: &#8220;From the cry of Heshbon unto Elealeh unto Jahaz they utter their voice from Zoar unto Horonaim Eglath Shelishiyah.&#8221; The translation and interpretation here are based on interpreting the elliptical syntax here by the parallel passage in Isaiah 15:4-6 where cries of anguish rise from Heshbon and Elealeh which are heard all the way to Jahaz. The people flee southward arriving at Zoar and Eglath Shelishiyah where they voice the news of the destruction in the north. Hence, the present translation interprets the phrase &#8220;from the cry of Heshbon unto Elealeh&#8221; to be parallel to &#8220;Heshbon and Elealeh cry out&#8221; and take the preposition &#8220;from&#8221; with the verb &#8220;they utter their voice,&#8221; i.e., with the cry of Heshbon and Elealeh. The impersonal &#8220;they raise their voice&#8221; is then treated as a passive and made the subject of the whole verse. There is some debate about the identification of the waters of Nimrim. They may refer to the waters of the Wadi Nimrim which enters the Jordan about eight miles north of the Dead Sea or those of the Wadi en-Numeirah which flows into the southern tip of the Dead Sea from about ten miles south. Most commentators take the reference to be the latter because of association with Zoar. However, if the passage is talking about the destruction in the north which is reported in the south by the fleeing refugees, the reference is probably to the Wadi Nimrim in the north.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Elealeh</i> was about two miles (3.3 km) north of Heshbon. Jahaz was about twenty miles (33 km) south of it. These three cities were in the north and <i>Zoar</i>, <i>Horonaim</i>, and <i>Eglath Shelishiyah</i> were apparently in the south. The verse is speaking about the news of destruction in the north spreading to the south. Comparison should be made with the parallel passage in Isa 15:4-6.</p>
