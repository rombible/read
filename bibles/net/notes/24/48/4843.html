<A NAME="4843"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2563><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;We have heard of the pride of Moab &#8211; [he is] exceedingly proud &#8211; of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his haughtiness, and the loftiness of his heart.&#8221; These words are essentially all synonyms, three of them coming from the same Hebrew root (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ga</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>) and one of the words being used twice (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font>). Since the first person singular is used in the next verse, the present translation considers the &#8220;we&#8221; of this verse to refer to the plural of majesty or the plural referring to the divine council in such passages as Gen 1:26; 3:22; 11:7; Isa 6:8 and has translated in the singular to avoid possible confusion of who the &#8220;we&#8221; are. Most understand the reference to be to Jeremiah and his fellow Judeans.</p>
