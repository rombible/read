<A NAME="4860"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=2580><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Behold! Like an eagle he will swoop and will spread his wings against Moab.&#8221; The sentence has been reordered in English to give a better logical flow and the unidentified &#8220;he&#8221; has been identified as &#8220;a nation.&#8221; The nation is, of course, Babylon, but it is nowhere identified so the referent has been left ambiguous.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Conquering nations are often identified with a swiftly flying eagle swooping down on its victims (cf. Deut 28:49). In this case the eagle is to be identified with the nation (or king) of Babylon (cf. Ezek 17:3, 12 where reference is to the removal of Jehoiachin (Jeconiah) and his replacement with Zedekiah).</p>
