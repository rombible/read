<A NAME="3822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2191><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Those men have made evil all they have done to the prophet Jeremiah in that they have thrown him into the cistern and he will die of starvation in the place where he is because there is no more food in the city.&#8221; The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et</font>) before &#8220;they have thrown&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1514; &#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512; &#1492;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">et </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asher hishlikhu</font>) is explanatory or further definition of &#8220;all they have done to&#8221; (i.e., the particle is repeated for apposition). The verb form &#8220;and he is sure to die&#8221; is an unusual use of the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive + imperfect that the grammars see as giving a logical consequence without a past nuance (cf. GKC 328 §111.<i>l</i> and <i>IBHS</i> 557-58 §33.3.1f).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> &#8220;Because there isn&#8217;t any food left in the city&#8221; is rhetorical exaggeration; the food did not run out until just before the city fell. Perhaps the intent is to refer to the fact that there was no food in the city for people so confined (i.e., in solitary confinement).</p>
