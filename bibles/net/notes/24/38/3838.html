<A NAME="3838"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2207><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Your life/soul will live.&#8221; The quote is a long condition-consequence sentence with compound consequential clauses. It reads, &#8220;If you will only go out to the officers of the king of Babylon, your soul [= you yourself; BDB 660 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> 4.a] will live and this city will not be burned with fire and you and your household will live.&#8221; The sentence has been broken down and restructured to better conform with contemporary English style. The infinitive absolute in the condition emphasizes the one condition, i.e., going out or surrendering (cf. Joüon 2:423 §123.g, and compare usage in Exod 15:26). For the idiom &#8220;go out to&#8221; = &#8220;surrender to&#8221; see the full idiom in 21:9 &#8220;go out and fall over to&#8221; which is condensed in 38:2 to &#8220;go out to.&#8221; The expression here is the same as in 38:2.</p>
