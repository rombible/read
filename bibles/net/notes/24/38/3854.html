<A NAME="3854"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=2223><b>tn</b> Verses 25-26 form a long compound, complex conditional sentence. The condition is found in v. 25 and contains a long quote. The consequence is found in v. 26 and contains another long quote. The Hebrew sentence literally reads: &#8220;And if the officials hear that I have talked with you and come to you and say to you, &#8216;Please tell us what you said to the king. Do not hide from us and we will not kill you [so that we will not kill you] and [tell us] what the king said to you,&#8217; then tell them.&#8221; The sentence has been broken up to better conform with contemporary English style.</p>
