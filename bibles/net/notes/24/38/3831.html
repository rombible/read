<A NAME="3831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2200><b>sn</b> The precise location of this entrance is unknown since it is mentioned nowhere else in the OT. Many commentators equate this with the &#8220;king&#8217;s outer entry&#8221; (mentioned in 2 Kgs 16:18) which appears to have been a private entryway between the temple and the palace.</p>
