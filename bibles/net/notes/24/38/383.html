<A NAME="383"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2172><b>tn</b> J. Bright (<i>Jeremiah </i>[AB], 226, 30) is probably correct in translating the verbs here as pluperfects and in explaining that these words are prophecies that Jeremiah uttered before his arrest not prophecies that were being delivered to the people through intermediaries sent by Jeremiah who was confined in the courtyard of the guardhouse. For the use of the <i>vav</i> consecutive + imperfect to denote the pluperfect see the discussion and examples in <i>IBHS</i> 552-53 §33.2.3a and see the usage in Exod 4:19. The words that are cited in v. 2 are those recorded in 21:9 on the occasion of the first delegation and those in v. 3 are those recorded in 21:10; 34:2; 37:8; 32:28 all except the last delivered before Jeremiah was confined in the courtyard of the guardhouse.</p>
