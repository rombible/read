<A NAME="3821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2190><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And the king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate.&#8221; This clause is circumstantial to the following clause; thus &#8220;while the king was&#8230;&#8221; Most commentators agree that the reference to sitting in the gate here likely refers to the same kind of judicial context that has been posited for 26:10 (see the translator&#8217;s note there for further references). Hence the translation uses &#8220;sitting&#8221; with the more technical &#8220;holding court&#8221; to better reflect the probable situation.</p>
