<A NAME="3846"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=2215><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The men of your friendship incited you and prevailed over you. Your feet are sunk in the mud. They turned backward.&#8221; The term &#8220;men of your friendship&#8221; (cf. BDB 1023 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> 5.a) is used to refer to Jeremiah&#8217;s &#8220;so-called friends&#8221; in 20:10, to the trusted friend who deserted the psalmist in Ps 41:10, and to the allies of Edom in Obad 7. According to most commentators it refers here to the false prophets and counselors who urged the king to rebel against Nebuchadnezzar. The verb translated &#8220;misled&#8221; is a verb that often refers to inciting or instigating someone to do something, often with negative connotations (so BDB 694 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</font> Hiph.2). It is generally translated &#8220;deceive&#8221; or &#8220;mislead&#8221; in 2 Kgs 18:32; 2 Chr 32:11, 15. Here it refers to the fact that his pro-Egyptian counselors induced him to rebel. They have proven too powerful for him and prevailed on him (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1499;&#1465;&#1500; &#1500;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yakhol lÿ</font>; see BDB 408 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1499;&#1465;&#1500;</font> 2.b) to follow a policy which will prove detrimental to him, his family, and the city. The phrase &#8220;your feet are sunk in the mud&#8221; is figurative for being entangled in great difficulties (so BDB 371 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1506;</font> Hoph and compare the usage in the highly figurative description of trouble in Ps 69:2 [69:3 HT]).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The taunt song here refers to the fact that Zedekiah had been incited into rebellion by pro-Egyptian nobles in his court who prevailed on him to seek aid from the new Egyptian Pharaoh in 589 <sc>b.c. and withhold tribute from Nebuchadnezzar. This led to the downfall of the city which is depicted in Jeremiah&#8217;s vision from the standpoint of its effects on the king himself and his family.</p>
