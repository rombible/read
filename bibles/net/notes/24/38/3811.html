<A NAME="3811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2180><b>tn</b> The Hebrew particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) has not been rendered here because it is introducing a parallel causal clause to the preceding one. To render &#8220;For&#8221; might be misunderstood as a grounds for the preceding statement. To render &#8220;And&#8221; or &#8220;Moreover&#8221; sounds a little odd here. If it must be represented, &#8220;Moreover&#8221; is perhaps the best rendering.</p>
