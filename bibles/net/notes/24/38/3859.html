<A NAME="3859"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=2228><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And Jeremiah stayed/remained in the courtyard of the guardhouse&#8230;&#8221; The translation once again intends to reflect the situation. Jeremiah had a secret meeting with the king at the third entrance to the temple (v. 14). He was returned to the courtyard of the guardhouse (cf. v. 13) after the conversation with the king where the officials came to question him (v. 27). He was not sent back to the dungeon in Jonathan&#8217;s house as he feared, but was left confined in the courtyard of the guardhouse.</p>
