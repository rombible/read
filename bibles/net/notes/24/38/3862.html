<A NAME="3862"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=2231><b>tc</b> The precise meaning of this line and its relation to the context are somewhat uncertain. This line is missing from the Greek and Syriac versions and from a few Hebrew <sc>mss. Some English versions and commentaries omit it as a double writing of the final words of the preceding line (see, e.g., REB; W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah </i>[Hermeneia], 2:268). Others see it as misplaced from the beginning of 39:3 (see, e.g., NRSV, TEV, J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah </i>[AB], 245). The clause probably does belong syntactically with 39:3 (i.e., <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;</font> [<font face="Scholar">ka</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asher</font>] introduces a temporal clause which is resumed by the <i>vav</i> consecutive on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyavo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">u</font>; see BDB 455 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;</font> 3), but it should not be moved there because there is no textual evidence for doing so. The intervening verses are to be interpreted as parenthetical, giving the background for the events that follow (see, e.g., the translation in D. Barthélemy, ed., <i>Preliminary and Interim Report on the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project</i>, 4:280). The chapter is not so much concerned with describing how Jerusalem fell as it is with contrasting the fate of Zedekiah who disregarded the word of the <sc>Lord with the fate of Jeremiah and that of Jeremiah&#8217;s benefactor Ebed Melech. The best way to treat the line without actually moving it before 39:3a is to treat it as a heading as has been done here.</p>
