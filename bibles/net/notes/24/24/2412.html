<A NAME="2412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1397><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;an object of reproach in peoples&#8217; proverbs&#8230;an object of ridicule in people&#8217;s curses.&#8221; The alternate translation treats the two pairs which are introduced without <i>vav</i>s (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) but are joined by <i>vav</i>s as examples of hendiadys. This is very possible here but the chain does not contain this pairing in 25:18; 29:18.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> For an example of how the &#8220;example used in curses&#8221; worked, see Jer 29:22. Sodom and Gomorrah evidently function much that same way (see 23:14; 49:18; 50:40; Deut 29:23; Zeph 2:9).</p>
