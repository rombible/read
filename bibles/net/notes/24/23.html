<A NAME="232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1275><b>sn</b> <i>Heb</i> This particle once again introduces a judgment speech. The indictment is found in v. 1 and the announcement of judgment in v. 2. This leads into an oracle of deliverance in vv. 3-4. See also the note on the word &#8220;judged&#8221; in 22:13.</p>
<A NAME="233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1276><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Woe to the shepherds who are killing and scattering the sheep of my pasture.&#8221; See the study note on 22:13 for the significance of &#8220;Sure to be judged&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;Woe&#8221;) See the study note for the significance of the metaphor introduced here.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Verses 1-4 of ch. 23 are an extended metaphor in which the rulers are compared to shepherds and the people are compared to sheep. This metaphor has already been met with in 10:21 and is found elsewhere in the context of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s covenant with David (cf. 2 Sam 7:7-8; Ps 78:70-72). The sheep are God&#8217;s people and he is the ultimate shepherd who is personally concerned about their care (cf. Pss 23:1; 80:2). He has set rulers over them as his under-shepherds and they are responsible to him for the care of his sheep (see 22:3-4). They have been lax shepherds, allowing the sheep to be scattered and destroyed. So he will punish them. As the true shepherd of Israel he will regather his scattered flock and place new shepherds (rulers) over them. These verses lead to a promise of an ideal ruler set over an Israel which has experienced a new and better Exodus (vv. 6-8). For a more complete development of this metaphor with similar messianic and eschatological implications see Ezek 34. The metaphor has been interpreted in the translation but some of the flavor left in the simile.</p>
<A NAME="234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1277><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;about the shepherds who are shepherding my people. &#8216;You have caused my sheep&#8230;.&#8217;&#8221; For the metaphor see the study note on the previous verse.</p>
<A NAME="235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1278><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Therefore, thus says the <sc>Lord, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds who should be shepherding my people: You have scattered my sheep and driven them away and you have not taken care of them. Behold I will visit upon you the evil of your deeds.&#8221; &#8220;Therefore&#8221; announces the judgment which does not come until &#8220;Behold.&#8221; It is interrupted by the messenger formula and a further indictment. The original has been broken up to conform more to contemporary English style, the metaphors have been interpreted for clarity and the connections between the indictments and the judgments have been carried by &#8220;So.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="2310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1283><b>tn</b> There are various nuances of the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<i>paqad</i>) represented in vv. 2, 4. See Ps 8:4 (8:5 HT) and Zech 10:3 for &#8220;care for/take care of&#8221; (cf. BDB 823 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font> Qal.A.1.a). See Exod 20:5; Amos 3:2; Jer 9:24; 11:22 for &#8220;punish&#8221; (cf. BDB 823 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font> Qal.A.3). See 1 Kgs 20:39 and 2 Kgs 10:19 for &#8220;be missing&#8221; (cf. BDB 823 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font> Niph.1).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> There is an extended play on the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font> which is a word with rather broad English equivalents. Here the word refers to the fault of the shepherds/rulers who have not &#8220;taken care&#8221; of the sheep/people (v. 2), the &#8220;punishment&#8221; for the evil they have done in not taking care of them (v. 2), and the fact that after the <sc>Lord assigns new shepherds/rulers over them they will be cared for in such a way that none of them &#8220;will turn up missing&#8221; (v. 4).</p>

<A NAME="2312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1285><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Oracle of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1286><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Behold the days are coming.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1287><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a righteous sprig to David&#8221; or &#8220;a righteous shoot&#8221; (NAB).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This passage and the parallel in Jer 33:15 are part of a growing number of prayers and prophecies regarding an ideal ruler to come forth from the Davidic line who will bring the justice, security, and well-being that the continuing line of Davidic rulers did not. Though there were periodic kings like Josiah who did fulfill the ideals set forth in Jer 22:3 (see Jer 22:15), by and large they were more like Jehoiakim who did not (see Jer 22:13). Hence the <sc>Lord brought to an end the Davidic rule. The potential for the ideal, however, remained because of God&#8217;s promise to David (2 Sam 7:16). The Davidic line became like a tree which was cut down, leaving only a stump. But from that stump God would bring forth a &#8220;shoot,&#8221; a &#8220;sprig&#8221; which would fulfill the ideals of kingship. See Isa 11:1-6 and Zech 3:8, 6:12 for this metaphor and compare Dan 4:14-15, 23, 26 for a different but related use of the metaphor.</p>
<A NAME="2315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1288><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he will reign as king and act wisely.&#8221; This is another example of the use of two verbs joined by &#8220;and&#8221; where one becomes the adverbial modifier of the other (hendiadys). For the nuance of the verb &#8220;act wisely&#8221; rather than &#8220;prosper&#8221; see Amos 5:13; Ps 2:10 (cf. BDB 968 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1500;</font> Hiph.5).</p>
<A NAME="2316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1289><b>sn</b> This has been the constant emphasis in this section. See 22:3 for the demand, 22:15 for its fulfillment, and 22:13 for its abuse. The ideal king would follow in the footsteps of his illustrious ancestor David (2 Sam 8:15) who set this forth as an ideal for his dynasty (2 Sam 23:3) and prayed for it to be true of his son Solomon (Ps 72:1-2).</p>
<A NAME="2317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1290><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;In his days [= during the time he rules].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1291><b>tn</b> Parallelism and context (cf. v. 4) suggest this nuance for the word often translated &#8220;be saved.&#8221; For this nuance elsewhere see Ps 119:117; Prov 28:18 for the verb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1506;</font> [<font face="Scholar">yasha</font>&#8217;] in the Niphal); and Ps 12:6; Job 5:4, 11 for the related noun (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1506;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yesha</font>&#8217;).</p>
<A NAME="2319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1292><b>sn</b> It should be noted that this brief oracle of deliverance implies the reunification of Israel and Judah under the future Davidic ruler. Jeremiah has already spoken about this reunification earlier in 3:18 and will have more to say about it in 30:3; 31:27, 31. This same ideal was espoused in the prophecies of Hosea (1:10-11 [2:1-2 HT]), Isaiah (11:1-4, 10-12), and Ezekiel (37:15-28) all of which have messianic and eschatological significance.</p>
<A NAME="2320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1293><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his name will be called &#8216;The <sc>Lord our righteousness&#8217;.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Hebrew word translated &#8220;justice&#8221; here is very broad in its usage, and it is hard to catch all the relevant nuances for this word in this context. It is used for &#8220;vindication&#8221; in legal contexts (see, e.g., Job 6:29), for &#8220;deliverance&#8221; or &#8220;salvation&#8221; in exilic contexts (see, e.g., Isa 58:8), and in the sense of ruling, judging with &#8220;justice&#8221; (see, e.g., Lev 19:15; Isa 32:1). Here it probably sums up the justice that the <sc>Lord provides through raising up this ruler as well as the safety, security, and well-being that result (see vv. 5-6a). In the NT this takes on soteriological connotations (see 1 Cor 1:31 in its context).</p>
<A NAME="2321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1294><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Oracle of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1295><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Behold the days are coming.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1296><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;descendants of the house of Israel.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1297><b>tc</b> It is probably preferable to read the third masculine singular plus suffix (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hiddikham</font>) here with the Greek version and the parallel passage in 16:15 rather than the first singular plus suffix in the MT (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hiddakhtim</font>). If this is not a case of mere graphic confusion, the MT could have arisen under the influence of the first person in v. 3. Though sudden shifts in person have been common in the book of Jeremiah, that is unlikely in a context reporting an oath.</p>
<A NAME="2325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1298><b>tn</b> This passage is the same as 16:14-15 with a few minor variations in Hebrew wording. The notes on that passage should be consulted for the rendering here. This passage has the Niphal of the verb &#8220;to say&#8221; rather than the impersonal use of the Qal. It adds the idea of &#8220;bringing out&#8221; to the idea of &#8220;bringing up out&#8221; and (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;who brought up and who brought out,&#8221; probably a case of hendiadys) before &#8220;the people [here &#8220;seed&#8221; rather than &#8220;children&#8221;] of Israel [here &#8220;house of Israel&#8221;] from the land of the north.&#8221; These are minor variations and do not affect the sense in any way. So the passage is rendered in much the same way.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This passage looks forward to a new and greater Exodus, one that so outstrips the earlier one that the earlier will not serve as the model of deliverance any longer. This same ideal was the subject of Isaiah&#8217;s earlier prophecies in Isa 11:11-12, 15-16; 43:16-21; 49:8-13; 51: 1-11.</p>
<A NAME="2326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1299><b>sn</b> Jeremiah has already had a good deal to say about the false prophets and their fate. See 2:8, 26; 5:13, 31; 14:13-15. Here he parallels the condemnation of the wicked prophets and their fate (23:9-40) with that of the wicked kings (21:11-22:30).</p>
<A NAME="2327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1300><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;false&#8221; is not in the text, but it is clear from the context that these are whom the sayings are directed against. The words &#8220;Here is what the <sc>Lord says&#8221; are also not in the text. But comparison with 46:2; 48:1; 49:1, 7, 23, 28; and 21:11 will show that this is a heading. The words are supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1301><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;My heart is crushed within me. My bones tremble.&#8221; It has already been noted several times that the &#8220;heart&#8221; in ancient Hebrew psychology was the intellectual and volitional center of the person, the kidneys were the emotional center, and the bones the locus of strength and also the subject of joy, distress, and sorrow. Here Jeremiah is speaking of his distress of heart and mind in modern psychology, a distress that leads him to trembling of body which he compares to that of a drunken person staggering around under the influence of wine.</p>
<A NAME="2329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1302><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;wine has passed over him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1303><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;wine because of the <sc>Lord and because of his holy word.&#8221; The words that are supplied in the translation are implicit from the context and are added for clarity.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The way the <sc>Lord and his word are being treated is clarified in the verses that follow.</p>
<A NAME="2331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1304><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;adulterers.&#8221; But spiritual adultery is clearly meant as also in 3:8-9; 9:2, and probably also 5:7.</p>
<A NAME="2332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1305><b>tn</b> For the word translated &#8220;They live&#8230;lives&#8221; see usage in Jer 8:6. For the idea of &#8220;misusing&#8221; their power (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;their power is not right&#8221; i.e., used in the wrong way) see 2 Kgs 7:9; 17:9. In the original text this line (really two lines in the Hebrew poetry) are at the end of the verse. However, this places the antecedent too far away and could lead to confusion. The lines have been rearranged to avoid such confusion.</p>
<A NAME="2333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1306><b>tn</b> For the use of this verb see 12:4 and the note there.</p>

See Deut 29:20-21 (29:19-20 HT) and for the specific curse see Deut 28:23-24. The curse is appropriate since their &#8220;adultery&#8221; lay in attributing their fertility to the god Baal (see Hos 2:9-13 (2:11-15 HT) and violating the covenant (see Hos 4:1-3).</p>
<A NAME="2335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1308><b>tn</b> The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) which begins this verse is parallel to the one at the beginning of the preceding verse. However, the connection is too distant to render it &#8220;for.&#8221; &#8220;Moreover&#8221; is intended to draw the parallel. The words &#8220;the <sc>Lord says&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;Oracle of the <sc>Lord&#8221;) have been drawn up to the front to introduce the shift in speaker from Jeremiah, who describes his agitated state, to God, who describes the sins of the prophets and priests and his consequent judgment on them.</p>

<A NAME="2344"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1317><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;they commit adultery and deal falsely.&#8221; The word &#8220;shocking&#8221; only occurs here and in 5:30 where it is found in the context of prophesying lies. This almost assures that the reference to &#8220;walking in lies&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the lie&#8221;) is referring to false prophesy. Moreover the references to the prophets in 5:13 and in 14:13-15 are all in the context of false prophesy as are the following references in this chapter in 23:24, 26, 32 and in 28:15. This appears to be the theme of this section. This also makes it likely that the reference to adultery is not literal adultery, though two of the false prophets in Babylon were guilty of this (29:23). The reference to &#8220;encouraging those who do evil&#8221; that follows also makes more sense if they were preaching messages of comfort rather than messages of doom. The verbs here are infinitive absolutes in place of the finite verb, probably used to place greater emphasis on the action (cf. Hos 4:2 in a comparable judgment speech.)</p>
<A NAME="2345"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1318><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;So they strengthen the hands of those doing evil so that they do not turn back from their evil.&#8221; For the use of the figure &#8220;strengthen the hands&#8221; meaning &#8220;encourage&#8221; see Judg 9:24; Ezek 13:22 (and cf. BDB 304 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1511;</font> Piel.2). The <i>vav</i> consecutive on the front of the form gives the logical consequence equivalent to &#8220;so&#8221; in the translation.</p>

Like Amos who focuses attention on the sins of the surrounding nations to bring out more forcefully the heinousness of Israel&#8217;s sin, God focuses attention on the sins of the prophets of Samaria to bring out the even worse sin of the prophets of Jerusalem. (The oracle is directed at them, not at the prophets of Samaria. See the announcement of judgment that follows.) The <sc>Lord has already followed that tack with Judah in Jeremiah 2 (cf. 2:11). Moreover, he here compares the prophets and the evil-doing citizens of Jerusalem, whom they were encouraging through their false prophesy, to the people of Sodom and Gomorrah who were proverbial for their wickedness (Deut 32:32; Isa 1:10).</p>

Moreover, Baal was worshiped in local manifestations as the Baal of Peor, Baal of Gad, etc. Hence, Baal is sometimes spoken of in the singular and sometimes in the plural. The <sc>Lord is the one true God (Deut 6:4). Moreover, he is the maker of heaven and earth (Gen 14:12; 2 Kgs 19:15; Ps 115:15), sees into the hearts of all men (Ps 33:13-15), and judges men according to what they do (Ezek 7:3, 7, 27). There is no hiding from him (Job 34:22; Ps 139:7-12) and no escape from his judgment (Amos 9:2-4). God has already spoken to the people and their leaders through Jeremiah along these lines (Jer 16:17; 21:14). Lurking behind the thoughts expressed here is probably Deut 29:19-21 where God warns that one &#8220;bad apple&#8221; who thinks he can get away with sinning against the covenant can lead to the destruction of all. The false prophets were the &#8220;bad apples&#8221; that were encouraging the corruption of the whole nation by their words promoting a false sense of security unconnected with loyalty to God and obedience to his covenant. The first question deals with the issue of God&#8217;s transcendence, the second with his omniscience, and the third with his omnipresence.</p>

The Hebrew text reads &#8220;What burden [i.e., burdensome message]?&#8221; The syntax of &#8220;what message?&#8221; is not in itself objectionable; the interrogative can function as an adjective (cf. BDB 552 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> 1.a[a]). What is objectionable to virtually all the commentaries and lexicons is the unparalleled use of the accusative particle in front of the interrogative and the noun (see, e.g., BDB 672 s.v. III <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;</font> and GKC 365-66 §117.<i>m</i>, n. 3). The emendation only involves the redivision and revocalization of the same consonants: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;&#1502;&#1463;&#1492;&#1470;&#1502;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et-mah-masa</font>&#8217;) becomes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1501; &#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">atem hammasa</font>&#8217;). This also makes a much more natural connection for the <i>vav</i> consecutive perfect that follows (cf. GKC 334 §112.<i>x</i> and compare Isa 6:7; Judg 13:3).</p>
<A NAME="2398"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">98</span><note=1371><b>tn</b> The meaning &#8220;cast you away&#8221; is questioned by some because the word is regularly used of &#8220;forsaking&#8221; or &#8220;abandoning&#8221; (see, e.g., Jer 7:29; 12:7; 15:6). However, it is clearly use of &#8220;casting down&#8221; or &#8220;throwing away&#8221; in Ezek 29:5; 32:4 and that meaning is virtually assured in v. 39 where the verb is combined with the phrase &#8220;from my presence&#8221; which is elsewhere used in rejection contexts with verbs like &#8220;send away,&#8221; &#8220;throw out,&#8221; or &#8220;remove&#8221; (see BDB 819 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1462;&#1492;</font> II.8.a). This is another example of the bracketing effect of a key word and should be rendered the same in the two passages. Moreover, it fits in nicely with the play on &#8220;burden&#8221; here.</p>
<A NAME="2399"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">99</span><note=1372><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Oracle of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>

GKC 458 §143.<i>d</i>).</p>
<A NAME="23102"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">102</span><note=1375><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;So, I, Jeremiah tell you&#8221; are not in the text. They are supplied in the translation for clarity to show that it is he who is addressing the people, not the <sc>Lord. See &#8220;our God&#8221; in v. 38 and &#8220;Here is what the <sc>Lord says&#8230;&#8221; which indicate the speaker is other than he.</p>
<A NAME="23103"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">103</span><note=1376><b>tn</b> This line is sometimes rendered as a description of what the people are doing (cf. NIV). However, repetition with some slight modification referring to the prophet in v. 37 followed by the same kind of prohibition that follows here shows that what is being contrasted is two views toward the <sc>Lord&#8217;s message, i.e., one of openness to receive what the <sc>Lord says through the prophet and one that already characterizes the <sc>Lord&#8217;s message as a burden. Allusion to the question that started the discussion in v. 33 should not be missed. The prophet alluded to is Jeremiah. He is being indirect in his reference to himself.</p>
<A NAME="23104"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">104</span><note=1377><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;burden of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="23106"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">106</span><note=1379><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The burden is [or will be] to a man his word.&#8221; There is a good deal of ambiguity regarding how this line is to be rendered. For the major options and the issues involved W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah </i>(Hermeneia), 1:651-52 should be consulted. Most of them are excluded by the observation that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;</font> probably does not mean &#8220;oracle&#8221; anywhere in this passage (see note on v. 33 regarding the use of this word). Hence it does not mean &#8220;every man&#8217;s word becomes his oracle&#8221; as in NIV or &#8220;for that &#8216;burden&#8217; [= oracle] is what he entrusts to the man of his word&#8221; (W. McKane, <i>Jeremiah </i>[ICC], 1:600-601). The latter is also ruled out by the fact that the antecedent of &#8220;his&#8221; on &#8220;his word&#8221; is clearly the word &#8220;man&#8221; in front of it. This would be the only case where the phrase &#8220;man of his word&#8221; occurs. There is also no textual reason for repointing the noun with the article as the noun with the interrogative to read &#8220;For how can his word become a burden to anyone?&#8221; There are, of course, other options but this is sufficient to show that the translation has been chosen after looking at other alternatives.</p>

Instead of the infinitive absolute <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nasho</font>&#8217;) a number of Hebrew <sc>mss, Aquila, Symmachus, Syriac, and Vulgate read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">naso</font>&#8217;). For the confusion of III <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> and III <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;</font> verbs presupposed by the miswriting of the Hebrew text see GKC 216 §75.<i>qq</i> and compare the forms of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nava</font>&#8217;) in Jer 26:9 and 1 Sam 10:6. While the verb &#8220;forget&#8221; would not be totally inappropriate here it does not fit the concept of &#8220;throwing away from my presence&#8221; as well as &#8220;pick up&#8221; does. For the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nasa</font>&#8217;) meaning &#8220;carry you off&#8221; compare the usage in 1 Kgs 15:22; 18:12 (and see BDB 671 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1488;</font> 3.b). Many see the nuance &#8220;pick you up&#8221; carrying through on the wordplay in v. 33. While that may be appropriate for the repetition of the verb &#8220;throw away&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1496;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font>, <font face="Scholar">natash</font>) that follows, it does not seem as appropriate for the use of the infinitive absolute that follows the verb which expresses some kind of forcefulness (see GKC 343 §113.<i>q</i>).</p>
