<A NAME="61"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=342><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Flee for safety, people of Benjamin, out of the midst of Jerusalem.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Compare and contrast Jer 4:6. There people in the outlying areas were warned to seek safety in the fortified city of Jerusalem. Here they are told to flee it because it was about to be destroyed.</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="62"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=343><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;ram&#8217;s horn,&#8221; but the modern equivalent is &#8220;trumpet&#8221; and is more readily understandable.</p>
<A NAME="63"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=344><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;leans down&#8221; or &#8220;looks down.&#8221; This verb personifies destruction leaning/looking down from its window in the sky, ready to attack. </p>
<A NAME="64"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=345><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;[It will be] a severe fracture.&#8221; The nation is pictured as a limb being fractured.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This passage is emotionally charged. There are two examples of assonance or wordplay in the verse: &#8220;sound&#8221; (Heb <font face="Scholar">tiq</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">u</font>, &#8220;blow&#8221;), which has the same consonants as &#8220;Tekoa&#8221; (Heb <font face="Scholar">uvitqoa</font>&#8217;), and &#8220;signal fire,&#8221; which comes from the same root as &#8220;light&#8221; (Heb <font face="Scholar">sÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">u mas</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et</font>, &#8220;lift up&#8221;). There is also an example of personification where disaster is said to &#8220;lurk&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;look down on&#8221;) out of the north. This gives a sense of urgency and concern for the coming destruction.</p>
<A NAME="65"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=346><b>tn</b> The verb here is another example of the Hebrew verb form that indicates the action is as good as done (a Hebrew prophetic perfect).</p>
<A NAME="66"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=347><b>sn</b> Jerusalem is personified as a young maiden who is helpless in the hands of her enemies.</p>
<A NAME="67"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=348><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The beautiful and delicate one I will destroy, the daughter of Zion. The English versions and commentaries are divided over the rendering of this verse because (1) there are two verbs with these same consonants, one meaning &#8220;to be like&#8221; and the other meaning &#8220;to be destroyed&#8221; (intransitive) or &#8220;to destroy&#8221; (transitive), and (2) the word rendered &#8220;beautiful&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">navah</font>) can be understood as a noun meaning &#8220;pasture&#8221; or as a defective writing of an adjective meaning &#8220;beautiful, comely&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">na</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">vah</font>). Hence some render &#8220;Fair Zion, you are like a lovely pasture,&#8221; reading the verb form as an example of the old second feminine singular perfect. Although this may fit the imagery of the next verse, that rendering ignores the absence of a preposition (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font> or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">lÿ </font>or<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>, both of which can be translated &#8220;to&#8221;) that normally goes with the verb &#8220;be like&#8221; and drops the conjunction in front of the adjective &#8220;delicate.&#8221; The parallel usage of the verb in Hos 4:5 argues for the meaning &#8220;destroy.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="68"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=349><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Shepherds and their flocks will come against it.&#8221;<i> </i>Rulers are often depicted as shepherds; see BDB 945 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> 1.d(2) (cf. Jer 12:10). The translation of this verse attempts to clarify the point of this extended metaphor.</p>
<A NAME="69"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=350><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;They will thrust [= pitch] tents around it.&#8221; The shepherd imagery has a surprisingly ominous tone. The beautiful pasture filled with shepherds grazing their sheep is in reality a city under siege from an attacking enemy.</p>
<A NAME="610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=351><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;They will graze each one his portion.&#8221; For the use of the verb &#8220;graze&#8221; to mean &#8220;strip&#8221; or &#8220;devastate&#8221; see BDB 945 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> 2.c. For a similar use of the word normally meaning &#8220;hand&#8221; to mean portion compare 2 Sam 19:43 (19:44 HT).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> There is a wordplay involving &#8220;sound&#8230;in Tekoa&#8221; mentioned in the study note on &#8220;destruction&#8221; in v. 1. The Hebrew verb &#8220;they will pitch&#8221; is from the same root as the word translated &#8220;sound&#8221; (<font face="Scholar">taqÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">u</font> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;</font>] here and <font face="Scholar">tiq</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">u</font> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;</font>] in v. 1).</p>
<A NAME="611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=352><b>tn</b> These words are not in the text but are implicit in the connection. They are supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=353><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Sanctify war.&#8221; This is probably an idiom from early Israel&#8217;s holy wars in which religious rites were to precede the battle.</p>
<A NAME="613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=354><b>tn</b> These words are not in the text but are supplied in the translation for clarity. Some commentaries and English versions see these not as the words of the enemy but as those of the Israelites expressing their fear that the enemy will launch a night attack against them and further destroy them. The connection with the next verse, however, fits better with them if they are the words of the enemy.</p>
<A NAME="614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=355><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Woe to us!&#8221; For the usage of this phrase see the translator&#8217;s note on 4:13. The usage of this particle here is a little exaggerated. They have lost the most advantageous time for attack but they are scarcely in a hopeless or doomed situation. The equivalent in English slang is &#8220;Bad news!&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=356><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;For.&#8221; The translation attempts to make the connection clearer.</p>
<A NAME="616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=357><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Yahweh of armies.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> For an explanation of the significance of this title see the study note on 2:19.</p>
<A NAME="617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=358><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Cut down its trees and build up a siege ramp against Jerusalem.&#8221; The referent has been moved forward from the second line for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=359><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;must be punished.&#8221; The meaning of this line is uncertain. The LXX reads, &#8220;Woe, city of falsehood!&#8221; The MT presents two anomalies: a masculine singular verb with a feminine singular subject in a verbal stem (Hophal) that elsewhere does not have the meaning &#8220;is to be punished.&#8221; Hence many follow the Greek which presupposes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497; &#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512; &#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1462;&#1511;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hoy </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ir hasheqer</font>) instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488; &#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512; &#1492;&#1464;&#1508;&#1456;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hi</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ir hofqad</font>). The Greek is the easier reading in light of the parallelism, and it would be hard to explain how the MT arose from it. KBL suggests reading a noun meaning &#8220;licentiousness&#8221; which occurs elsewhere only in Mishnaic Hebrew, hence &#8220;this is the city, the licentious one&#8221; (attributive apposition; cf. KBL 775 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1511;&#1462;&#1512;</font>). Perhaps the Hophal perfect (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1508;&#1456;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hofÿqad</font>) should be revocalized as a Niphal infinitive absolute (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1465;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hippaqod</font>); this would solve both anomalies in the MT since the Niphal is used in this nuance and the infinitive absolute can function in place of a finite verb (cf. GKC 346 §113.<i>ee</i> and <i>ff</i>). This, however, is mere speculation and is supported by no Hebrew <sc>ms.</p>
<A NAME="619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=360><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;All of it oppression in its midst.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=361><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;As a well makes cool/fresh its water, she makes cool/fresh her wickedness.&#8221; The translation follows the reading proposed by the Masoretes (<i>Qere</i>) which reads a rare form of the word &#8220;well&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1512;</font> [<font face="Scholar">bayir</font>] for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1512;</font> [<font face="Scholar">bÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">er</font>]) in place of the form written in the text (<i>Kethib</i>, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font> [<font face="Scholar">bor</font>]), which means &#8220;cistern.&#8221; The latter noun is masculine and the pronoun &#8220;its&#8221; is feminine. If indeed <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bayir</font>) is a byform of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">be</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">er</font>), which is feminine, it would agree in gender with the pronoun. It also forms a more appropriate comparison since cisterns do not hold fresh water.</p>

It is not necessary to read the verb forms here as two imperatives or an infinitive absolute followed by an imperative as some English versions and commentaries do. This is an example of a third plural verb used impersonally and translated as a passive (cf. GKC 460 §144.<i>g</i>).</p>
<A NAME="628"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=369><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Pass your hand back over the branches like a grape harvester.&#8221; The translation is intended to clarify the metaphor that Jeremiah should try to rescue some from the coming destruction.</p>

<A NAME="650"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=391><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Know, congregation [or witness], what in [or against] them.&#8221; The meaning of this line is somewhat uncertain. The meaning of the noun of address in the second line (&#8220;witness,&#8221; rendered as an imperative in the translation, &#8220;Be witnesses&#8221;) is greatly debated. It is often taken as &#8220;congregation&#8221; but the lexicons and commentaries generally question the validity of reading that word since it is nowhere else applied to the nations. BDB 417 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font> 3 says that the text is dubious. <i>HALOT</i> 747 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, 4 emends the text to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1461;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">de</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>). Several modern English versions (e.g., NIV, NCV, God&#8217;s Word) take it as the feminine singular noun &#8220;witness&#8221; (cf. BDB 729 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font>) and understand it as a collective. This solution is also proposed by J. A. Thompson (<i>Jeremiah </i>[NICOT], 259, n. 3) and appears to make the best sense in the context. The end of the line is very elliptical but is generally taken as either, &#8220;what I will do with/to them,&#8221; or &#8220;what is coming against them&#8221; (= &#8220;what will happen to them&#8221;) on the basis of the following context.</p>

Though common in Hebrew style, it is not common in English. The shift to the third person in the translation is an accommodation to English style.</p>
<A NAME="658"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=399><b>tn</b> This is an attempt to render the Hebrew particle rendered &#8220;behold&#8221; joined to the first person pronoun.</p>

<A NAME="660"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=401><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;and fall to their destruction&#8221; are implicit in the metaphor and are supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>

<A NAME="663"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=404><b>tn</b> These words are not in the text, but, from the context, someone other than God is speaking and is speaking for and to the people (either Jeremiah or the people themselves). These words are supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="664"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=405><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;We have lost our strength to do battle&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Our hands hang limp [or helpless at our sides].&#8221; According to BDB 951 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1508;&#1464;&#1492;</font> Qal.2, this idiom is used figuratively for losing heart or energy. The best example of its figurative use of loss of strength or the feeling of helplessness is in Ezek 21:12 where it appears in the context of the heart (courage) melting, the spirit sinking, and the knees becoming like water. For other examples compare 2 Sam 4:1; Zeph 3:16. In Neh 6:9 it is used literally of the builders &#8220;dropping their hands from the work&#8221; out of fear. The words &#8220;with fear&#8221; are supplied in the translation because they are implicit in the context.</p>
<A NAME="665"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=406><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;For the enemy has a sword.&#8221;</p>

The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bakhon</font>) can mean &#8220;tower&#8221; (cf. BDB 103 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font>; cf. Isa 23:13 for the only other use) or &#8220;assayer&#8221; (cf. BDB 103 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font>). The latter would be the more expected nuance because of the other uses of nouns and verbs from this root. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mivtsar</font>) normally means &#8220;fortress&#8221; (cf. BDB 131 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1512;</font>), but most modern commentaries and lexicons deem that nuance inappropriate here. <i>HALOT</i> follows a proposal that the word is to be repointed to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿvatser</font>) and derived from a root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">batsar</font>) meaning &#8220;to test&#8221; (cf. <i>HALOT</i> 143 s.v. IV <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1512;</font>). That proposal makes the most sense in the context, but the root appears nowhere else in the OT.</p>

<A NAME="674"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=415><b>tn</b> These words are not in the text but are supplied in the translation for clarity. Some takes these words to be the continuation of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s commission of Jeremiah to the task of testing them. However, since this is the evaluation, the task appears to be complete. The words are better to be taken as Jeremiah&#8217;s report after he has completed the task.</p>

In the ancient refining process lead was added as a flux to remove impurities from silver ore in the process of oxidizing the lead. Jeremiah says that the lead has been used up and the impurities have not been removed. The translation is based on the recognition of an otherwise unused verb root meaning &#8220;blow&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1512;</font> [<font face="Scholar">nakhar</font>]; cf.
