<A NAME="1032"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=657><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;The <sc>Lord who is&#8221; are not in the text. They are supplied in the translation for clarity. For the significance of the words that follow them see the study note that follows.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>the portion of Jacob&#8217;s descendants</i>, which is applied to God here, has its background in the division of the land where each tribe received a portion of the land of Palestine except the tribe of Levi whose &#8220;portion&#8221; was the <sc>Lord. As the other tribes lived off what their portion of the land provided, the tribe of Levi lived off what the <sc>Lord provided, i.e., the tithes and offerings dedicated to him. Hence to have the <sc>Lord as one&#8217;s portion is to have him provide for all one&#8217;s needs (see Ps 16:5 in the context of vv. 2, 6 and Lam 3:24 in the context of vv. 22-23).</p>
