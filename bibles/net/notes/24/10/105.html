<A NAME="105"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=630><b>sn</b> This passage is dripping with sarcasm. It begins by talking about the &#8220;statutes&#8221; of the pagan peoples as a &#8220;vapor&#8221; using a singular copula and singular predicate. Then it suppresses the subject, the idol, as though it were too horrible to mention, using only the predications about it. The last two lines read literally: &#8220;[it is] a tree which one cuts down from the forest; the work of the hands of a craftsman with his chisel.&#8221;</p>
