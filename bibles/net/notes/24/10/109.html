<A NAME="109"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=634><b>tn</b> The form that introduces this line has raised debate. The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">me</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">en</font>) normally means &#8220;without&#8221; and introduces a qualification of a term expressing desolation or &#8220;so that not&#8221; and introduces a negative result (cf. BDB 35 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</font> 6.b). Neither of these nuances fit either this verse or the occurrence in v. 7. BDB 35 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</font> 6.b.<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;</font> notes that some have explained this as a strengthened form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ayin</font>) which occurs in a similar phrase five other times (cf., e.g., 1 Kgs 8:23). Though many including BDB question the validity of this solution it is probably better than the suggestion that BDB gives of repointing to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">me</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ayin</font>, &#8220;whence&#8221;), which scarcely fits the context of v. 7, or the solution of <i>HALOT</i> 41 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</font>, which suggests that the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mem</font>) is a double writing (dittograph) of the final consonant from the preceding word. That would assume that the scribe made the same error twice or was influenced the second time by the first erroneous writing.</p>
