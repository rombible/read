<A NAME="1024"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=649><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;The <sc>Lord is&#8221; are not in the text. They are implicit from the context. They are supplied in the translation here because of the possible confusion of who the subject is due to the parenthetical address to the people of Israel in v. 11. The first two verbs are participles and should not merely be translated as the narrative past. They are predicate nominatives of an implied copula intending to contrast the <sc>Lord as the one who made the earth with the idols which did not.</p>
