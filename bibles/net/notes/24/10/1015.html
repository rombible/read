<A NAME="1015"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=640><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;The instruction of vanities [worthless idols] is wood.&#8221; The meaning of this line is a little uncertain. Various proposals have been made to make sense, most of which involve radical emendation of the text. For some examples see J. A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah </i>(NICOT), 323-24, fn 6. However, this is probably a case of the bold predication that discussed in GKC 452 §141.<i>d</i>, some examples of which may be seen in Ps 109:4 &#8220;I am prayer,&#8221; and Ps 120:7 &#8220;I am peace.&#8221;</p>
