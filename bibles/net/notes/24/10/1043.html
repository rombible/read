This passage could refer to the exiles of 605 <sc>b.c., 597 <sc>b.c., or more probably be anticipatory of the exile of 588 <sc>b.c. since the &#8220;tent,&#8221; (i.e., the city) is pictured as torn down. The picture of devastation and desolation here should be contrasted with that in Isa 54:2-3.</p>
