<A NAME="1056"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=681><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;who do not call on your name.&#8221; The idiom &#8220;to call on your name&#8221; (directed to God) refers to prayer (mainly) and praise. See 1 Kgs 18:24-26 and Ps 116:13, 17. Here &#8220;calling on your name&#8221; is parallel to &#8220;acknowledging you.&#8221; In many locations in the OT &#8220;name&#8221; is equivalent to the person. In the OT, the &#8220;name&#8221; reflected the person&#8217;s character (cf. Gen 27:36; 1 Sam 25:25) or his reputation (Gen 11:4; 2 Sam 8:13). To speak in a person&#8217;s name was to act as his representative or carry his authority (1 Sam 25:9; 1 Kgs 21:8). To call someone&#8217;s name over something was to claim it for one&#8217;s own (2 Sam 12:28).</p>
