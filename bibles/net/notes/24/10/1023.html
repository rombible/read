<A NAME="1023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=648><b>tn</b> This verse is in Aramaic. It is the only Aramaic sentence in Jeremiah. Scholars debate the appropriateness of this verse to this context. Many see it as a gloss added by a postexilic scribe which was later incorporated into the text. Both R. E. Clendenen (&#8220;Discourse Strategies in Jeremiah 10,&#8221; JBL 106 [1987]: 401-8) and W. L. Holladay (<i>Jeremiah </i>[Hermeneia], 1:324-25, 334-35) have given detailed arguments that the passage is not only original but the climax and center of the contrast between the <sc>Lord and idols in vv. 2-16. Holladay shows that the passage is a very carefully constructed chiasm (see accompanying study note) which argues that &#8220;these&#8221; at the end is the subject of the verb &#8220;will disappear&#8221; not the attributive adjective modifying heaven. He also makes a very good case that the verse is poetry and not prose as it is rendered in the majority of modern English versions.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This passage is carefully structured and placed to contrast the <sc>Lord who is living and eternal (v. 10) and made the heavens and earth (v. 12) with the idols who did not and will disappear. It also has a very careful concentric structure in the original text where &#8220;the gods&#8221; is balanced by &#8220;these,&#8221; &#8220;heavens&#8221; is balance by &#8220;from under the heavens,&#8221; &#8220;the earth&#8221; is balanced by &#8220;from the earth,&#8221; and &#8220;did not make&#8221; is balanced and contrasted in the very center by &#8220;will disappear.&#8221; The structure is further reinforced by the sound play/wordplay between &#8220;did not make&#8221; (<i>Aram</i> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1488; &#1506;&#1458;&#1489;&#1463;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;</font> [<font face="Scholar">la</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avadu</font>]) and &#8220;will disappear&#8221; (<i>Aram</i> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1461;&#1488;&#1489;&#1463;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;</font> [<font face="Scholar">ye</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">vadu</font>]). This is the rhetorical climax of Jeremiah&#8217;s sarcastic attack on the folly of idolatry.</p>
