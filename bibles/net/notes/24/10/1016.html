<A NAME="1016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=641><b>tc</b> Two Qumran scrolls of Jeremiah (4QJer<sup>a</sup> and 4QJer<sup>b</sup>) reflect a Hebrew text that is very different than the traditional MT from which modern Bibles have been translated. The Hebrew text in these two manuscripts is similar to that from which LXX was translated. This is true both in small details and in major aspects where the LXX differs from MT. Most notably, 4QJer<sup>a</sup>, 4QJer<sup>b</sup> and LXX present a version of Jeremiah about 13% shorter than the longer version found in MT. One example of this shorter text is Jer 10:3-11 in which MT and 4QJer<sup>a</sup> both have all nine verses, while LXX and 4QJer<sup>b</sup> both lack vv. 6-8 and 10, which extol the greatness of God. In addition, the latter part of v. 9 is arranged differently in LXX and 4QJer<sup>b</sup>. The translation here follows MT which is supported by 4QJer<sup>a</sup>.</p>
