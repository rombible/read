<A NAME="1021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=646><b>sn</b> There is an ironic pun in this last line. The Hebrew word translated &#8220;skillful workers&#8221; is the same word that is translated &#8220;wise people&#8221; in v. 7. The artisans do their work skillfully but they are not &#8220;wise.&#8221;</p>
