<A NAME="108"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=633><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;I said&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text, but there appears to be a shift in speaker. Someone is now addressing the <sc>Lord. The likely speaker is Jeremiah, so the words &#8220;I said&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
