<A NAME="3611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2078><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;So you go and read from the scroll which you have written from my mouth the words of the <sc>Lord in the ears of the people in the house of the <sc>Lord on a fast day, and in that way [for the explanation of this rendering see below] you will be reading them in the ears of all Judah [= the people of Judah] who come from their towns [i.e., to the temple to fast].&#8221; Again the syntax of the original is awkward, separating several of the qualifying phrases from the word or phrase they are intended to modify. In most of the &#8220;literal&#8221; English versions the emphasis on &#8220;what the <sc>Lord said&#8221; tends to get lost and it looks like two separate groups are to be addressed rather than one. The intent of the phrase is to define who the people are who will hear; the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;</font> that introduces the clause is explicative (BDB 252 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;</font> 1.b) and the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gam</font>) is used to emphasize the explicative &#8220;all Judah who come in from their towns&#8221; (cf. BDB 169 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1501;</font> 2). If some force were to be given to the &#8220;literal&#8221; rendering of that particle here it would be &#8220;actually.&#8221; This is the group that is to be addressed according to v. 3. The complex Hebrew sentence has been restructured to include all the relevant information in more comprehensible and shorter English sentences.</p>
