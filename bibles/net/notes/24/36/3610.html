<A NAME="3610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2077><b>sn</b> Regular fast days were not a part of Israel&#8217;s religious calendar. Rather fast days were called on special occasions, i.e., in times of drought or a locust plague (Joel 1:14; 2:15), or during a military crisis (2 Chr 20:3), or after defeat in battle (1 Sam 31:13; 2 Sam 1:12). A fast day was likely chosen for the reading of the scroll because the people would be more mindful of the crisis they were in and be in more of a repentant mood. The events referred to in the study note on v. 1 would have provided the basis for Jeremiah&#8217;s anticipation of a fast day when the scroll could be read.</p>
