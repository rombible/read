<A NAME="365"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2072><b>sn</b> This refers to the messages that Jeremiah delivered during the last eighteen years of Josiah, the three month reign of Jehoahaz and the first four years of Jehoiakim&#8217;s reign (the period between Josiah&#8217;s thirteenth year [cf. 1:2] and the fourth year of Jehoiakim [v. 1]). The exact content of this scroll is unknown since many of the messages in the present book are undated. It is also not known what relation this scroll had to the present form of the book of Jeremiah, since this scroll was destroyed and another one written that contained more than this one did (cf. v. 32). Since Jeremiah continued his ministry down to the fall of Jerusalem in 587/6 <sc>b.c. (1:2) and beyond (cf. Jer 40-44) much more was added to those two scrolls even later.</p>
