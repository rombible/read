<A NAME="3653"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=2120><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;You burned this scroll, saying, &#8216;Why did you write on it, saying, &#8220;The king of Babylon will certainly come [the infinitive absolute before the finite verb expresses certainty here as several places elsewhere in Jeremiah] and destroy this land and exterminate from it both man and beast.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221; The sentence raises several difficulties for translating literally. I.e., the &#8220;you&#8221; in &#8220;why did you write&#8221; is undefined, though it obviously refers to Jeremiah. The gerund &#8220;saying&#8221; that introduces &#8216;Why did you write&#8217; does not fit very well with &#8220;you burned the scroll.&#8221; Gerunds of this sort are normally explanatory. Lastly, there is no indication in the narrative that Jehoiakim ever directly asked Jeremiah this question. In fact, he had been hidden out of sight so Jehoiakim couldn&#8217;t confront him. The question is presented rhetorically, expressing Jehoiakim&#8217;s thoughts or intents and giving the rational for burning the scroll, i.e., he questioned Jeremiah&#8217;s right to say such things. The translation has attempted to be as literal as possible without resolving some of these difficulties. One level of embedded quotes has been eliminated for greater simplicity. For the rendering of &#8220;How dare you&#8221; for the interrogative &#8220;why do you&#8221; see the translator&#8217;s note on 26:9.</p>
