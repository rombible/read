<A NAME="3654"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=2121><b>sn</b> This prophesy was not &#8220;totally&#8221; fulfilled because his son Jehoiachin (Jeconiah) did occupy the throne for three months (2 Kgs 23:8). However, his rule was negligible and after his capitulation and exile to Babylon, he himself was promised that neither he nor his successors would occupy the throne of David (cf. Jer 22:30; and see the study notes on 22:24, 30).</p>
