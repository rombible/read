<A NAME="369"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2076><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I am restrained; I cannot go into.&#8221; The word &#8220;restrained&#8221; is used elsewhere in Jeremiah of his being confined to the courtyard of the guardhouse (33:1; 39:15). However, that occurred only later during the tenth year of Zedekiah (Jer 32:1-2) and Jeremiah appears here to be free to come and go as he pleased (vv. 19, 26). The word is used in the active voice of the <sc>Lord preventing Sarah from having a baby (Gen 16:2). The probable nuance is here &#8220;I am prevented/ debarred&#8221; from being able to go. No reason is given why he was prevented/debarred. It has been plausibly suggested that he was prohibited from going into the temple any longer because of the scathing sermon he delivered there earlier (Jer 26:1-3; 7:1-15).</p>
