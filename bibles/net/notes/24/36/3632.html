<A NAME="3632"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2099><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Did Jeremiah dictate them to you?&#8221; The words &#8220;Do they actually come from Jeremiah&#8217;s mouth?&#8221; assume that the last phrase (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1493;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mippiv</font>) is a question, either without the formal <font face="Scholar">he</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1458;</font>) interrogative (see GKC 473 §150.<i>a</i> and compare usage in 1 Sam 16:4; Prov 5:16) or with a letter supplied from the end of the preceding word (single writing of a letter following the same letter [haplography]; so the majority of modern commentaries). The word is missing in the Greek version. The presence of this same word at the beginning of the answer in the next verse suggests that this was a question (probably without the <i>he </i>[<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1458;</font>] interrogative to make it more emphatic) since the common way to answer affirmatively is to repeat the emphatic word in the question (cf. GKC 476 §150.<i>n</i> and compare usage in Gen 24:58). The intent of the question is to make sure that these were actually Jeremiah&#8217;s words not Baruch&#8217;s own creation (cf. Jer 42:2-3 for a similar suspicion).</p>
