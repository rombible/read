<A NAME="3659"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=2126><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And he wrote upon it from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the scroll which Jehoiakim king of Judah burned in the fire. And many words like these were added to them besides [or further].&#8221; The translation uses the more active form in the last line because of the tendency in contemporary English style to avoid the passive. It also uses the words &#8220;everything&#8221; for &#8220;all the words&#8221; and &#8220;messages&#8221; for &#8220;words&#8221; because those are legitimate usages of these phrases, and they avoid the mistaken impression that Jeremiah repeated verbatim the words on the former scroll or repeated verbatim the messages that he had delivered during the course of the preceding twenty-three years.</p>
