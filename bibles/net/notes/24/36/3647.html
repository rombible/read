<A NAME="3647"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=2114><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the son of the king.&#8221; Many of the commentaries express doubt that this actually refers to Jehoiakim&#8217;s own son since Jehoiakim was only about thirty at this time and one of his sons would not have been old enough to have been in such a position of authority. The same doubt is expressed about the use of this term in 38:6 and in 1 Kgs 22:26. The term need not refer to the ruling king&#8217;s own son but one of the royal princes.</p>
