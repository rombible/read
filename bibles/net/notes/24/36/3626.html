<A NAME="3626"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2093><b>tn</b> The original has another example of a prepositioned object (called <i>casus pendens</i> in the grammars; cf. GKC 458 §143.<i>b</i>) which is intended to focus attention on &#8220;the scroll.&#8221; The Hebrew sentence reads: &#8220;The scroll which you read from it in the ears of the people take it and come.&#8221; Any attempt to carry over this emphasis into the English translation would be awkward. Likewise, the order of the two imperatives has been reversed as more natural in English.</p>
