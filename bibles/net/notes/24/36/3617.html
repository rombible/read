<A NAME="3617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2084><b>sn</b> <i>Shaphan</i> had been <i>the royal secretary</i> under Jehoiakim&#8217;s father&#8217;s rule. During the course of his official duties the book of the law had been discovered and he had read it and reported its contents to Josiah who instituted sweeping reforms on the basis of his obedience to it. (See 2 Kgs 22 and note especially vv. 3, 8, 10.) If the Shaphan mentioned in 26:14 is the same person as this, Gemariah would have been the brother of the man who spoke up on Jeremiah&#8217;s behalf when the priests and prophets sought to have him killed.</p>
