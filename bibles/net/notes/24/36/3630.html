<A NAME="3630"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2097><b>tn</b> According to BDB 808 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1491;</font> Qal.1 and 40 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;</font> 3.a, this is an example of the &#8220;pregnant&#8221; use of a preposition where an implied verb has to be supplied in the translation to conform the normal range of the preposition with the verb that is governing it. The Hebrew text reads: &#8220;they feared unto one another.&#8221; BDB translates &#8220;they turned in dread to each other.&#8221; The translation adopted seems more appropriate in this context.</p>
