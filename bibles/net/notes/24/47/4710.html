<A NAME="4710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2514><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;you who are left alive on the Philistine plain.&#8221; Or &#8220;you who remain of the Anakim.&#8221; The translation follows the suggestion of several of the modern commentaries that the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1502;&#1462;&#1511;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">emeq</font>) means &#8220;strength&#8221; or &#8220;power&#8221; here (see J. A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah </i>[NICOT], 698; J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah </i>[AB], 310; and see also <i>HALOT</i> 803 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1502;&#1462;&#1511;</font>). It is a rare homonym of the word that normally means &#8220;valley&#8221; that seems to be an inappropriate designation of the Philistine plain. Many of the modern English versions and commentaries follow the Greek version which reads here &#8220;remnant of the Anakim&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anaqim</font>] instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1511;&#1464;&#1501;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">imqam</font>], a confusion of basically one letter). This emendation is followed by both BDB 771 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1502;&#1462;&#1511;</font> and KBL 716 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1502;&#1462;&#1511;</font>. The Anakim were generally associated with the southern region around Hebron but an enclave of them was known to have settled in Gaza, Gath, and Ekron, three of the Philistine cities (cf. Josh 11:22). However, the fact that this judgment is directed against the Philistines not the Anakim and that this homonym apparently appears also in Jer 49:4 makes the reading of &#8220;power&#8221; more likely here.</p>
