<A NAME="473"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2507><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Behold! Waters are rising from the north.&#8221; The metaphor of enemy armies compared to overflowing water is seen also in Isa 8:8-9 (Assyria) and 46:7-8 (Egypt). Here it refers to the foe from the north (Jer 1:14; 4:6; etc) which is specifically identified with Babylon in Jer 25. The metaphor has been turned into a simile in the translation to help the average reader identify that a figure is involved and to hint at the referent.</p>
