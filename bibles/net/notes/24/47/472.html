<A NAME="472"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2506><b>sn</b> The precise dating of this prophecy is uncertain. Several proposals have been suggested, the most likely of which is that the prophecy was delivered in 609 <sc>b.c. in conjunction with Pharaoh Necho&#8217;s advance into Palestine to aid the Assyrians. That was the same year that Josiah was killed by Necho at the battle of Megiddo and four years before Necho was defeated by Nebuchadnezzar, the foe from the north. The prophecy presupposes that Ashkelon is still in existence (v. 5) hence it must be before 604 <sc>b.c. For a fairly complete discussion of the options see G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, T. G. Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52 </i>(WBC),<i> </i>299-300.</p>
