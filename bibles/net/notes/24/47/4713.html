<A NAME="4713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2517><b>sn</b> The passage is highly figurative. The sword of the <sc>Lord, which is itself a figure of the destructive agency of the enemy armies, is here addressed as a person and is encouraged in rhetorical questions (the questions are designed to dissuade) to &#8220;be quiet,&#8221; &#8220;be at rest,&#8221; &#8220;be silent,&#8221; all of which is designed to get the <sc>Lord to call off the destruction against the Philistines.</p>
