<A NAME="474"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2508><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;From the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his stallions, from the rattling of his chariots at the rumbling of their wheels, fathers will not turn to their children from sinking of hands.&#8221; According to BDB 952 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> the &#8220;sinking of the hands&#8221; is figurative of helplessness caused by terror. A very similar figure is seen with a related expression in Isa 35:3-4. The sentence has been restructured to put the subject up front and to suggest through shorter sentences more in keeping with contemporary English style the same causal connections. The figures have been interpreted for the sake of clarity for the average reader.</p>
