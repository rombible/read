<A NAME="478"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2512><b>sn</b> <i>All the help that remains for Tyre and Sidon</i> and <i>that remnant that came from the island of Crete</i> appear to be two qualifying phrases that refer to the Philistines, the last with regard to their origin and the first with regard to the fact that they were allies that Tyre and Sidon depended on. &#8220;Crete&#8221; is literally &#8220;Caphtor&#8221; which is generally identified with the island of Crete. The Philistines had come from there (Amos 9:7) in the wave of migration from the Aegean Islands during the twelfth and eleventh century and had settled on the Philistine plain after having been repulsed from trying to enter Egypt.</p>
