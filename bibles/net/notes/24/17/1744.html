<A NAME="1744"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1064><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;But sanctify [or set apart as sacred] the Sabbath day.&#8221; The idea of setting it apart as something sacred to the <sc>Lord is implicit in the command. See the explicit statements of this in Exod 20:10; 31:5; 35:2; Lev 24:8. For some readers the idea of treating the Sabbath day as something sacred won&#8217;t mean much without spelling the qualification out specifically. Sabbath observance was not just a matter of not working.</p>
