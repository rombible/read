<A NAME="1751"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1071><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;There will come through the gates of this city the kings and princes&#8230;riding in chariots and on horses, they and their officials&#8230;&#8221; The structure of the original text is broken up here because of the long compound subject which would make the English sentence too long. The term &#8220;princes&#8221; is often omitted as a supposed double writing of the word that follows it and looks somewhat like it (the Hebrew reads here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; &#1497;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">vÿsarim yoshÿvim</font>) or the same word which occurs later in the verse and is translated &#8220;officials&#8221; (the word can refer to either). It is argued that &#8220;princes&#8221; are never said to sit on the throne of David (translated here &#8220;follow in the succession of David&#8221;). However, the word is in all texts and versions and the concept of sitting on the throne of someone is descriptive of both past, present, and future and is even used with the participle in a proleptic sense of &#8220;the one who is to sit on the throne&#8221; (cf. Exod 11:5; 12:29).</p>
