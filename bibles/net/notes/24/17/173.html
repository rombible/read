<A NAME="173"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1023><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;adamant.&#8221; The word &#8220;diamond&#8221; is an accommodation to modern times. There is no evidence that diamond was known in ancient times. This hard stone (perhaps emery) became metaphorical for hardness; see Ezek 3:9 and Zech 7:12. For discussion see W. E. Staples, &#8220;Adamant,&#8221; <i>IDB</i> 1:45.</p>
