<A NAME="1735"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1055><b>sn</b> Observance of the Sabbath day (and the Sabbatical year) appears to have been a litmus test of the nation&#8217;s spirituality since it is mentioned in a number of passages besides this one (cf., e.g., Isa 56:2, 6; 58:13; Neh 13:15-18). Perhaps this is because the Sabbath day was the sign of the Mosaic covenant (Exod 31:13-17) just as the rainbow was the sign of the Noahic covenant (Gen 9:12, 13, 17) and circumcision was the sign of the Abrahamic covenant (Gen 17:11). This was not the only command they failed to obey, nor was their failure to obey this one the sole determining factor in the <sc>Lord&#8217;s decision to destroy Judah (cf. 7:23- 24; 11:7-8 in their contexts).</p>
