<A NAME="1730"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1050><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I have not run after you for the sake of disaster.&#8221; The translation follows the suggestion of some ancient versions. The Hebrew text reads &#8220;I have not run from being a shepherd after you.&#8221; The translation follows two Greek versions (Aquila and Symmachus) and the Syriac in reading the word &#8220;evil&#8221; or &#8220;disaster&#8221; here in place of the word &#8220;shepherd&#8221; in the Hebrew text. The issue is mainly one of vocalization. The versions mentioned are reading a form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mera</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>) instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1512;&#1465;&#1506;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mero</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eh</font>). There does not appear to be any clear case of a prophet being called a shepherd, especially in Jeremiah where it is invariably used of the wicked leaders/rulers of Judah, the leaders/rulers of the enemy that he brings to punish them, or the righteous ruler that he will bring in the future. Moreover, there are no cases where the preposition &#8220;after&#8221; is used with the verb &#8220;shepherd.&#8221; Parallelism also argues for the appropriateness of this reading; &#8220;disaster&#8221; parallels the &#8220;incurable day.&#8221; The thought also parallels the argument thus far. Other than 11:20; 12:3; 15:15 where he has prayed for vindication by the <sc>Lord punishing his persecutors as they deserve, he has invariably responded to the <sc>Lord&#8217;s word of disaster with laments and prayers for his people (see 4:19-21; 6:24; 8:18; 10:19-25; 14:7-9, 19-22).</p>
