<A NAME="1718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1038><b>tn</b> The term rendered &#8220;mind&#8221; here and in the previous verse is actually the Hebrew word for &#8220;heart.&#8221; However, in combination with the word rendered &#8220;heart&#8221; in the next line, which is the Hebrew for &#8220;kidneys,&#8221; it is best rendered &#8220;mind&#8221; because the &#8220;heart&#8221; was considered the center of intellect, conscience, and will and the &#8220;kidneys&#8221; the center of emotions.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> For an earlier reference to this motif see Jer 11:20. For a later reference see Jer 20:12. See also Ps 17:2-3.</p>
