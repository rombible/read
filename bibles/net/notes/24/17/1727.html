<A NAME="1727"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1047><b>tn</b> The translation fills in the details of the metaphor from a preceding context (15:18) and from the following context (17:18). The literal translation &#8220;Heal me and I will be healed. Rescue me and I will be rescued.&#8221; does not make much sense if these details are not filled in. The metaphor is filled in for clarity for the average reader.</p>
