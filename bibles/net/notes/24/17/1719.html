<A NAME="1719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1039><b>tn</b> The meaning of this line is somewhat uncertain. The word translated &#8220;broods over&#8221; occurs only here and Isa 34:15. It is often defined on the basis of an Aramaic cognate which means &#8220;to gather&#8221; with an extended meaning of &#8220;to gather together under her to hatch.&#8221; Many commentators go back to a Rabbinic explanation that the partridge steals the eggs of other birds and hatches them out only to see the birds depart when they recognize that she is not the mother. Modern studies question the validity of this zoologically. Moreover, W. L. Holladay contests the validity on the basis of the wording &#8220;and she does hatch them&#8221; (<i>Heb </i>&#8220;bring them to birth&#8221;). See W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah </i>(Hermeneia), 1:498, and see also P. C. Craigie, P. H. Kelley, J. F. Drinkard, <i>Jeremiah 1-25 </i>(WBC),<i> </i>229. The point of the comparison is that the rich gather their wealth but they do not get to see the fruits of it.</p>
