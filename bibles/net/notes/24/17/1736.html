<A NAME="1736"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1056><b>sn</b> The identity and location of the <i>People&#8217;s Gate</i> is uncertain since it is mentioned nowhere else in the Hebrew Bible. Some identify it with the Benjamin Gate mentioned in Jer 37:13; 38:7 (cf. NAB), but there is no textual support for this in the Hebrew Bible or in any of the ancient versions.</p>
