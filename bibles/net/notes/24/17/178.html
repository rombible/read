<A NAME="178"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1028><b>tc</b> This reading follows some of the ancient versions. The MT reads, &#8220;hills. My mountain in the open field [alluding to Jerusalem] and your wealth&#8230;I will give.&#8221; The vocalization of the noun plus pronoun and the unusual form of the expression to allude to Jerusalem calls into question the originality of the MT. The MT reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1458;&#1512;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">harari</font>) which combines the suffix for a singular noun with a pointing of the noun in the plural, a form which would be without parallel (compare the forms in Ps 30:8 for the singular noun with suffix and Deut 8:9 for the plural noun with suffix). Likewise, Jerusalem was not &#8220;in the open field.&#8221; For a similar expression compare Jer 13:27.</p>
