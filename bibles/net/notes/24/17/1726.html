<A NAME="1726"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1046><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The fountain of living water.&#8221; For an earlier use of this metaphor and the explanation of it see Jer 2:13 and the notes there. There does not appear to be any way to retain this metaphor in the text without explaining it. In the earlier text the context would show that literal water was not involved. Here it might still be assumed that the <sc>Lord merely gives life-giving water.</p>
