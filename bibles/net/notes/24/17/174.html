<A NAME="174"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1024><b>tn</b> This verse has been restructured for the sake of the English poetry: <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The sin of Judah is engraved [or written] with an iron pen, inscribed with a point of a diamond [or adamant] upon the tablet of their hearts and on the horns of their altars.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> There is biting sarcasm involved in the use of the figures here. The law was inscribed on the tablets of stone by the &#8220;finger&#8221; of God (Exod 31:18; 32:16). Later under the new covenant it would be written on their hearts (Jer 31:33). Blood was to be applied to the horns of the altar in offering the sin offering (cf., e.g., Lev 4:7, 18, 25, 20) and on the bronze altar to cleanse it from sin on the Day of Atonement (Lev 16:18). Here their sins are engraved (permanently written, cf. Job 19:24) on their hearts (i.e., control their thoughts and actions) and on their altars (permanently polluting them).</p>
