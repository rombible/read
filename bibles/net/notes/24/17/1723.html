<A NAME="1723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1043><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;O glorious throne, O high place from the beginning, O hope of Israel, O <sc>Lord.&#8221; Commentators and translators generally understand these four lines (which are three in the Hebrew original) as two predications, one eulogizing the temple and the other eulogizing God. However, that does not fit the context very well and does not take into account the nature of Jeremiah&#8217;s doxology in Jeremiah 16:19-20 (and compare also 10:6-7). There the doxology is context motivated, focused on God, and calls on relevant attributes in the form of metaphorical epithets. That fits nicely here as well. For the relevant parallel passages see the study note.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> As King and Judge seated on his heavenly throne on high the <sc>Lord metes out justice. For examples of this motif see Jer 25:30; Ps 11:4; 9:4, 7 (9:5, 8 HT). As the place of sanctuary he offers refuge for those who are fleeing for safety. Ezek 11:16 and Isa 18:1-4 are examples of passages using that motif. Finally, the <sc>Lord has been referred to earlier as the object of Israel&#8217;s hope (Jer 14:8). All of these are relevant to the choices that the <sc>Lord has placed before them, trust or turn away, and the threat that as all-knowing Judge he will reward people according to their behavior.</p>
