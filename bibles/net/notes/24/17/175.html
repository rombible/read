<A NAME="175"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1025><b>tn</b> It is difficult to convey in good English style the connection between this verse and the preceding. The text does not have a finite verb but a temporal preposition with an infinitive: <i>Heb</i> &#8220;while their children remember their altars&#8230;&#8221; It is also difficult to translate the verb &#8220;literally.&#8221; (i.e., what does &#8220;remember&#8221; their altars mean?). Hence it has been rendered &#8220;always think about.&#8221; Another possibility would be &#8220;have their altars&#8230;on their minds.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> There is possibly a sarcastic irony involved here as well. The Israelites were to remember the <sc>Lord and what he had done and were to commemorate certain days, e.g., the Passover and the Sabbath which recalled their deliverance. Instead they resorted to the pagan altars and kept them in mind.</p>
