<A NAME="1519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=962><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to me.&#8221; BDB 513 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font> 5.a(d) compares the usage of the preposition &#8220;to&#8221; here to that in Jonah 3:3, &#8220;Nineveh was a very great city to God [in God&#8217;s estimation].&#8221; The NEB/REB interpret as though it were the agent after a passive verb, &#8220;I have made widows more numerous.&#8221; Most English versions ignore it. The present translation follows BDB though the emphasis on God&#8217;s agency has been strong in the passage.</p>
