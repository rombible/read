<A NAME="1545"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=988><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;They must turn/return to you and you must not turn/return to them.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Once again the root &#8220;return&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shuv</font>) is being played on as in 3:1&#8211;4:4. See the threefold call to repentance in 3:12, 14, 22. The verb is used here four times &#8220;repent,&#8221; &#8220;restore,&#8221; and &#8220;become&#8221; twice. He is to serve as a model of repentance, not an imitator of their apostasy. In accusing God of being unreliable he was coming dangerously close to their kind of behavior.</p>
