<A NAME="1516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=959><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;The <sc>Lord continued&#8221; are not in the text. They have been supplied in the translation to show the shift back to talking about the people instead of addressing them. The obvious speaker is the <sc>Lord; the likely listener is Jeremiah as in vv. 1-4.</p>
