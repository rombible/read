<A NAME="155"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=948><b>tn</b> The translation attempts to render in understandable English some rather unusual uses of terms here. The verb translated &#8220;punish&#8221; is often used that way (cf. BDB 823 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font> Qal.A.3 and compare usage in Jer 11:22, 13:21). However, here it is accompanied by a direct object and a preposition meaning &#8220;over&#8221; which is usually used in the sense of appointing someone over someone (cf. BDB 823 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font> Qal.B.1 and compare usage in Jer 51:27). Moreover the word translated &#8220;different ways&#8221; normally refers to &#8220;families,&#8221; &#8220;clans,&#8221; or &#8220;guilds&#8221; (cf. BDB 1046-47 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font> for usage). Hence the four things mentioned are referred to figuratively as officers or agents into whose power the <sc>Lord consigns them. The Hebrew text reads: &#8220;I will appoint over them four guilds, the sword to kill, the dogs to drag away, the birds of the skies and the beasts of the earth to devour and to destroy.&#8221;</p>
