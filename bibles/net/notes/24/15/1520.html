<A NAME="1520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=963><b>tn</b> The translation of this line is a little uncertain because of the double prepositional phrase which is not represented in this translation or most of the others. The Hebrew text reads: &#8220;I will bring in to them, against mother of young men, a destroyer at noon time.&#8221; Many commentaries delete the phrase with the Greek text. If the preposition read &#8220;against&#8221; like the following one this would be a case of apposition of nearer definition. There is some evidence of that in the Targum and the Syriac according to <i>BHS</i>. Both nouns &#8220;mothers&#8221; and &#8220;young men&#8221; are translated as plural here though they are singular; they are treated by most as collectives. It would be tempting to translate these two lines &#8220;In broad daylight I have brought destroyers against the mothers of her fallen young men.&#8221; But this may be too interpretive. In the light of 6:4, noontime was a good time to attack. NJPS has &#8220;I will bring against them &#8211; young men and mothers together &#8211; &#8230;.&#8221; In this case &#8220;mother&#8221; and &#8220;young men&#8221; would be a case of asyndetic coordination.</p>
