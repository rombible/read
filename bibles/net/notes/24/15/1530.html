<A NAME="1530"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=973><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;A man of strife and a man of contention with all the land.&#8221; The &#8220;of&#8221; relationship (Hebrew and Greek genitive) can convey either subjective or objective relationships, i.e., he instigates strife and contention or he is the object of it. A study of usage elsewhere, e.g., Isa 41:11; Job 31:35; Prov 12:19; 25:24; 26:21; 27:15, is convincing that it is subjective. In his role as God&#8217;s covenant messenger charging people with wrong doing he has instigated counterarguments and stirred about strife and contention against him.</p>
