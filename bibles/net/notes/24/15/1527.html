<A NAME="1527"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=970><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will deliver those of them that survive to the sword before their enemies.&#8221; The referent of &#8220;them&#8221; is ambiguous. Does it refer to the children of the widow (nearer context) or the people themselves (more remote context, v. 7)? Perhaps it was meant to include both. Verse seven spoke of the destruction of the people and the killing off of the children.</p>
