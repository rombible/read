<A NAME="1518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=961><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;did not repent of their wicked ways&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;They did not turn back from their ways.&#8221; There is no casual particle here (either <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> [<font face="Scholar">ki</font>], which is more formally casual, or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;</font> [<font face="Scholar">vÿ</font>], which sometimes introduces casual circumstantial clauses). The causal idea is furnished by the connection of ideas. If the verbs throughout this section are treated as pasts and this section seen as a lament, then the clause could be sequential: &#8220;but they still did not turn&#8230;&#8221;</p>
