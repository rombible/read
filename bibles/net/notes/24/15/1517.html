<A NAME="1517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=960><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I have winnowed them with a winnowing fork in the gates of the land.&#8221; The word &#8220;gates&#8221; is here being used figuratively for the cities, the part for the whole. See 14:2 and the notes there.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Like straw blown away by the wind</i>. A figurative use of the process of winnowing is referred to here. Winnowing was the process whereby a mixture of grain and straw was thrown up into the wind to separate the grain from the straw and the husks. The best description of the major steps in threshing and winnowing grain in the Bible is seen in another figurative passage in Isa 41:15-16.</p>
