<A NAME="157"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=950><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;The <sc>Lord cried out&#8221; are not in the text. However, they are necessary to show the shift in address between speaking to Jeremiah in vv. 1-4 about the people and addressing Jerusalem in vv. 5-6 and the shift back to the address to Jeremiah in vv. 7-9. The words &#8220;oracle of the <sc>Lord&#8221; are, moreover, found at the beginning of v. 6.</p>
