<A NAME="154"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=947><b>tn</b> It is difficult to render the rhetorical force of this passage in meaningful English. The text answers the question &#8220;Where should we go?&#8221; with four brief staccato-like expressions with a play on the preposition &#8220;to&#8221;: <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Who to the death, to the death and who to the sword, to the sword and who to the starvation, to the starvation and who to the captivity, to the captivity.&#8221; The word &#8220;death&#8221; here is commonly understood to be a poetic substitute for &#8220;plague&#8221; because of the standard trio of sword, famine, and plague (see, e.g., 14:12 and the notes there). This is likely here and in 18:21. For further support see W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah </i>(Hermeneia), 1:440. The nuance &#8220;starvation&#8221; rather than &#8220;famine&#8221; has been chosen in the translation because the referents here are all things that accompany war.</p>
