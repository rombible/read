<A NAME="1512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=955><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you are going backward.&#8221; This is the only occurrence of this adverb with this verb. It is often used with another verb meaning &#8220;turn backward&#8221; (= abandon; <i>Heb</i> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;</font> [<font face="Scholar">sug</font>] in the Niphal). For examples see Jer 38:22; 46:5. The only other occurrence in Jeremiah has been in the unusual idiom in 7:24 where it was translated &#8220;they got worse and worse instead of better.&#8221; That is how J. Bright (<i>Jeremiah </i>[AB], 109) translates it here. However it is translated, it has connotations of apostasy.</p>
