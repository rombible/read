<A NAME="1524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=967><b>tn</b> The meaning of this line is debated. Some understand this line to mean &#8220;she has breathed out her life&#8221; (cf., e.g., BDB 656 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1495;</font> and 656 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1462;&#1504;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> 1.c). However, as several commentaries have noted (e.g., W. McKane, <i>Jeremiah</i> [ICC], 1:341; J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah</i> [AB], 109) it makes little sense to talk about her suffering shame and embarrassment if she has breathed her last. Both the Greek and Latin versions understand &#8220;soul&#8221; not as the object but as the subject and the idea being one of fainting under despair. This idea seems likely in light of the parallelism. Bright suggests the phrase means either &#8220;she gasped out her breath&#8221; or &#8220;her throat gasped.&#8221; The former is more likely. One might also render &#8220;she fainted dead away,&#8221; but that idiom might not be familiar to all readers.</p>
