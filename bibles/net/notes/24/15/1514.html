<A NAME="1514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=957><b>tn</b> There is a difference of opinion on how the verbs here and in the following verses are to be rendered, whether past or future. KJV, NASB, NIV for example render them as future. ASV, RSV, TEV render them as past. NJPS has past here and future in vv. 7-9. This is perhaps the best solution. The imperfect + <i>vav</i> consecutive here responds to the perfect in the first line. The imperfects + <i>vav</i> consecutives followed by perfects in vv. 7-9 and concluded by an imperfect in v. 9 pick up the perfects + <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutives in vv. 3-4. Verses 7-9 are further development of the theme in vv. 1-4. Verses 5-6 have been an apostrophe or a turning aside to address Jerusalem directly. For a somewhat similar alternation of the tenses see Isa 5:14-17 and consult GKC 329-30 §111.<i>w</i>. One could of course argue that the imperfects + <i>vav</i> consecutive in vv. 7-9 continue the imperfect + <i>vav</i> consecutive here. In this case, vv. 7-9 are not a continuation of the oracle of doom but another lament by God (cf. 14:1-6, 17-18).</p>
