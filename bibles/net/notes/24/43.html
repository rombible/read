<A NAME="431"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2357><b>tn</b> This sentence contains an emphasis that is impossible to translate into idiomatic English that would not sound redundant. In Hebrew the sentence reads: &#8220;When Jeremiah finished [the temporal subordination is left out here because it would make the sentence too long] telling all the people all the words [or all the things] which the <sc>Lord their God had sent him [to say] to them, namely all these words,&#8230;&#8221; The last phrase has been left out of the translation as already having been included. Though they have been left out of the translation, attention is called to their presence here.</p>
<A NAME="432"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2358><b>sn</b> See the study note on 42:1 for the possible identification of this man with Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite.</p>
<A NAME="433"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2359><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;is inciting you against us.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="434"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2360><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in order to give us into the hands of the Chaldeans.&#8221; The substitution &#8220;he wants to&#8221; as the equivalent of the purpose clause has been chosen to shorten the sentence to better conform with contemporary English style.</p>
<A NAME="435"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2361><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Chaldeans.&#8221; See the study note on 21:4 for explanation.</p>
<A NAME="436"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2362><b>sn</b> These are the people who are referred to in Jer 40:11-12.</p>
<A NAME="437"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2363><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the daughters of the king.&#8221; See the translator&#8217;s note on 41:10.</p>
<A NAME="438"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2364><b>sn</b> This refers to the group mentioned in Jer 40:7 and 41:10. The two groups together constituted all the people who were at Mizpah when Gedaliah was murdered, had been taken captive by Ishmael, had been rescued by Johanan and the other army officers, and had consulted Jeremiah at Geruth Chimham.</p>
<A NAME="439"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2365><b>sn</b> This had been their intention all along (41:17). Though they consulted the <sc>Lord and promised to do what he told them whether they agreed with it or not (42:5-6), it is clear that they had no intention of doing so. Jeremiah could see that (42:19-22). They refused to believe that the <sc>Lord had really said what Jeremiah told them (43:4) and feared reprisal from the Babylonians more than any potential destruction from the <sc>Lord (43:3).</p>
<A NAME="4310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2366><b>sn</b> <i>Tahpanhes</i> was an important fortress city on the northern border of Egypt in the northeastern Nile delta. It is generally equated with the Greek city of Daphne. It has already been mentioned in 2:16 in conjunction with Memphis (the Hebrew name is &#8220;Noph&#8221;) as a source of soldiers who did violence to the Israelites in the past.</p>
<A NAME="4311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2367><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The word of the <sc>Lord came to Jeremiah at Tahpanhes, saying.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2368><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Take some large stones in your hands.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2369><b>tn</b> The meaning of the expression &#8220;mortar of the clay pavement&#8221; is uncertain. The noun translated &#8220;mortar&#8221; occurs only here and the etymology is debated. Both BDB 572 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1496;</font> and KBL 529 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1496;</font> give the meaning &#8220;mortar.&#8221; The noun translated &#8220;clay pavement&#8221; is elsewhere used of a &#8220;brick mold.&#8221; Here BDB 527 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503;</font> 2 gives &#8220;quadrangle&#8221; and KBL 527 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503;</font> 2 gives &#8220;terrace of bricks.&#8221; <i>HALOT</i> 558 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1496;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503;</font> 2 give &#8220;loamy soil&#8221; for both words, seeing the second noun as a dittography or gloss of the first (see also note c in <i>BHS</i>).</p>
<A NAME="4314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2370><b>sn</b> All the commentaries point out that this was not Pharaoh&#8217;s (main) palace but a governor&#8217;s residence or other government building that Pharaoh occupied when he was in Tahpanhes.</p>
<A NAME="4315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2371><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in Tahpanhes in the eyes of the men of Judah.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2372><b>sn</b> This is another of those symbolic prophecies of Jeremiah which involved an action and an explanation. Compare Jer 19, 27.</p>
<A NAME="4317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2373><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Yahweh of armies, the God of Israel.&#8221; Compare 7:3 and see the study note on 2:19 for explanation of the translation and significance of this title.</p>
<A NAME="4318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2374><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;send and take/fetch.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2375><b>sn</b> See the study note on Jer 25:9 for the use of this epithet for foreign rulers. The term emphasizes God&#8217;s sovereignty over history.</p>
<A NAME="4320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2376><b>tn</b> The Greek version reads the verbs in this sentence as third person, &#8220;he will set,&#8221; and second person, &#8220;you have buried.&#8221; This fits the context better but it is difficult to explain how the Hebrew could have arisen from this smoother reading. The figure of substitution (metonymy of cause for effect) is probably involved: &#8220;I will have him set&#8221; and &#8220;I have had you bury.&#8221; The effect of these substitutions is to emphasize the sovereignty of God.</p>
<A NAME="4321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2377><b>tn</b> The meaning of this word is uncertain. The word here (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;</font> [<font face="Scholar">shafriro</font>] <i>Qere</i>, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;</font> [<font face="Scholar">shafruro</font>] <i>Kethib</i>) occurs only here in the Hebrew Bible. According to the lexicons it refers to either the carpet for his throne or the canopy over it. See, e.g., <i>HALOT</i> 1510 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font>.</p>
<A NAME="4322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2378><b>tn</b> As in 15:2 the Hebrew is very brief and staccato-like: &#8220;those to death to death, and those to captivity to captivity, and those to the sword to the sword.&#8221; As in 15:2 most commentaries and English versions assume that the word &#8220;death&#8221; refers to death by disease. See the translator&#8217;s note on 15:2 and compare also 18:21 where the sword is distinctly connected with &#8220;war&#8221; or &#8220;battle&#8221; and is distinct from &#8220;killed by death [i.e., disease].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2379><b>tc</b> The translation follows the Greek, Syriac, and Latin versions. The Hebrew text reads: &#8220;I will set fire to.&#8221; While it would be possible to explain the first person subject here in the same way as in the two verbs in v. 12b, the corruption of the Hebrew text is easy to explain here as a metathesis of two letters, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yod</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tav</font>). The Hebrew reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hitsatti</font>) and the versions presuppose <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hitsit</font>).</p>
<A NAME="4324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2380><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;burn them or carry them off as captives.&#8221; Some of the commentaries and English versions make a distinction between the objects of the verbs, i.e., burn the temples and carry off the gods. However, the burning down of the temples is referred to later in v. 13.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> It was typical in the ancient Near East for the images of the gods of vanquished nations to be carried off and displayed in triumphal procession on the return from battle to show the superiority of the victor&#8217;s gods over those of the vanquished (cf., e.g., Isa 46:1-2).</p>
<A NAME="4325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2381><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;he will take over Egypt as easily as a shepherd wraps his cloak around him.&#8221; The translation follows the interpretation of <i>HALOT</i> 769 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1464;&#1506;&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;</font> Qal, the Greek translation, and a number of the modern commentaries (e.g., J. A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah </i>[NICOT], 671). The only other passage where that translation is suggested for this verb is Isa 22:17 according to <i>HAL</i>. The alternate translation follows the more normal meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">atah</font>; cf. BDB 741 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;</font> Qal which explains &#8220;so completely will it be in his power&#8221;). The fact that the subject is &#8220;a shepherd&#8221; lends more credence to the former view though there may be a deliberate double meaning playing on the homonyms (cf. W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah </i>[Hermeneia], 2:302).</p>
<A NAME="4326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2382><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in peace/wholeness/well-being/safety [<i>shalom</i>].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2383><b>sn</b> It is generally agreed that <i>the temple of the sun</i> was located in Heliopolis, which is elsewhere referred to as On (cf. Gen 41:45). It was the center for the worship of Amon-Re, the Egyptian sun god, and was famous for its obelisks (conical shaped pillars) dedicated to that god. It was located about 6 miles (10 km) northeast of modern-day Cairo.</p>
