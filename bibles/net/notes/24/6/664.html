<A NAME="664"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=405><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;We have lost our strength to do battle&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Our hands hang limp [or helpless at our sides].&#8221; According to BDB 951 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1508;&#1464;&#1492;</font> Qal.2, this idiom is used figuratively for losing heart or energy. The best example of its figurative use of loss of strength or the feeling of helplessness is in Ezek 21:12 where it appears in the context of the heart (courage) melting, the spirit sinking, and the knees becoming like water. For other examples compare 2 Sam 4:1; Zeph 3:16. In Neh 6:9 it is used literally of the builders &#8220;dropping their hands from the work&#8221; out of fear. The words &#8220;with fear&#8221; are supplied in the translation because they are implicit in the context.</p>
