<A NAME="614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=355><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Woe to us!&#8221; For the usage of this phrase see the translator&#8217;s note on 4:13. The usage of this particle here is a little exaggerated. They have lost the most advantageous time for attack but they are scarcely in a hopeless or doomed situation. The equivalent in English slang is &#8220;Bad news!&#8221;</p>
