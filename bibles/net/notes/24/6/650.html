<A NAME="650"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=391><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Know, congregation [or witness], what in [or against] them.&#8221; The meaning of this line is somewhat uncertain. The meaning of the noun of address in the second line (&#8220;witness,&#8221; rendered as an imperative in the translation, &#8220;Be witnesses&#8221;) is greatly debated. It is often taken as &#8220;congregation&#8221; but the lexicons and commentaries generally question the validity of reading that word since it is nowhere else applied to the nations. BDB 417 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font> 3 says that the text is dubious. <i>HALOT</i> 747 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, 4 emends the text to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1461;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">de</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>). Several modern English versions (e.g., NIV, NCV, God&#8217;s Word) take it as the feminine singular noun &#8220;witness&#8221; (cf. BDB 729 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font>) and understand it as a collective. This solution is also proposed by J. A. Thompson (<i>Jeremiah </i>[NICOT], 259, n. 3) and appears to make the best sense in the context. The end of the line is very elliptical but is generally taken as either, &#8220;what I will do with/to them,&#8221; or &#8220;what is coming against them&#8221; (= &#8220;what will happen to them&#8221;) on the basis of the following context.</p>
