<A NAME="613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=354><b>tn</b> These words are not in the text but are supplied in the translation for clarity. Some commentaries and English versions see these not as the words of the enemy but as those of the Israelites expressing their fear that the enemy will launch a night attack against them and further destroy them. The connection with the next verse, however, fits better with them if they are the words of the enemy.</p>
