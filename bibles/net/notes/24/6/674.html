<A NAME="674"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=415><b>tn</b> These words are not in the text but are supplied in the translation for clarity. Some takes these words to be the continuation of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s commission of Jeremiah to the task of testing them. However, since this is the evaluation, the task appears to be complete. The words are better to be taken as Jeremiah&#8217;s report after he has completed the task.</p>
