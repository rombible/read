<A NAME="67"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=348><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The beautiful and delicate one I will destroy, the daughter of Zion. The English versions and commentaries are divided over the rendering of this verse because (1) there are two verbs with these same consonants, one meaning &#8220;to be like&#8221; and the other meaning &#8220;to be destroyed&#8221; (intransitive) or &#8220;to destroy&#8221; (transitive), and (2) the word rendered &#8220;beautiful&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">navah</font>) can be understood as a noun meaning &#8220;pasture&#8221; or as a defective writing of an adjective meaning &#8220;beautiful, comely&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">na</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">vah</font>). Hence some render &#8220;Fair Zion, you are like a lovely pasture,&#8221; reading the verb form as an example of the old second feminine singular perfect. Although this may fit the imagery of the next verse, that rendering ignores the absence of a preposition (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font> or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">lÿ </font>or<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>, both of which can be translated &#8220;to&#8221;) that normally goes with the verb &#8220;be like&#8221; and drops the conjunction in front of the adjective &#8220;delicate.&#8221; The parallel usage of the verb in Hos 4:5 argues for the meaning &#8220;destroy.&#8221;</p>
