<A NAME="64"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=345><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;[It will be] a severe fracture.&#8221; The nation is pictured as a limb being fractured.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This passage is emotionally charged. There are two examples of assonance or wordplay in the verse: &#8220;sound&#8221; (Heb <font face="Scholar">tiq</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">u</font>, &#8220;blow&#8221;), which has the same consonants as &#8220;Tekoa&#8221; (Heb <font face="Scholar">uvitqoa</font>&#8217;), and &#8220;signal fire,&#8221; which comes from the same root as &#8220;light&#8221; (Heb <font face="Scholar">sÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">u mas</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et</font>, &#8220;lift up&#8221;). There is also an example of personification where disaster is said to &#8220;lurk&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;look down on&#8221;) out of the north. This gives a sense of urgency and concern for the coming destruction.</p>
