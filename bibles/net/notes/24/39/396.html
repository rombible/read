<A NAME="396"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2237><b>sn</b> The <i>king&#8217;s garden</i> is mentioned again in Neh 3:15 in conjunction with the pool of Siloam and the stairs that go down from the city of David. This would have been in the southern part of the city near the Tyropean Valley which agrees with the reference to the &#8220;two walls&#8221; which were probably the walls on the eastern and western hills.</p>
