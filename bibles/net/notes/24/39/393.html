<A NAME="393"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2234><b>tn</b> English versions and commentaries differ on the number of officials named here and the exact spelling of their names. For a good discussion of the options see F. B. Huey, <i>Jeremiah, Lamentations </i>(NAC), 341, n. 71. Most commentaries follow the general lead of J. Bright (<i>Jeremiah </i>[AB], 243) as the present translation has done here. However, the second name is not emended on the basis of v. 13 as Bright does, nor is the second Nergal-Sharezer regarded as the same man as the first and the information on the two combined as he does. The first Nergal-Sharezer is generally identified on the basis of Babylonian records as the man who usurped the throne from Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s son, Awel-Marduk or Evil-Merodach as he is known in the OT (Jer 52:31; 2 Kgs 25:27). The present translation renders the two technical Babylonian terms &#8220;Rab-Saris&#8221; (only in Jer 39:3, 13; 2 Kgs 18:17) and &#8220;Rab-Mag&#8221; (only in Jer 39:3, 13) as &#8220;chief officer&#8221; and &#8220;high official&#8221; without knowing precisely what offices they held. This has been done to give the modern reader some feeling of their high position without specifying exactly what their precise positions were (i.e., the generic has been used for the [unknown] specific).</p>
