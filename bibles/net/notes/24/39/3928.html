<A NAME="3928"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2259><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Now the word of the <sc>Lord came to Jeremiah while he&#8230;saying.&#8221; The form of this clause is disjunctive showing that it does not follow the preceding events in either chronological or logical sequence. For a discussion of the form and function of such disjunctive clauses see <i>IBHS</i> 650-52 §39.2.3. This example most closely fits the description and function of example 12, Ruth 4:18, 21-22 on p. 652.</p>
