<A NAME="3925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2256><b>tn</b> The meaning of the last phrase is uncertain. An alternate translation is &#8220;to take him home with him.&#8221; The text reads literally &#8220;to bring him into the house.&#8221; However, it is unclear whether &#8220;the house&#8221; refers to Jeremiah&#8217;s house or to Gedaliah&#8217;s. The fact that Nebuzaradan later offers Jeremiah the option of going back to Gedaliah (40:5) suggests that the house is here Gedaliah&#8217;s where Jeremiah would be looked out for in accord with Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s command (v. 12).</p>
