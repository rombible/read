<A NAME="395"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2236><b>tn</b> The Hebrew style here is typically full or redundant, giving a general subject first and then listing the specifics. The Hebrew<i> </i>text reads: &#8220;Then all the officers of the king of Babylon came and sat in the Middle Gate, Nergal-Sharezer&#8230;and all the rest of the officers of the king of Babylon.&#8221; In the translation the general subject has been eliminated and the list of the &#8220;real&#8221; subjects used instead; this eliminates the dashes or commas typical of some modern English versions.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The identification of the location of the <i>Middle Gate</i> is uncertain since it is mentioned nowhere else in the OT.</p>
