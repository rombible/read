<A NAME="3929"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2260><b>sn</b> Even though Jeremiah was confined to the courtyard of the guardhouse, he was still free to entertain visitors (32:2, 8). Moreover, Ebed-Melech was an official attached to the royal court and would have had access to the courtyard of the guardhouse (38:7, 13). Jeremiah would not have had to leave the courtyard of the guardhouse to &#8220;go and tell&#8221; him something.</p>
