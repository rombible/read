<A NAME="3926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2257><b>tn</b> Many translate this last clause as a conclusion or summary remark, &#8220;So Jeremiah stayed&#8230;&#8221; However, it is better to translate it as an adversative because it probably refers to the fact that rather than staying with Gedaliah in the governor&#8217;s residence Jeremiah stayed among the people. That is how he wound up being led off as a prisoner to Ramah. See further the study note on 40:1. According to <i>IBHS</i> 550 §33.2.1d the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive can have either of these values (see examples 11 and 12 for the adversative or contrastive nuance).</p>
