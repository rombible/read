<A NAME="3917"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2248><b>tc</b> The translation is based on an emendation of the text which leaves out &#8220;the rest of the people who were left&#8221; as a double writing of the same phrase at the beginning of the verse. Some commentators emend the phrase &#8220;the rest of the people who were left&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1514; &#1497;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512; &#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hannish</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arim vÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et yeter ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">am</font>) to read &#8220;the rest of the craftsmen who were left&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1514; &#1497;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512; &#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503; &#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">vÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et yeter ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amon hannish</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arim</font>) on the basis of the parallel in Jer 52:15 (which does not have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hannish</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arim</font>). However, it is easier to explain the phrase as a dittography of the phrase at the beginning (which is exactly the same except <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font> [<font face="Scholar">ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ir</font>] follows it). The text is redundant because it refers twice to the same group of people. The Hebrew text reads: &#8220;And the rest of the people who were left in the city and the deserters who had deserted to him and the rest of the people Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, carried into exile to Babylon.&#8221; The text has also been divided up to create two shorter sentences to better conform with contemporary English style.</p>
