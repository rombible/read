They will destroy all the walls surrounding it and also destroy all the towns in Judah.&#8221; The text of v. 15b reads in Hebrew, &#8220;they will each set up his throne [near? in?] the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem and against all its walls&#8230;and against all the towns&#8230;.&#8221; Commentators are divided over whether the passage refers to the kings setting up their thrones after victory in preparation for passing judgment on their defeated enemies in the city or whether it refers to setting up siege against it. There is no Hebrew preposition before the word for &#8220;the entrance&#8221; so that it could be &#8220;in&#8221; (which would imply victory) or &#8220;at/near&#8221; (which would imply siege), and the same verb + object (i.e., &#8220;they will set up their thrones&#8221;) governs all the locative statements. It is most often taken to refer to the aftermath of victory because of the supposed parallel in Jer 43:8-13 and the supposed fulfillment in Jer 39:3. Though this may fit well with the first part of the compound expression, it does not fit well with the latter part which is most naturally taken to refer to hostile attacks against Jerusalem and the other cities of Judah. The translation given in the text is intended to reflect the idea of an army setting up for siege. The alternate translation is intended to reflect the other view. </p>
