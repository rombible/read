<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to whom the word of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> came.&#8221; The present translation is more in keeping with contemporary English idiom. The idea of &#8220;<i>began</i> to speak&#8221; comes from the context where the conclusion of his speaking is signaled by the phrases &#8220;until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah&#8221; and &#8220;until the people of Jerusalem were taken into exile&#8221; in v. 3.</p>
