<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;This is a record of what Jeremiah prophesied and did&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The words [or affairs] of Jeremiah.&#8221; The phrase could refer to either the messages of Jeremiah recorded in the book or to both his messages and the biographical (and autobiographical) narratives recorded about him in the book. Since the phrase is intended to serve as the title or superscription for the whole book and recurs again in 51:64 at the end of the book before the final appendix, it might refer to the latter. The expression &#8220;The words of [someone]&#8221; is a standard introductory formula (Deut 29:1[28:69]; 2 Sam 23:1; Amos 1:1; Eccl 1:1; Neh 1:1).</p>
