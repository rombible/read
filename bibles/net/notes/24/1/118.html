<a name="118"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=18><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I appoint you today over nations and kingdoms to uproot&#8230;.&#8221; The phrase refers to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> giving Jeremiah authority as a prophet to declare what he, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, will do; it does not mean that Jeremiah himself will do these things. The expression involves a figure of speech where the subject of a declaration is stated instead of the declaration about it. Compare a similar use of the same figure in Gen 41:13.</p>
