<a name="131"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=31><b>tn</b> The name &#8220;Jeremiah&#8221; is not in the text. The use of the personal pronoun followed by the proper name is an attempt to reflect the correlative emphasis between Jeremiah&#8217;s responsibility noted here and the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s promise noted in the next verse. The emphasis in the Hebrew text is marked by the presence of the subject pronouns at the beginning of each of the two verses.</p>
