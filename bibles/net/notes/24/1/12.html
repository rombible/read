<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2><b>sn</b> The translation reflects the ancient Jewish tradition of substituting the word for &#8220;Lord&#8221; for the proper name for Israel&#8217;s God which is now generally agreed to have been Yahweh. Jewish scribes wrote the consonants<span class="smallcaps"> YHWH </span>but substituted the vowels for the word &#8220;Lord.&#8221; The practice of calling him &#8220;Lord&#8221; rather than using his proper name is also reflected in the Greek translation which is the oldest translation of the Hebrew Bible. The meaning of the name Yahweh occurs in Exod 3:13-14 where God identifies himself as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and tells Moses that his name is &#8220;I am&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1492;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">ehyeh</font>). However, he instructs the Israelites to refer to him as <span class="smallcaps">YHWH</span> (&#8220;Yahweh&#8221; = &#8220;He is&#8221;); see further Exod 34:5-6.</p>
