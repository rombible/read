<a name="112"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=12><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I am a boy/youth.&#8221; The Hebrew word can refer to an infant (Exod 2:6), a young boy (1 Sam 2:11), a teenager (Gen 21:12), or a young man (2 Sam 18:5). The translation is deliberately ambiguous since it is unclear how old Jeremiah was when he was called to begin prophesying. </p>
