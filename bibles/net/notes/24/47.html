<A NAME="471"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2505><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;That which came [as] the word of the <sc>Lord to Jeremiah.&#8221; For this same construction see 14:1; 46:1 and see the translator&#8217;s note at 14:1 for explanation.</p>
<A NAME="472"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2506><b>sn</b> The precise dating of this prophecy is uncertain. Several proposals have been suggested, the most likely of which is that the prophecy was delivered in 609 <sc>b.c. in conjunction with Pharaoh Necho&#8217;s advance into Palestine to aid the Assyrians. That was the same year that Josiah was killed by Necho at the battle of Megiddo and four years before Necho was defeated by Nebuchadnezzar, the foe from the north. The prophecy presupposes that Ashkelon is still in existence (v. 5) hence it must be before 604 <sc>b.c. For a fairly complete discussion of the options see G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, T. G. Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52 </i>(WBC),<i> </i>299-300.</p>
<A NAME="473"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2507><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Behold! Waters are rising from the north.&#8221; The metaphor of enemy armies compared to overflowing water is seen also in Isa 8:8-9 (Assyria) and 46:7-8 (Egypt). Here it refers to the foe from the north (Jer 1:14; 4:6; etc) which is specifically identified with Babylon in Jer 25. The metaphor has been turned into a simile in the translation to help the average reader identify that a figure is involved and to hint at the referent.</p>
<A NAME="474"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2508><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;From the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his stallions, from the rattling of his chariots at the rumbling of their wheels, fathers will not turn to their children from sinking of hands.&#8221; According to BDB 952 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> the &#8220;sinking of the hands&#8221; is figurative of helplessness caused by terror. A very similar figure is seen with a related expression in Isa 35:3-4. The sentence has been restructured to put the subject up front and to suggest through shorter sentences more in keeping with contemporary English style the same causal connections. The figures have been interpreted for the sake of clarity for the average reader.</p>
<A NAME="475"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2509><b>map</b> For location see Map1-A2; Map2-G2; Map4-A1; JP3-F3; JP4-F3.</p>
<A NAME="476"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2510><b>map</b> For location see Map1-A1; JP3-F3; JP4-F3.</p>
<A NAME="477"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2511><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;For the <sc>Lord will.&#8221; The first person style has been adopted because the <sc>Lord is speaking (cf. v. 2).</p>
<A NAME="478"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2512><b>sn</b> <i>All the help that remains for Tyre and Sidon</i> and <i>that remnant that came from the island of Crete</i> appear to be two qualifying phrases that refer to the Philistines, the last with regard to their origin and the first with regard to the fact that they were allies that Tyre and Sidon depended on. &#8220;Crete&#8221; is literally &#8220;Caphtor&#8221; which is generally identified with the island of Crete. The Philistines had come from there (Amos 9:7) in the wave of migration from the Aegean Islands during the twelfth and eleventh century and had settled on the Philistine plain after having been repulsed from trying to enter Egypt.</p>
<A NAME="479"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2513><b>sn</b> Shaving one&#8217;s head and gashing one&#8217;s body were customs to show mourning or sadness for the dead (cf. Deut 14:1; Mic 1:16; Ezek 27:31; Jer 16:6; 48:37).</p>
<A NAME="4710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2514><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;you who are left alive on the Philistine plain.&#8221; Or &#8220;you who remain of the Anakim.&#8221; The translation follows the suggestion of several of the modern commentaries that the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1502;&#1462;&#1511;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">emeq</font>) means &#8220;strength&#8221; or &#8220;power&#8221; here (see J. A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah </i>[NICOT], 698; J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah </i>[AB], 310; and see also <i>HALOT</i> 803 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1502;&#1462;&#1511;</font>). It is a rare homonym of the word that normally means &#8220;valley&#8221; that seems to be an inappropriate designation of the Philistine plain. Many of the modern English versions and commentaries follow the Greek version which reads here &#8220;remnant of the Anakim&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anaqim</font>] instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1511;&#1464;&#1501;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">imqam</font>], a confusion of basically one letter). This emendation is followed by both BDB 771 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1502;&#1462;&#1511;</font> and KBL 716 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1502;&#1462;&#1511;</font>. The Anakim were generally associated with the southern region around Hebron but an enclave of them was known to have settled in Gaza, Gath, and Ekron, three of the Philistine cities (cf. Josh 11:22). However, the fact that this judgment is directed against the Philistines not the Anakim and that this homonym apparently appears also in Jer 49:4 makes the reading of &#8220;power&#8221; more likely here.</p>
<A NAME="4711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2515><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;How long will you cry out&#8221; are not in the text but some such introduction seems necessary because the rest of the speech assumes a personal subject.</p>
<A NAME="4712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2516><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;before you are quiet/at rest.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2517><b>sn</b> The passage is highly figurative. The sword of the <sc>Lord, which is itself a figure of the destructive agency of the enemy armies, is here addressed as a person and is encouraged in rhetorical questions (the questions are designed to dissuade) to &#8220;be quiet,&#8221; &#8220;be at rest,&#8221; &#8220;be silent,&#8221; all of which is designed to get the <sc>Lord to call off the destruction against the Philistines.</p>
<A NAME="4714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2518><b>tn</b> The reading here follows the Greek, Syriac, and Latin versions. The Hebrew text reads &#8220;how can you rest&#8221; as a continuation of the second person in v. 6.</p>
<A NAME="4715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2519><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;When the <sc>Lord has.&#8221; The first person is again adopted because the <sc>Lord has been speaking.</p>
<A NAME="4716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2520><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Against Ashkelon and the sea coast, there he has appointed it.&#8221; For the switch to the first person see the preceding translator&#8217;s note. &#8220;There&#8221; is poetical and redundant and the idea of &#8220;attacking&#8221; is implicit in &#8220;against.&#8221;</p>
