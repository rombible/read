From vv. 7-8 it appears that they were a nomadic tribe that had resisted settling down and taking up farming. They had also agreed to abstain from drinking wine. Most scholars agree in equating the Jonadab son of Rechab mentioned as the leader who had instituted these strictures as the same Jonadab who assisted Jehu in his religious purge of Baalism following the reign of Ahab (2 Kgs 10:15, 23-24). If this is the case, the Rechabites followed these same rules for almost 250 years because Jehu&#8217;s purge of Baalism and the beginning of his reign was in 841 <sc>b.c. and the incident here took place some time after Jehoiakim&#8217;s rebellion in 603 <sc>b.c. (see the study note on v. 1).</p>
