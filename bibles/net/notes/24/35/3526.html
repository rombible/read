<A NAME="3526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2064><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;this people.&#8221; However, the speech is addressed to the people of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem, so the second person is retained in English. In addition to the stylistic difference that Hebrew exhibits in the rapid shift between persons (second to third and third to second, which have repeatedly been noted and documented from GKC 462 §144.<i>p</i>) there may be a subtle rhetorical reason for the shift here. The shift from direct address to indirect address which characterizes this verse and the next may reflect the <sc>Lord&#8217;s rejection of the people he is addressing. A similar shift takes place in Wisdom&#8217;s address to the simple minded, fools, and mockers in Prov 1:28-32 after the direct address of 1:22-27.</p>
