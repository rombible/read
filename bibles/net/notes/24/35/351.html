<A NAME="351"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2039><b>sn</b> The introductory statement here shows that this incident is earlier than those in Jer 32&#8211;34 which all take place in the reign of Zedekiah. Jehoiakim ruled from 609/8 <sc>b.c. until 598/97 <sc>b.c. and his brother Zedekiah followed him after a brief reign of three months by Jehoiakim&#8217;s son who was captured by Nebuchadnezzar and taken to Babylon. Zedekiah ruled from 598/7 <sc>b.c. until the kingdom fell in 587/86. The position of this chapter is out of chronological order emphasizing the theme of covenant infidelity (Jer 34; 35:12-17) versus the faithfulness to his commands that God expected from Israel as illustrated by the Rechabites&#8217; faithfulness to the commands of their progenitor. This is thus another one of those symbolic acts in Jeremiah which have significance to the message of the book (compare Jer 13, 19). This incident likely took place during the time that people living in the countryside like the Rechabites were forced to take shelter in the fortified cities because of the raiding parties that Nebuchadnezzar had sent against Jehoiakim after he had rebelled against him in 603 <sc>b.c. (compare v. 11 and Jer 4:5 with 2 Kgs 24:1-2).</p>
