<A NAME="3342"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1989><b>tn</b> The very complex and elliptical syntax of the original Hebrew of vv. 20-21 has been broken down to better conform with contemporary English style. The text reads somewhat literally (after the addition of a couple of phrases which have been left out by ellipsis): &#8220;Thus says the <sc>Lord, &#8216;If you can break my covenant with the day and my covenant with the night so that there is not to be daytime and night in their proper time then also my covenant can be broken with my servant David so that there is not to him a son reigning upon his throne [and also my covenant can be broken] with the Levites [so there are not] priests who minister to me.&#8221; The two phrases in brackets are elliptical, the first serving double duty for the prepositional phrase &#8220;with the Levites&#8221; as well as &#8220;with David&#8221; and the second serving double duty with the noun &#8220;priests&#8221; which parallels &#8220;a son.&#8221; The noun &#8220;priests&#8221; is not serving here as appositional because that phrase is always &#8220;the priests, the Levites,&#8221; never &#8220;the Levites, the priests.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This refers to a reaffirmation of the Davidic covenant (cf., e.g., 2 Sam 7:11-16, 25-29; Ps 89:3-4, 19-29) and God&#8217;s covenant with the Levites (cf. Num 25:10-13; Mal 2:4-6; Deut 32:8-11).</p>
