<A NAME="334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1951><b>tn</b> This passive participle or adjective is normally used to describe cities or walls as &#8220;fortified&#8221; or &#8220;inaccessible.&#8221; All the lexicons, however, agree in seeing it used here metaphorically of &#8220;secret&#8221; or &#8220;mysterious&#8221; things, things that Jeremiah could not know apart from the <sc>Lord&#8217;s revelation. G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, and T. G. Smothers (<i>Jeremiah 26-52 </i>[WBC], 170) make the interesting observation that the word is used here in a context in which the fortifications of Jerusalem are about to fall to the Babylonians; the fortified things in God&#8217;s secret counsel fall through answer to prayer.</p>
