<A NAME="3330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1977><b>sn</b> This refers at the very least to the promises of Jer 23:5-6, 7-8; 30:3; 31:27, 31 where the same formula &#8220;The time will certainly come (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;Behold the days are coming&#8221;)&#8221; occurs. Reference may also be to the promises through the earlier prophets of what is alluded to here, i.e., the restoration of Israel and Judah under a Davidic ruler and the revival of the offerings (cf. Hos 1:10-11; 3:4-5; Amos 9:11-12; Isa 11:1-5, 10-16; Jer 30:9, 21 for the former and Jer 31:14; 33:11 for the latter).</p>
