<A NAME="3339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1986><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Thus says the <sc>Lord.&#8221; However, the <sc>Lord is speaking so the first person introduction has again been adopted. The content of the verse shows that it is a promise to David (vv. 21-22) and the Levites based on a contrary to fact condition (v. 20). See further the translator&#8217;s note at the end of the next verse for explanation of the English structure adopted here.</p>
