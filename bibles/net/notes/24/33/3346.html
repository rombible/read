<A NAME="3346"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1993><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The two families which the <sc>Lord chose, he has rejected them.&#8221; This is an example of an object prepositioned before the verb and resumed by a redundant pronoun to throw emphasis of focus on it (called <i>casus pendens</i> in the grammars; cf. GKC 458 §143.<i>d</i>). Some commentators identify the &#8220;two families&#8221; as those of David and Levi mentioned in the previous verses, and some identify them as the families of the Israelites and of David mentioned in the next verse. However, the next clause in this verse and the emphasis on the restoration and regathering of Israel and Judah in this section (cf. 33:7, 14) show that the reference is to Israel and Judah (see also 30:3, 4; 31:27, 31 and 3:18).</p>
