<A NAME="3334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1981><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And this is what will be called to it: &#8216;The <sc>Lord our righteousness.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> For the significance of this title see the study note on the parallel text in 23:6. Other titles by which Jerusalem is to be known are found in Isa 62:2-4; Jer 3:17; Ezek 48:35; Zech 8:3 emphasizing that the <sc>Lord takes up his relation with it once again, dwells in it, delights in it, and finds it faithful once more (cf. Isa 1:26). In 23:6 the title is applied to the Davidic ruler that the <sc>Lord will raise up over them who will do what is just and right. God&#8217;s vindication of the city by its restoration after exile and his provision of this just ruler over it is the probable source for the title.</p>
