<A NAME="339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1956><b>tn</b> The translation and meaning of vv. 4-5 are somewhat uncertain. The translation and precise meaning of vv. 4-5 are uncertain at a number of points due to some difficult syntactical constructions and some debate about the text and meaning of several words. The text reads more literally, &#8220;<b>33:4</b> For thus says the <sc>Lord, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah which have been torn down on account the siege ramps and the sword <b>33:5</b> going to fight the Chaldeans and to fill them with the dead bodies of the men whom I have killed in my anger and in my wrath and on account of all whose wickedness I have hidden my face from this city.&#8221; There are two difficult syntactical forms (1) the participle at the beginning of v. 5 &#8220;going [or those going] to fight&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>) and (2) the infinitive plus suffix that introduces the next clause &#8220;and to fill them&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ulÿmal</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">am</font>). The translation has interpreted the former as a verbal use of the participle with an indefinite subject &#8220;they&#8221; (= the defenders of Jerusalem who have torn down the buildings; cf. GKC 460-61 §144.<i>i</i> for this point of grammar). The conjunction plus preposition plus infinitive construct has been interpreted as equivalent to a finite verb (cf. <i>IBHS</i> 611 §36.3.2a, i.e., &#8220;and they will fill them [the houses and buildings of v. 4]&#8221;). Adopting the Greek text of these two verses would produce a smoother reading. It reads &#8220;For thus says the <sc>Lord concerning the houses of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah which have been pulled down for mounds and fortifications to fight against the Chaldeans and to fill it [should be &#8220;them&#8221;] with the corpses of men whom I smote in my anger and my wrath and I turned away my face from them [rather than from &#8220;this city&#8221; of the Hebrew text] for all their wickedness: Behold I will&#8230;&#8221; The Greek does not have the problem with the participle because it has seen it as part of a word meaning fortification. This also eliminates the problem with the infinitive because it is interpreted as parallel with &#8220;to fight.&#8221; I.e., the defenders used these torn-down buildings for defensive fortifications and for burial places. It would be tempting to follow this reading. However, there is no graphically close form for &#8220;fortification&#8221; that would explain how the more difficult <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hekharev ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>) of the Hebrew text arose and there is doubt whether <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1465;&#1500;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">solÿlot</font>) can refer to a defense mound. W. L. Holladay (<i>Jeremiah </i>[Hermeneia], 2:221, 225) has suggested reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hakharakim</font>) in place of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hekharev</font>) in the technical sense of &#8220;crenels,&#8221; the gaps between the raised portion on top of the wall (which raised portion he calls &#8220;merlons&#8221; and equates with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1465;&#1500;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">solÿlot</font>). He does not, however, further suggest seeing <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>) as part of this corrupted form, choosing to see it rather as a gloss. His emendation and interpretation, however, have been justly criticized as violating the usage of both <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1465;&#1500;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> which is elsewhere &#8220;siege mound&#8221; and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kharakim</font>) which elsewhere refers only to the latticed opening of a window (Song 2:9). Until a more acceptable explanation of how the difficult Hebrew text could have arisen from the Greek, the Hebrew should be retained, though it is admittedly awkward. G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, and T. G. Smothers (<i>Jeremiah 26-52 </i>[WBC],<i> </i>166, 172) have perhaps the best discussion of the issues and the options involved here.</p>
