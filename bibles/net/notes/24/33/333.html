<A NAME="333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1950><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I, the <sc>Lord, made the earth. I formed it in such a way as to firmly establish it&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Thus says the <sc>Lord who makes/does it, the <sc>Lord who forms it to establish it, whose name is the <sc>Lord.&#8221; It is unclear what the antecedent of &#8220;it&#8221; is. The Greek version supplies the object &#8220;the earth.&#8221; However, as D. Barthélemy, ed., <i>Preliminary and Interim Report on the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project</i>, 4:269, notes, this is probably a smoothing of a text which had no object other than the pronoun. No other text or version has an object other than the pronoun. It could be argued that &#8220;the earth&#8221; is to be understood as the intended referent from other contexts within the book of Jeremiah (Jer 10:12, 16; 51:15) where these verbs refer to the <sc>Lord as creator and from the prior context in 32:17 where the <sc>Lord&#8217;s power as creator is the basis for the assertion that nothing is too hard for him. This is the object that is supplied in a number of modern English versions and commentaries. However, the use of the feminine singular pronoun in other contexts to refer to an indefinite reality which is spelled out in the preceding or following context (cf. 2 Kgs 19:25; Isa 22:11; 37:26; 44:7) lends credence to the suggestion by the committee for <i>The Hebrew Old Testament Project</i> that the pronoun refers to the work or plan of the <sc>Lord, a view which is reflected in the NJPS and has been adopted here. For the use of the verb &#8220;form&#8221; here in the sense of &#8220;plan&#8221; see BDB 427 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1512;</font> 2.b and compare the usage in Isa 22:11; 37:26. The best discussion of options is given in G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, T. G. Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52 </i>(WBC),<i> </i>169-70, who see the pronoun referring ahead to the great and hidden things of v. 3. As in several other cases our translation has opted for a first person introduction rather than the third person of the original because the <sc>Lord himself is speaking.</p>
