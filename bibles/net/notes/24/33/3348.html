<A NAME="3348"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1995><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Thus says the <sc>Lord.&#8221; See the translator&#8217;s note at the beginning of v. 20 for the style adopted here. Here the promise is in v. 26 following the contrary to fact condition in v. 25. The Hebrew text of vv. 25-26 reads: &#8220;Thus says the <sc>Lord, &#8220;If I have not established my covenant with day and night [and] the laws/statutes of heaven and earth, also I could reject the seed of Jacob and David my servant from taking from his seed as rulers over the seed of Abraham&#8230;&#8221; The syntax of the original is a little awkward because it involves the verbs &#8220;establish&#8221; and &#8220;reject&#8221; governing two objects, the first governing two similar objects &#8220;my covenant&#8221; and &#8220;the regulations&#8221; and the second governing two dissimilar objects &#8220;the seed of Jacob&#8221; and &#8220;my servant David from taking [so as not to take].&#8221; The translation has sought to remove these awkward syntactical constructions and also break down the long complex original sentence in such a way as to retain its original intent, i.e., the guarantee of the continuance of the seed of Jacob and of the rule of a line of David&#8217;s descendants over them based on the fixed order of God&#8217;s creation decrees.</p>
