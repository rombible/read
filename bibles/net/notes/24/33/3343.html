<A NAME="3343"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1990><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Just as the stars in the sky cannot be numbered or the sand on the seashore cannot be measured, so I will greatly increase [or multiply] the seed of my servant David and the Levites who minister before me.&#8221; The word &#8220;seed of&#8221; does not carry over to the &#8220;the Levites&#8221; as a noun governing two genitives because &#8220;the Levites&#8221; has the accusative marker in front of it. The sentence has been broken down in conformity with contemporary English style.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Context makes it clear that what is in view is an innumerable line of descendants from the righteous ruler that the <sc>Lord raises up over Israel and Judah after their regathering and restoration to the land. What is in view, then, is a reinstitution or reinstatement of the Davidic covenant of grant, the perpetual right of the Davidic dynasty to rule over the nation of Israel for all time (see also v. 26). This is guaranteed by the creation order which is the object of both God&#8217;s creative decree (Gen 1:14-19) and his covenant with Noah after the flood (Gen 8:22). (For further discussion on the nature of a covenant of grant see the study note on 32:40.) The rejection of the lines of Jehoiakim (36:30) and Jeconiah (22:30) and the certain captivity and death of Zedekiah (32:4) may have called into question the continuance of the Davidic promise which always had a certain conditional nature to it (cf. 1 Kgs 2:4; 8:25; 9:5). This promise and this guarantee show that the covenant of grant still stands and will ultimately find its fulfillment. Because this promise never found its fulfillment after the return from exile, it is left to the NT to show how it is fulfilled (cf., e.g., Matt 1:1-17 where it is emphasized that Jesus is the son (and heir) of both Abraham and David).</p>
