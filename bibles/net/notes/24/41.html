<A NAME="411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2298><b>sn</b> It is not altogether clear whether this is in the same year that Jerusalem fell or not. The wall was breached in the fourth month (= early July; 39:2) and Nebuzaradan came and burned the palace, the temple, and many of the houses and tore down the wall in the fifth month (= early August; 52:12). That would have left time between the fifth month and the seventh month (October) to gather in the harvest of grapes, dates and figs, and olives (40:12). However, many commentators feel that too much activity takes place in too short a time for this to have been in the same year and posit that it happened the following year or even five years later when a further deportation took place, possibly in retaliation for the murder of Gedaliah and the Babylonian garrison at Mizpah (52:30). The assassination of Gedaliah had momentous consequences and was commemorated in one of the post exilic fast days lamenting the fall of Jerusalem (Zech 8:19).</p>
<A NAME="412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2299><b>sn</b> <i>All the Judeans</i>. This can scarcely refer to all the Judeans who had rallied around Gedaliah at Mizpah because v. 10 later speaks of Ishmael carrying off &#8220;the rest of the people who were at Mizpah.&#8221; Probably what is meant is &#8220;all the Judeans and Babylonian soldiers&#8221; that were also at the meal. It is possible that this meal was intended to seal a covenant between Gedaliah and Ishmael of Ishmael&#8217;s allegiance to Gedaliah and his Babylonian overlords (cf. Gen 26:30-31; 31:53-54; Exod 24:11). In any case, this act of treachery and deceit was an extreme violation of the customs of hospitality practiced in the ancient Near East.</p>
<A NAME="413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2300><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Chaldean.&#8221; See the study note on 21:4 for explanation. There are two cases of apposition with the repetition of the preposition or of the sign of the accusative in this verse, e.g., &#8220;who were with him, [namely] with Gedaliah&#8221; and &#8220;all the Chaldeans who happened to be there, [namely] the soldiers.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2301><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;were found there.&#8221; For this nuance of the verb see BDB 594 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font> Niph.2.c.</p>
<A NAME="415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2302><b>sn</b> <i>Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria</i> were all cities in the northern kingdom of Israel with important religious and political histories. When Israel was destroyed in 722 <sc>b.c., some of the Israelites had been left behind and some of the Judeans had taken up residence in these northern cities. People residing there had participated in the reforms of Hezekiah (2 Chr 30:11) and Josiah (2 Chr 34:9) and were evidently still faithfully following the Jewish calendar. They would have been on their way to Jerusalem to celebrate the Jewish New Year and the Feast of Tabernacles (Lev 23:34).</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For the location of Samaria see Map2-B1; Map4-D3; Map5-E2; Map6-A4; Map7-C1.</p>
<A NAME="416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2303><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;to show they were mourning&#8221; are not in the text but are implicit in the acts. They are supplied in the translation for clarification for readers who may not be familiar with ancient mourning customs.</p>
<A NAME="417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2304><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;in Jerusalem&#8221; are not in the text but are implicit. They are supplied in the translation for clarity.</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2305><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he was weeping/crying.&#8221; The translation is intended to better reflect the situation.</p>
<A NAME="419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2306><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.&#8221; The words that are supplied in the translation are implicit to the situation and are added for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="4110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2307><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;and threw their bodies&#8221; result from the significant use of the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>, so GKC 384 §119.<i>gg</i> and BDB 39 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;</font> 1). Hence the suggestion in <i>BHS</i> (fn a) that the Syriac and two Greek <sc>mss are reading a different text is not really a textual issue but a translational one; the versions are supplying the words for stylistic purposes as has been done here.</p>
<A NAME="4111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2308><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;But there were ten men found among them and they said.&#8221; However, for the use of &#8220;were found&#8221; = &#8220;be, happened to be&#8221; see BDB 594 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font> 2.c and compare the usage in 41:3.</p>
<A NAME="4112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2309><b>tn</b> This sentence is a good example of the elliptical nature of some of the causal connections in the Hebrew Bible. All the Hebrew says literally is &#8220;For we have hidden stores of wheat, barley, olive oil, and honey in a field.&#8221; However, it is obvious that they are using this as their bargaining chip to prevent Ishmael and his men from killing them. For the use of &#8220;for&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ki</font>) for such elliptical thoughts see BDB 473-74 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 3.c.</p>
<A NAME="4113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2310><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;So he refrained from killing them&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he refrained and did not kill them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2311><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the midst of their brothers/fellow countrymen.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2312><b>tc</b> The translation here follows the reading of the Greek version. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain; some understand it to mean &#8220;because of Gedaliah [i.e., to cover up the affair with Gedaliah]&#8221; and others understand it to mean &#8220;alongside of Gedaliah.&#8221; The translation presupposes that the Hebrew text reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512; &#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bor gadol hu</font>&#8217;) in place of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1497;&#1463;&#1491;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿyad-gÿdalyahu</font>). The meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1497;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿyad</font>) does not fit any of the normal ones given for this expression and those who retain the Hebrew text normally explain it as an unparalleled use of &#8220;because&#8221; or &#8220;in the affair of&#8221; (so NJPS) or a rare use meaning &#8220;near, by the side of &#8220; (see BDB 391 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;</font> 5.d where only Ps 141:6 and Zech 4:12 are cited. BDB themselves suggest reading with the Greek version as the present translation does [so BDB 391 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;</font> 5.c(3)]). For the syntax presupposed by the Greek text which has been followed consult <i>IBHS</i> 298 §16.3.3d and 133 §8.4.2b. The first clause is a classifying clause with normal order of subject-predicate-copulative pronoun and it is followed by a further qualifying relative clause.</p>
<A NAME="4116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2313><b>sn</b> It is generally agreed that the cistern referred to here is one of several that Asa dug for supplying water as part of the defense system constructed at Mizpah (cf. 1 Kgs 15:22; 2 Chr 16:6).</p>
<A NAME="4117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2314><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;with corpses&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;with the slain.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2315><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the daughters of the king.&#8221; Most commentators do not feel that this refers to the actual daughters of Zedekiah since they would have been too politically important to have escaped exile with their father. As noted in the translator&#8217;s note on 36:26 this need not refer to the actual daughters of the king but may refer to other royal daughters, i.e., the daughters of other royal princes.</p>
<A NAME="4119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2316><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;crimes,&#8221; or &#8220;evil things&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the evil.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2317><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the many [or great] waters.&#8221; This is generally identified with the pool of Gibeon mentioned in 2 Sam 2:13.</p>
<A NAME="4121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2318><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all the people who were with Ishmael.&#8221; However, this does not refer to his own troops but to those he had taken with him from Mizpah, i.e., the captives. The phrase is specifically clarified in the next verse, i.e. &#8220;the people whom Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah.&#8221; Hence the phrase is translated here according to sense, not according to the literal wording.</p>
<A NAME="4122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2319><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Chaldeans.&#8221; See the study note on 21:4 for explanation.</p>
<A NAME="4123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2320><b>sn</b> <i>Geruth Kimham</i> is nowhere else mentioned in the Bible and its precise location is unknown. Many commentators relate the second part of the name to the name of the son of David&#8217;s benefactor when he fled from Absalom (2 Sam 19:38-39) and see this as a reference to an estate that David assigned this son as reward for his father&#8217;s largess. Gibeon was about six miles northwest of Jerusalem and Benjamin is approximately the same distance southwest of it. Hence, the people mentioned here had not traveled all that far.</p>
<A NAME="4124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2321><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map7-E2; Map8-E2; Map10-B4.</p>
<A NAME="4125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2322><b>tn</b> Verses 16-18a are a long complex sentence in the Hebrew text with some rather awkward placement of qualifying terms. In the Hebrew text these verses read: &#8220;<b>41:16</b> And he took, Johanan&#8230;and all the army officers with him, all the people who were left alive which he [Johanan] had taken back from Ishmael son of Nethaniah from Mizpah after he [Ishmael] had killed Gedaliah&#8230;men, men of war, and women and children and court officials which he [Johanan] had brought back from Gibeon <b>41:17</b> and they went and they stayed at Geruth Kimham&#8230;to go to enter Egypt <b>41:18</b> because of the Chaldean because they were afraid of them because Ishmael&#8230;&#8221; The sentence has been broken down and restructured to reflect all the relevant data in shorter sentences which better conform with contemporary English style. There are a couple of places where the text and syntax are debated. Many modern English versions and commentaries read &#8220;They led off/took control of/took all survivors of the people whom Ishmael&#8230;had taken captive [reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492; &#1465;&#1488;&#1514;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shavah </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">otam</font>) in place of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489; &#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1461;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">heshiv me</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et</font>), &#8220;whom he (Johanan) had taken back/rescued from Ishmael] from Mizpah after he had&#8230;&#8221; This is a decidedly smoother text but there is no manuscript or versional evidence for it and so it has been rejected here. Some commentators and English versions see the words &#8220;men of war&#8221; (&#8220;soldiers&#8221;) following the word &#8220;men&#8221; as appositional to that word and hence see only one category. However, there are no parallels to these words used in this kind of apposition. So the translation reflects two categories.</p>
