<A NAME="292"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1637><b>tn</b> Jer 29:1-3 are all one long sentence in Hebrew containing a parenthetical insertion. The text reads &#8220;These are the words of the letter which the prophet Jeremiah sent to the elders&#8230;people whom Nebuchadnezzar had exiled from Jerusalem to Babylon after King Jeconiah&#8230;had gone from Jerusalem by the hand of Elasah&#8230;whom Zedekiah sent&#8230;saying, &#8216;Thus says the <sc>Lord&#8230;&#8217;&#8221; The sentence has been broken up for the sake of contemporary English style and clarity.</p>
<A NAME="293"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1638><b>tn</b> This term is often mistakenly understood to refer to a &#8220;eunuch.&#8221; It is clear, however, in Gen 39:1 that &#8220;eunuchs&#8221; could be married. On the other hand it is clear from Isa 59:3-5 that some who bore this title could not have children. In this period, it is possible that the persons who bore this title were high officials like the <font face="Scholar">rab saris</font><i> </i>who was a high official in the Babylonian court (cf. Jer 39:3, 13; 52:25). For further references see <i>HALOT</i> 727 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1505;</font> 1.c.</p>
<A NAME="294"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1639><b>sn</b> See 2 Kgs 24:14-16 and compare the study note on Jer 24:1.</p>
<A NAME="295"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1640><b>sn</b> <i>Elasah son of Shaphan</i> may have been the brother of Ahikam, who supported Jeremiah when the priests and the prophets in Jerusalem sought to kill Jeremiah for preaching that the temple and the city would be destroyed (cf. 26:24).</p>
<A NAME="296"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1641><b>sn</b> This individual is not the same as the Gemariah mentioned in 36:10, 11, 12, 25 who was one of the officials who sought to have the first scroll of Jeremiah&#8217;s prophecies preserved. He may, however, have been a son or grandson of the High Priest who discovered the book of the law during the reign of Josiah (cf., e.g., 2 Kgs 22:8, 10) which was so instrumental in Josiah&#8217;s reforms. </p>
<A NAME="297"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1642><b>sn</b> It is unclear whether this incident preceded or followed those in the preceding chapter. It is known from 52:59 that Zedekiah himself had made a trip to Babylon in the same year mentioned in 28:1 and that Jeremiah had used that occasion to address a prophecy of disaster to Babylon. It is not impossible that Jeremiah sent two such disparate messages at the same time (see Jer 25:8-11, 12-14, 17-18, 26).</p>

<A NAME="299"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1644><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I sent.&#8221; This sentence exhibits a rapid switch in person, here from the third person to the first. Such switches are common to Hebrew poetry and prophecy (cf. GKC 462 §144.<i>p</i>). Contemporary English, however, does not exhibit such rapid switches and it creates confusion for the careful reader. Such switches have regularly been avoided in the translation.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Elsewhere Nebuchadnezzar is seen as the one who carried them into exile (cf. 27:20; 29:1). Here and in v. 14 the <sc>Lord is seen as the one who sends them into exile. The <sc>Lord is the ultimate cause and Nebuchadnezzar is his agent or servant (cf. 25:9; 27:6 and notes).</p>

<A NAME="2916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1651><b>tn</b> See the translator&#8217;s note on Jer 27:22 for this term.</p>
<A NAME="2917"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1652><b>tn</b> Verse 10 is all one long sentence in the Hebrew original: &#8220;According to the fullness of Babylon seventy years I will take thought of you and I will establish my gracious word to you by bringing you back to this place.&#8221; The sentence has been broken up to conform better to contemporary English style.</p>
<A NAME="2918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1653><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;this place.&#8221; The text has probably been influenced by the parallel passage in 27:22. The term appears fifteen times in Jeremiah and is invariably a reference to Jerusalem or Judah.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> See Jer 27:22 for this promise.</p>
<A NAME="2919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1654><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Oracle of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2920"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1655><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I know the plans that I am planning for you, oracle of the <sc>Lord, plans of well-being and not for harm to give to you&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2921"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1656><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the future you hope for&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a future and a hope.&#8221; This is a good example of hendiadys where two formally coordinated nouns (adjectives, verbs) convey a single idea where one of the terms functions as a qualifier of the other. For this figure see E. W. Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, 658-72. This example is discussed on p. 661.</p>
<A NAME="2922"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1657><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;come and pray to me.&#8221; This is an example of verbal hendiadys where two verb formally joined by &#8220;and&#8221; convey a main concept with the second verb functioning as an adverbial qualifier.</p>
<A NAME="2923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1658><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;You will call out to me and come to me in prayer and I will hear your prayers.&#8221; The verbs are <i>vav</i> consecutive perfects and can be taken either as unconditional futures or as contingent futures. See GKC 337 §112.<i>kk</i> and 494 §159.<i>g</i> and compare the usage in Gen 44:22 for the use of the <i>vav</i> consecutive perfects in contingent futures. The conditional clause in the middle of 29:13 and the deuteronomic theology reflected in both Deut 30:1-5 and 1 Kgs 8:46-48 suggest that the verbs are continent futures here. For the same demand for wholehearted seeking in these contexts which presuppose exile see especially Deut 30:2, 1 Kgs 8:48.</p>
<A NAME="2924"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1659><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;If you wholeheartedly seek me&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;You will seek me and find [me] because you will seek me with all your heart.&#8221; The translation attempts to reflect the theological nuances of &#8220;seeking&#8221; and &#8220;finding&#8221; and the psychological significance of &#8220;heart&#8221; which refers more to intellectual and volitional concerns in the OT than to emotional ones.</p>
<A NAME="2925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1660><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will let myself be found by you.&#8221; For this nuance of the verb see BDB 594 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font> Niph.1.f and compare the usage in Isa 65:1; 2 Chr 15:2. The Greek version already noted that nuance when it translated the phrase &#8220;I will manifest myself to you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1661><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Oracle of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1662><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;restore your fortune.&#8221; Alternately, &#8220;I will bring you back from exile.&#8221; This idiom occurs twenty-six times in the OT and in several cases it is clearly not referring to return from exile but restoration of fortunes (e.g., Job 42:10; Hos 6:11&#8211;7:1; Jer 33:11). It is often followed as here by &#8220;regather&#8221; or &#8220;bring back&#8221; (e.g., Jer 30:3; Ezek 29:14) so it is often misunderstood as &#8220;bringing back the exiles.&#8221; The versions (LXX, Vulg., Tg., Pesh.) often translate the idiom as &#8220;to go away into captivity,&#8221; deriving the noun from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿvi</font>, &#8220;captivity&#8221;). However, the use of this expression in Old Aramaic documents of Sefire parallels the biblical idiom: &#8220;the gods <i>restored the fortunes</i> of the house of my father again&#8221; (J. A. Fitzmyer, <i>The Aramaic Inscriptions of Sefire</i> [BibOr], 100-101, 119-20). The idiom means &#8220;to turn someone's fortune, bring about change&#8221; or &#8220;to reestablish as it was&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 1386 s.v. 3.c). In Ezek 16:53 it is paralleled by the expression &#8220;to restore the situation which prevailed earlier.&#8221; This amounts to <i>restitutio in integrum</i>, which is applicable to the circumstances surrounding the return of the exiles.</p>

<A NAME="2931"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1666><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;of Jerusalem&#8221; are not in the text but are supplied in the translation to identify the referent and avoid the possible confusion that &#8220;this city&#8221; refers to Babylon.</p>

<A NAME="2934"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1669><b>tn</b> The meaning of this word is somewhat uncertain. It occurs only here in the Hebrew Bible. BDB 1045 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;</font> relates it to the noun &#8220;horrible thing&#8221; (translated &#8220;something shocking&#8221;) in Jer 5:30; 23:14 and defines it as &#8220;horrid, disgusting.&#8221; <i>HALOT</i> 1495 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;</font> relates it to the same noun and define it as &#8220;rotten; corrupt.&#8221; That nuance is accepted here.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Compare Jer 24:8-10 in its context for the figure here.</p>

<A NAME="2940"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1675><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;pay attention to the word of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; However, the <sc>Lord is speaking in the words just previous to this and in the words which follow (&#8220;whom I have sent&#8221;). This is another example of the shift from third person referent to first person which is common in Hebrew poetry and prophecy but is not common in English style. The person has been adjusted in the translation to avoid confusion.</p>
<A NAME="2941"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1676><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Yahweh of armies, the God of Israel.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> See study notes on 2:19 and 7:3 for the explanation of this title.</p>

<A NAME="2943"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1678><b>sn</b> Being <i>roasted to death in the fire</i> appears to have been a common method of execution in Babylon. See Dan 3:6, 19-21. The famous law code of the Babylonian king Hammurabi also mandated this method of execution for various crimes a thousand years earlier. There is a satirical play on words involving their fate, &#8220;roasted them to death&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, <i>qalam</i>), and the fact that that fate would become a common topic of curse (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">qÿlalah</font>) pronounced on others in Babylon.</p>
<A NAME="2944"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1679><b>tn</b> It is commonly assumed that this word is explained by the two verbal actions that follow. The word (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nÿvalah</font>) is rather commonly used of sins of unchastity (cf., e.g., Gen 34:7; Judg 19:23; 2 Sam 13:12) which would fit the reference to adultery. However, the word is singular and not likely to cover both actions that follow. The word is also used of the greedy act of Achan (Josh 7:15) which threatened Israel with destruction and the churlish behavior of Nabal (1 Sam 25:25) which threatened him and his household with destruction. The word is also used of foolish talk in Isa 9:17 (9:16 HT) and Isa 32:6. It is possible that this refers to a separate act, one that would have brought the death penalty from Nebuchadnezzar, i.e., the preaching of rebellion in conformity with the message of the false prophets in Jerusalem and other nations (cf. 27:9, 13). Hence it is possible that the translation should read: &#8220;This will happen because of their vile conduct. They have propagated rebellion. They have committed adultery with their neighbors&#8217; wives. They have spoken words that I did not command them to speak. They have spoken lies while claiming my authority.&#8221;</p>

They are supplied in the translation here to indicate the shift in topic and the shift in addressee (the imperative &#8220;tell&#8221; is second singular). The introduction supplied in the translation here matches that in v. 30 where the words are in the text.</p>
<A NAME="2948"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1683><b>tn</b> It is unclear whether this is a family name or a place name. The word occurs nowhere else in the Hebrew Bible.</p>

<A NAME="2950"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1685><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Tell Shemaiah the Nehelamite, &#8216;Thus says Yahweh of armies the God of Israel&#8230;.&#8221; The indirect quotation is used in the translation to avoid the complexity of embedding a quotation within a quotation.</p>
<A NAME="2951"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1686><b>sn</b> Jer 29:24-32 are concerned with Jeremiah&#8217;s interaction with a false prophet named Shemaiah. The narrative in this section is not in strict chronological order and is somewhat elliptical. It begins with a report of a message that Jeremiah appears to have delivered directly to Shemaiah and refers to a letter that Shemaiah sent to the priest Zephaniah encouraging him to reprimand Jeremiah for what Shemaiah considered treasonous words in his letter to the exiles (vv. 24-28; compare v. 28 with v. 5). However, Jeremiah is in Jerusalem and Shemaiah is in Babylon. The address must then be part of a second letter Jeremiah sent to Babylon. Following this the narrative refers to Zephaniah reading Shemaiah&#8217;s letter to Jeremiah and Jeremiah sending a further letter to the captives in Babylon (vv. 29-32). This is probably not a third letter but part of the same letter in which Jeremiah reprimands Shemaiah for sending his letter to Zephaniah (vv. 25-28; the same letter referred to in v. 29). The order of events thus is: Jeremiah sent a letter to the captives counseling them to settle down in Babylon (vv. 1-23). Shemaiah sent a letter to Zephaniah asking him to reprimand Jeremiah (vv. 26-28). After Zephaniah read that letter to Jeremiah (v. 29), Jeremiah wrote a further letter to Babylon reprimanding him (vv. 25-28, 31) and pronouncing judgment on him (v. 32). The elliptical nature of the narrative is reflected in the fact that vv. 25-27 are part of a long causal sentence which sets forth an accusation but has no corresponding main clause or announcement of judgment. This kind of construction involves a rhetorical figure (called aposiopesis) where what is begun is not finished for various rhetorical reasons. Here the sentence that is broken off is part of an announcement of judgment which is not picked up until v. 32 after a further (though related) accusation (v. 31b).</p>

The Hebrew text reads &#8220;The <sc>Lord has&#8230;to be overseers [in] the house of the <sc>Lord for/over.&#8221; The reading here follows that of the Greek, Syriac, and Latin versions in reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">paqid bÿvet</font>) in place of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pÿqidim bet</font>). There has been a confusion of the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mem</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet</font>) and a transposition of the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yod</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dalet</font>).</p>
<A NAME="2959"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=1694><b>sn</b> The Hebrew term translated <i>lunatic </i>applies to anyone who exhibits irrational behavior. It was used for example of David who drooled and scratched on the city gate to convince Achish not to arrest him as a politically dangerous threat (1 Sam 21:14). It was often used contemptuously of the prophets by those who wanted to play down the significance of their words (2 Kgs 9:11; Hos 9:7 and here).</p>
<A NAME="2960"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=1695><b>tn</b> The verb here is a good example of what <i>IBHS</i> 431 §26.2f calls the estimative-declarative reflexive where a person presents himself in a certain light. For examples of this usage see 2 Sam 13:5; Prov 13:7.</p>
<A NAME="2961"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=1696><b>tn</b> See the translator&#8217;s note on 20:2 for this word which only occurs here and in 20:2-3.</p>
<A NAME="2962"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=1697><b>tn</b> This word only occurs here in the Hebrew Bible. All the lexicons are agreed as seeing it referring to a collar placed around the neck. The basis for this definition are the cognate languages (see, e.g., <i>HALOT</i> 958-59 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1504;&#1465;&#1511;</font> for the most complete discussion).</p>
<A NAME="2963"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=1698><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;So why have you not reprimanded Jeremiah&#8230;?&#8221; The rhetorical question functions as an emphatic assertion made explicit in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="2964"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=1699><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;For he has sent to us in Babylon, saying&#8230;.&#8221; The quote, however, is part of the earlier letter.</p>

<A NAME="2969"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=1704><b>sn</b> Compare the same charge against Hananiah in Jer 28:16 and see the note there. In this case, the false prophesy of Shemaiah is not given but it likely had the same tenor since he wants Jeremiah reprimanded for saying that the exile will be long and the people are to settle down in Babylon.</p>
