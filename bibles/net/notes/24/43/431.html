<A NAME="431"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2357><b>tn</b> This sentence contains an emphasis that is impossible to translate into idiomatic English that would not sound redundant. In Hebrew the sentence reads: &#8220;When Jeremiah finished [the temporal subordination is left out here because it would make the sentence too long] telling all the people all the words [or all the things] which the <sc>Lord their God had sent him [to say] to them, namely all these words,&#8230;&#8221; The last phrase has been left out of the translation as already having been included. Though they have been left out of the translation, attention is called to their presence here.</p>
