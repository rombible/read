<A NAME="4320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2376><b>tn</b> The Greek version reads the verbs in this sentence as third person, &#8220;he will set,&#8221; and second person, &#8220;you have buried.&#8221; This fits the context better but it is difficult to explain how the Hebrew could have arisen from this smoother reading. The figure of substitution (metonymy of cause for effect) is probably involved: &#8220;I will have him set&#8221; and &#8220;I have had you bury.&#8221; The effect of these substitutions is to emphasize the sovereignty of God.</p>
