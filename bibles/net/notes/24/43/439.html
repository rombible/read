<A NAME="439"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2365><b>sn</b> This had been their intention all along (41:17). Though they consulted the <sc>Lord and promised to do what he told them whether they agreed with it or not (42:5-6), it is clear that they had no intention of doing so. Jeremiah could see that (42:19-22). They refused to believe that the <sc>Lord had really said what Jeremiah told them (43:4) and feared reprisal from the Babylonians more than any potential destruction from the <sc>Lord (43:3).</p>
