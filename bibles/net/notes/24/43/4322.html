<A NAME="4322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2378><b>tn</b> As in 15:2 the Hebrew is very brief and staccato-like: &#8220;those to death to death, and those to captivity to captivity, and those to the sword to the sword.&#8221; As in 15:2 most commentaries and English versions assume that the word &#8220;death&#8221; refers to death by disease. See the translator&#8217;s note on 15:2 and compare also 18:21 where the sword is distinctly connected with &#8220;war&#8221; or &#8220;battle&#8221; and is distinct from &#8220;killed by death [i.e., disease].&#8221;</p>
