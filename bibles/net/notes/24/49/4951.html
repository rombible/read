<A NAME="4951"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=2645><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;The <sc>Lord spoke&#8221; and &#8220;he said&#8221; are not in the text. There is only a title here: &#8220;Concerning Damascus.&#8221; However, something needs to be supplied to show that these are the <sc>Lord&#8217;s words of judgment (cf. v. 26 &#8220;oracle of the <sc>Lord&#8221; and the &#8220;I&#8221; in v. 27). These words have been supplied in the translation for clarity and consistency with the introduction to the other judgment speeches.</p>
