<A NAME="4979"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">79</span><note=2673><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will break the bow of Elam, the chief source of their might.&#8221; The phrase does not mean that God will break literal bows or that he will destroy their weapons (synecdoche of species for genus) or their military power (so Hos 1:5). Because of the parallelism, the &#8220;bow&#8221; here stands for the archers who wield the bow, and were the strongest force (or chief contingent) in their military.</p>
