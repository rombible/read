<A NAME="4918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2612><b>sn</b> <i>Edom</i> was a kingdom to the south and east of Judah. Its borders varied over time but basically Edom lay in the hundred mile strip between the Gulf of Aqaba on the south and the Zered River on the north. It straddled the Arabah leading down from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba, having as its northern neighbors both Judah and Moab. A long history of hostility existed between Israel and Edom, making Edom one of the favorite objects of the prophets&#8217; oracles of judgment (cf., e.g., Isa 21:11-12; 34:5-15; 63:1-6; Amos 1:11-12; Ezek 25:12-14; 35:1-15; Obad 1-16). Not much is known about Edom at this time other than the fact that they participated in the discussions regarding rebellion against Nebuchadnezzar in 594 <sc>b.c. According to Obadiah 10-16 they not only gloated over Judah&#8217;s downfall in 586 <sc>b.c. but participated in its plunder and killed some of those who were fleeing the country.</p>
