<A NAME="4922"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2616><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;make deep to dwell.&#8221; The meaning of this phrase is debated. Some take it as a reference for the Dedanites who were not native to Edom to go down from the heights of Edom and go back home (so G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, T. G. Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52 </i>[WBC],<i> </i>330). The majority of commentaries, however, take it as a reference to the Dedanites disassociating themselves from the Edomites and finding remote hiding places to live in (so J. A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah </i>[NICOT], 718). For the options see W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah </i>(Hermeneia), 2:375.</p>
