<A NAME="4930"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2624><b>sn</b> <i>Bozrah</i> appears to have been the chief city in Edom, its capital city (see its parallelism with Edom in Isa 34:6; 63:1; Jer 49:22). The reference to &#8220;its towns&#8221; (translated here &#8220;all the towns around it&#8221;) could then be a reference to all the towns in Edom. It was located about twenty-five miles southeast of the southern end of the Dead Sea apparently in the district of Teman (see the parallelism in Amos 1:12).</p>
