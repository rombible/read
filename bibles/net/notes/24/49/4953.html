<A NAME="4953"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=2647><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Hamath and Arpad.&#8221; There is no word for people in the text. The cities are being personified. However, since it is really the people who are involved and it is clearer for the modern reader, the present translation supplies the words &#8220;people of&#8221; both here and in v. 24. The verbs in vv. 23-25 are all to be interpreted as prophetic perfects, the tense of the Hebrew verb that views an action as though it were as good as done. The verbs are clearly future in vv. 26-27 which begin with a &#8220;therefore.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Hamath</i> was a city on the Orontes River about 110 miles (183 km) north of Damascus. <i>Arpad</i> was a city that was 95 miles (158 km) farther north from there. These two cities were in the path of the northern descent of the kings of Assyria and Babylonia and had been conquered earlier under the Assyrian kings (Isa 10:9; 36:19; 37:13). The apparent reference here is to their terror and loss of courage when they hear the news that Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s armies are on the move toward them and Damascus. They would have been in the path of Nebuchadnezzar as he chased Necho south after the battle of Carchemish.</p>
