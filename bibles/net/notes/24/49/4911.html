<A NAME="4911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2605><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Why do you brag about your valleys, about the fruitfulness of your valleys.&#8221; The meaning of the first two lines of this verse are uncertain primarily due to the ambiguity of the expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1489; &#1506;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1511;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zav </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">imqekh</font>). The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zav</font>) is either a Qal perfect or Qal participle of a verb meaning flow. It is common in the expression &#8220;a land flowing with milk and honey&#8221; and is also common to refer to the seminal discharge or discharge of blood which makes a man or woman unclean. BDB 264 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font> Qal.2 sees it as an abbreviation of the idea of &#8220;flowing with milk and honey&#8221; and sees it as referring to the fertility of Ammon&#8217;s valley. However, there are no other examples of such an ellipsis. Several of the modern English versions and commentaries have taken the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1502;&#1462;&#1511;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">emeq</font>) not as a reference to a valley but to the homonym cited in the note on 47:5 and see the reference here to the flowing away of Ammon&#8217;s strength. That interpretation is followed here. Instead of explaining the plural ending on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1502;&#1464;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amaqim</font>) as being an enclitic <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mem</font>) as others who follow this interpretation (e.g., J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah</i> [AB], 325), the present translation understands the plural as a plural of amplification (cf. GKC 397-98 §124.<i>e</i> and compare the noun &#8220;might&#8221; in Isa 40:26).</p>
