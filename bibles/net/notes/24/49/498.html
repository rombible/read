<A NAME="498"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2602><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;you women of Rabbah&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;daughters of Rabbah.&#8221; It is difficult to tell whether the word &#8220;daughters&#8221; is used here in the same sense that it has in v. 2 (see the translator&#8217;s note there) or in the literal sense of &#8220;daughters.&#8221; The former has been preferred because the cities themselves (e.g., Heshbon) are called to wail in the earlier part of the verse and the term &#8220;daughters&#8221; has been used in the previous verse of the surrounding villages.</p>
