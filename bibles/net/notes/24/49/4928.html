<A NAME="4928"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2622><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;of my wrath&#8221; after &#8220;cup&#8221; in the first line and &#8220;from the cup of my wrath&#8221; in the last line are not in the text but are implicit in the metaphor. They have been supplied in the translation for clarity.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The reference here is to the cup of God&#8217;s wrath which is connected with the punishment of war at the hands of the Babylonians referred to already in Jer 25:15-29. Those who do not deserve to drink are the innocent victims of war who get swept away with the guilty. Edom was certainly not one of the innocent victims as is clear from this judgment speech and those referred to in the study note on 49:7.</p>
