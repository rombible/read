<A NAME="4934"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2628><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;The <sc>Lord says to Edom&#8221; are not in the text. They have been supplied in the translation to mark the shift from the address of the messenger summoning the nations to prepare to do battle against Edom. The <sc>Lord is clearly the speaker (see the end of v. 16) and Edom is clearly the addressee. Such sudden shifts are common in Hebrew poetry, particularly Hebrew prophecy, but are extremely disruptive to a modern reader trying to follow the argument of a passage. TEV adds &#8220;The <sc>Lord said&#8221; and then retains third person throughout. CEV puts all of vv. 14-16 in the second person and uses indirect discourse in v. 15.</p>
