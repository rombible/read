<A NAME="4926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2620><b>tn</b> The tense and nuance of the verb translated &#8220;pillage&#8221; are both different than the verb in Obad 5. There the verb is the imperfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ganav</font>, &#8220;to steal&#8221;). Here the verb is the perfect of a verb which means to &#8220;ruin&#8221; or &#8220;spoil.&#8221; The English versions and commentaries, however, almost all render the verb here in much the same way as in Obad 5. The nuance must mean they only &#8220;ruin, destroy&#8221; (by stealing) only as much as they need (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;their sufficiency&#8221;), and the verb is used as metonymical substitute, effect for cause. The perfect must be some kind of a future perfect; &#8220;would they not have destroyed only&#8230;&#8221; The negative question is carried over by ellipsis from the preceding lines.</p>
