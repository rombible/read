Its capital city was Susa. It was destroyed in 640 <sc>b.c. by Ashurbanipal after a long period of conflict with the Assyrian kings. It appears from Babylonian records to have regained its independence shortly thereafter, perhaps as early as 625 <sc>b.c., and was involved in the fall of Assyria in 612 <sc>b.c. If the date refers to the first year of Zedekiah&#8217;s rule (597 <sc>b.c.), this prophecy appears to be later than the previous ones (cf. the study notes on 46:2 and 47:1).</p>
