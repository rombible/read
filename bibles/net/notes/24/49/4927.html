<A NAME="4927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2621><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Their children and relatives will all be destroyed. And none of their neighbors will say, &#8216;Leave your orphans with me and I&#8217;ll keep them alive. Your widows can trust in me.&#8217;&#8221; This latter interpretation is based on a reading in a couple of the Greek versions (Symmachus and Lucian) and is accepted by a number of the modern commentaries, (J. Bright, J. A. Thompson, W. L. Holladay, and G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, T. G. Smothers). However, the majority of modern English versions do not follow it and lacking any other Hebrew or versional evidence it is probable that this is an interpretation to explain the mitigation of what appears as a prophecy of utter annihilation. There have been other cases in Jeremiah where a universal affirmation (either positive or negative) has been modified in the verses that follow. The verb in the second line <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1496;&#1464;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tivtakhu</font>) is highly unusual; it is a second masculine plural form with a feminine plural subject. The form is explained in GKC 127-28 §47.<i>k</i> and 160-61 §60.<i>a</i>, n. 1 as a pausal substitution for the normal form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1496;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tivtakhnah</font>) and a similar form in Ezek 37:7 cited as a parallel.</p>
