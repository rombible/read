<A NAME="499"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2603><b>tc</b> Or &#8220;Run back and forth inside the walls of your towns.&#8221; Or &#8220;slash yourselves with gashes.&#8221; The meaning of this line is uncertain. The Hebrew text reads &#8220;run back and forth among the walls.&#8221; The word &#8220;run back and forth&#8221; is generally taken as a Hitpolel of a verb that means to &#8220;go about&#8221; in the Qal and to &#8220;go back and forth&#8221; in the Polel (cf. BDB 1002 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;</font>). The noun that follows in the Hebrew means &#8220;wall, hedge&#8221; and is quite commonly modified by the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1465;&#1488;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tso</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">n</font>, &#8220;sheep&#8221;) referring to sheepfolds (cf., e.g., Num 32:36; 1 Sam 24:3). But the phrase &#8220;run back and forth among the sheepfolds&#8221; yields little meaning here. In Ps 89:40 (89:41 HT) the word &#8220;wall&#8221; is used in parallelism with fortified cities and refers to the walls of the city. That is the sense that is assumed in one of the alternate translations with the words &#8220;of your towns&#8221; being supplied in the translation for clarification. However, that figure is a little odd in a context which speaks of mourning rites. Hence, some emend the word &#8220;walls&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1461;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">gÿderot</font>) to &#8220;gashes&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1467;&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">gÿdudot</font>), a word that has occurred in a similar context in Jer 48:37. That would involve only the common confusion of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;</font>. That is the reading adopted here and fits the context nicely. NRSV appears to go one step further and read the verb as a Hitpolel from a root that is otherwise used only as a noun to mean &#8220;whip&#8221; or &#8220;scourge.&#8221; NRSV reads &#8220;slash yourselves with whips&#8221; which also makes excellent sense in the context but is not supported by any parallel use of the verb.</p>
