<A NAME="4980"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">80</span><note=2674><b>tn</b> Or more simply, &#8220;I will bring enemies against Elam from every direction. / And I will scatter the people of Elam to the four winds. // There won&#8217;t be any nation / where the refugees of Elam will not go.&#8221; Or more literally, &#8220;I will bring the four winds against Elam / from the four quarters of heaven. / I will scatter&#8230;.&#8221; However, the winds are not to be understood literally here. God isn&#8217;t going to &#8220;blow the Elamites&#8221; out of Elam with natural forces. The winds must figuratively represent enemy forces that God will use to drive them out. Translating literally would be misleading at this point.</p>
