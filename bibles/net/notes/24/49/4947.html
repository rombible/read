<A NAME="4947"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=2641><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;They will surely drag them off, namely the young ones of the flock. He will devastate their habitation [or their sheepfold] on account of them.&#8221; The figure of the lion among the flock of sheep appears to be carried on here where the people are referred to as a flock and their homeland is referred to as a sheepfold. It is hard, however, to carry the figure over here into the translation, so the figures have been interpreted instead. Both of these last two sentences are introduced by a formula that indicates a strong affirmative oath (i.e., they are introduced by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501; &#1500;&#1465;&#1488;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im lo</font>&#8217;; cf. BDB 50 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> 1.b(2)]). The subject of the verb &#8220;they will drag them off&#8221; is the indefinite third plural which may be taken as a passive in English (cf. GKC 460 §144.<i>g</i>). The subject of the last line is the <sc>Lord which has been rendered in the first person for stylistic reasons (see the translator&#8217;s note on the beginning of the verse).</p>
