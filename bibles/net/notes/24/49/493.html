<A NAME="493"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2597><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Does not Israel have any sons? Does not he have any heir [or &#8220;heirs&#8221; as a collective]? Why [then] has Malcom taken possession of Gad and [why] do his [Malcom&#8217;s] people live in his [Gad&#8217;s] land?&#8221; A literal translation here will not produce any meaning without major commentary. Hence the meaning that is generally agreed on is reflected in an admittedly paraphrastic translation. The reference is to the fact that the Ammonites had taken possession of the cities that had been deserted when the Assyrians carried off the Transjordanian tribes in 733 <sc>b.c. assuming that the Israelites would not return in sufficient numbers to regain control of it. The thought underlying the expression &#8220;Why has Milcom taken possession&#8230;&#8221; reflects the idea, common in the OT and the ancient Near East, that the god of a people drove out the previous inhabitants, gave their land to his worshipers to possess, and took up residence with them there (cf., e.g., Deut 1:21; Judg 11:24 and line 33-34 of the Moabite stone: &#8220;Chemosh said to me, &#8216;Go down, fight against Hauronen.&#8217; And I went down [and I fought against the town and took it], and Chemosh dwelt there in my time.&#8221; [<i>ANET</i> 321]).</p>
