<A NAME="4984"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">84</span><note=2678><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I will sit in judgment over Elam&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will set up my throne in Elam.&#8221; Commentators are divided over whether this refers to a king sitting in judgment over his captured enemies or whether it refers to formally establishing his rule over the country. Those who argue for the former idea point to the supposed parallels in 1:15 (which the present translation understands not to refer to this but to setting up siege) and 43:8-13. The parallelism in the verse here, however, argues that it refers to the <sc>Lord taking over the reins of government by destroying their former leaders.</p>
