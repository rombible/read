<A NAME="4912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2606><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;apostate daughter.&#8221; This same term is applied to Israel in Jer 31:22 but seems inappropriate here to Ammon because she had never been loyal to the <sc>Lord and could not hence be called &#8220;apostate.&#8221; However, if it is used of the fact that she rebelled against the <sc>Lord&#8217;s servant, Nebuchadnezzar, it might be appropriate (cf. Jer 27:6, 8). Hence the term &#8220;rebellious&#8221; is used in the translation to represent it. The word &#8220;daughter&#8221; is again a personification of the land (cf. BDB 123 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1514;</font> 3) and is here translated &#8220;people of Ammon&#8221; to make it easier for the modern reader to identify the referent. </p>
