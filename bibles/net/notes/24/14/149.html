<A NAME="149"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=891><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they cover their heads.&#8221; Some of the English versions have gone wrong here because of the &#8220;normal&#8221; use of the words translated here &#8220;disappointed&#8221; and &#8220;dismayed.&#8221; They are regularly translated &#8220;ashamed&#8221; and &#8220;disgraced, humiliated, dismayed&#8221; elsewhere (see e.g., Jer 22:22); they are somewhat synonymous terms which are often parallel or combined. The key here, however, is the expression &#8220;they cover their heads&#8221; which is used in 2 Sam 15:30 for the expression of grief. Moreover, the word translated here &#8220;disappointed&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bosh</font>) is used that way several times. See for example Jer 12:13 and consult examples in BDB 101 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;</font> Qal.2. A very similar context with the same figure is found in Jer 2:36-37.</p>
