<A NAME="141"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=883><b>sn</b> The form of Jer 14:1&#8211;15:9 is very striking rhetorically. It consists essentially of laments and responses to them. However, what makes it so striking is its deviation from normal form (cf. 2 Chr 20:5-17 for what would normally be expected). The descriptions of the lamentable situation come from the mouth of God <i>not</i> the people (cf.14:1-6, 17-18). The prophet utters the petitions with statements of trust (14:7-9, 19-22) and the <sc>Lord answers <i>not</i> with oracles promising deliverance but promising doom (14:10; 15:1-9). In the course of giving the first oracle of doom, the Lord commands Jeremiah not to pray for the people (14:11-12) and Jeremiah tries to provide an excuse for their actions (14:13). The <sc>Lord responds to that with an oracle of doom on the false prophets (14:14-16).</p>
