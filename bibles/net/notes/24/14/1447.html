<A NAME="1447"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=929><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;starvation&#8221; has been translated &#8220;famine&#8221; elsewhere in this passage. It is the word which refers to hunger. The &#8220;starvation&#8221; here may be war induced and not simply that which comes from famine per se. &#8220;Starvation&#8221; will cover both.</p>
