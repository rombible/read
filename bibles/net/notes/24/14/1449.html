<A NAME="1449"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=931><b>tn</b> The words, &#8220;Then I said, &#8216;<sc>Lord&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text. It is obvious from the context that the <sc>Lord is addressee. The question of the identity of the speaker is the same as that raised in vv. 7-9 and the arguments set forth there are applicable here as well. Jeremiah is here identifying with the people and doing what they refuse to do, i.e., confess their sins and express their trust in him.</p>
