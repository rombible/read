<A NAME="1457"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=939><b>tn</b> English versions quite commonly supply &#8220;us&#8221; as an object for the verb in the first line. This is probably wrong. The Hebrew text reads: &#8220;Do not treat with contempt for the sake of your name; do not treat with disdain your glorious throne.&#8221; This is case of poetic parallelism where the object is left hanging until the second line. For an example of this see Prov 13:1 in the original and consult E. W. Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech, </i>103-4. There has also been some disagreement whether &#8220;your glorious throne&#8221; refers to the temple (as in 17:12) or Jerusalem (as in 3:17). From the beginning of the prayer in v. 19 where a similar kind of verb has been used with respect to Zion/Jerusalem it would appear that the contextual referent is Jerusalem. The absence of an object from the first line makes it possible to retain part of the metaphor in the translation and still convey some meaning.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The place of God&#8217;s <i>glorious throne</i> was first of all the ark of the covenant where God was said to be enthroned between the cherubim, then the temple that housed it, then the city itself. See 2 Kgs 19:14-15 in the context of Sennacherib&#8217;s attack on Jerusalem.</p>
