<A NAME="1417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=899><b>tn</b> It would be a mistake to translate this word as &#8220;stranger.&#8221; This word (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ger</font>) refers to a resident alien or resident foreigner who stays in a country not his own. He is accorded the privilege of protection through the common rights of hospitality but he does not have the rights of the native born or citizen. The simile here is particularly effective. The land was the <sc>Lord&#8217;s land; they were but resident foreigners and tenants on it (Lev 25:23). Jeremiah&#8217;s complaint here is particularly bold. For further information on the status of &#8220;resident foreigners&#8221; see <i>IDB</i> 4:397-99 s.v. &#8220;Sojourner.&#8221;</p>
