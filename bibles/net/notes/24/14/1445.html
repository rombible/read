<A NAME="1445"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=927><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;virgin daughter, my people.&#8221; The last noun here is appositional to the first two (genitive of apposition). Hence it is not &#8216;literally&#8217; &#8220;virgin daughter of my people.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This is a metaphor which occurs several times with regard to Israel, Judah, Zion, and even Sidon and Babylon. It is the poetic personification of the people, the city, or the land. Like other metaphors the quality of the comparison being alluded to must be elicited from the context. This is easy in Isa 23:12 (oppressed) and Isa 47:1 (soft and delicate) but not so easy in other places. From the nature of the context the suspicion here is that the protection the virgin was normally privileged to is being referred to and there is a reminder that the people are forfeiting it by their actions. Hence God laments for them.</p>
