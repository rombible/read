<A NAME="1437"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=919><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;divination and worthlessness.&#8221; The noun &#8220;worthlessness&#8221; stands as a qualifying &#8220;of&#8221; phrase (= to an adjective; an attributive genitive in Hebrew) after a noun in Zech 11:17; Job 13:4. This is an example of hendiadys where two nouns are joined by &#8220;and&#8221; with one serving as the qualifier of the other.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The word translated &#8220;predictions&#8221; here is really the word &#8220;divination.&#8221; Divination was prohibited in Israel (cf. Deut 18:10, 14). The practice of divination involved various mechanical means to try to predict the future. The word was used here for its negative connotations in a statement that is rhetorically structured to emphasize the falseness of the promises of the false prophets. It would be unnatural to contemporary English style to try to capture this emphasis in English. In the Hebrew text the last sentence reads: &#8220;False vision, divination, and worthlessness and the deceitfulness of their heart they are prophesying to them.&#8221; For the emphasis in the preceding sentence see the note there.</p>
