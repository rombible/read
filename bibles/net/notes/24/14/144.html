<A NAME="144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=886><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Judah mourns, its gates pine away, they are in mourning on the ground.&#8221; There are several figures of speech involved here. The basic figure is that of personification where Judah and it cities are said to be in mourning. However, in the third line the figure is a little hard to sustain because &#8220;they&#8221; are in mourning on the ground. That presses the imagination of most moderns a little too far. Hence the personification has been interpreted &#8220;people of&#8221; throughout. The term &#8220;gates&#8221; here is used as part for whole for the &#8220;cities&#8221; themselves as in several other passages in the OT (cf. BDB 1045 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</font> 2.b, c and see, e.g., Isa 14:31).</p>
