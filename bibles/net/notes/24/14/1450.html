<A NAME="1450"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=932><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;does your soul despise.&#8221; Here as in many places the word &#8220;soul&#8221; stands as part for whole for the person himself emphasizing emotional and volitional aspects of the person. However, in contemporary English one does not regularly speak of the &#8220;soul&#8221; in contexts such as this but of the person.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> There is probably a subtle allusion to the curses called down on the nation for failure to keep their covenant with God. The word used here is somewhat rare (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ga</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>). It is used of Israel&#8217;s rejection of God&#8217;s stipulations and of God&#8217;s response to their rejection of him and his stipulations in Lev 26:11, 15, 30, 43-44. That the allusion is intended is probable when account is taken of the last line of v. 21.</p>
