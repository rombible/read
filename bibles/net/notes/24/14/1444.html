<A NAME="1444"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=926><b>tn</b> Many of the English versions and commentaries render this an indirect or third person imperative, &#8220;Let my eyes overflow&#8230;&#8221; because of the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) which introduces the phrase translated &#8220;without ceasing&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1502;&#1462;&#1497;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">al-tidmenah</font>). However, this is undoubtedly an example where the particle introduces an affirmation that something cannot be done (cf. GKC 322 §109.<i>e</i>). Clear examples of this are found in Pss 41:2 (41:3 HT); 50:3; Job 40:32 (41:8). God here is describing again a lamentable situation and giving his response to it. See 14:1-6 above.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Once again it is the <sc>Lord lamenting the plight of the people, now directed to them, not the people lamenting their plight to him. See 14:1-6 and the study notes on the introduction to this section and on 14:7.</p>
