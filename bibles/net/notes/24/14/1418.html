<A NAME="1418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=900><b>tn</b> This is the only time this word occurs in the Hebrew Bible. The lexicons generally take it to mean &#8220;confused&#8221; or &#8220;surprised&#8221; (cf., e.g., BDB 187 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1463;&#1501;</font>). However, the word has been found in a letter from the seventh century in a passage where it must mean something like &#8220;be helpless&#8221;; see W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah </i>(Hermeneia), 1:433, for discussion and bibliography of an article where this letter is dealt with.</p>
