<A NAME="148"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=890><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;containers&#8221; is a generic word in Hebrew = &#8220;vessels.&#8221; It would probably in this case involve water &#8220;jars&#8221; or &#8220;jugs.&#8221; But since in contemporary English one would normally associate those terms with smaller vessels, &#8220;containers&#8221; may be safer.</p>
