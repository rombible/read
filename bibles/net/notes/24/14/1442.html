<A NAME="1442"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=924><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;their evil.&#8221; Hebrew words often include within them a polarity of cause and effect. Thus the word for &#8220;evil&#8221; includes both the concept of wickedness and the punishment for it. Other words that function this way are &#8220;iniquity&#8221; = &#8220;guilt [of iniquity]&#8221; = &#8220;punishment [for iniquity].&#8221; Context determines which nuance is proper.</p>
