<A NAME="2927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1662><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;restore your fortune.&#8221; Alternately, &#8220;I will bring you back from exile.&#8221; This idiom occurs twenty-six times in the OT and in several cases it is clearly not referring to return from exile but restoration of fortunes (e.g., Job 42:10; Hos 6:11&#8211;7:1; Jer 33:11). It is often followed as here by &#8220;regather&#8221; or &#8220;bring back&#8221; (e.g., Jer 30:3; Ezek 29:14) so it is often misunderstood as &#8220;bringing back the exiles.&#8221; The versions (LXX, Vulg., Tg., Pesh.) often translate the idiom as &#8220;to go away into captivity,&#8221; deriving the noun from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿvi</font>, &#8220;captivity&#8221;). However, the use of this expression in Old Aramaic documents of Sefire parallels the biblical idiom: &#8220;the gods <i>restored the fortunes</i> of the house of my father again&#8221; (J. A. Fitzmyer, <i>The Aramaic Inscriptions of Sefire</i> [BibOr], 100-101, 119-20). The idiom means &#8220;to turn someone's fortune, bring about change&#8221; or &#8220;to reestablish as it was&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 1386 s.v. 3.c). In Ezek 16:53 it is paralleled by the expression &#8220;to restore the situation which prevailed earlier.&#8221; This amounts to <i>restitutio in integrum</i>, which is applicable to the circumstances surrounding the return of the exiles.</p>
