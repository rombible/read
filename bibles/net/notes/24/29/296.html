<A NAME="296"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1641><b>sn</b> This individual is not the same as the Gemariah mentioned in 36:10, 11, 12, 25 who was one of the officials who sought to have the first scroll of Jeremiah&#8217;s prophecies preserved. He may, however, have been a son or grandson of the High Priest who discovered the book of the law during the reign of Josiah (cf., e.g., 2 Kgs 22:8, 10) which was so instrumental in Josiah&#8217;s reforms. </p>
