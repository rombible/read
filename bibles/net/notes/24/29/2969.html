<A NAME="2969"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=1704><b>sn</b> Compare the same charge against Hananiah in Jer 28:16 and see the note there. In this case, the false prophesy of Shemaiah is not given but it likely had the same tenor since he wants Jeremiah reprimanded for saying that the exile will be long and the people are to settle down in Babylon.</p>
