<A NAME="2959"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=1694><b>sn</b> The Hebrew term translated <i>lunatic </i>applies to anyone who exhibits irrational behavior. It was used for example of David who drooled and scratched on the city gate to convince Achish not to arrest him as a politically dangerous threat (1 Sam 21:14). It was often used contemptuously of the prophets by those who wanted to play down the significance of their words (2 Kgs 9:11; Hos 9:7 and here).</p>
