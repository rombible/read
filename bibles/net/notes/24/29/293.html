<A NAME="293"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1638><b>tn</b> This term is often mistakenly understood to refer to a &#8220;eunuch.&#8221; It is clear, however, in Gen 39:1 that &#8220;eunuchs&#8221; could be married. On the other hand it is clear from Isa 59:3-5 that some who bore this title could not have children. In this period, it is possible that the persons who bore this title were high officials like the <font face="Scholar">rab saris</font><i> </i>who was a high official in the Babylonian court (cf. Jer 39:3, 13; 52:25). For further references see <i>HALOT</i> 727 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1505;</font> 1.c.</p>
