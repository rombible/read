<A NAME="2953"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1688><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;letters.&#8221; Though GKC 397 §124.<i>b</i>, n. 1 denies it, this is probably a case of the plural of extension. For a similar usage see Isa 37:14 where the plural &#8220;letters&#8221; is referred to later as an &#8220;it.&#8221; Even if there were other &#8220;letters,&#8221; the focus is on the letter to Zephaniah.</p>
