Such switches are common to Hebrew poetry and prophecy (cf. GKC 462 §144.<i>p</i>). Contemporary English, however, does not exhibit such rapid switches and it creates confusion for the careful reader. Such switches have regularly been avoided in the translation.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Elsewhere Nebuchadnezzar is seen as the one who carried them into exile (cf. 27:20; 29:1). Here and in v. 14 the <sc>Lord is seen as the one who sends them into exile. The <sc>Lord is the ultimate cause and Nebuchadnezzar is his agent or servant (cf. 25:9; 27:6 and notes).</p>
