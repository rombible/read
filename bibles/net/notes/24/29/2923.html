<A NAME="2923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1658><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;You will call out to me and come to me in prayer and I will hear your prayers.&#8221; The verbs are <i>vav</i> consecutive perfects and can be taken either as unconditional futures or as contingent futures. See GKC 337 §112.<i>kk</i> and 494 §159.<i>g</i> and compare the usage in Gen 44:22 for the use of the <i>vav</i> consecutive perfects in contingent futures. The conditional clause in the middle of 29:13 and the deuteronomic theology reflected in both Deut 30:1-5 and 1 Kgs 8:46-48 suggest that the verbs are continent futures here. For the same demand for wholehearted seeking in these contexts which presuppose exile see especially Deut 30:2, 1 Kgs 8:48.</p>
