<A NAME="2940"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1675><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;pay attention to the word of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; However, the <sc>Lord is speaking in the words just previous to this and in the words which follow (&#8220;whom I have sent&#8221;). This is another example of the shift from third person referent to first person which is common in Hebrew poetry and prophecy but is not common in English style. The person has been adjusted in the translation to avoid confusion.</p>
