<A NAME="111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=684><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The word which came to Jeremiah from the <sc>Lord, saying.&#8221; The proposed translation is more in keeping with contemporary English idiom. Cf. 1:2 and 7:1 and footnotes there.</p>
<A NAME="112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=685><b>tn</b> The form is a second masculine plural which is followed in the MT of vv. 2-3 by second masculine singulars. This plus the fact that the whole clause &#8220;listen to the terms of this covenant&#8221; is nearly repeated at the end of v. 3 has led many modern scholars to delete the whole clause (cf., e.g. W. McKane,<i> Jeremiah </i>[ICC], 1:236-37). However, this only leads to further adjustments in the rest of the verse which are difficult to justify. The form has also led to a good deal of speculation about who these others were that are initially addressed here. The juxtaposition of second plural and singular forms has a precedent in Deuteronomy, where the nation is sometimes addressed with the plural and at other times with a collective singular. </p>
<A NAME="113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=686><b>sn</b> <i>The covenant</i> <i>I made with Israel</i>. Apart from the legal profession and Jewish and Christian tradition the term &#8220;covenant&#8221; may not be too familiar. There were essentially three kinds of &#8220;covenants&#8221; that were referred to under the Hebrew term used here: (1) &#8220;Parity treaties&#8221; or &#8220;covenants&#8221; between equals in which each party pledged itself to certain agreed upon stipulations and took an oath to it in the name of their god or gods (cf. Gen 31:44-54); (2) &#8220;Suzerain-vassal treaties&#8221; or &#8220;covenants&#8221; in which a great king pledged himself to protect the vassal&#8217;s realm and his right to rule over his own domain in exchange for sovereignty over the vassal, including the rendering of absolute loyalty and submission to the great king&#8217;s demands spelled out in detailed stipulations; (3) &#8220;Covenants of grant&#8221; in which a great king granted to a loyal servant or vassal king permanent title to a piece of land or dominion over a specified realm in recognition of past service. It is generally recognized that the Mosaic covenant which is being referred to here is of the second type and that it resembles in kind the ancient Near Eastern suzerain-vassal treaties. These treaties typically contained the following elements: (1) a preamble identifying the great king (cf. Exod 20:2a; Deut 1:1-4); (2) a historical prologue summarizing the great king&#8217;s past benefactions as motivation for future loyalty (cf. Exod 20:2b; Deut 1:5&#8211;4:43); (3) the primary stipulation of absolute and unconditional loyalty (cf. Exod 20:3-8; Deut 5:1&#8211;11:32); (4) specific stipulations governing future relations between the vassal and the great king and the vassal&#8217;s relation to other vassals (cf. Exod 20:22&#8211;23:33; Deut 12:1&#8211;26:15); (5) the invoking of curses on the vassal for disloyalty and the pronouncing of blessing on him for loyalty (cf. Lev 26; Deut 27-28); (6) the invoking of witnesses to the covenant, often the great king&#8217;s and the vassal&#8217;s gods (cf. Deut 30:19; 31:28 where the reference is to the &#8220;heavens and the earth&#8221; as enduring witnesses). It is also generally agreed that the majority of the threats of punishment by the prophets refer to the invocation of these covenant curses for disloyalty to the basic stipulation, that of absolute loyalty. </p>
<A NAME="114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=687><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;this covenant.&#8221; The referent of &#8220;this&#8221; is left dangling until it is further defined in vv. 3-4. Leaving it undefined in the translation may lead to confusion hence the anticipatory nature of the demonstrative is spelled out explicitly in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=688><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and speak/tell them.&#8221; However, the translation chosen is more appropriate to modern idiom.</p>
<A NAME="116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=689><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;those living in Jerusalem&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;inhabitants of.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=690><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Cursed is the person who does not listen to the terms of this covenant.&#8221; &#8220;This covenant&#8221; is further qualified in the following verse by a relative clause. The form of the sentence and the qualification &#8220;my&#8221; before covenant were chosen for better English idiom and to break up a long sentence which really extends to the middle of v. 5.</p>
<A NAME="118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=691><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fathers&#8221; (also in vv. 5, 7, 10).</p>
<A NAME="119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=692><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;does not listen&#8230;this covenant which I commanded your fathers.&#8221; The sentence is broken up this way in conformity with contemporary English style.</p>
<A NAME="1110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=693><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron-smelting furnace.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=694><b>tn</b> In place of the words &#8220;I said at that time&#8221; the Hebrew text has &#8220;saying.&#8221; The sentence is again being restructured in English to avoid the long, confusing style of the Hebrew original.</p>
<A NAME="1112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=695><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Obey me and carry them out.&#8221; The &#8220;them&#8221; refers back to the terms of the covenant which they were charged to keep according to the preceding. The referent is made specific to avoid ambiguity.</p>
<A NAME="1113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=696><b>tn</b> The words, &#8220;If you do&#8221; are not in the text. They have been supplied in the translation to break up a long sentence consisting of an imperative followed by a consequential sentence.</p>
<A NAME="1114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=697><b>sn</b> <i>Obey me and carry out the terms of the agreement&#8230;and I will be your God</i>. This refers to the Mosaic law which was instituted at Sinai and renewed on the Plains of Moab before Israel entered into the land. The words &#8220;the terms of the covenant&#8221; are explicitly used for the Ten Commandments in Exod 34:28 and for the additional legislation given in Deut 28:69; 29:8. The formulation here is reminiscent of Deut 29:9-14 (29:10-15 HT). The book of Deuteronomy is similar in its structure and function to an ancient Near Eastern treaty. In these the great king reminded his vassal of past benefits that he had given to him, charged him with obligations (the terms or stipulations of the covenant) chief among which was absolute loyalty and sole allegiance, promised him future benefits for obeying the stipulations (the blessings), and placed him under a curse for disobeying them. Any disobedience was met with stern warnings of punishment in the form of destruction and exile. Those who had witnessed the covenant were called in to confirm the continuing goodness of the great king and the disloyalty of the vassal. The vassal was then charged with a list of particular infringements of the stipulations and warned to change his actions or suffer the consequences. This is the background for Jer 11:1-9. Jeremiah is here functioning as a messenger from the <sc>Lord, Israel&#8217;s great king, and charging both the fathers and the children with breach of covenant.</p>
<A NAME="1115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=698><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;a land flowing with milk and honey&#8221; is very familiar to readers in the Jewish and Christian traditions as a proverbial description of the agricultural and pastoral abundance of the land of Israel. However, it may not mean too much to readers outside those traditions; an equivalent expression would be &#8220;a land of fertile fields and fine pastures.&#8221; E. W. Bullinger (<i>Figures of Speech</i>, 626) identifies this as a figure of speech called synecdoche where the species is put for the genus, &#8220;a region&#8230;abounding with pasture and fruits of all kinds.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=699><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;&#8216;a land flowing with milk and honey,&#8217; as at this day.&#8221; However, the literal reading is too elliptical and would lead to confusion.</p>
<A NAME="1117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=700><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;Let it be so&#8221; are not in the text; they are an explanation of the significance of the term &#8220;Amen&#8221; for those who may not be part of the Christian or Jewish tradition.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The word <i>amen</i> is found at the end of each of the curses in Deut 27 where the people express their agreement with the appropriateness of the curse for the offense mentioned.</p>
<A NAME="1118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=701><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the terms of this covenant.&#8221; However, this was a separate message and the ambiguity of &#8220;this&#8221; could still cause some confusion.</p>
<A NAME="1119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=702><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;warned them&#8230;saying, &#8216;Obey me.&#8217;&#8221; However, it allows the long sentence to be broken up easier if the indirect quote is used.</p>
<A NAME="1120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=703><b>tn</b> For the explanation for this rendering see the note on 7:13.</p>
<A NAME="1121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=704><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;So I brought on them all the terms of this covenant which I commanded to do and they did not do.&#8221; There is an interesting polarity that is being exploited by two different nuances implicit in the use of the word &#8220;terms&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;</font> [<font face="Scholar">divre</font>], literally &#8220;words&#8221;), i.e., what the <sc>Lord &#8220;brings on&#8221; them, namely, the curses that are the penalty for disobedience and the stipulations that they are &#8220;to do,&#8221; that is, to carry out. The sentence is broken up this way in keeping with contemporary English style to avoid the long and complicated style of the original.</p>
<A NAME="1122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=705><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Conspiracy [a plot to rebel] is found [or exists] among the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=706><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;They have repeated the evil actions of&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=707><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;have walked/followed after.&#8221; See the translator&#8217;s note at 2:5 for the idiom.</p>
<A NAME="1125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=708><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;house of Israel and house of Judah.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=709><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Therefore, thus, says the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The person has been shifted in the translation in accordance with the difference between Hebrew and English style.</p>
<A NAME="1127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=710><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Then the towns of Judah and those living in Jerusalem will&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=711><b>tn</b> The Hebrew construction is emphatic involving the use of an infinitive of the verb before the verb itself (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;saving they will not save&#8221;). For this construction to give emphasis to an antithesis, cf. GKC 343 §113.<i>p</i>.</p>
<A NAME="1129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=712><b>tn</b> This is again an attempt to render the Hebrew particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) contextually. The nuance is a little hard to establish due to the nature of the rhetoric of the passage which utilizes the figure of apostrophe where the <sc>Lord turns from talking about Judah to addressing her directly, probably in condemnatory tones. Something like &#8220;the very idea that you should&#8230;&#8221; might best represent the mood. The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> is probably asseverative or intensive (cf. BDB 472 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 1.e).</p>
<A NAME="1130"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=713><b>sn</b> Cf. Jer 2:28.</p>
<A NAME="1131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=714><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;For [or Indeed] the number of your [sing.] cities are your [sing.] gods, Judah, and the number of the streets of Jerusalem [or perhaps (your) streets, Jerusalem] you [plur.] have set up altars to the shameful thing, altars to sacrifice to Baal.&#8221; This passage involves a figure of speech where the speaker turns from describing something about someone to addressing him/her directly (a figure called apostrophe). This figure is not common in contemporary English literature or conversation and translating literally would lead to confusion on the part of some readers. Hence, the translation retains the third person in keeping with the rest of the context. The shift from singular &#8220;your cities&#8221; to plural &#8220;you have set up&#8221; is interpreted contextually to refer to a shift in addressing Judah to addressing the citizens of Jerusalem whose streets are being talked about. The appositional clause, &#8220;altars to sacrifice to Baal&#8221; has been collapsed with the preceding clause to better identify what the shameful thing is and to eliminate a complex construction. The length of this sentence runs contrary to the usual practice of breaking up long complex sentences in Hebrew into shorter equivalent ones in English. However, breaking up this sentence and possibly losing the connecting link with the preceding used to introduce it might lead to misunderstanding.</p>
<A NAME="1132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=715><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=716><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;to save them&#8221; are not in the text but are implicit from the context. They are supplied in the translation for clarity.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Cf. Jer 7:16 where this same command is addressed to Jeremiah.</p>
<A NAME="1134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=717><b>tc</b> The rendering &#8220;when disaster strikes them&#8221; is based on reading &#8220;at the time of&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1461;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et</font>) with a number of Hebrew <sc>mss and the versions instead of &#8220;on account of&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ad</font>). W. L. Holladay (<i>Jeremiah </i>[Hermeneia], 1:347) is probably right in assuming that the MT has been influenced by &#8220;for them&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">va</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adam</font>) earlier in the verse.</p>
<A NAME="1135"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=718><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;The <sc>Lord says to the people of Judah&#8221; are not in the text. It is, however, clear from the words that follow that he is the speaker and Judah the addressee. The words are supplied in the translation for the sake of clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=719><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;What to my beloved [being] in my house?&#8221; The text has been restructured to avoid possible confusion by the shift from third person in the first two lines to second person in the last two lines and the lines of the following verse. The reference to Judah as his &#8220;beloved&#8221; is certainly ironic and perhaps even sarcastic.</p>
<A NAME="1137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=720><b>tc</b> The meaning of this line is uncertain. The text reads somewhat literally either &#8220;her doing the wicked thing the many&#8221; or &#8220;doing it, the wicked thing, the many.&#8221; The text, relationship between words, and meaning of this whole verse have been greatly debated. Wholesale emendation based on the ancient versions is common in both the commentaries and the modern English versions. Many follow the lead of the Greek version which in many cases offers a smoother reading but for that very reason may not be original. The notes that follow will explain some of these emendations but will also attempt to explain the most likely meaning of the MT which is the more difficult and probably the more original text. Since it is presumed to be the original the text will be dealt with in the notes line for line in the MT even though the emendations often relate to more than one line. For example the Greek of the first two lines reads: &#8220;Why has the beloved done abomination in my house?&#8221; This ignores the preposition before &#8220;my beloved&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">lididi</font>) and treats the form &#8220;her doing&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1492;&#1468;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asotah</font>], Qal infinitive plus suffix) as a finite verb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">astah</font>], Qal perfect third feminine). The forms are similar but the Greek is smoother. Moreover, it is difficult to explain the presence of &#8220;to&#8221; in the MT if the Greek is the original. The Greek text likewise does not have the difficulty that is exhibited in the MT by the word &#8220;the many&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">harabbim</font>). It reads a word for &#8220;vows/votive offerings&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8016;&#967;&#945;&#943; </font>[<font face="Greektl">eucai</font>] regularly = <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> [<font face="Scholar">gÿdarim</font>]) in place of the word &#8220;many&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">harabbim</font>) and takes it as part of a compound subject of the verb in the following line meaning &#8220;take away.&#8221; However, this word is far removed graphically from that in the MT and it would be difficult to explain how the MT arose from it. The Old Latin apparently reads a word for &#8220;fat&#8221; (<font face="Scholar">adipes</font> = <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khalavim</font>) which is closer in script to the MT and would be more likely original than the Greek. However, both of these resolutions look like attempts to smooth out a difficult text. Because there is no solid support for any single reading, it is probably best to retain the MT&#8217;s &#8220;the many.&#8221; Many do retain it and take it as a second accusative of &#8220;doing it&#8221; and read &#8220;she does the wicked thing with many [i.e., many false gods],&#8221; a use of the accusative which is hard to justify. Another alternative, taking the adjective &#8220;the many&#8221; to modify the noun &#8220;the wicked thing&#8221; is sometimes suggested but is not possible because the adjective is masculine plural and the noun is feminine singular which is contrary to Hebrew style. Hence one cannot read &#8220;she has done many wicked things.&#8221; The present translation follows the suggestion in D. Barthélemy, ed., <i>Preliminary and Interim Report on the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project</i>, 4:209, that it is the subject of the infinitive construct with an object suffix which is anticipatory of the noun &#8220;wickedness&#8221; that follows (cf. GKC 425 §131.<i>m</i>), i.e., &#8220;the many do it, namely the wickedness&#8221; (for the meaning of the noun see BDB 273 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1494;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> 3.b).</p>
<A NAME="1138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=721><b>tn</b> The meaning of this line is also uncertain. The Hebrew text reads somewhat literally, &#8220;holy meat they pass over from upon you.&#8221; The question of the subject of the verb is the main problem here. The verb is masculine plural and the only subject available is &#8220;holy meat&#8221; which is singular, a &#8220;they&#8221; which goes back to &#8220;the many,&#8221; or a noun from the end of the preceding line which is combined with &#8220;holy meat.&#8221; The latter is the solution of the Greek version which reads &#8220;Will votive offerings [or pieces of fat (following the Old Latin)] and holy meats take away from you your wickedness?&#8221; However, that resolution has been rejected in the preceding note as smoothing out the difficulties of the first two lines. It also leaves out the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) at the beginning of the following line and takes the noun &#8220;your wickedness&#8221; as the object of the verb. That certainly would make for an easier reading of both this line and the next and the assumption that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> may not be in the text is possible because it could be explained as a double writing of the pronoun on the end of the preceding phrase &#8220;from upon you&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1497;&#1460;&#1498;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">me</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alayikh</font>). However, besides being the smoother reading it leaves the last line too short poetically. The solution of the UBS, <i>Preliminary Report</i>, 4:209 is that &#8220;they&#8221; (referring back to &#8220;the many&#8221;?) is the subject. They read: &#8220;so that they carry away from you even sacrificial flesh.&#8221; But who are &#8220;they&#8221; and &#8220;you?&#8221; Is the &#8220;they&#8221; the priests and the &#8220;you&#8221; the people? (See 1 Sam 2:10-17 for a possible parallel.) This, however, introduces too many unknowns into the text. The translation adopted is based on a revocalization of the form &#8220;from upon you&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1497;&#1460;&#1498;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">me</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alayikh</font>) to &#8220;your treacherous acts&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1464;&#1497;&#1460;&#1498;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ma</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alayikh</font>; for this noun cf. BDB 591 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> 2), a solution which is also proposed in the margin of the NJPS which reads: &#8220;Can your treacheries be canceled by sacral flesh?&#8221; For the nuance of the verb presupposed here (= be removed, cease to exist) see BDB 718 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;</font> Qal.6.c and compare usage in Job 30:15. While this solution does preserve the consonantal text and is accepted here, it should be acknowledged that there is no ancient support for it and the reading of the noun &#8220;treacheries&#8221; in place of the compound preposition &#8220;from upon&#8221; is purely speculative.</p>
<A NAME="1139"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=722><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;for [or when] your wickedness then you rejoice.&#8221; The meaning of this line is uncertain. The Greek version, which reads &#8220;or will you escape by these things&#8221; (presupposing a Hebrew text <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501; &#1506;&#1463;&#1500; &#1494;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514; &#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">im </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al zot ta</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">uzi</font>) is far removed from the reading in the MT (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1494; &#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1465;&#1494;&#1460;&#1497;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">az ta</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alozi</font>]; the rest of the Hebrew line has been left out because the Greek reads it with the preceding line) and again appears to be an attempt to smooth out a difficult text. The translation retains the MT but rewords it so it makes better sense in English. The translation presupposes that the phrase &#8220;your wickedness&#8221; is the object of the verb &#8220;take joy&#8221; and the adverb &#8220;then&#8221; refers back to the offering of sacred flesh, i.e., &#8220;even then [or at that time]&#8221; as a <i>constructio ad sensum</i>. For a similar use of the adverb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1494;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">az</font>) compare Gen 13:7. For the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) meaning &#8220;that&#8221; after a question see BDB 472 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 1.f. A possible alternative would be to read as UBS, <i>Preliminary Report</i>, 4:209 do: &#8220;When trouble reaches you, then will you exult?&#8221; If the text of the whole verse followed here, the more difficult text, is not the original one, the most likely alternative would be: &#8220;What right does my beloved have to be in my house? She has does wicked things [reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1492; &#1502;&#1456;&#1494;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1465;&#1514;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">ostah mÿzimot</font>].

[If it could] then you could rejoice.&#8221; It should be emphasized that the text of the verse is uncertain in a number of places and open to more than one interpretation. However, regardless of which text or interpretation of it is followed, the Masoretic as interpreted here, the Greek as given in the notes, or an emended text based on both, the overall meaning is much the same. Judah has done evil and the <sc>Lord rejects their superficial attempts to placate him through ritual without change of behavior. The particulars are different; the point is the same.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> For the argument of this verse compare the condemnatory questions in Jer 7:9-11.</p>
<A NAME="1140"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=723><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The <sc>Lord once called you&#8230;.&#8221; This is another example of the rapid shift in person that is common to Hebrew style which is not common in English and could lead to confusion for some readers.

<A NAME="1141"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=724><b>tn</b> The verb form used here is another example of a verb expressing that the action is as good as done (the Hebrew prophetic perfect).</p>

The Hebrew use of the pronouns in vv. 16-17 for the olive tree and the people that it represents is likely to cause confusion if retained. In v. 16 the people are &#8220;you&#8221; and the olive tree is &#8220;it.&#8221; The people are again &#8220;you&#8221; in v. 17 but part of the metaphor is carried over, i.e., &#8220;he &#8216;planted&#8217; you.&#8221; It creates less confusion in the flow of the passage if the metaphorical identification is carried out throughout by addressing the people/plant as &#8220;you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1143"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=726><b>tn</b> The verb here has most commonly been derived from a root meaning &#8220;to be broken&#8221; (cf. BDB 949 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1506;</font>) which fits poorly with the metaphor of setting the plant on fire. Another common option is to emend it to a verb meaning &#8220;to be burned up&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ar</font>).

<A NAME="1148"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=731><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;caused me to know that I might know.&#8221; Many English versions supply an unstated object &#8220;their plots&#8221; which is referred to later in the context (cf. v. 19). The presupposition of this kind of absolute ellipsis is difficult to justify and would create the need for understanding an ellipsis of &#8220;it&#8221; also after &#8220;I knew.&#8221; It is better to see a bipolar use of the verb &#8220;know&#8221; here. For the second use of the verb &#8220;know&#8221; meaning &#8220;have understanding&#8221; see BDB 394 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1464;&#1497;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</font> Qal.5.</p>
<A NAME="1149"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=732><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Then you showed me their deeds.&#8221; This is another example of the rapid shift in person which is common in Jeremiah.

The text again involves an apostrophe, talking about the <sc>Lord to addressing him.</p>

GKC 258 §91.<i>l</i> for general use and Ps 11:7 and Job 27:23 for third singular use. Though this fits the context nicely the emendation is probably unnecessary since the word &#8220;bread&#8221; is sometimes used of other foodstuff than grain or its products (cf. BDB 537 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1462;&#1495;&#1462;&#1501;</font> 2.a).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The word <i>fruit</i> refers contextually here to the prophecies that Jeremiah was giving, not (as some suppose) his progeny.

In Hebrew thought the &#8220;kidneys&#8221; were thought of as the seat of the emotions and passions and the &#8220;heart&#8221; was viewed as the seat of intellect, conscience, and will. The &#8220;heart&#8221; and the &#8220;kidneys&#8221; are often used figuratively for the thoughts, emotions, motives, and drives that are thought to be seated in them.</p>
