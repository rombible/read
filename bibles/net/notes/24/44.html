<A NAME="441"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2384><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The word came to Jeremiah concerning.&#8221; Though the phrase &#8220;from the <sc>Lord&#8221; is missing from this formula which occurs elsewhere at 7:1; 11:1; 18:1; 21:1; 30:1; 32:1; 34:1, 8; 35:1; 40:1, it is clearly implied from the words that follow. As in these other passages, the more active form has been chosen for the translation to better conform with contemporary English style.</p>
<A NAME="442"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2385><b>sn</b> The first three cities, <i>Migdol</i>, <i>Tahpanhes</i>, and <i>Memphis</i>, are located in Northern or Lower Egypt. Memphis (Heb &#8220;<i>Noph</i>&#8221;) was located south of Heliopolis (which was referred to earlier as &#8220;the temple of the sun&#8221;) and was about fourteen miles (23 km) south of Cairo. For the identification and location of Tahpanhes see the study note on Jer 43:7. The location of Migdol has been debated but is tentatively identified with a border fortress about twenty-five miles (42 km) east-northeast of Tahpanhes. The &#8220;region of southern Egypt&#8221; is literally &#8220;the land of Pathros,&#8221; the long Nile valley extending north and south between Cairo and Aswan (biblical Syene). For further information see the discussion in G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, T. G. Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52 </i>(WBC),<i> </i>262-63. Reference here is to Judean exiles who had fled earlier as well as to those from Mizpah who were led into Egypt by Johanan and the other arrogant men (43:3, 5).</p>

<A NAME="447"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2390><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;thus making me angry.&#8221; However, this is a good place to break the sentence to create a shorter sentence that is more in keeping with contemporary English style.</p>

<A NAME="449"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2392><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fathers&#8221; (also in vv. 9, 10, 17, 21).</p>
<A NAME="4410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2393><b>sn</b> Compare Jer 19:4 for the same thought and see also 7:9.</p>
<A NAME="4411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2394><b>tn</b> See 7:13 for an explanation of this idiom and compare 7:25; 25:4; 26:5; 29:19; 35:15 for similar references to the persistent warnings of the prophets.</p>

<A NAME="4413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2396><b>tn</b> There appears to be a deliberate shift in the pronouns used in vv. 2-5. &#8220;You&#8221; refers to the people living in Egypt who are being addressed (v. 2) and to the people of present and past generations to whom the <sc>Lord persistently sent the prophets (v. 4). &#8220;They&#8221; refers to the people of Jerusalem and the towns of Judah who have suffered disaster (v. 2) because of the wickedness of sacrificing to other gods (vv. 3, 5). The referents have been explicitly identified in the translation for the sake of clarity.</p>
<A NAME="4414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2397><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;They did not listen or incline their ear [= pay attention] by turning from their wickedness by not sacrificing to other gods.&#8221; The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lamed</font>) + the negative + the infinitive is again epexegetical. The sentence has been restructured and more idiomatic English expressions have been used to better conform with contemporary English style but an attempt has been made to retain the basic relationships of subordination.</p>
<A NAME="4415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2398><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Yahweh, the God of armies, the God of Israel.&#8221; Compare 35:17; 38:17 and for the title &#8220;God of armies&#8221; see the study note on 2:19.</p>
<A NAME="4416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2399><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the works of your hands.&#8221; Here the phrase is qualified by the epexegetical <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lamed</font>) + infinitive, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1511;&#1463;&#1496;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿqatter</font>, &#8220;by sacrificing [to other gods]&#8221;).

<A NAME="4417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2400><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a curse.&#8221; For the meaning of this phrase see the translator&#8217;s note on 24:9 and see the usage in 24:9; 25:18; 26:6; 29:22.</p>
<A NAME="4418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2401><b>tn</b> Verses 7b-8 are all one long, complex sentence governed by the interrogative &#8220;Why.&#8221; The Hebrew text reads: &#8220;Why are you doing great harm to your souls [= &#8220;yourselves&#8221; (cf. BDB 660 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> 4.b[6])] so as to cut off [= destroy] from yourselves man and woman, child and baby [the terms are collective singulars and are to be interpreted as plurals] from the midst of Judah so as not to leave to yourselves a remnant by making me angry with the works of your hands by sacrificing to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have come to live so as to cut off [an example of result rather than purpose after the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿma</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">an</font>; see the translator&#8217;s note on 25:7)] yourselves and so that you may become a curse and an object of ridicule among all the nations of the earth.&#8221; The sentence has been broken down and restructured to better conform with contemporary English style. An attempt has been made to retain an equivalent for all the subordinations and qualifying phrases.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> What is being threatened is not the total destruction of a remnant of Judah. Jeremiah recognizes those who have been carried off to Babylon as well as other places as seeds for a new beginning (e.g., 24:5-6; 29:14; 30:3). But he denies here that any of those who have gone to Egypt and are continuing to practice idolatry will be among them. All of them will be cut off (i.e., destroyed) from the midst of Judah so that not a remnant of them will be left.</p>
<A NAME="4419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2402><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his.&#8221; This should not be viewed as a textual error but as a distributive singular use of the suffix, i.e., the wives of each of the kings of Judah (cf. GKC 464 §145.<i>l</i> and compare the usage in Isa 2:8; Hos 4:8).</p>
<A NAME="4420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2403><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they&#8221; but as H. Freedman (<i>Jeremiah </i>[SoBB], 284) notes the third person is used here to include the people just referred to as well as the current addressees. Hence &#8220;your people&#8221; or &#8220;the people of Judah.&#8221; It is possible that the third person again reflects the rhetorical distancing that was referred to earlier in 35:16 (see the translator&#8217;s note there for explanation) in which case one might translate &#8220;you have shown,&#8221; and &#8220;you have not revered.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2404><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to set before.&#8221; According to BDB 817 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1462;&#1492;</font> II.4.b(g) this refers to &#8220;propounding to someone for acceptance or choice.&#8221; This is clearly the usage in Deut 30:15, 19; Jer 21:8 and is likely the case here. However, to translate literally would not be good English idiom and &#8220;proposed to&#8221; might not be correctly understood, so the basic translation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">natan</font>) has been used here.</p>
<A NAME="4422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2405><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Behold I am setting my face against you for evil/disaster.&#8221; For the meaning of the idiom &#8220;to set the face to/against&#8221; see the translator&#8217;s note on 42:15 and compare the references listed there.</p>
<A NAME="4423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2406><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and to destroy all Judah.&#8221; However, this statement must be understood within the rhetoric of the passage (see vv. 7-8 and the study note on v. 8) and within the broader context of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s promises to restore the remnant who are in Babylon and those scattered in other lands (23:3; 24:5-6; 29:14; 30:3; 32:27). In this context &#8220;all Judah&#8221; must refer to all the Judeans living in Egypt whom Jeremiah is now addressing. This involves the figure of synecdoche where all does not extend to all individuals but to all that are further specified or implied (see E. W. Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, 616-18, and the comments in H. Freedman,<i> Jeremiah</i> [SoBB], 285). The &#8220;and&#8221; in front of &#8220;to destroy&#8221; is to be understood as an example of the epexegetical use of the conjunction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vav</font>; see BDB 252 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;</font> 1.b and compare the translation of J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah </i>[AB], 260).</p>
<A NAME="4424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2407><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they set their face to go.&#8221; Compare 44:11 and 42:14 and see the translator&#8217;s note at 42:15.</p>
<A NAME="4425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2408><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fall by the sword.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4426"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2409><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;All of them without distinction,&#8221; or &#8220;All of them from the least important to the most important&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;From the least to the greatest.&#8221; See the translator&#8217;s note on 42:1 for the meaning of this idiom.</p>
<A NAME="4427"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2410><b>tn</b> See the study note on 24:9 and the usage in 29:22 for the meaning and significance of this last phrase.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> See Jer 42:18 for parallel usage.</p>
<A NAME="4428"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2411><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;There shall not be an escapee or a survivor to the remnant of Judah who came to sojourn there in the land of Egypt even to return to the land of Judah which they are lifting up their souls [= &#8220;longing/desiring&#8221; (BDB 672 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1488;</font> Piel.2)] to return to live there; for none shall return except fugitives.&#8221; The long, complex Hebrew original has been broken up and restructured to better conform with contemporary English style. Another possible structure would be &#8220;None of the Judean remnant who have come to live in the land of Egypt will escape or survive. None of them will escape or survive to return to the land of Judah where they long to return to live. Indeed (emphatic use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> [<font face="Scholar">ki</font>]; cf. BDB 472 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 1.e) none of them shall return except a few fugitives.&#8221; This verse is a good example of rhetorical hyperbole where a universal negative does not apply to absolutely all the particulars. Though the <sc>Lord denies at the outset that any will escape or survive the punishment of vv. 12-13 to return to Judah, he says at the end that a few fugitives will return (the two words for fugitive are from the same root and mean the same thing). (E. W. Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, 618-19, might classify this as a synecdoche of genus where a universal negative does not deny particularity.) That this last statement is not a gloss or an afterthought is supported by what is said later in v. 28.</p>
<A NAME="4429"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2412><b>tn</b> The translation is very interpretive at several key points: <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Then all the men who were aware that their wives were sacrificing to other gods and all their wives who were standing by, a great crowd/congregation, and all the people who were living in the land of Egypt in Pathros answered, saying.&#8221; It is proper to assume that the phrase &#8220;a great crowd&#8221; is appositional to &#8220;all the men&#8230;and their wives&#8230;.&#8221; It is also probably proper to assume that the phrase &#8220;who were standing by&#8221; is unnecessary to the English translation. What is interpretive is the assumption that the &#8220;and all the people who were living in Egypt in Pathros&#8221; is explicative of &#8220;the great crowd&#8221; and that the phrase &#8220;in Pathros&#8221; is conjunctive and not appositional. Several commentaries and English versions (e.g., J. A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah </i>[NICOT], 678-79, n. 2; NJPS) assume that the phrase is descriptive of a second group, i.e., all the Jews from Pathros in Egypt (i.e., southern Egypt [see the study note on 44:1]). Those who follow this interpretation generally see this as a gloss (see Thompson, 678, n. 2, and also W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah </i>[Hermeneia], 2:279, n. 15b). It is probably better to assume that the phrase is explicative and that &#8220;all&#8221; is used in the same rhetorical way that it has been used within the chapter, i.e., &#8220;all&#8221; = representatives of all. Likewise the phrase &#8220;in Pathros&#8221; should be assumed to be conjunctive as in the Syriac translation and as suggested by <i>BHS</i> fn c since Jeremiah&#8217;s answer in vv. 24, 26 is directed to all the Judeans living in Egypt.</p>

The disasters included the death of Josiah himself at the battle of Megiddo, the deportation of his son Jehoahaz to Egypt, the death of Jehoiakim, the deportation of Jehoiachin (Jeconiah) and many other Judeans in 597 <sc>b.c., the death by war, starvation, and disease of many Judeans during the siege of Jerusalem in 588-86 <sc>b.c., and the captivity of many of those who survived. Instead of seeing these as punishments for their disobedience to the <sc>Lord as Jeremiah had preached to them, they saw these as consequences of their failure to continue the worship of the foreign gods.</p>
<A NAME="4435"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2418><b>tc</b> The words &#8220;And the women added&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text. They are, however, implicit in what is said. They are found in the Syriac version and in one recension of the Greek version. W. L. Holladay (<i>Jeremiah </i>[Hermeneia], 2:279, n. 19a) suggests that these words are missing from the Hebrew text because of haplography, i.e., that the scribe left out <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1499;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vahannashim </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">omru khi</font>) because his eye jumped from the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> at the beginning to the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) that introduced the temporal clause and left out everything in between. It is, however, just as likely, given the fact that there are several other examples of quotes which have not been formally introduced in the book of Jeremiah, that the words were not there and are supplied by these two ancient versions as a translator&#8217;s clarification.</p>
<A NAME="4436"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2419><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;When we sacrificed and poured out drink offering to the Queen of Heaven and made cakes in her image, wasn&#8217;t it with the knowledge and approval of our husbands?&#8221; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;When we sacrificed to the Queen of Heaven and poured out drink offerings [for the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lamed</font>) + the infinitive construct to carry on the tense of the preceding verb see BDB 518 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font> 7.b(h)] to her, did we make cakes to make an image of her and pour out drink offerings apart from [i.e., &#8220;without the knowledge and consent of,&#8221; so BDB 116 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1506;&#1458;&#1491;&#1461;&#1497;</font> b(a)] our husbands?&#8221; The question expects a positive answer and has been rendered as an affirmation in the translation. The long, complex Hebrew sentence has again been broken in two and restructured to better conform with contemporary English style.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> According to Jer 7:18-19 it was not only with the full knowledge and approval of their husbands but also with their active participation. Most of the commentaries call attention to the fact that what is being alluded to here is that a woman&#8217;s vow had to have her husband&#8217;s conscious approval to have any validity (cf. Num 30:7-16 and see the reference to the vow in v. 17).</p>

<A NAME="4443"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2426><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;You and your wives.&#8221; The text and referent here is uncertain because of the confusing picture that the alternation of pronouns presents in this verse. Three of the main verbs are second feminine plurals and one of them is second masculine plural. All the pronominal suffixes on the nouns are second masculine plurals. The Hebrew text reads: &#8220;You [masc. pl.] and your [masc. pl.] wives have spoken [2nd fem. pl.; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tÿdabberÿnah</font>] with your [masc. pl.] mouth and you have fulfilled [masc. pl.; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;&#1514;&#1462;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mille</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">tem</font>] with your [masc. pl.] hands, saying, &#8216;We [common gender] will certainly carry out&#8230;.&#8217; Indeed fulfill [2nd fem. pl.; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1502;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">taqimnah</font>] your [masc. pl.] vows and indeed carry out [2nd fem. pl.; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1497;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ta</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asenah</font>] your [masc. pl.] vows.&#8221; Older commentaries, such as K&amp;D 22:165, explain the feminine verbs as a matter of the women being the principle subject. Most all modern commentaries (e.g., J. A. Thompson, J. Bright, W. L. Holladay, and G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, T. G. Smothers) follow the reading of the Greek version which reads &#8220;you women&#8221; (=<i> </i><i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492; &#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font></i>, [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">attenah hannashim</font>]) in place of &#8220;you and your wives&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1501; &#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1497;&#1499;&#1462;&#1501;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">attem unÿshekhem</font>) in the Hebrew. None of them, however, explain the use of the 2nd masc. plurals here. This is possibly a case where the masculine forms are used in the place of the feminine due to the dislike of Hebrew to use the feminine plural forms (cf. GKC 459 §144.<i>a</i> and 466 §145.<i>t</i>). This seems all the more probable when 2nd fem. pl. verbs are qualified by nouns with 2nd masc. pl. suffixes. The translation here follows this interpretation of the masc. pl. forms and reads &#8220;you women&#8221; with the Greek version in place of &#8220;you and your wives&#8221; and sees the referents throughout as the women.</p>

<A NAME="4445"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=2428><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Therefore.&#8221; This particle quite often introduces the announcement of judgment after an indictment or accusation of a crime. That is its function here after the statement of cause in vv. 24-25. However, it would not sound right after the immediately preceding ironical or sarcastic commands to go ahead and fulfill their vows. &#8220;But&#8221; is a better transition unless one wants to paraphrase &#8220;Therefore, since you are so determined to do that&#8230;.&#8221;</p>

Not all but almost all; very few would survive. The following statement implies that the reason that they are left alive is to bear witness to the fact that the <sc>Lord&#8217;s threats were indeed carried out. See vv. 11-14 for a parallel use of &#8220;all&#8221; and &#8220;none&#8221; qualified by a &#8220;few.&#8221;</p>

The best way to carry that idea across in this context seems to be &#8220;I will make something happen to prove [or portend].&#8221; Another possibility would be &#8220;I will give you a pre-omen that,&#8221; but many readers would probably not be familiar with &#8220;omen/pre-omen.&#8221; Again the sentence has been broken in two and restructured to better conform with English style.</p>
