<A NAME="351"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2039><b>sn</b> The introductory statement here shows that this incident is earlier than those in Jer 32&#8211;34 which all take place in the reign of Zedekiah. Jehoiakim ruled from 609/8 <sc>b.c. until 598/97 <sc>b.c. and his brother Zedekiah followed him after a brief reign of three months by Jehoiakim&#8217;s son who was captured by Nebuchadnezzar and taken to Babylon. Zedekiah ruled from 598/7 <sc>b.c. until the kingdom fell in 587/86. The position of this chapter is out of chronological order emphasizing the theme of covenant infidelity (Jer 34; 35:12-17) versus the faithfulness to his commands that God expected from Israel as illustrated by the Rechabites&#8217; faithfulness to the commands of their progenitor. This is thus another one of those symbolic acts in Jeremiah which have significance to the message of the book (compare Jer 13, 19). This incident likely took place during the time that people living in the countryside like the Rechabites were forced to take shelter in the fortified cities because of the raiding parties that Nebuchadnezzar had sent against Jehoiakim after he had rebelled against him in 603 <sc>b.c. (compare v. 11 and Jer 4:5 with 2 Kgs 24:1-2).</p>
<A NAME="352"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2040><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The word which came to Jeremiah from the <sc>Lord in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, saying.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="353"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2041><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the house of the Rechabites.&#8221; &#8220;House&#8221; is used here in terms of &#8220;household&#8221; or &#8220;family&#8221; (cf. BDB 109 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;</font> 5.a, b).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Nothing is known about the <i>Rechabite community</i> other than what is said about them in this chapter. From vv. 7-8 it appears that they were a nomadic tribe that had resisted settling down and taking up farming. They had also agreed to abstain from drinking wine. Most scholars agree in equating the Jonadab son of Rechab mentioned as the leader who had instituted these strictures as the same Jonadab who assisted Jehu in his religious purge of Baalism following the reign of Ahab (2 Kgs 10:15, 23-24). If this is the case, the Rechabites followed these same rules for almost 250 years because Jehu&#8217;s purge of Baalism and the beginning of his reign was in 841 <sc>b.c. and the incident here took place some time after Jehoiakim&#8217;s rebellion in 603 <sc>b.c. (see the study note on v. 1).</p>
<A NAME="354"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2042><b>sn</b> This refers to one of the rooms built on the outside of the temple that were used as living quarters for the priests and for storage rooms (cf. Neh 13:4-5; 1 Kgs 6:5; 1 Chr 28:12; 2 Chr 31:11 and compare Ezek 41:1-14).</p>
<A NAME="355"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2043><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah, the man of God.&#8221; The reference to &#8220;sons&#8221; and to &#8220;man of God&#8221; fits the usage of these terms elsewhere to refer to prophets and their disciples (see BDB 43-44 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> 3(b) and compare usage in 2 Kgs 4:40 for the former and BDB 121 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503;</font> 7.a and compare the usage in 2 Kgs 4:38 for the latter).</p>
<A NAME="356"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2044><b>sn</b> According to Jer 52:24; 2 Kgs 25:18 there were three officers who carried out this duty. It was their duty to guard the entrance of the temple to keep people out that did not belong there, such as those who were foreigners or ritually unclean (see 2 Kgs 12:9 and compare Ps 118:19-20).</p>
<A NAME="357"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2045><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Drink wine.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="358"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2046><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Don&#8217;t plant a vineyard and it shall not be to you [= and you shall/must not have one].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="359"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2047><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Don&#8217;t&#8230;and don&#8217;t&#8230;but live&#8230;in order that you might&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2048><b>sn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;where you are sojourning.&#8221; The terms &#8220;sojourn&#8221; and &#8220;sojourner&#8221; referred to a person who resided in a country not his own, without the rights and privileges of citizenship as a member of a nation, state, or principality. In the ancient Near East such people were dependent on the laws of hospitality rather than the laws of state for protection and provision of legal rights. Perhaps the best illustration of this is Abraham who &#8220;sojourned&#8221; among the Philistines and the Hittites in Canaan and was dependent upon them for grazing and water rights and for a place to bury his wife (cf. Gen 20-24). What is described here is the typical lifestyle of a nomadic tribe.</p>
<A NAME="3511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2049><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;We have not drunk wine all our days.&#8221; Actually vv. 8b-9a are a series of infinitive constructs plus the negative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿvilti</font>) explaining the particulars of how they have obeyed, i.e., by not drinking wine&#8230;and by not building&#8230;.&#8221; The more direct declarative statement is used here to shorten the sentence and is more in keeping with contemporary style.</p>
<A NAME="3512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2050><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;We have obeyed and done according to all which our ancestor Jonadab commanded us.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2051><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="3514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2052><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Chaldean.&#8221; For explanation see the study note on 21:4.</p>
<A NAME="3515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2053><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Yahweh of armies, the God of Israel.&#8221; For this title see 7:3 and the study note on 2:19.</p>
<A NAME="3516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2054><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;<b>35:12</b> And the word of the <sc>Lord came to Jeremiah, saying, &#8216;Thus says Yahweh of armies the God of Israel, &#8220;Go and say&#8230;&#8216;Will you not learn&#8230;&#8217;&#8221;&#8217;&#8221; The use of the indirect introduction has been chosen here as in 34:1-2 to try to cut down on the confusion created by embedding quotations within quotations.</p>
<A NAME="3517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2055><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Oracle of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2056><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;from this&#8221; are not in the text but are implicit from the context. They have been supplied in the translation for the sake of clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2057><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Will you not learn a lesson&#8230;?&#8221; The rhetorical question here has the force of an imperative, made explicit in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="3520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2058><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The words of Jonadab son of Rechab which he commanded his descendants not to drink wine have been carried out.&#8221; (For the construction of the accusative of subject after a passive verb illustrated here see GKC 388 §121.<i>b</i>.) The sentence has been broken down and made more direct to better conform to contemporary English style.</p>
<A NAME="3521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2059><b>tn</b> The <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) plus the independent pronoun before the verb is intended to mark a sharp contrast. It is difficult, if not impossible to mark this in English other than &#8220;But I.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3522"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2060><b>tn</b> On this idiom (which occurs again in the following verse) see the translator&#8217;s note on 7:13 for this idiom and compare its use in 7:13, 25; 11:7; 25:3, 4; 26:5; 29:19; 32:33; 35:14, 15; 44:9.</p>
<A NAME="3523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2061><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Turn, each of you, from his [= your] wicked way and make good your deeds.&#8221; Compare 18:11 where the same idiom occurs with the added term of &#8220;make good your ways.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2062><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Don&#8217;t go after/follow other gods.&#8221; See the translator&#8217;s note on 2:5 for an explanation of the idiom and see 11:10; 13:10; 25:6 for the same idiom.</p>
<A NAME="3525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2063><b>tn</b> This is an attempt to represent the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) which is probably not really intensive here (cf. BDB 472 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 1.e) but is one of those causal uses of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> that BDB discusses on 473-74 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 3.c where the cause is really the failure of the people of Judah and Jerusalem to listen/obey. I.e., the causal particle is at the beginning of the sentence so as not to interrupt the contrast drawn.</p>
<A NAME="3526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2064><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;this people.&#8221; However, the speech is addressed to the people of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem, so the second person is retained in English. In addition to the stylistic difference that Hebrew exhibits in the rapid shift between persons (second to third and third to second, which have repeatedly been noted and documented from GKC 462 §144.<i>p</i>) there may be a subtle rhetorical reason for the shift here. The shift from direct address to indirect address which characterizes this verse and the next may reflect the <sc>Lord&#8217;s rejection of the people he is addressing. A similar shift takes place in Wisdom&#8217;s address to the simple minded, fools, and mockers in Prov 1:28-32 after the direct address of 1:22-27.</p>
<A NAME="3527"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2065><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Therefore, thus says the <sc>Lord, the God of armies, the God of Israel.&#8221; For the title see 7:13 and the study note on 2:19. The first person address is again used in the translation because this whole section is a speech from the <sc>Lord (see vv. 12-13).</p>
<A NAME="3528"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2066><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Yahweh of armies, the God of Israel.&#8221; For this title, which occurs again in the following verse, see the notes on 7:3 and the study note on 2:19.</p>
<A NAME="3529"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2067><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;There shall not be cut to Jonadab son of Rechab a man standing before me all the days.&#8221; For the first part of this idiom see 33:17-18 where it is applied to David always having a descendant to occupy the throne and the Levites will always have priests to offer up sacrifices. For the latter part of the idiom &#8220;to stand before&#8221; referring to service see BDB 764 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1491;</font> 1.e and compare the usage in 1 Kgs 1:2; 2 Kgs 3:14; Jer 15:19; Deut 10:8. As comparison with those passages will show, it refers to attending on, or serving a superior, a king, or the <sc>Lord. It is used of both prophets (e.g., 1 Kgs 17:1) and priests (e.g., Deut 10:8) serving the <sc>Lord. Its most common use is to refer to priestly service. The nature of the service is not further defined in this case, though several of the commentaries point out a Mishnaic tradition that the Rechabites later were given the function of bringing wood for the altar.</p>
