<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=52><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my inheritance.&#8221; Or &#8220;the land [i.e., inheritance] I gave you,&#8221; reading the pronoun as indicating source rather than possession. The parallelism and the common use in Jeremiah of the term to refer to the land or people as the <sc>Lord&#8217;s (e.g., 12:7, 8, 9; 16:18; 50:11) make the possessive use more likely here.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The land belonged to the <sc>Lord; it was given to the Israelites in trust (or usufruct) as their heritage. See Lev 25:23.</p>
