<A NAME="23"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=39><b><i>tn</i></b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the loyal love of your youth.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Hebrew word translated &#8220;how devoted you were&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khesed</font>) refers metaphorically to the devotion of a new bride to her husband. In typical Hebraic fashion, contemporary Israel is identified with early Israel after she first entered into covenant with (= married) the <sc>Lord. The reference to her earlier devotion is not absolute but relative. Compared to her unfaithfulness in worshiping other gods after she got into the land, the murmuring and complaining in the wilderness are ignored.</p>
