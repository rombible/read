<A NAME="24"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=40><b>sn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the first fruits of his harvest.&#8221; Many commentators see the figure here as having theological significance for the calling of the Gentiles. It is likely, however, that in this context the metaphor &#8211; here rendered as a simile &#8211; is intended to bring out the special relationship and inviolability that Israel had with God. As the first fruits were the special possession of the <sc>Lord, to be eaten only by the priests and off limits to the common people, so Israel was God&#8217;s special possession and was not to be &#8220;eaten&#8221; by the nations.</p>
