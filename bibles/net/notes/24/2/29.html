<A NAME="29"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=45><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;They went/followed after.&#8221; This idiom is found most often in Deuteronomy or covenant contexts. It refers to loyalty to God and to his covenant or his commandments (e.g., 1 Kgs 14:8; 2 Chr 34:31) with the metaphor of a path or way underlying it (e.g., Deut 11:28; 28:14). To &#8220;follow other gods&#8221; was to abandon this way and this loyalty (i.e., to &#8220;abandon&#8221; or &#8220;forget&#8221; God, Judg 2:12; Hos 2:13) and to follow the customs or religious traditions of the pagan nations (e.g., 2 Kgs 17:15). The classic text on &#8220;following&#8221; God or another god is 1 Kgs 18:18, 21 where Elijah taunts the people with &#8220;halting between two opinions&#8221; whether the <sc>Lord was the true God or Baal was. The idiom is often found followed by &#8220;to serve and to worship&#8221; or &#8220;they served and worshiped&#8221; such and such a god or entity (see, e.g., Jer 8:2; 11:10; 13:10; 16:11; 25:6; 35:15).</p>
