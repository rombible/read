<A NAME="277"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=113><b>tn</b> KJV and ASV read this line with 2:34. The ASV makes little sense and the KJV again erroneously reads the archaic second person feminine singular perfect as first person common singular. All the modern English versions and commentaries take this line with 2:35.</p>
