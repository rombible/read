<A NAME="248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=84><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the Lord Yahweh, [the God of] hosts.&#8221; For the title Lord <sc>God see the study note on 1:6. For the title &#8220;who rules over all&#8221; see the following study note. The title &#8220;the <sc>Lord who rules over all&#8221; is a way of rendering the title &#8220;Yahweh of armies.&#8221; It is an abbreviation of a longer title &#8220;Yahweh the God of armies&#8221; which occurs five times in Jeremiah (see, e.g., 44:7). The abbreviated title occurs seventy-seven times in the book of Jeremiah. On thirty-two occasions it is further qualified by the title &#8220;the God of Israel,&#8221; showing his special relation to Israel. On six occasions it is preceded by the title &#8220;Lord&#8221; (see, e.g., 46:10) and twice it is preceded by the title &#8220;the King&#8221; (see, e.g., 51:17). Both titles emphasize his sovereignty. Twice it is said that he is the maker of all things (10:16; 51:19), and once it is said that he made the earth and the people and animals on it and gives them into the control of whomever he wishes (27:4-5). On two occasions it is emphasized that he also made the heavenly elements and controls the natural elements of wind, rain, thunder, and hail (31:35; 51:14-16). All this is consistent with usage elsewhere where the &#8220;armies&#8221; over which he has charge are identified as (1) the angels which surround his throne (Isa 6:3, 5; 1 Kgs 22:19) and which he sends to protect his servants (2 Kgs 6:17), (2) the natural forces of thunder, rain, and hail (Isa 29:6; Josh 10:11; Judg 5:4, 5) through which he sends the enemy into panic and &#8220;gums&#8221; up their chariot wheels, (3) the armies of Israel (1 Sam 17:45) which he leads into battle (Num 10:34-35; Josh 5:14, 15) and for whom he fights as a mighty warrior (Exod 15:3; Isa 42:13; Ps 24:8), and even (4) the armies of the nations which he musters against his disobedient people (Isa 13:14). This title is most commonly found in the messenger formula &#8220;Thus says&#8230;&#8221; introducing both oracles of judgment (on Israel [e.g., 9:7, 15] and on the nations [e.g. 46:19; 50:18]; and see in general 25:29-32). It emphasizes his sovereignty as the king and creator, the lord of creation and of history, and the just judge who sees and knows all (11:20; 20:12) and judges each person and nation according to their actions (Jer 32:18-19). In the first instance (in the most dominant usage) this will involve the punishment of his own people through the agency of the Babylonians (cf., e.g., 25:8-9). But it will also include the punishment of all nations, including Babylon itself (cf. Jer 25:17-26, 32-38), and will ultimately result in the restoration of his people and a new relation with them (30:8; 31:35-37).</p>
