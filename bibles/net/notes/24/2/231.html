<A NAME="231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=67><b>tn</b> It is difficult to decide whether to translate &#8220;fresh, running water&#8221; which the Hebrew term for &#8220;living water&#8221; often refers to (e.g., Gen 26:19; Lev 14:5), or &#8220;life-giving water&#8221; which the idiom &#8220;fountain of life&#8221; as source of life and vitality often refers to (e.g., Ps 36:9; Prov 13:14; 14:27). The contrast with cisterns, which collected and held rain water, suggests &#8220;fresh, running water,&#8221; but the reality underlying the metaphor contrasts the <sc>Lord, the source of life, health, and vitality, with useless idols that cannot do anything.</p>
