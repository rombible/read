<A NAME="832"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=529><b>tn</b> The meaning of this line is very uncertain. A possible alternate translation is: &#8220;They have broken the laws that I gave them.&#8221; The line reads rather literally &#8220;And I gave them they passed over them.&#8221; The translation adopted treats the first expression as a noun clause (cf. GKC 488-89 §155.<i>n</i>) which is the subject of the following verb, i.e., &#8220;the things I gave them [contextually, the grapes, etc.] passed over from them.&#8221; The alternate translation treats the expression as a dangling object (a Hebrew <i>casus pendens</i>) resumed by the pronoun &#8220;them&#8221; and understands &#8220;the things that I gave them&#8221; to be the law or some related entity which is often the object of this verb (see BDB 717 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;</font> Qal.1.i). Neither of these translations is without its weakness. The weakness of the translation which has been adopted is the unusual use it assigns to the object suffix of the verb translated &#8220;pass over.&#8221; The weakness of the alternate translation is the rather abrupt and opaque introduction of a new topic of reference (i.e., the laws) into the context. On the whole the latter weakness would appear to outweigh the former. This line is missing from the Greek version and J. Bright (<i>Jeremiah </i>[AB]) and J. A. Thompson (<i>Jeremiah </i>[NICOT]) despair of giving a translation. For other possible suggestions see, W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah </i>(Hermeneia), 1:285-86.</p>
