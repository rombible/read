<A NAME="818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=515><b>tn</b> There is debate in the commentaries and lexicons about the identification of some of these birds, particularly regarding the identification of the &#8220;swallow&#8221; which is more likely the &#8220;swift&#8221; and the &#8220;crane&#8221; which some identify with the &#8220;thrush.&#8221; For a discussion see the Bible encyclopedias and the UBS handbook <i>Fauna and Flora of the Bible</i>. The identity of the individual birds makes little difference to the point being made and &#8220;swallow&#8221; is more easily identifiable to the average reader than the &#8220;swift.&#8221;</p>
