<A NAME="824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=521><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The lying pen of the scribes have made [it] into a lie.&#8221; The translation is an attempt to make the most common interpretation of this passage understandable for the average reader. This is, however, a difficult passage whose interpretation is greatly debated and whose syntax is capable of other interpretations. The interpretation of the NJPS, &#8220;Assuredly, for naught has the pen labored, for naught the scribes,&#8221; surely deserves consideration within the context; i.e. it hasn&#8217;t done any good for the scribes to produce a reliable copy of the law, which the people have refused to follow. That interpretation has the advantage of explaining the absence of an object for the verb &#8220;make&#8221; or &#8220;labored&#8221; but creates a very unbalanced poetic couplet.</p>
