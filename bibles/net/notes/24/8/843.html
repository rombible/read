<A NAME="843"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=540><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I am sending against you snakes, poisonous ones which cannot be charmed.&#8221; In the light of the context literal snakes are scarcely meant. So the metaphor is turned into a simile to prevent possible confusion. For a similar metaphorical use of animals for enemies see 5:6.</p>
