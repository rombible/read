<A NAME="852"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=549><b>sn</b> The people&#8217;s cry and the <sc>Lord&#8217;s interruption reflect the same argument that was set forth in the preceding chapter. They have misguided confidence that the <sc>Lord is with them regardless of their actions and he responds that their actions have provoked him to the point of judging them. See especially 7:4 and 7:30.</p>
