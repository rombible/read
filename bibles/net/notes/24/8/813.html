<A NAME="813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=510><b>sn</b> There is a continuing play on the same root word used in the preceding verse. Here the words &#8220;turn away from me,&#8221; &#8220;apostasy,&#8221; and &#8220;turn back to me&#8221; are all forms from the root that was translated &#8220;go the wrong way&#8221; and &#8220;turn around&#8221; in v. 4. The intended effect is to contrast Judah&#8217;s recalcitrant apostasy with the usual tendency to try and correct one&#8217;s mistakes.</p>
