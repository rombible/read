<A NAME="87"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=504><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Death will be chosen rather than life by the remnant who are left from this wicked family in all the places where I have banished them.&#8221; The sentence is broken up and restructured to avoid possible confusion because of the complexity of the English to some modern readers. There appears to be an extra &#8220;those who are left&#8221; that was inadvertently copied from the preceding line. It is missing from one Hebrew <sc>ms and from the Greek and Syriac versions and is probably not a part of the original text.</p>
