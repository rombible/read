<A NAME="51"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=260><b>tn</b> These words are not in the text, but since the words at the end are obviously those of the <sc>Lord, they are supplied in the translation here to mark the shift in speaker from 4:29-31 where Jeremiah is the obvious speaker.</p>
<A NAME="52"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=261><b>tn</b> It is not clear who is being addressed here. The verbs are plural so they are not addressed to Jeremiah per se. Since the passage is talking about the people of Jerusalem, it is unlikely they are addressed here except perhaps rhetorically. Some have suggested that the heavenly court is being addressed here as in Job 1:6-8; 2:1-3. It is clear from Jer 23:18, 22; Amos 3:7 that the prophets had access to this heavenly counsel through visions (cf. 1 Kgs 22:19-23), so Jeremiah could have been privy to this speech through that means. Though these are the most likely addressee, it is too presumptuous to supply such an explicit addressee without clearer indication in the text. The translation will just have to run the risk of the probable erroneous assumption by most English readers that the addressee is Jeremiah. </p>

A leopard will watch outside their cities. Anyone who goes out from them will be torn in pieces.&#8221; However, it is unlikely that, in the context of judgment that Jeremiah has previously been describing, literal lions are meant. The animals are metaphorical for their enemies. Compare Jer 4:7.</p>

<A NAME="523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=282><b>tn</b> These words are not in the text, but are supplied in the translation to make clear who is speaking.</p>
<A NAME="524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=283><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;How can I forgive [or pardon] you.&#8221; The pronoun &#8220;you&#8221; is second feminine singular, referring to the city. See v. 1.</p>

<A NAME="527"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=286><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I satisfied them to the full.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="528"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=287><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they committed adultery.&#8221; It is difficult to decide whether literal adultery with other women or spiritual adultery with other gods is meant. The word for adultery is used for both in the book of Jeremiah. For examples of its use for spiritual adultery see 3:8, 9; 9:2. For examples of its use for literal adultery see 7:9; 23:14. The context here could argue for either. The swearing by other gods and the implicit contradiction in their actions in contrast to the expected gratitude for supplying their needs argues for spiritual adultery. However, the reference to prostitution in the next line and the reference to chasing after their neighbor&#8217;s wives argues for literal adultery. The translation opts for spiritual adultery because of the contrast implicit in the concessive clause.</p>
<A NAME="529"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=288><b>tn</b> There is a great deal of debate about the meaning of this word. Most of the modern English versions follow the lead of lexicographers who relate this word to a noun meaning &#8220;troop&#8221; and understand it to mean &#8220;they trooped together&#8221; (cf. BDB 151 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1491;</font> Hithpo.2 and compare the usage in Mic 5:1 [4:14 HT]). A few of the modern English versions and commentaries follow the reading of the Greek and read a word meaning &#8220;they lodged&#8221; (reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1456;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;</font> [<font face="Scholar">yitggorÿru</font>] from I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> [<font face="Scholar">gur</font>; cf. <i>HALOT</i> 177 s.v. Hithpo. and compare the usage in 1 Kgs 17:20] instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1490;&#1468;&#1465;&#1491;&#1464;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;</font> [<font face="Scholar">yitggodadu</font>]). W. L. Holladay (<i>Jeremiah </i>[Hermeneia], 1:180) sees a reference here to the cultic practice of cutting oneself in supplication to pagan gods (cf. BDB 151 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1491;</font> Hithpo.1 and compare the usage in 1 Kgs 18:28). The houses of prostitutes would then be a reference to ritual prostitutes at the pagan shrines. The translation follows BDB and the majority of modern English versions.</p>
<A NAME="530"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=289><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to a house of a prostitute.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This could be a reference to cultic temple prostitution connected with the pagan shrines. For allusion to this in the OT, see, e.g., Deut 23:17 and 2 Kgs 23:7.</p>
<A NAME="531"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=290><b>tn</b> The meanings of these two adjectives are uncertain. The translation of the first adjective is based on assuming that the word is a defectively written participle related to the noun &#8220;testicle&#8221; (a Hiphil participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1499;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> [<font face="Scholar">ma</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ashikhim</font>] from a verb related to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eshekh</font>, &#8220;testicle&#8221;]; cf. Lev 21:20) and hence &#8220;having testicles&#8221; (cf. <i>HALOT</i> 1379 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;</font>) instead of the Masoretic form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mashkim</font>) from a root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shakhah</font>), which is otherwise unattested in either verbal or nominal forms. The second adjective is best derived from a verb root meaning &#8220;to feed&#8221; (a Hophal participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> [<font face="Scholar">muzanim</font>, the <i>Kethib</i>] from a root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font> [<font face="Scholar">zun</font>; cf.

The word for &#8220;vineyards&#8221; (or &#8220;vine rows&#8221;) is a <i>hapax legomenon</i> and its derivation is debated. BDB 1004 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> repoints <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1462;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sharoteha</font>) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1462;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shuroteha</font>) and relates it to a Mishnaic Hebrew and Palestinian Aramaic word meaning &#8220;row.&#8221; <i>HALOT</i> 1348 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> also repoints to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1462;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;</font> and relates it to a noun meaning &#8220;wall,&#8221; preferring to see the reference here to the walled terraces on which the vineyards were planted. The difference in meaning is minimal.</p>
<A NAME="536"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=295><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;for they do not belong to the <sc>Lord.&#8221; In the light of the context and Jeremiah&#8217;s identification of Israel as a vine (cf., e.g., 2:21) and a vineyard (cf., e.g., 12:10), it is likely that this verse has a totally metaphorical significance. The enemy is to go through the vineyard that is Israel and Judah and destroy all those who have been unfaithful to the <sc>Lord. It is not impossible, however, that the verse has a double meaning, a literal one and a figurative one: the enemy is not only to destroy Israel and Judah&#8217;s vines but to destroy Israel and Judah, lopping off the wicked Israelites who, because of their covenant unfaithfulness, the <sc>Lord has disowned. If the verse is totally metaphorical one might translate: &#8220;Pass through my vineyard, Israel and Judah, wreaking destruction. But do not destroy all of the people. Cut down like branches those unfaithful people because they no longer belong to the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>

E.g., &#8220;When you [people] say, &#8220;Why&#8230;?&#8221; then you, Jeremiah, tell them&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="560"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=319><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;As you left me and&#8230;, so you will&#8230;.&#8221; The translation was chosen so as to break up a rather long and complex sentence.</p>
<A NAME="561"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=320><b>sn</b> This is probably a case of deliberate ambiguity (double entendre). The adjective &#8220;foreigners&#8221; is used for both foreign people (so Jer 30:8; 51:51) and foreign gods (so Jer 2:25; 3:13). See also Jer 16:13 for the idea of having to serve other gods in the lands of exile.</p>

<A NAME="572"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=331><b>tn</b> The meaning of the last three words is uncertain. The pointing and meaning of the Hebrew word rendered &#8220;hiding in ambush&#8221; is debated. BDB relates the form (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kÿshakh</font>) to a root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shakhakh</font>), which elsewhere means &#8220;decrease, abate&#8221; (cf. BDB 1013 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font>), and notes that this is usually understood as &#8220;like the crouching of fowlers,&#8221; but they say this meaning is dubious. <i>HALOT</i> 1345 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font> questions the validity of the text and offers three proposals; the second appears to create the least textual modification, i.e., reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kesakh</font>, &#8220;as in the hiding place of (bird catchers)&#8221;; for the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sakh</font>) see <i>HALOT</i> 1236 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1498;&#1456;</font> 4 and compare Lam 2:6 for usage. The versions do not help. The Greek does not translate the first two words of the line. The proposal given in <i>HALOT</i> is accepted with some hesitancy.</p>
<A NAME="573"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=332><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a destroying thing.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="574"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=333><b>tn</b> The words, &#8220;that have been caught&#8221; are not in the text but are implicit in the comparison.</p>
<A NAME="575"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">75</span><note=334><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;are filled with deceit.&#8221; The translation assumes a figure of speech of cause for effect (metonymy). Compare the same word in the same figure in Zeph 1:9.</p>
<A NAME="576"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">76</span><note=335><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;therefore they have gotten great and rich.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="578"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=337><b>tn</b> The meaning of this word is uncertain. This verb occurs only here. The lexicons generally relate it to the word translated &#8220;plate&#8221; in Song 5:14 and understand it to mean &#8220;smooth, shiny&#8221; (so BDB 799 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1514;</font>) or &#8220;fat&#8221; (so <i>HALOT</i> 850 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1514;</font>). The word in Song 5:14 more likely means &#8220;smooth&#8221; than &#8220;plate&#8221; (so TEV). So &#8220;sleek&#8221; is most likely here.</p>
<A NAME="579"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">79</span><note=338><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they cross over/transgress with respect to matters of evil.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> There is a wordplay in the use of this word which has twice been applied in v. 22 to the sea not crossing the boundary set for it by God.</p>

Should I not bring retribution&#8230;?&#8221; The rhetorical questions function as emphatic declarations.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> These words are repeated from 5:9 to give a kind of refrain justifying again the necessity of punishment in the light of such sins.</p>
<A NAME="581"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">81</span><note=340><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;they shall rule at their hands.&#8221; Since the word &#8220;hand&#8221; can be used figuratively for authority or mean &#8220;side&#8221; and the pronoun &#8220;them&#8221; can refer to the priests themselves or the prophets, the following translations have also been suggested: &#8220;the priests rule under their [the prophets&#8217;] directions,&#8221; or &#8220;the priests rule in league with them [the prophets].&#8221; From the rest of the book it would appear that the prophets did not exercise authority over the priests nor did they exercise the same authority over the people that the priests did. Hence it probably mean &#8220;by their own hand/power/authority.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="582"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">82</span><note=341><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;But what will you do at its end?&#8221; The rhetorical question implies a negative answer: &#8220;Nothing!&#8221;</p>
