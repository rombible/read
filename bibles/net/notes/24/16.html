<A NAME="162"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=991><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Thus says the <sc>Lord concerning the sons and daughters who are born in the place and concerning their mothers who give them birth and their fathers who fathered them in this land.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="163"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=992><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;For thus says the <sc>Lord&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="164"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=993><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;my peace.&#8221; The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿlomi</font>) can be translated &#8220;peace, prosperity&#8221; or &#8220;well-being&#8221; (referring to wholeness or health of body and soul).</p>
<A NAME="165"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=994><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Oracle of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="166"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=995><b>sn</b> These were apparently pagan customs associated with mourning (Isa 15:2; Jer 47:5) which were forbidden in Israel (Lev 19:8; 21:5) but apparently practiced anyway (Jer 41:5).</p>
<A NAME="167"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=996><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;For thus says Yahweh of armies the God of Israel.&#8221; The introductory formula which appears three times in vv. 1-9 (vv. 1, 3, 5) has been recast for smoother English style.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> For the title &#8220;the <sc>Lord God of Israel who rules over all&#8221; see 7:3 and the study note on 2:19.</p>
<A NAME="168"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=997><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;before your eyes and in your days.&#8221; The pronouns are plural including others than Jeremiah.</p>
<A NAME="169"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=998><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all these words/things.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The actions of the prophet would undoubtedly elicit questions about his behavior and he would have occasion to explain the reason.</p>
<A NAME="1610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=999><b>tn</b> These two sentences have been recast in English to break up a long Hebrew sentence and incorporate the oracular formula &#8220;says the <sc>Lord (<i>Heb</i> &#8216;oracle of the <sc>Lord&#8217;)&#8221; which occurs after &#8220;Your fathers abandoned me.&#8221; In Hebrew the two sentences read: &#8220;When you tell them these things and they say, &#8216;&#8230;&#8217;, then tell them, &#8216;Because your ancestors abandoned me,&#8217; oracle of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1000><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fathers&#8221; (also in vv. 12, 13, 15, 19).</p>
<A NAME="1612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1001><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;followed after.&#8221; See the translator&#8217;s note at 2:5 for the explanation of the idiom.</p>
<A NAME="1613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1002><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;But me they have abandoned and my law they have not kept.&#8221; The objects are thrown forward to bring out the contrast which has rhetorical force. However, such a sentence in English would be highly unnatural.</p>
<A NAME="1614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1003><b>sn</b> For the argumentation here compare Jer 7:23-26.</p>
<A NAME="1615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1004><b>tn</b> The particle translated here &#8220;Yet&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1461;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">lakhen</font>) is regularly translated &#8220;So&#8221; or &#8220;Therefore&#8221; and introduces a consequence. However, in a few cases it introduces a contrasting set of conditions. Compare its use in Judg 11:8; Jer 48:12; 49:2; 51:52; and Hos 2:14 (2:16 HT).</p>
<A NAME="1616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1005><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Oracle of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The <sc>Lord has been speaking; the first person has been utilized in translation to avoid a shift which might create confusion.</p>
<A NAME="1617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1006><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Behold the days are coming.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1007><b>tn</b> These two verses which constitute one long sentence with compound, complex subordinations has been broken up for sake of English style. It reads, &#8220;Therefore, behold the days are coming, says the <sc>Lord [<i>Heb</i> &#8216;oracle of the <sc>Lord&#8217;] and it will not be said any longer, &#8216;By the life of the <sc>Lord who&#8230;Egypt&#8217; but &#8216;by the life of the <sc>Lord who&#8230;&#8217; and I will bring them back&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1008><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Oracle of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The <sc>Lord has been speaking; the first person has been utilized in translation to avoid a shift which might create confusion.</p>
<A NAME="1620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1009><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Behold I am about to send for many fishermen and they will catch them. And after that I will send for many hunters and they will hunt them from every mountain and from every hill and from the cracks in the rocks.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The picture of rounding up the population for destruction and exile is also seen in Amos 4:2 and Hab 1:14-17.</p>
<A NAME="1621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1010><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;For my eyes are upon all their ways. They are not hidden from before me. And their sin is not hidden away from before my eyes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1011><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;First.&#8221; Many English versions and commentaries delete this word because it is missing from the Greek version and is considered a gloss added by a postexilic editor who is said to be responsible also for vv. 14-16. This is not the place to resolve issues of authorship and date. It is the task of the translator to translate the &#8220;original&#8221; which in this case is the MT supported by the other versions. The word here refers to order in rank or order of events. Compare Gen 38:28; 1 Kgs 18:25. Here allusion is made to the restoration previously mentioned. First in order of events is the punishment of destruction and exile, then restoration.</p>
<A NAME="1623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1012><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;double.&#8221; However, usage in Deut 15:18 and probably Isa 40:2 argues for &#8220;full compensation.&#8221; This is supported also by usage in a tablet from Alalakh in Syria. See P. C. Craigie, P. H. Kelley, J. F. Drinkard, <i>Jeremiah 1-25 </i>(WBC),<i> </i>218, for bibliography.</p>
<A NAME="1624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1013><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my inheritance.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> For earlier references to the term used here see Jer 2:7 where it applies as here to the land, Jer 10:16; 12:8-9 where it applies to the people, and Jer 12:7 where it applies to the temple.</p>
<A NAME="1625"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1014><b>tn</b> Many of the English versions take &#8220;lifeless statues of their detestable idols&#8221; with &#8220;filled&#8221; as a compound object. This follows the Masoretic punctuation but violates usage. The verb &#8220;fill&#8221; never takes an object preceded by the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet</font>).</p>
<A NAME="1626"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1015><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;Then I said&#8221; are not in the text. They are supplied in the translation to show the shift from God, who has been speaking to Jeremiah, to Jeremiah, who here addresses God.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The shift here is consistent with the interruptions that have taken place in chapters 14 and 15 and in Jeremiah&#8217;s response to God&#8217;s condemnation of the people of Judah&#8217;s idolatry in chapter 10 (note especially vv. 6-16).</p>
<A NAME="1627"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1016><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;O <sc>Lord, my strength and my fortress, my refuge in the day of trouble. The literal which piles up attributes is of course more forceful than the predications. However, piling up poetic metaphors like this adds to the length of the English sentence and risks lack of understanding on the part of some readers. Some rhetorical force has been sacrificed for the sake of clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1628"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1017><b>tn</b> Once again the translation has sacrificed some of the rhetorical force for the sake of clarity and English style: <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Only falsehood did our ancestors possess, vanity and [things in which?] there was no one profiting in them.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This passage offers some rather forceful contrasts. The <sc>Lord is Jeremiah&#8217;s source of strength, security, and protection. The idols are false gods, worthless idols, that can offer no help at all.</p>
<A NAME="1629"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1018><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they are &#8216;no gods.&#8217;&#8221; For the construction here compare 2:11 and a similar construction in 2 Kgs 19:18 and see BDB 519 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;</font> 1.b(b).</p>
<A NAME="1630"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1019><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;The <sc>Lord said&#8221; are not in the text. However, it is obvious that he is the speaker. These words are supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1631"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1020><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;So I will make known to those nations, I will make known to them at this time my power and my might. Then they will know that my name is the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> There is a decided ambiguity in this text about the identity of the pronoun &#8220;them.&#8221; Is it his wicked people he has been predicting judgment upon or the nations that have come to recognize the folly of idolatry? The nearer antecedent would argue for that. However, usage of &#8220;hand&#8221; (translated here &#8220;power&#8221;) in 6:12; 15:6 and later 21:5 and especially the threatening motif of &#8220;at this time&#8221; (or &#8220;now&#8221;) in 10:18 suggest that the &#8220;So&#8221; goes back logically to vv. 16-18, following a grounds of judgment with the threatened consequence as it has in at least 16 out of 18 occurrences thus far. Moreover it makes decidedly more sense that the Jews will know that his name is the <sc>Lord as the result of the present (&#8220;at this time&#8221;) display of his power in judgment than that the idolaters will at some later (cf. Isa 2:2-4 for possible parallel) time. There has been a decided emphasis that the people of Israel do not &#8220;know&#8221; him (cf. 2:8; 4:22; 9:3, 6). Now they will, but in a way they did not wish to. There is probably an allusion (and an ironic reversal) here to Exod 3:13-15; 34:5-7. They have presumed upon his graciousness and forgotten that his name not only involves being with them to help but being against them to punish sin. Even if the alternate translation is followed the reference is still to God&#8217;s mighty power made known in judging the wicked Judeans. The words &#8220;power&#8221; and &#8220;might&#8221; are an example of hendiadys in which two nouns joined by &#8220;and&#8221; in which one modifies the other.</p>
