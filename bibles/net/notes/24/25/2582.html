<A NAME="2582"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">82</span><note=1482><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;like a lion about to attack&#8221; are not in the text but are implicit in the metaphor. The explicit comparison of the <sc>Lord to a lion is made at the end of the passage in v. 38. The words are supplied in the translation here for clarity.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> For the metaphor of the <sc>Lord going forth against his enemies like an attacking lion see Jer 49:19; 50:44; Isa 31:4 in all of which the <sc>Lord comes against the nations in defense of his people. In Hos 5:14 the metaphor is turned against his own people. The figure of a lion ravaging people has already been used in Jer 4:7 of the enemy from the north (Babylon).</p>
