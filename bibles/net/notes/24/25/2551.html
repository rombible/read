<A NAME="2551"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1451><b>sn</b> The <i>land of Uz</i> was Job&#8217;s homeland (Job 1:1). The exact location is unknown but its position here between Egypt and the Philistine cities suggests it is south of Judah, probably in the Arabian peninsula. Lam 4:21 suggests that it was near Edom.</p>
