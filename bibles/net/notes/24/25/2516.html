<A NAME="2516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1416><b>tn</b> This is a rather clear case where the Hebrew particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿma</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">an</font>) introduces a consequence and not a purpose, contrary to the dictum of BDB 775 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</font> note 1. They have not listened to him <i>in order to</i> make him angry but <i>with the result that</i> they have made him angry by going their own way. Jeremiah appears to use this particle for result rather than purpose on several other occasions (see, e.g., 7:18, 19; 27:10, 15; 32:29).</p>
