<A NAME="2591"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">91</span><note=1491><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;of military destruction&#8221; have been supplied in the translation to make the metaphor clear. The metaphor has shifted from that of God as a lion, to God as a warrior, to God as a judge, to God as the author of the storm winds of destruction. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> For the use of this word in a literal sense see Jonah 1:4. For its use to refer to the wrath of the <sc>Lord which will rage over the wicked see Jer 23:19; 30:23. Here it refers to the mighty Babylonian army which will come bringing destruction over all the known world. The same prophecy has just been given under the figure of the nations drinking the wine of God&#8217;s wrath (vv. 15-29).</p>
