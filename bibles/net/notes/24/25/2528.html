<A NAME="2528"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1428><b>sn</b> The <i>sound of people grinding meal</i> and the presence of <i>lamps shining in their houses</i> were signs of everyday life. The <sc>Lord is going to make these lands desolate (v. 11) destroying all signs of life. (The statement is, of course, hyperbolic or poetic exaggeration; even after the destruction of Jerusalem many people were left in the land.) For these same descriptions of everyday life applying to the end of life see the allegory in Eccl 12:3-6.</p>
