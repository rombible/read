<A NAME="2539"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1439><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Thus said the <sc>Lord, the God of Israel, to me.&#8221; It is generally understood that the communication is visionary. God does not have a &#8220;hand&#8221; and the action of going to the nations and making them drink of the cup are scarcely literal. The words are supplied in the translation to show the figurative nature of this passage.</p>
