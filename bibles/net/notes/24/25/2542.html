<A NAME="2542"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1442><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;because of the sword that I will send among them.&#8221; Here, as often elsewhere in Jeremiah, the sword is figurative for warfare which brings death. See, e.g., 15:2. The causal particle here is found in verbal locutions where it is the cause of emotional states or action. Hence there are really two &#8220;agents&#8221; which produce the effects of &#8220;staggering&#8221; and &#8220;acting insane,&#8221; the cup filled with God&#8217;s wrath and the sword. The sword is the &#8220;more literal&#8221; and the actual agent by which the first agent&#8217;s action is carried out.</p>
