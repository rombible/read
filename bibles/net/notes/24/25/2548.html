<A NAME="2548"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1448><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;as it is today.&#8221; This phrase would obviously be more appropriate after all these things had happened as is the case in 44:6, 23 where the verbs referring to these conditions are past. Some see this phrase as a marginal gloss added after the tragedies of 597 <sc>b.c. or 586 <sc>b.c. However, it may refer here to the beginning stages where Judah has already suffered the loss of Josiah, of its freedom, of some of its temple treasures, and of some of its leaders (Dan 1:1-3. The different date for Jehoiakim there is due to the different method of counting the king&#8217;s first year; the third year there is the same as the fourth year in 25:1).</p>
