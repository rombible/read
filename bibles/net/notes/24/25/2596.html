The participle in this verse is followed by a <i>vav</i> consecutive perfect like the imperatives in v. 34. The verbs in v. 38 are perfects but they can be and probably should be understood as prophetic like the perfect in v. 31 (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nÿtanam</font>) which is surrounded by imperfects, participles, and <i>vav</i> consecutive perfects.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Jer 25:36-38 shifts to the future as though the action were already accomplished or going on. It is the sound that Jeremiah hears in his &#8220;prophetic ears&#8221; of something that has begun (v. 29) but will find its culmination in the future (vv. 13, 16, 27, 30-35).</p>
