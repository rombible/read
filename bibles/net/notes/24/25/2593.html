(See Jer 23:1-4 and the notes there.) Here the figure has some irony involved in it. It is the shepherds who are to be slaughtered like sheep. They may have considered themselves &#8220;choice vessels&#8221; (the literal translation of &#8220;fine pottery&#8221;), but they would be slaughtered and lie scattered on the ground (v. 33) like broken pottery.</p>
