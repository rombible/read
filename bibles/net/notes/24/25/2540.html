<A NAME="2540"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1440><b>sn</b> &#8220;Drinking from the cup of wrath&#8221; is a common figure to represent being punished by God. Isaiah had used it earlier to refer to the punishment which Judah was to suffer and from which God would deliver her (Isa 51:17, 22) and Jeremiah&#8217;s contemporary Habakkuk uses it of Babylon &#8220;pouring out its wrath&#8221; on the nations and in turn being forced to drink the bitter cup herself (Hab 2:15-16). In Jer 51:7 the <sc>Lord will identify Babylon as the cup which makes the nations stagger. In v. 16 drinking from the cup will be identified with the sword (i.e., wars) that the <sc>Lord will send against the nations. Babylon is also to be identified as the sword (cf. Jer 51:20-23). What is being alluded to here in highly figurative language is the judgment that the <sc>Lord will wreak on the nations listed here through the Babylonians. The prophecy given here in symbolical form is thus an expansion of the one in vv. 9-11.</p>
