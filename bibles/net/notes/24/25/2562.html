<A NAME="2562"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=1462><b>tc</b> Or &#8220;and all the kings of people of mixed origin who.&#8221; The Greek version gives evidence of having read the term only once; it refers to the &#8220;people of mixed origin&#8221; without reference to the kings of Arabia. While the term translated &#8220;people of mixed origin&#8221; seems appropriate in the context of a group of foreigners within a larger entity (e.g. Israel in Exod 12:38; Neh 13:3; Egypt in Jer 50:37), it seems odd to speak of them as a separate entity under their own kings. The presence of the phrase in the Hebrew text and the other versions dependent upon it can be explained as a case of dittography.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> See further Jer 49:28-33 for judgment against some of these Arabian peoples.</p>
