<A NAME="2525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1425><b>sn</b> The Hebrew word translated &#8220;everlasting&#8221; is the word often translated &#8220;eternal.&#8221; However, it sometimes has a more limited time reference. For example it refers to the lifetime of a person who became a &#8220;lasting slave&#8221; to another person (see Exod 21:6; Deut 15:17). It is also used to refer to the long life wished for a king (1 Kgs 1:31; Neh 2:3). The time frame here is to be qualified at least with reference to Judah and Jerusalem as seventy years (see 29:10-14 and compare v. 12).</p>
