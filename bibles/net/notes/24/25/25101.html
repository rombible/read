<A NAME="25101"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">101</span><note=1501><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;by the sword of the oppressors.&#8221; The reading here follows a number of Hebrew <sc>mss and the Greek version. The majority of Hebrew <sc>mss read &#8220;the anger of the oppressor.&#8221; The reading &#8220;the sword of the oppressors&#8221; is supported also by the parallel use of this phrase in Jer 46:16; 50:16. The error in the MT may be explained by confusion with the following line which has the same beginning combination (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497; &#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> [<font face="Scholar">mippÿne kharon</font>] confused for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497; &#1495;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489;</font> [<font face="Scholar">mippÿne kherev</font>]). This reading is also supported by the Targum, the Aramaic paraphrase of the OT. According to BDB 413 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font> Qal the feminine singular participle (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hayyonah</font>) is functioning as a collective in this idiom (see GKC 394 §122.<i>s</i> for this phenomenon).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The connection between &#8220;war&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;the sword&#8221;) and the wrath or anger of the <sc>Lord has already been made in vv. 16, 27 and the sword has been referred to also in vv. 29, 31. The sword is of course a reference to the onslaughts of the Babylonian armies (see later Jer 51:20-23).</p>
