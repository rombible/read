<A NAME="2538"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1438><b>tn</b> This is an attempt to render the Hebrew particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) which is probably being used in the sense that BDB 473-74 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 3.c notes, i.e., the causal connection is somewhat loose, related here to the prophecies against the nations. &#8220;So&#8221; seems to be the most appropriate way to represent this.</p>
