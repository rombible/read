<A NAME="2522"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1422><b>sn</b> Nebuchadnezzar is called the <sc>Lord&#8217;s <i>servant</i> also in Jer 27:6; 43:10. He was the <sc>Lord&#8217;s servant in that he was the agent used by the <sc>Lord to punish his disobedient people. Assyria was earlier referred to as the <sc>Lord&#8217;s &#8220;rod&#8221; (Isa 10:5-6) and Cyrus is called his &#8220;shepherd&#8221; and his &#8220;anointed&#8221; (Isa 44:28; 45:1). P. C. Craigie, P. H. Kelley, and J. F. Drinkard (<i>Jeremiah 1-25 </i>[WBC],<i> </i>364) make the interesting observation that the terms here are very similar to the terms in v. 4. The people of Judah ignored the servants, the prophets, he sent to turn them away from evil. So he will send other servants whom they cannot ignore.</p>
