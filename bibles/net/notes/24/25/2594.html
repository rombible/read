<A NAME="2594"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">94</span><note=1494><b>tn</b> The meaning of this line is debated. The Greek version does not have the words &#8220;lie scattered&#8221; and it reads the words &#8220;like broken pieces of fine pottery&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;like choice vessels&#8221;; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497; &#1495;&#1462;&#1502;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kikhli khemdah</font>) as &#8220;like choice rams&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1500;&#1461;&#1497; &#1495;&#1462;&#1502;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ele khemdah</font>); i.e., &#8220;the days have been completed for you to be slaughtered and you will fall like choice rams.&#8221; The reading of the Greek version fits the context better, but is probably secondary for that very reason. The word translated &#8220;lie scattered&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1508;&#1493;&#1465;&#1510;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tÿfotsah</font>) occurs nowhere else and the switch to the simile of &#8220;choice vessels&#8221; is rather abrupt. However, this section has been characterized by switching metaphors. The key to the interpretation and translation here is the consequential nature of the verbal actions involved. &#8220;Fall&#8221; does not merely refer to the action but the effect, i.e., &#8220;lie fallen&#8221; (cf. BDB 657 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1500;</font> 7 and compare Judg 3:25; 1 Sam 31:8). Though the noun translated &#8220;lie scattered&#8221; does not occur elsewhere, the verb does. It is quite commonly used of dispersing people and that has led many to see that as the reference here. The word, however, can be used of scattering other things like seed (Isa 28:25), arrows (2 Sam 22:15; metaphorical for lightning), etc. Here it follows &#8220;slaughtered&#8221; and refers to their dead bodies. The simile (<i>Heb</i> &#8220; fallen like choice vessels&#8221;) is elliptical, referring to &#8220;broken pieces&#8221; of choice vessels. In this sense the simile fits in perfectly with v. 33.</p>
