<A NAME="2514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1414><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;make me angry with the work of your hands.&#8221; The term &#8220;work of your own hands&#8221; is often interpreted as a reference to idolatry as is clearly the case in Isa 2:8; 37:19. However, the parallelism in 25:14 and the context in 32:30 show that it is more general and refers to what they have done. That is likely the meaning here as well.</p>
