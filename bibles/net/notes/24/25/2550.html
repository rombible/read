<A NAME="2550"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1450><b>tn</b> The meaning of this term and its connection with the preceding is somewhat uncertain. This word is used of the mixture of foreign people who accompanied Israel out of Egypt (Exod 12:38) and of the foreigners that the Israelites were to separate out of their midst in the time of Nehemiah (Neh 13:3). Most commentators interpret it here of the foreign people who were living in Egypt. (See BDB 786 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489;</font> and KBL 733 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489;</font>.)</p>
