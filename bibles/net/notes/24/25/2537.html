<A NAME="2537"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1437><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;according to their deeds and according to the work of their hands.&#8221; The two phrases are synonymous; it would be hard to represent them both in translation without being redundant. The translation attempts to represent them by the qualifier &#8220;all&#8221; before the first phrase.</p>
