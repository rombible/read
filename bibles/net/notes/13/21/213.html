<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=546><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and incited David to count Israel.&#8221; As v. 5 indicates, David was not interested in a general census, but in determining how much military strength he had.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The parallel text in 2 Sam 24:1 says, &#8220;The <sc>Lord&#8217;s anger again raged against Israel and he incited David against them, saying: &#8216;Go, count Israel and Judah!&#8217;&#8220; The version of the incident in the Book of 2 Samuel gives an underlying theological perspective, while the Chronicler simply describes what happened from a human perspective. Many interpreters and translations render the Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1496;&#1464;&#1503;</font> as a proper name here, &#8220;Satan&#8221; (NEB, NASB, NIV, NRSV). However, the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1496;&#1464;&#1503;</font>, which means &#8220;adversary,&#8221; is used here without the article. Elsewhere when it appears without the article, it refers to a personal or national adversary in the human sphere, the lone exception being Num 22:22, 32, where the angel of the Lord assumes the role of an adversary to Balaam. When referring elsewhere to the spiritual entity known in the NT as Satan, the noun has the article and is used as a title, &#8220;the Adversary&#8221; (see Job 1:6-9, 12; 2:1-4, 6-7; Zech 3:1-2). In light of usage elsewhere the adversary in 1 Chr 21:1 is likely a human enemy, probably a nearby nation whose hostility against Israel pressured David into numbering the people so he could assess his military strength. For compelling linguistic and literary arguments against taking the noun as a proper name here, see S. Japhet, <i>I &amp; II Chronicles</i> (OTL), 374-75.</p>
