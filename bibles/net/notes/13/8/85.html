<A NAME="85"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=184><b>tc</b> Some LXX <sc>mss add &#8220;Ner&#8221; here (cf. 1 Chr 9:36 and v. 33 below, where Ner is mentioned as the father of Kish). The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿner</font>) could have been accidentally omitted by homoioarcton since each name in the list has the conjunction prefixed to it. Some English versions follow the LXX here and add &#8220;Ner&#8221; (e.g., NAB, NIV, NLT).</p>
