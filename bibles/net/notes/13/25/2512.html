<A NAME="2512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=674><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The first lot went to Asaph, to Joseph.&#8221; Apparently the recurring formula, &#8220;and his sons and his relatives, twelve&#8221; has been accidentally omitted from the Hebrew text at this point (see vv. 10-31; the formula is slightly different in v. 9b). If the number &#8220;twelve&#8221; is not supplied here, the total comes to only 276, not the 288 required by v. 7.</p>
