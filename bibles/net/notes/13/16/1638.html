<A NAME="1638"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=413><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to bless his house.&#8221; Elsewhere when &#8220;house&#8221; is the object of &#8220;bless,&#8221; it refers to a household or family. See, for example, 1 Chr 13:14; 17:27. However, since <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet</font>, &#8220;house&#8221;) refers to a literal house or home earlier in the verse and to David&#8217;s palace in 17:1, one might translate here, &#8220;David went to pronounce a blessing on [i.e., dedicate] his house [i.e., palace].&#8221;</p>
