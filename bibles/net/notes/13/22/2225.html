<A NAME="2225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=618><b>tn</b> In the Hebrew text the statement is phrased as a rhetorical question, &#8220;Is not the <sc>Lord your God with you?&#8221; The question anticipates the response, &#8220;Of course he is!&#8221; Thus in the translation the positive statement &#8220;The <sc>Lord your God is with you!&#8221; has been used.</p>
