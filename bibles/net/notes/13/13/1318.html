<A NAME="1318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=336><b>sn</b> The modern reader might think God seemed to overreact here, but Israel needed a vivid object lesson of God&#8217;s holiness. By loading the ark on a cart, David had violated the instructions in God&#8217;s law (Exod 25:12-14; Num 4:5-6, 15). Uzzah&#8217;s action, however innocent it may seem, betrayed a certain lack of reverence for God&#8217;s presence. God had to remind his people that his holiness could not under any circumstances be violated.</p>
