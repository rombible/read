<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=47><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And after the death of Hezron in Caleb Ephrathah, and the wife of Hezron, Abijah, and she bore to him Ashhur the father of Tekoa.&#8221; Perhaps one could translate: &#8220;After Hezron died in Caleb Ephrathah, Abijah, Hezron&#8217;s wife, bore to him Ashhur, the father of Tekoa&#8221; (cf. NASB, NIV, NRSV). In this case the text suggests that Abijah was born after his father&#8217;s death. Because of the awkward syntax and the odd appearance of &#8220;Caleb Ephrathah&#8221; as a place name, some prefer to emend the text. Some alter <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1461;&#1489; &#1488;&#1462;&#1508;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿkhalev </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">efratah</font>, &#8220;in Caleb Ephrathah&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488; &#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1461;&#1489; &#1488;&#1462;&#1508;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> khalev </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">efratah</font>, &#8220;Caleb had sexual relations with Ephrath&#8221;) and then change <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aviyyah</font>, &#8220;Abijah&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avihu</font>, &#8220;his father&#8221;). This results in the following translation: &#8220;And after Hezron&#8217;s death, Caleb had sexual relations with Ephrath, his father Hezron&#8217;s wife, and she bore to him Ashhur the father of Tekoa&#8221; (cf. NAB). This would mean that Caleb&#8217;s second wife Ephrath had actually been his late father&#8217;s wife (probably Caleb&#8217;s stepmother). Perhaps the text was subsequently altered because Caleb&#8217;s actions appeared improper in light of the injunctions in Lev 18:8; 20:11; Deut 22:30; 27:20 (which probably refer, however, to a son having sexual relations with his stepmother while his father is still alive).</p>
