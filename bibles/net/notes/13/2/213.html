<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=41><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Caleb son of Hezron fathered [children] with Azubah, a wife, and with Jerioth.&#8221; Jerioth could be viewed as a second wife (so NLT; cf. also NASB, NIV, NRSV), but the following context mentions only &#8220;her [presumably Azubah&#8217;s] sons.&#8221; Another option, the one chosen in the translation, is that Jerioth is another name for Azubah.</p>
