<A NAME="34"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=61><b>tn</b> Most Hebrew <sc>mss read &#8220;Bathshua&#8221; here, but 2 Sam 12:24 makes it clear Bathsheba was Solomon&#8217;s mother. &#8220;Bathsheba&#8221; is read by one Hebrew <sc>ms and the Vulgate. Many English translations (e.g., NAB, NIV, NLT) render the name &#8220;Bathsheba&#8221; to avoid confusion.</p>
