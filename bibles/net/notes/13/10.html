<A NAME="102"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=216><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the Philistines.&#8221; The translation has substituted the pronoun &#8220;they&#8221; to avoid redundancy.</p>
<A NAME="103"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=217><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his&#8221;; the referent (Saul) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>

<A NAME="105"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=219><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they found him, the ones who shoot with the bow, and he was in pain from the ones shooting.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="106"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=220><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;so these uncircumcised ones might not come and abuse me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="107"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=221><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all his house.&#8221; This is probably to be understood as a general summary statement. It could include other males in Saul&#8217;s household besides his three sons, cf. 1 Sam 31:6. If it refers only to the male members of his household who would have stood in succession to the throne (cf. NLT, &#8220;bringing his dynasty to an end,&#8221;) even here there is an exception, since one of Saul&#8217;s sons, Eshbaal (or &#8220;Ishbosheth&#8221; in 2 Sam 2:8) was not killed in the battle and became king over Israel, which he ruled for two years (2 Sam 2:10) until he was assassinated by Rechab and Baanah (2 Sam 4:5-6). The tribe of Judah never acknowledged Ishbosheth as king; instead they followed David (2 Sam 2:10).</p>
<A NAME="108"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=222><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they&#8221;; the referent (the army) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="109"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=223><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;god.&#8221; The Hebrew term may be translated as singular or plural depending on the context.</p>
<A NAME="1010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=224><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;arose and carried away the corpse of Saul and the corpses of his sons.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1011"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=225><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;their bones.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1012"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=226><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Saul died because of his unfaithfulness by which he acted unfaithfully against the <sc>Lord, concerning the word of the <sc>Lord which he did not keep, also to Saul, a ritual pit to seek.&#8221; The text alludes to the incident recorded in 1 Sam 28. The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ov</font>, &#8220;ritual pit&#8221;) refers to a pit used by a magician to conjure up underworld spirits.
