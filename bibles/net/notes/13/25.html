<A NAME="251"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=663><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;David and the officers of the army set apart for service the sons of Asaph and Heman and Jeduthun, the ones prophesying by harps, by lyres, and by cymbals.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="252"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=664><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and their number was, the men of work for their service.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="253"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=665><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the sons of Asaph [were] upon the hand of Asaph, the one prophesying upon the hands of the king.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="254"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=666><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;belonging to Jeduthun, the sons of Jeduthun.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="255"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=667><b>tn</b> This name appears as &#8220;Izri&#8221; in v. 10.</p>
<A NAME="256"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=668><b>tc</b> One Hebrew <sc>ms and some LXX <sc>mss supply the name &#8220;Shimei&#8221; after &#8220;Jeshaiah.&#8221; Most Hebrew <sc>mss omit the name here (but cf. v. 17).</p>
<A NAME="257"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=669><b>tc</b> The list includes only five names. Apparently the name &#8220;Shimei&#8221; (see v. 17), which appears in one medieval Hebrew <sc>ms and in the LXX, has been accidentally omitted from the Hebrew text.</p>
<A NAME="258"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=670><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;belonging to Heman, the sons of Heman.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="259"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=671><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;by the words of God to exalt a horn.&#8221; An animal&#8217;s horn is sometimes used metaphorically as a symbol of strength and honor. See BDB 901-2 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1504;</font>.</p>
<A NAME="2510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=672><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and their number with their brothers, trained in music to the <sc>Lord, all skilled, was 288.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=673><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they cast lots [for] service, just as like small, like great, teacher with student.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=674><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The first lot went to Asaph, to Joseph.&#8221; Apparently the recurring formula, &#8220;and his sons and his relatives, twelve&#8221; has been accidentally omitted from the Hebrew text at this point (see vv. 10-31; the formula is slightly different in v. 9b). If the number &#8220;twelve&#8221; is not supplied here, the total comes to only 276, not the 288 required by v. 7.</p>
<A NAME="2513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=675><b>tn</b> &#8220;Izri&#8221; is a variant of the name &#8220;Zeri&#8221; (cf. 25:3).</p>
