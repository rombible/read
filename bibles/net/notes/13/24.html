<A NAME="242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=650><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And the sons of Eleazar were found to be more, with respect to the heads of men, than the sons of Ithamar, and they divided them. To the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen heads, according to the house of the fathers; and to the sons of Ithamar there were eight, according to the house of their fathers.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=651><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they divided them by lots, these with these, for the officials of the holy place and the officials of God were from the sons of Eleazar and among the sons of Ithamar.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=656><b>tn</b> This appears to be a variant of the name Shebuel (cf. 1 Chr 23:16 and 26:24).</p>
<A NAME="249"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=657><b>tc</b> Most Hebrew <sc>mss omit &#8220;Hebron&#8221; here, but see 1 Chr 23:19. The name is included in two Hebrew <sc>mss and some LXX <sc>mss.</p>

The text, however, may be corrupt at this point; a list of Jaaziah&#8217;s sons may have been accidentally omitted. See v. 27.</p>
<A NAME="2412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=660><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;from Jaaziah his son.&#8221; See the note on &#8220;Beno&#8221; in v. 26.</p>
