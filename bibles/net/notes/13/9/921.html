<A NAME="921"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=212><b>tc</b> The name &#8220;Ahaz&#8221; is included in the Vulgate and Syriac, but omitted in the MT. It probably was accidentally omitted by haplography. Note that the name appears at the beginning of the next verse. Cf. also 8:35.</p>
