<A NAME="1718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=431><b>tn</b> Here the word &#8220;house&#8221; is used in a metaphorical sense, referring to a royal dynasty. The <sc>Lord&#8217;s use of the word here plays off the literal sense that David had in mind as he contemplated building a temple (&#8220;house&#8221;) for the <sc>Lord. In the translation the adjective &#8220;dynastic&#8221; is supplied to indicate that the term is used metaphorically.</p>
