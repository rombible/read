<A NAME="1727"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=440><b>tn</b> The translation &#8220;You have revealed to me what men long to know&#8221; is very tentative; the meaning of the Hebrew text is unclear. The text appears to read literally, &#8220;and you see me like the searching of man, that which is upward,&#8221; which is nonsensical. The translation above assumes the following: (1) The Qal verb translated &#8220;you see me&#8221; is repointed as a Hiphil, &#8220;you showed me,&#8221; (2) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tor</font>) is understood in the sense of &#8220;searching, exploring,&#8221; and (3) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hamma</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alah</font>) is taken in a temporal sense of &#8220;that which lies beyond.&#8221; Thus one could translate, &#8220;you have shown me what men search for, what lies beyond.&#8221; </p>
