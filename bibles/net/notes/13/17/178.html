<A NAME="178"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=421><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and I was from tent to tent and from tabernacle.&#8221; The words <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el-mishÿkan</font>, &#8220;to tabernacle&#8221;) should probably be added at the end of the sentence to complete this prepositional phrase and produce symmetry with the preceding prepositional phrase. The words probably fell from the text by homoioteleuton.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>I have lived in a tent that has been in various places.</i> The point here is that the Lord moved with the tabernacle as it moved from place to place; he did not confine himself to a particular location.</p>
