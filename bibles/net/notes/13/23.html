<A NAME="231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=626><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and full of years.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=627><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (David) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=628><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and their number by their heads, by men, was 38,000.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=629><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;David said&#8221; are supplied here in the translation for clarification. The appearance of the first person verb &#8220;I supplied&#8221; in v. 5 indicates that David is speaking here.</p>
<A NAME="235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=630><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;made to [or &#8220;for&#8221;] praise.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=631><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;Zina&#8221; here and &#8220;Zizah&#8221; in v. 11. One Hebrew <sc>ms, the LXX, and the Vulgate, harmonizing the form of the name to that found in v. 11, read &#8220;Zizah&#8221; here.</p>
<A NAME="237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=632><b>sn</b> Verses 8-10 are confusing. Two different lists of Shimei&#8217;s sons appear. In between these lists is the statement &#8220;these were the leaders of the family of Ladan,&#8221; suggesting that the list just before this includes the sons of Ladan, not Shimei. But verse 8 already lists Ladan&#8217;s sons. Apparently the text as it stands is a conflation of differing traditions.</p>
<A NAME="238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=633><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Aaron was set apart to consecrate it, the most holy things, he and his sons, permanently, to sacrifice before the <sc>Lord, to serve him, and to bless his name permanently.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="2310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=635><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has the plural &#8220;sons,&#8221; but only one name appears after this. The attached phrase &#8220;the oldest&#8221; might indicate that Shebuel was not Gershom&#8217;s only son, but note v. 17.</p>
<A NAME="2311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=636><b>tc</b> The LXX reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#931;&#959;&#965;&#946;&#945;&#951;&#955;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Soubahl</font>) here, a reading followed by NAB, NIV, NCV, CEV (&#8220;Shubael&#8221;); cf. 24:20.</p>
<A NAME="2312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=637><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has &#8220;the sons of Eliezer were,&#8221; but only one name appears after this in the verse, and we are specifically told that Eliezer had no other sons.</p>
<A NAME="2313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=638><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has the plural &#8220;sons,&#8221; but only one name appears after this.
