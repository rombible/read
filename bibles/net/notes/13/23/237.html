<A NAME="237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=632><b>sn</b> Verses 8-10 are confusing. Two different lists of Shimei&#8217;s sons appear. In between these lists is the statement &#8220;these were the leaders of the family of Ladan,&#8221; suggesting that the list just before this includes the sons of Ladan, not Shimei. But verse 8 already lists Ladan&#8217;s sons. Apparently the text as it stands is a conflation of differing traditions.</p>
