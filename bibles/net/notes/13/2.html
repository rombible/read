<A NAME="21"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=29><b>tn</b> The groupings in the list that follows, as well as the conjunctions (<i>vav</i>-consecutives in Hebrew), reflect those of the Hebrew text.</p>
<A NAME="22"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=30><b>tn</b> The name means &#8220;daughter of Shua.&#8221; Shua is identified in Gen 38:2 as a &#8220;Canaanite man.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="23"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=31><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;was evil in the eyes of the <sc>Lord, so he [i.e., the <sc>Lord] killed him [i.e., Er].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="24"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=32><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his&#8221;; the referent (Judah) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="25"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=33><b>tc</b> Many medieval Hebrew <sc>mss, some LXX <sc>mss, and Syriac read &#8220;Darda&#8221; (see 1 Kgs 4:31 ET = 1 Kgs 5:11 HT).</p>
<A NAME="26"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=34><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sons.&#8221; The Hebrew text has the plural, but only one son is listed.</p>
<A NAME="27"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=35><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text has &#8220;Achar,&#8221; which means &#8220;disaster,&#8221; but a few medieval Hebrew <sc>mss read &#8220;Achan.&#8221; See Josh 7:1.</p>
<A NAME="28"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=36><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the troubler of Israel who was unfaithful with respect to the devoted [things].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="29"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=37><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sons.&#8221; The Hebrew text has the plural, but only one son is listed.</p>
<A NAME="210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=38><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has &#8220;Celubai,&#8221; but see v. 18, where Caleb is described as the son of Hezron.</p>
<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=39><b>tc</b> The LXX reads &#8220;Salmon&#8221; (cf. Ruth 4:21) and is followed by some English versions (e.g., NIV, NCV, TEV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=40><b>tn</b> In 2 Sam 2:18 this name appears as &#8220;Abishai,&#8221; a spelling followed by many English versions here.</p>
<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=41><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Caleb son of Hezron fathered [children] with Azubah, a wife, and with Jerioth.&#8221; Jerioth could be viewed as a second wife (so NLT; cf. also NASB, NIV, NRSV), but the following context mentions only &#8220;her [presumably Azubah&#8217;s] sons.&#8221; Another option, the one chosen in the translation, is that Jerioth is another name for Azubah.</p>
<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=42><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;took for himself.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=43><b>sn</b> This means &#8220;later&#8221; in relation to the births of the three sons (Jerahmeel, Ram and Caleb) mentioned in v. 9.</p>
<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=44><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Hezron went to.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=45><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he took,&#8221; referring to taking in marriage.</p>
<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=46><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Havvoth Jair&#8221; (NIV, NRSV). Some translations do not translate the phrase (&#8220;havvoth&#8221; = &#8220;the towns of&#8221;), but treat it as part of the place name.</p>
<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=47><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And after the death of Hezron in Caleb Ephrathah, and the wife of Hezron, Abijah, and she bore to him Ashhur the father of Tekoa.&#8221; Perhaps one could translate: &#8220;After Hezron died in Caleb Ephrathah, Abijah, Hezron&#8217;s wife, bore to him Ashhur, the father of Tekoa&#8221; (cf. NASB, NIV, NRSV). In this case the text suggests that Abijah was born after his father&#8217;s death. Because of the awkward syntax and the odd appearance of &#8220;Caleb Ephrathah&#8221; as a place name, some prefer to emend the text. Some alter <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1461;&#1489; &#1488;&#1462;&#1508;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿkhalev </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">efratah</font>, &#8220;in Caleb Ephrathah&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488; &#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1461;&#1489; &#1488;&#1462;&#1508;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> khalev </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">efratah</font>, &#8220;Caleb had sexual relations with Ephrath&#8221;) and then change <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aviyyah</font>, &#8220;Abijah&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avihu</font>, &#8220;his father&#8221;). This results in the following translation: &#8220;And after Hezron&#8217;s death, Caleb had sexual relations with Ephrath, his father Hezron&#8217;s wife, and she bore to him Ashhur the father of Tekoa&#8221; (cf. NAB). This would mean that Caleb&#8217;s second wife Ephrath had actually been his late father&#8217;s wife (probably Caleb&#8217;s stepmother). Perhaps the text was subsequently altered because Caleb&#8217;s actions appeared improper in light of the injunctions in Lev 18:8; 20:11; Deut 22:30; 27:20 (which probably refer, however, to a son having sexual relations with his stepmother while his father is still alive).</p>
<A NAME="220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=48><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sons.&#8221; The Hebrew text has the plural &#8220;sons&#8221; in all three instances in this verse, even though the following lists have only one name each.</p>
<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=49><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the sons of Mareshah,&#8221; but this does not fit contextually. Perhaps the text originally had <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1465; &#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1462;&#1492; &#1502;&#1464;&#1512;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">uvÿno mishneh mareshah</font>, &#8220;and his second son, Mareshah&#8221;), with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (&#8220;second&#8221;) later accidentally falling out by homoioteleuton (cf. the note in <i>BHS</i> here). </p>
<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=50><b>sn</b> See the note on the word &#8220;concubine&#8221; in 1:32.</p>
<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=51><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;son.&#8221; The Hebrew text has the singular, but the following list contains more than one name.</p>
<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=52><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text reads &#8220;Ephrathah&#8221; here, but see v. 19, which mentions &#8220;Ephrath&#8221; as the wife of Hur.</p>
<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=53><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has &#8220;Menuchites&#8221; here, but v. 54 has &#8220;Manachathites.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=54><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from these went forth the Zorathites and Eshtaolites.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=55><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;the Sopherim.&#8221; The NAB transliterates this term and treats it as a proper name.</p>
<A NAME="228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=56><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;came.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=57><b>tn</b> Or (if <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;</font> [<font face="Scholar">beth</font>] is translated as &#8220;house&#8221; rather than considered to be part of the name) &#8220;the father of the house [i.e., family] of Rechab.&#8221;</p>
