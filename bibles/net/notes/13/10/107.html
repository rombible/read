<A NAME="107"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=221><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all his house.&#8221; This is probably to be understood as a general summary statement. It could include other males in Saul&#8217;s household besides his three sons, cf. 1 Sam 31:6. If it refers only to the male members of his household who would have stood in succession to the throne (cf. NLT, &#8220;bringing his dynasty to an end,&#8221;) even here there is an exception, since one of Saul&#8217;s sons, Eshbaal (or &#8220;Ishbosheth&#8221; in 2 Sam 2:8) was not killed in the battle and became king over Israel, which he ruled for two years (2 Sam 2:10) until he was assassinated by Rechab and Baanah (2 Sam 4:5-6). The tribe of Judah never acknowledged Ishbosheth as king; instead they followed David (2 Sam 2:10).</p>
