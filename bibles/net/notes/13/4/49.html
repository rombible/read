<A NAME="49"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=77><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has simply, &#8220;and she gave birth to,&#8221; without identifying the subject. The words &#8220;Mered&#8217;s wife Bithiah&#8221; are added in the translation for clarification. See v. 18b, which mentions &#8220;Bethiah, whom Mered married.&#8221;</p>
