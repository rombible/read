<A NAME="156"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=366><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text adds <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ben</font>, &#8220;son&#8221;) here; the word is omitted in three Hebrew <sc>mss and most LXX <sc>mss. If the word is original, perhaps the name of Zechariah&#8217;s father was accidentally omitted. Some English versions treat the word as an additional name in the list (&#8220;Ben&#8221;; e.g., KJV, ASV, NASB).</p>
