<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1><b>tc</b> The LXX reads &#8220;Noah; the sons of Noah [were] Shem, Ham, and Japheth.&#8221; Several English translations (e.g., NIV, NLT) follow the LXX.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Shem, Ham, and Japheth</i> were Noah&#8217;s three sons (Gen 6:10).</p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2><b>tc</b> Many medieval Hebrew <span class="smallcaps">mss</span>, along with the LXX and Vulgate, read &#8220;Riphath&#8221; (see Gen 10:3). This is followed by several English translations (e.g., NAB, NIV, NLT), while others (e.g., ASV, NASB, NRSV) follow the MT reading (&#8220;Diphath&#8221;).</p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3><b>tn</b> Or in this case, &#8220;descendants.&#8221;</p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4><b>tc</b> The <i>Kethiv</i> has &#8220;Rodanim,&#8221; which probably refers to the island of Rhodes. The <i>Qere</i> has &#8220;Dodanim,&#8221; which refers to one of the most ancient and revered locations in ancient Greece. The MT and most medieval Hebrew <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> of the parallel list in Gen 10:4 read &#8220;Dodanim,&#8221; but a few have &#8220;Rodanim.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Kittim and Rodanim.&#8221;</p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>tn</b> That is, &#8220;Egypt.&#8221;</p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=6><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he began to be a mighty warrior in the earth.&#8221;</p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=7><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;came forth.&#8221;</p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=8><b>tc</b> The words &#8220;the sons of Aram&#8221; do not appear in the Hebrew text. Apparently the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497; &#1488;&#1458;&#1512;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">uvÿney </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aram</font>) has accidentally dropped out of the text by homoioteleuton (note the presence of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1512;&#1464;&#1501;</font> just before this). The phrase is included in Gen 10:23.</p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=9><b>tc</b> The MT of the parallel geneaology in Gen 10:23 reads &#8220;Mash,&#8221; but the LXX there reads &#8220;Meshech&#8221; in agreement with 1 Chr 1:17.</p>
<a name="110"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=10><b>sn</b> Perhaps this refers to the scattering of the people at Babel (Gen 11:1-9).</p>
<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>tc</b> Some medieval Hebrew <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> and the Syriac read &#8220;Obal&#8221; (see Gen 10:28).</p>
<a name="112"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=12><b>tc</b> Some LXX <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> read &#8220;Arphaxad, Cainan, Shelah&#8221; (see also the notes on Gen 10:24; 11:12-13).</p>
<a name="113"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=13><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;the others were&#8221; are supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<a name="114"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=14><b>sn</b> A <i>concubine</i> was a slave woman in ancient Near Eastern societies who was the legal property of her master, but who could have legitimate sexual relations with her master. A concubine&#8217;s status was more elevated than a mere servant, but she was not free and did not have the legal rights of a free wife. The children of a concubine could, in some instances, become equal heirs with the children of the free wife. After the period of the Judges concubines may have become more of a royal prerogative (2 Sam 21:10-14; 1 Kgs 11:3).</p>
<a name="115"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=15><b>tc</b> Many medieval Hebrew <span class="smallcaps">mss</span>, along with some LXX <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> and the Syriac, read &#8220;Zepho&#8221; (see Gen 36:11).</p>
<a name="116"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=16><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has simply, &#8220;and Timna and Amalek,&#8221; but Gen 36:12 indicates that Timna, a concubine of Eliphaz, was the mother of Amalek. See also v. 39 below, which states that Timna was the sister of Lotan.</p>
<a name="117"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=17><b>tn</b> Perhaps this is the Timna mentioned in v. 36.</p>
<a name="118"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=18><b>tc</b> Some medieval Hebrew <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> and a few LXX <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> read &#8220;Alvan&#8221; (see Gen 36:23).</p>
<a name="119"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=19><b>tc</b> A few medieval Hebrew <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> read &#8220;Shepho&#8221; (see Gen 36:23).</p>

<a name="121"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=21><b>tn</b> The parallel geneaology in Gen 36:26 has the variant spelling &#8220;Hemdan.&#8221; Some English versions follow the variant spelling here (e.g., NAB, NIV, NCV, CEV, NLT).</p>

<a name="123"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=23><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;Dishon&#8221; here, but this should be emended to &#8220;Dishan.&#8221; See the list in v. 38 and Gen 36:28.</p>
<a name="124"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=24><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;ruled in his place,&#8221; here and in vv. 45-50.</p>

<a name="128"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=28><b>tn</b> Each of the names in this list is preceded by the word &#8220;chief&#8221; in the Hebrew text. This has not been included in the translation because it would appear very redundant to the modern reader.</p>
