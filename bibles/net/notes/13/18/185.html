<A NAME="185"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=471><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;when he went to set up his hand at the Euphrates River.&#8221; The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yad</font>, &#8220;hand&#8221;) is usually understood to mean &#8220;control&#8221; or &#8220;dominion&#8221; here. However, since <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;</font> does occasionally refer to a monument, perhaps one could translate, &#8220;to set up his monument at the Euphrates River&#8221; (i.e., as a visible marker of the limits of his dominion). For another example of the Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">natsav</font>) used with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;</font> (&#8220;monument&#8221;), see 1 Sam 15:12.</p>
