<A NAME="45"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=239><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;a certain one&#8221;; KJV, ASV &#8220;such a one.&#8221; The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497; &#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pÿloni </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">almoni</font>) is not the name of the nearest relative, but an idiom which literally means &#8220;such and such&#8221; or &#8220;a certain one&#8221; (BDB 811-12 s.v. <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font></i>), which is used when one wishes to be ambiguous (1 Sam 21:3; 2 Kgs 6:8). Certainly Boaz would have known his relative&#8217;s name, especially in such a small village, and would have uttered his actual name. However the narrator refuses to record his name in a form of poetic justice because he refused to preserve Mahlon&#8217;s &#8220;name&#8221; (lineage) by marrying his widow (see 4:5, 9-10). This close relative, who is a literary foil for Boaz, refuses to fulfill the role of family guardian. Because he does nothing memorable, he remains anonymous in a chapter otherwise filled with names. His anonymity contrasts sharply with Boaz&#8217;s prominence in the story and the fame he attains through the child born to Ruth. Because the actual name of this relative is not recorded, the translation of this expression is difficult since contemporary English style expects either a name or title. This is usually supplied in modern translations: &#8220;friend&#8221; (NASB, NIV, RSV, NRSV, NLT), &#8220;so-and-so&#8221; (JPS, NJPS). Perhaps &#8220;Mr. So-And-So!&#8221; or &#8220;Mr. No-Name!&#8221; makes the point. For discussion see Adele Berlin, <i>Poetics and Interpretation of Biblical Narrative</i>, 99-101; R. L. Hubbard, Jr., <i>Ruth </i>(NICOT), 233-35; F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth,</i> <i>Esther</i> (WBC), 196-97. In the present translation &#8220;John Doe&#8221; is used since it is a standard designation for someone who is a party to legal proceedings whose true name is unknown.</p>
<A NAME="46"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=240><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he turned aside&#8221; (so KJV, NASB); NRSV &#8220;And he went over.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="47"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=241><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he took ten men from the elders of the town.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="49"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=243><b>tn</b> The perfect form of the verb here describes as a simple fact an action that is underway (cf. NIV, NRSV, CEV, NLT); NAB &#8220;is putting up for sale.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Naomi&#8230;is selling</i>. The nature of the sale is uncertain. Naomi may have been selling the property rights to the land, but this seems unlikely in light of what is known about ancient Israelite property laws. It is more likely that Naomi, being a woman, held only the right to use the land until the time of her remarriage or death (F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth,</i> <i>Esther</i> [WBC], 202-4). Because she held this right to use of the land, she also had the right to buy it back from the its current owner. (This assumes that Elimelech sold the land prior to going to Moab.) Since she did not possess the means to do so, however, she decided to dispose of her rights in the matter. She was not selling the land per se, but disposing of the right to its redemption and use, probably in exchange for room and board with the purchaser (Bush, 211-15). If this is correct, it might be preferable to translate, &#8220;Naomi is disposing of her rights to the portion of land,&#8221; although such a translation presumes some knowledge of ancient Israelite property laws.</p>

<A NAME="411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=245><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;before those sitting here and before the leaders of my people&#8221; appears to refer to the leaders who were specially chosen as witnesses (v. 2) and the larger group of community leaders standing by. It is possible, however, that the phrases &#8220;before those sitting here&#8221; and &#8220;before the leaders of my people&#8221; are appositional and that both refer to the ten leaders mentioned in v. 2 (cf. NLT &#8220;in the presence of these witnesses&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=246><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;if you will redeem, redeem&#8221; (KJV, NASB, NRSV all similar); NCV &#8220;If you want to buy back the land, then buy it.&#8221;</p>

But it is possible that he briefly addresses the witnesses and refers to the closer relative in the third person. See J. M. Sasson, <i>Ruth</i>, 118.</p>

<A NAME="419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=253><b>tc</b> The MT <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1461;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ume</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et</font>) may be understood in two ways: (1) &#8220;and from&#8221; (<i>vav</i> conjunction &#8220;and,&#8221; plus preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> [<font face="Scholar">min</font>] &#8220;from,&#8221; plus definite direct object marker <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1514;</font>) parallel to the preceding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">miyyad</font>, &#8220;from [the hand of]&#8221;), suggesting the field would be purchased from Naomi <i>and from</i> Ruth; or (2) &#8220;and&#8221; (<i>vav</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>] conjunction &#8220;and,&#8221; plus enclitic <i>mem</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1501;</font>], plus direct object marker [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1514;</font>]) introducing the second part of the acquisition: the nearest kinsman would be acquiring the field <i>and</i> Ruth (for discussion see F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth,</i> <i>Esther</i> [WBC], 202). However, the <i>BHS</i> editors suggest reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1501; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;</font> (&#8220;as well as&#8230;&#8221;; emphatic particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1501;</font> [&#8220;also&#8221;] and the definite direct object marker <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1514;</font>) introducing the second part of the acquisition: He would be acquiring the field <i>and</i> Ruth. This alternate reading is reflected in the <i>Vulgate</i> reading <i>quoque</i> (&#8220;and also&#8221;) and supported by parallel usage in v. 9, &#8220;I am acquiring the field from Naomi, and <i>also </i>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501; &#1488;&#1461;&#1514;&#1470;</font>, <font face="Scholar">gam </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et</font>) Ruth the Moabitess the wife of the deceased.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=254><b>tc</b> The MT (<i>Kethib</i>) reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qaniti</font>, &#8220;I acquire,&#8221; Qal perfect 1st person common singular): &#8220;When you acquire the field from the hand of Naomi, <i>I acquire</i> Ruth the Moabitess&#8230;&#8221; However, the marginal reading (<i>Qere</i>) is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qanitah</font>, &#8220;you acquire,&#8221; Qal perfect 2nd person masculine singular, reflected in 2nd person masculine singular forms in Greek, Latin, Aramaic, and Syriac): &#8220;When you acquire the field from the hand of Naomi, <i>you </i>must also<i> acquire</i> Ruth the Moabitess&#8230;&#8221; The <i>Qere</i> is probably original because the <i>Kethib</i> is too difficult syntactically and contextually, while the <i>Qere</i> makes perfect sense: (1) Boaz stated in 3:13 that the nearest kinsman had the first right to acquire Ruth if he wanted to do so, and only the <i>Qere</i> reading here presents him with that option; and (2) Boaz announces in 4:9-10 that he was acquiring the field and Ruth as a package deal in 4:9-10, and only the <i>Qere</i> reading here presents the nearest kinsman with the same package deal. The <i>Kethib</i> probably arose by a scribe trying to harmonize 4:5 with the 1st person common singular form in 4:9-10 without fully understanding the ploy of Boaz in 4:5. See F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth,</i> <i>Esther</i> (WBC), 216-17.</p>
<A NAME="421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=255><b>tc</b> The presence of two difficult textual problems in this line (see two preceding notes) has produced a combination of four different ways in which this line can be rendered: (1) &#8220;When you acquire the field from Naomi, <i>you must acquire [it] from</i> Ruth the Moabitess the wife of the deceased&#8221; (KJV, NKJV); (2) &#8220;When you acquire the field from Naomi <i>and from</i> Ruth the Moabitess, <i>you must acquire</i> the wife of the deceased&#8221; (JPS, NJPS, NIV); (3) &#8220;When you acquire the field from Naomi, <i>you must also acquire </i>Ruth the Moabitess the wife of the deceased&#8221; (NASB, NCV, TEV, RSV, NRSV, NLT); and (4) &#8220;When you acquire the field from Naomi, <i>then I acquire</i> Ruth the Moabitess the wife of the deceased&#8221; (REB). The third option is adopted here.</p><p class="footnote"><sup> </sup><b>sn</b> <i>Our deceased relative</i>. This refers to Mahlon, viewed as Elimelech&#8217;s heir.</p>
<A NAME="422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=256><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in order to raise up the name of the deceased over his inheritance&#8221; (NASB similar); NRSV &#8220;to maintain the dead man&#8217;s name on his inheritance.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=257><b>sn</b> <i>I would ruin my own inheritance</i>. It is not entirely clear how acquiring Ruth and raising up an heir for the deceased Elimelech would ruin this individual&#8217;s inheritance. Perhaps this means that the inheritance of his other children would be diminished. See R. L. Hubbard, Jr., <i>Ruth </i>(NICOT), 245-46.</p>
<A NAME="424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=258><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;redeem for yourself, you, my right of redemption for I am unable to redeem.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Here it appears that the acquisition of Ruth along with the land was an obligatory package deal (&#8220;When you acquire the field from Naomi, you <i>must also</i> acquire Ruth&#8230;&#8221;). On the other hand, Boaz viewed marriage to Ruth as voluntary in 3:13 (&#8220;If he does not <i>want</i> to redeem you, I will redeem you&#8221;), and presented the acquisition of the field as voluntary in 4:4 (&#8220;If you <i>want </i>to exercise your right&#8230;but if not, tell me!&#8221;). Initially, Boaz makes the transaction appear to be a mere land deal in 4:4. When the nearest relative jumped at the land offer, Boaz confronted him with the attendant social/family obligation of marrying Ruth to raise up an heir for the deceased to inherit this very land. By conducting the transaction in public where the close relative would need to save face, Boaz forced him either to reject the offer entirely or to include Ruth in the deal &#8211; but he could not take the land and reject Ruth. Either way, Ruth would be cared for and Elimelech&#8217;s line continued. But if he took Ruth, the acquisition of the land would be more economically burdensome than beneficial, so he yielded his purchase option to Boaz. For discussion, see F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth,</i> <i>Esther</i> (WBC), 229-33. </p>

The omission of the suffix with &#8220;name&#8221; could be explained as virtual haplography (note the letter <i>bet</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;</font>], which is similar to <i>kaf</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;</font>], at the beginning of the next word). The same explanation could account for the omission of the prefixed <i>yod</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font>) on the verb &#8220;call&#8221; (<i>yod</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font>] and <i>vav</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>] are similar in appearance).
