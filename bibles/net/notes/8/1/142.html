<a name="142"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=42><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for there is bitterness to me exceedingly from you.&#8221; The clause <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1470;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497; &#1502;&#1456;&#1488;&#1465;&#1491; &#1502;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki-mar-li me</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">od mikkem</font>) is notoriously difficult to interpret. It has been taken in three different ways: (1) &#8220;For I am very bitter for me because of you,&#8221; that is, because of your widowed condition (cf. KJV, NKJV, ASV, RSV, NJB, REB, JB, TEV). This does not fit well, however, with the following statement (&#8220;for the LORD has attacked me&#8221;) nor with the preceding statement (&#8220;You must not return with me&#8221;). (2) &#8220;For I am far more bitter than for you&#8221; (cf. NASB, NIV, NJPS, NEB, CEV, NLT). This does not provide an adequate basis, however, for the preceding statement (&#8220;You must not return with me&#8221;). (3) &#8220;For my bitterness is too much for you [to bear]&#8221; (cf. NAB, NRSV, NCV, CEV margin). This is preferable because it fits well with both the preceding and following statements. These three options reflect the three ways the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1503;</font> may be taken here: (1) causal: &#8220;because of, on account of&#8221; (BDB<i> </i>580 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> 2.f; <i>HALOT </i>598 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> 6), not that Orpah and Ruth were the cause of her calamity, but that Naomi was grieved because they had become widows; (2) comparative: &#8220;more [bitter] than you&#8221; (BDB<i> </i>581 s.v. 6.a; <i>HALOT </i>598 s.v. 5b), meaning that Naomi&#8217;s situation was more grievous than theirs &#8211; while they could remarry, her prospects were much more bleak; and (3) elative, describing a situation that is too much for a person to bear: &#8220;too [bitter] for you&#8221; (BDB<i> </i>581 s.v. 6.d; <i>HALOT </i>598 s.v. 5a; <i>IBHS</i> 267 §14.4f; e.g., Gen 4:13; Exod 18:18; Deut 17:8; 1 Kgs 19:17), meaning that Naomi&#8217;s plight was too bitter for her daughters-in-law to share. While all three options are viable, the meaning adopted must fit two criteria: (1) The meaning of this clause (1:13b) must provide the grounds for Naomi&#8217;s emphatic rejection of the young women&#8217;s refusal to separate themselves from her (1:13a); and (2) it must fit the following clause: &#8220;for the hand of the LORD has gone out against me&#8221; (1:13c). The first and second options do not provide adequate reasons for sending her daughters-in-law back home, nor do they fit her lament that the LORD had attached her (not them); however, the third option (elative sense) fits both criteria. Naomi did not want her daughters-in-law to share her sad situation, that is, to be poor, childless widows in a foreign land with no prospect for marriage. If they accompanied her back to Judah, they would be in the same kind of situation in which she found herself in Moab. If they were to find the &#8220;rest&#8221; (security of home and husband) she wished for them, it would be in Moab, not in Judah. The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> had already deprived her of husband and sons. She could do nothing for them in this regard because she had no more sons to give them as husbands, and she was past the age of child-bearing to raise up new husbands for them in the future &#8211; as if they could wait that long anyway (1:13a). For a discussion of these three options and defense of the approach adopted here, see F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth,</i> <i>Esther</i> (WBC), 80-81.</p>
