When used of a foreign land, it can refer to (1) temporary dwelling as a visiting foreigner (Gen 12:10; 20:1; 21:34; 2 Kgs 8:1-2; Jer 44:14) or (2) permanent dwelling as a resident foreigner (Gen 47:4; Exod 6:4; Num 15:14; Deut 26:5; 2 Sam 4:3; Jer 49:18,33; 50:40; Ezek 47:22-23). Although Naomi eventually returned to Judah, there is some ambiguity whether or not Elimelech intended the move to make them permanent resident foreigners. Cf. NASB &#8220;to sojourn&#8221; and NIV &#8220;to live for a while,&#8221; both of which imply the move was temporary, while &#8220;to live&#8221; (NCV, NRSV, NLT) is more neutral about the permanence of the relocation.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Some interpreters view Elimelech&#8217;s departure from Judah to sojourn in Moab as lack of faith in the covenant God of Israel to provide for his family&#8217;s needs in the land of promise; therefore his death is consequently viewed as divine judgment. Others note that God never prohibited his people from seeking food in a foreign land during times of famine but actually sent his people to a foreign land during a famine in Canaan on at least one occasion as an act of deliverance (Gen 37-50). In this case, Elimelech&#8217;s sojourn to Moab was an understandable act by a man concerned for the survival of his family, perhaps even under divine approval, so their death in Moab was simply a tragedy, a bad thing that happened to a godly person.</p>
