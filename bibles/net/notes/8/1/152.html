<a name="152"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=52><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;certainly death will separate me and you.&#8221; Ruth&#8217;s vow has been interpreted two ways: (1) Not even death will separate her from Naomi &#8211; because they will be buried next to one another (e.g., NRSV, NCV; see E. F. Campbell, <i>Ruth </i>[AB], 74-75). However, for the statement to mean, &#8220;Not even death will separate me and you,&#8221; it would probably need to be introduced by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>, &#8220;if&#8221;) or negated by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;, &#8220;not&#8221;; see F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth,</i> <i>Esther</i> [WBC], 83). (2) Nothing except death will separate her from Naomi (e.g., KJV, ASV, RSV, NASB, NIV, TEV, NJPS, REB, NLT, GW; see Bush, 83). The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> introduces the content of the vow, which &#8211; if violated &#8211; would bring about the curse uttered in the preceding oath (BDB<i> </i>472 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 1.c; e.g., Gen 42:16; Num 14:22; 1 Sam 20:3; 26:16; 29:6; 2 Sam 3:35; 1 Kgs 2:23; Isa 49:18). Some suggest that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;</font> is functioning as an asseverative (&#8220;indeed, certainly&#8221;) to express what the speaker is determined <i>will</i> happen (Bush, 83; see 1 Sam 14:44; 2 Sam 3:9; 1 Kgs 2:23; 19:2). Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> probably functions in a conditional sense: &#8220;if&#8221; or &#8220;if&#8230;except, unless&#8221; (BDB<i> </i>473 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew"> &#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font>2.b). So her vow may essentially mean &#8220;if anything except death should separate me from you!&#8221; The most likely view is (2): Ruth is swearing that death alone will separate her from Naomi.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Ruth&#8217;s devotion to Naomi is especially apparent here. Instead of receiving a sure blessing and going home (see v. 8), Ruth instead takes on a serious responsibility and subjects herself to potential divine punishment. Death, a power beyond Ruth&#8217;s control, <i>will separate</i> the two women, but until that time Ruth will stay by Naomi&#8217;s side and she will even be buried in the same place as Naomi.</p>
