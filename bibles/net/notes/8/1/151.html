In this formula the exact curse is understood but not expressed (GKC 472 §149.<i>d</i>; BDB 462 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;</font> 1.b). In ancient Near Eastern imprecations, when the curse was so extreme, it was not uttered because it was unspeakably awful: &#8220;In the twelve uses of this formula, the calamity which the speaker invokes is never named, since OT culture (in keeping with the rest of the ancient Near East) accorded such power to the spoken word&#8221; (F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth,</i> <i>Esther</i> [WBC], 82). Ruth here pronounces a curse upon herself, elevating the preceding promise to a formal, unconditional level. If she is not faithful to her promise, she agrees to become an object of divine judgment. As in other occurrences of this oath/curse formula, the specific punishment is not mentioned. As Bush explains, the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) here is probably asseverative (&#8220;indeed, certainly&#8221;) and the statement that follows expresses what underscores the seriousness of her promise by invoking divine judgment, as it were, if she does otherwise. Of course, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> would not have been obligated to judge her if she had abandoned Naomi &#8211; this is simply an ancient idiomatic way of expressing her commitment to her promise.</p>
