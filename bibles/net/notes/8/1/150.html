<a name="150"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=50><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;do not urge me to abandon you to turn back from after you.&#8221; Most English versions, following the lead of the KJV, use &#8220;leave&#8221; here. The use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1494;&#1489;</font> (&#8220;abandon&#8221;) reflects Ruth&#8217;s perspective. To return to Moab would be to abandon Naomi and to leave her even more vulnerable than she already is.</p>
