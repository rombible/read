<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3><b>sn</b> The name <i>Bethlehem</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514; &#1500;&#1462;&#1495;&#1462;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bet lekhem</font>) is from &#8220;house, place&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;</font>) and &#8220;bread, food&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1462;&#1495;&#1462;&#1501;</font>), so the name literally means &#8220;House of Bread&#8221; or &#8220;Place of Food.&#8221; Perhaps there is irony here: One would not expect a severe famine in such a location. This would not necessarily indicate that Bethlehem was under divine discipline, but merely that the famine was very severe, explaining the reason for the family&#8217;s departure.</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map7-E2; Map8-E2; Map10-B4.</p>
