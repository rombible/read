<a name="140"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=40><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;No, my daughters.&#8221; Naomi is not answering the rhetorical questions she has just asked. In light of the explanatory clause that follows, it seems more likely that she is urging them to give up the idea of returning with her. In other words, the words &#8220;no, my daughters&#8221; complement the earlier exhortation to &#8220;go back.&#8221; To clarify this, the words &#8220;you must not return with me&#8221; are added in the translation.</p>
