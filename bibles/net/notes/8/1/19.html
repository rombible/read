W. Bush, <i>Ruth,</i> <i>Esther</i> (WBC), 64. The designation &#8220;Ephrathites&#8221; might indicate that they were residents of Ephrathah. However, the adjectival form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1508;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ephratim</font>, &#8220;Ephrathites&#8221;) used here elsewhere refers to someone from the clan of Ephrath (cf. 1 Chr 4:4) which lived in the region of Bethlehem: &#8220;Now David was the son of an Ephrathite from Bethlehem in Judah whose name was Jesse&#8221; (1 Sam 17:12; cf. Mic 5:2 [MT 5:1]). So it is more likely that the virtually identical expression here &#8211; &#8220;Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah&#8221; &#8211; refers to the clan of Ephrath in Bethlehem (see R. L. Hubbard, Jr., <i>Ruth </i>[NICOT], 91).</p>
