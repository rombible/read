<a name="126"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=26><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;devotion as you have done with the dead and with me.&#8221; The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khesed</font>, &#8220;devotion&#8221;) is a key thematic term in the book of Ruth (see 2:20; 3:10). G. R. Clark suggests that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1491;</font> &#8220;is not merely an attitude or an emotion; it is an emotion that leads to an activity beneficial to the recipient&#8221;; an act of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1491;</font> is &#8220;a beneficent action performed, in the context of a deep and enduring commitment between two persons or parties, by one who is able to render assistance to the needy party who in the circumstances is unable to help him &#8211; or herself&#8221; (<i>The Word Hesed in the Hebrew Bible </i>[JSOTSup], 267). <i>HALOT</i> 336-37 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1491;</font> defines the word as &#8220;loyalty&#8221; or &#8220;faithfulness.&#8221; Other appropriate glosses might be &#8220;commitment&#8221; and &#8220;devotion.&#8221;</p>
