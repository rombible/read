The word order is conjunction + subject + verb, highlighting the contrast between the actions of Orpah and Ruth. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Orpah</i> is a literary foil for Ruth. Orpah is a commendable and devoted person (see v. 8); after all she is willing to follow Naomi back to Judah. However, when Naomi bombards her with good reasons why she should return, she relents. But Ruth is special. Despite Naomi&#8217;s bitter tirade, she insists on staying. Orpah is a good person, but Ruth is beyond good &#8211; she possesses an extra measure of devotion and sacrificial love that is uncommon. </p>
