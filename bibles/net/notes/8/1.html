<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the days of the judging of the judges.&#8221; The LXX simply reads &#8220;when the judges judged,&#8221; and Syriac has &#8220;in the days of the judges.&#8221; Cf. NASB &#8220;in the days when the judges governed (ruled NRSV).&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Many interpreters, reading this statement in the light of the Book of Judges which describes a morally corrupt period, assume that the narrator is painting a dark backdrop against which Ruth&#8217;s exemplary character and actions will shine even more brightly. However, others read this statement in the light of the book&#8217;s concluding epilogue which traces the full significance of the story to the time of David, the chosen king of Judah (4:18-22).</p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the land.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;of Judah&#8221; is supplied in the translation to clarify the referent.</p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3><b>sn</b> The name <i>Bethlehem</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514; &#1500;&#1462;&#1495;&#1462;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bet lekhem</font>) is from &#8220;house, place&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;</font>) and &#8220;bread, food&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1462;&#1495;&#1462;&#1501;</font>), so the name literally means &#8220;House of Bread&#8221; or &#8220;Place of Food.&#8221; Perhaps there is irony here: One would not expect a severe famine in such a location. This would not necessarily indicate that Bethlehem was under divine discipline, but merely that the famine was very severe, explaining the reason for the family&#8217;s departure.</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map7-E2; Map8-E2; Map10-B4.</p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;to live temporarily.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gur</font>, &#8220;sojourn&#8221;) may refer to (1) temporary dwelling in a location (Deut 18:6; Judg 17:7) or (2) permanent dwelling in a location (Judg 5:17; Ps 33:8). When used of a foreign land, it can refer to (1) temporary dwelling as a visiting foreigner (Gen 12:10; 20:1; 21:34; 2 Kgs 8:1-2; Jer 44:14) or (2) permanent dwelling as a resident foreigner (Gen 47:4; Exod 6:4; Num 15:14; Deut 26:5; 2 Sam 4:3; Jer 49:18,33; 50:40; Ezek 47:22-23). Although Naomi eventually returned to Judah, there is some ambiguity whether or not Elimelech intended the move to make them permanent resident foreigners. Cf. NASB &#8220;to sojourn&#8221; and NIV &#8220;to live for a while,&#8221; both of which imply the move was temporary, while &#8220;to live&#8221; (NCV, NRSV, NLT) is more neutral about the permanence of the relocation.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Some interpreters view Elimelech&#8217;s departure from Judah to sojourn in Moab as lack of faith in the covenant God of Israel to provide for his family&#8217;s needs in the land of promise; therefore his death is consequently viewed as divine judgment. Others note that God never prohibited his people from seeking food in a foreign land during times of famine but actually sent his people to a foreign land during a famine in Canaan on at least one occasion as an act of deliverance (Gen 37-50). In this case, Elimelech&#8217;s sojourn to Moab was an understandable act by a man concerned for the survival of his family, perhaps even under divine approval, so their death in Moab was simply a tragedy, a bad thing that happened to a godly person.</p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he and his wife and his two sons.&#8221; The LXX omits &#8220;two.&#8221;</p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=6><b>sn</b> The name &#8220;Elimelech&#8221; literally means &#8220;My God [is] king.&#8221; The narrator&#8217;s explicit identification of his name seems to cast him in a positive light.</p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=7><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the name of his wife [was] Naomi.&#8221; This has been simplified in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The name Naomi (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1506;&#1459;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">na</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">omi</font>) is from the adjective <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1465;&#1506;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">noam</font>, &#8220;pleasant, lovely&#8221;) and literally means &#8220;my pleasant one&#8221; or &#8220;my lovely one.&#8221; Her name will become the subject of a wordplay in 1:20-21 when she laments that she is no longer &#8220;pleasant&#8221; but &#8220;bitter&#8221; because of the loss of her husband and two sons.</p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=8><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the name[s] of his two sons [were] Mahlon and Kilion.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The name Mahlon (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">makhlon</font>) is from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">malah</font>, &#8220;to be weak, sick&#8221;) and Kilion (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1460;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khilyon</font>) is from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khalah</font>, &#8220;to be frail&#8221;). The rate of infant mortality was so high during the Iron Age that parents typically did not name children until they survived infancy and were weaned. Naomi and Elimelech might have named their two sons Mahlon and Kilion to reflect their weak condition in infancy due to famine &#8211; which eventually prompted the move to Moab where food was abundant.</p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=9><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[They were] Ephrathites.&#8221; Ephrathah is a small village (Ps 132:6) in the vicinity of Bethlehem (Gen 35:16), so close in proximity that it is often identified with the larger town of Bethlehem (Gen 35:19; 48:7; Ruth 4:11; Mic 5:2 [MT 5:1]; <i>HALOT </i>81 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1508;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1492;</font>); see F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth,</i> <i>Esther</i> (WBC), 64. The designation &#8220;Ephrathites&#8221; might indicate that they were residents of Ephrathah. However, the adjectival form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1508;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ephratim</font>, &#8220;Ephrathites&#8221;) used here elsewhere refers to someone from the clan of Ephrath (cf. 1 Chr 4:4) which lived in the region of Bethlehem: &#8220;Now David was the son of an Ephrathite from Bethlehem in Judah whose name was Jesse&#8221; (1 Sam 17:12; cf. Mic 5:2 [MT 5:1]). So it is more likely that the virtually identical expression here &#8211; &#8220;Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah&#8221; &#8211; refers to the clan of Ephrath in Bethlehem (see R. L. Hubbard, Jr., <i>Ruth </i>[NICOT], 91).</p>

Qal.3.d; 2 Chr 11:21; 13:21; 24:3; Ezra 9:2,12; 10:44; Neh 13:25).</p>

The name Ruth (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">rut</font>) is from the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ut</font>, &#8220;friendship&#8221;), derived from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1461;&#1506;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rea</font>&#8217;, &#8220;friend, companion&#8221;). Ironically, Orpah will eventually turn her back on Naomi, while Ruth will display extraordinary friendship as her life-long companion (see 1:14). Since they seem to mirror the most definitive action of these women, perhaps they designate character types (as is the case with the name <i>Mara</i> in 1:21 and <i>Peloni Almoni</i> in 4:2) rather than their original birth names. </p>
<a name="115"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=15><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the two of them also died, Mahlon and Kilion.&#8221;</p>

By shifting to this word from the more common term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ben</font>, &#8220;son&#8221;; see vv. 1-5a) and then using it in an unusual manner, the author draws attention to Naomi&#8217;s loss and sets up a verbal link with the story&#8217;s conclusion (cf. 4:16). Although grown men, they were still her &#8220;babies&#8221; (see E. F. Campbell, <i>Ruth </i>[AB], 56; F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth,</i> <i>Esther</i> [WBC], 66).</p>

F. Williams, <i>NIDOTTE </i>3:658), so it sometimes appears with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zakhar</font>, &#8220;to remember&#8221;; Pss 8:4 [MT 5]; 106:4; Jer 14:10; 15:15; Hos 8:13; 9:9) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>, &#8220;to see&#8221;; Exod 4:31; Ps 80:14 [MT 15]; <i>NIDOTTE </i>3:659). It often emphasizes the cause/effect response to what is seen (<i>NIDOTTE </i>3:659). When God observes people in need, it is glossed &#8220;be concerned about, care for, attend to, help&#8221; (Gen 21:1; 50:24, 25; Exod 4:31; Ruth 1:6; 1 Sam 2:21; Jer 15:15; Zeph 2:7; Zech 10:3b; <i>NIDOTTE </i>3:661). When humans are the subject, it sometimes means &#8220;to visit&#8221; needy people to bestow a gift (Judg 15:1; 1 Sam 17:18). Because it has such a broad range of meanings, its use here has been translated variously: (1) &#8220;had visited&#8221; (KJV, ASV, NASV, RSV; so BDB 823-24 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font>); (2) &#8220;had considered&#8221; (NRSV) and &#8220;had taken note of&#8221; (TNK; so <i>HALOT </i>955-57 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1511;&#1491;</font>); and (3) &#8220;had come to the aid of&#8221; (NIV), &#8220;had blessed&#8221; (TEV), and &#8220;had given&#8221; (CEV; so <i>NIDOTTE </i>3:657). When God observed the plight of his people, he demonstrated his concern by benevolently giving them food.</p>

G. R.

NRSV, NAB, NCV, CEV margin). Although Naomi and her daughters-in-law had reason for emotional grief, the issue at hand was Naomi&#8217;s lamentable situation, which she did not want them to experience: being a poor widow in a foreign land.</p>

It has been taken in three different ways: (1) &#8220;For I am very bitter for me because of you,&#8221; that is, because of your widowed condition (cf. KJV, NKJV, ASV, RSV, NJB, REB, JB, TEV). This does not fit well, however, with the following statement (&#8220;for the LORD has attacked me&#8221;) nor with the preceding statement (&#8220;You must not return with me&#8221;). (2) &#8220;For I am far more bitter than for you&#8221; (cf. NASB, NIV, NJPS, NEB, CEV, NLT). This does not provide an adequate basis, however, for the preceding statement (&#8220;You must not return with me&#8221;). (3) &#8220;For my bitterness is too much for you [to bear]&#8221; (cf. NAB, NRSV, NCV, CEV margin). This is preferable because it fits well with both the preceding and following statements. These three options reflect the three ways the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1503;</font> may be taken here: (1) causal: &#8220;because of, on account of&#8221; (BDB<i> </i>580 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> 2.f; <i>HALOT </i>598 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> 6), not that Orpah and Ruth were the cause of her calamity, but that Naomi was grieved because they had become widows; (2) comparative: &#8220;more [bitter] than you&#8221; (BDB<i> </i>581 s.v. 6.a; <i>HALOT </i>598 s.v. 5b), meaning that Naomi&#8217;s situation was more grievous than theirs &#8211; while they could remarry, her prospects were much more bleak; and (3) elative, describing a situation that is too much for a person to bear: &#8220;too [bitter] for you&#8221; (BDB<i> </i>581 s.v. 6.d; <i>HALOT </i>598 s.v. 5a; <i>IBHS</i> 267 §14.4f; e.g., Gen 4:13; Exod 18:18; Deut 17:8; 1 Kgs 19:17), meaning that Naomi&#8217;s plight was too bitter for her daughters-in-law to share. While all three options are viable, the meaning adopted must fit two criteria: (1) The meaning of this clause (1:13b) must provide the grounds for Naomi&#8217;s emphatic rejection of the young women&#8217;s refusal to separate themselves from her (1:13a); and (2) it must fit the following clause: &#8220;for the hand of the LORD has gone out against me&#8221; (1:13c). The first and second options do not provide adequate reasons for sending her daughters-in-law back home, nor do they fit her lament that the LORD had attached her (not them); however, the third option (elative sense) fits both criteria. Naomi did not want her daughters-in-law to share her sad situation, that is, to be poor, childless widows in a foreign land with no prospect for marriage. If they accompanied her back to Judah, they would be in the same kind of situation in which she found herself in Moab. If they were to find the &#8220;rest&#8221; (security of home and husband) she wished for them, it would be in Moab, not in Judah. The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> had already deprived her of husband and sons. She could do nothing for them in this regard because she had no more sons to give them as husbands, and she was past the age of child-bearing to raise up new husbands for them in the future &#8211; as if they could wait that long anyway (1:13a). For a discussion of these three options and defense of the approach adopted here, see F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth,</i> <i>Esther</i> (WBC), 80-81.</p>

In ancient Near Eastern imprecations, when the curse was so extreme, it was not uttered because it was unspeakably awful: &#8220;In the twelve uses of this formula, the calamity which the speaker invokes is never named, since OT culture (in keeping with the rest of the ancient Near East) accorded such power to the spoken word&#8221; (F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth,</i> <i>Esther</i> [WBC], 82). Ruth here pronounces a curse upon herself, elevating the preceding promise to a formal, unconditional level. If she is not faithful to her promise, she agrees to become an object of divine judgment. As in other occurrences of this oath/curse formula, the specific punishment is not mentioned. As Bush explains, the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) here is probably asseverative (&#8220;indeed, certainly&#8221;) and the statement that follows expresses what underscores the seriousness of her promise by invoking divine judgment, as it were, if she does otherwise.

However, for the statement to mean, &#8220;Not even death will separate me and you,&#8221; it would probably need to be introduced by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>, &#8220;if&#8221;) or negated by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;, &#8220;not&#8221;; see F.

The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> introduces the content of the vow, which &#8211; if violated &#8211; would bring about the curse uttered in the preceding oath (BDB<i> </i>472 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 1.c; e.g., Gen 42:16; Num 14:22; 1 Sam 20:3; 26:16; 29:6; 2 Sam 3:35; 1 Kgs 2:23; Isa 49:18).

It may be derived from: (1) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shadad</font>, &#8220;to be strong&#8221;), cognate to Arabic <font face="Scholar">sdd</font>, meaning &#8220;The Strong One&#8221; or &#8220;Almighty&#8221;; (2) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shadah</font>, &#8220;mountain&#8221;), cognate to Akkadian <i>shadu</i>, meaning &#8220;The Mountain Dweller&#8221; or &#8220;God of the Mountains&#8221;; (3) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shadad</font>, &#8220;to devastate&#8221;) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shad</font>, &#8220;destroyer&#8221;), Akkadian <font face="Scholar">Shedum</font>, meaning &#8220;The Destroyer&#8221; or &#8220;The Malevolent One&#8221;; or (4) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;</font> (<font face="Scholar">she</font>, &#8220;who&#8221;) plus <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">diy</font>, &#8220;sufficient&#8221;), meaning &#8220;The One Who is Sufficient&#8221; or &#8220;All-Sufficient One&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 1420-22 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1497;</font>). In terms of use, Shaddai (or El Shaddai) is presented as the <i>sovereign</i> king/judge of the world who grants life/blesses and kills/judges. In Genesis he blesses the patriarchs with fertility and promises numerous descendants. Outside Genesis he blesses/protects and also takes away life/happiness. In light of Naomi&#8217;s emphasis on God&#8217;s sovereign, malevolent deprivation of her family, one can understand her use of this name for God. For discussion of this divine name, see T. N. D. Mettinger, <i>In Search of God</i>, 69-72. </p>
