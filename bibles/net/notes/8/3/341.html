<A NAME="341"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=208><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;everything which you are saying I will do for you.&#8221; The Hebrew word order emphasizes Boaz&#8217;s intention to fulfill Ruth&#8217;s request. As in v. 5, the Hebrew imperfect is used (note &#8220;you are saying&#8221;), even though Ruth&#8217;s request appears to be concluded. According to GKC 316 §107.<i>h</i>, the imperfect can sometimes &#8220;express actions, etc., which although, strictly speaking, they are already finished, are regarded as still lasting on into the present time, or continuing to operate in it.&#8221; The imperfect <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1506;&#1457;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">e</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eseh</font>) could be translated &#8220;I will do&#8221; (so NAB, NIV, NRSV, NLT), but since there are legal complications which must first be resolved, it is better to take the form as indicating Boaz&#8217;s desire or intention, if the legal matters can be worked out.</p>
