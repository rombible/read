<A NAME="332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=199><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and spread your wing [or skirt] over your servant.&#8221; Many medieval Hebrew <sc>mss have the plural/dual &#8220;your wings&#8221; rather than the singular &#8220;your wing, skirt.&#8221; The latter is more likely here in the context of Ruth&#8217;s marriage proposal. In the metaphorical account in Ezek 16:8, God spreads his skirt over naked Jerusalem as an act of protection and as a precursor to marriage. Thus Ruth&#8217;s words can be taken, in effect, as a marriage proposal (and are so translated here; cf. TEV &#8220;So please marry me&#8221;). See F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth,</i> <i>Esther</i> (WBC), 164-65.</p>
