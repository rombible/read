NIV &#8220;a kinsman-redeemer&#8221;; NLT &#8220;my family redeemer&#8221;). In this context Boaz, as a &#8220;redeemer,&#8221; functions as a guardian of the family interests who has responsibility for caring for the widows of his deceased kinsmen. For a discussion of the legal background, see F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth,</i> <i>Esther</i> (WBC), 166-69.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> By proposing marriage, Ruth goes beyond the letter of Naomi&#8217;s instructions (see v. 4, where Naomi told Ruth that Boaz would tell her what to do). Though she is more aggressive than Naomi told her to be, she is still carrying out the intent of Naomi&#8217;s instructions, which were designed to lead to marriage.</p>
