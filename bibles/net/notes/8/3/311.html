<A NAME="311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=178><b>tn</b> Some define the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">margÿlot</font>) as &#8220;the place for the feet&#8221; (see <i>HALOT</i> 631 s.v.; cf. KJV, NASB, NIV, NRSV, NLT), but in Dan 10:6 the word refers to the legs, or &#8220;region of the legs.&#8221; For this reason &#8220;legs&#8221; or &#8220;lower body&#8221; is the preferred translation (see F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth,</i> <i>Esther</i> [WBC], 152). Because &#8220;foot&#8221; is sometimes used euphemistically for the genitals, some feel that Ruth uncovered Boaz&#8217;s genitals. For a critique of this view see Bush, 153. While Ruth and Boaz did not actually have a sexual encounter at the threshing floor, there is no doubt that Ruth&#8217;s actions are symbolic and constitute a marriage proposal.</p>
