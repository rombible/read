<A NAME="335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=202><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my daughter.&#8221; This form of address is a mild form of endearment, perhaps merely rhetorical. A few English versions omit it entirely (e.g., TEV, CEV). The same expression occurs in v. 11.</p>
