<A NAME="331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=198><b>tn</b> Here Ruth uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amah</font>), a more elevated term for a female servant than <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shifkhah</font>), the word used in 2:13. In Ruth 2, where Ruth has just arrived from Moab and is very much aware of her position as a foreigner (v. 10), she acknowledges Boaz&#8217;s kindness and emphasizes her own humility by using the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, though she admits that she does not even occupy that lowly position on the social scale. However, here in chap. 3, where Naomi sends her to Boaz to seek marriage, she uses the more elevated term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> to describe herself because she is now aware of Boaz&#8217;s responsibility as a close relative of her deceased husband and she wants to challenge him to fulfill his obligation. In her new social context she is dependent on Boaz (hence the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font>), but she is no mere <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font>.</p>
