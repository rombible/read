<A NAME="254"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=131><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I am finding favor in your eyes.&#8221; In v. 10, where Ruth uses the perfect, she simply states the fact that Boaz is kind. Here the Hebrew text switches to the imperfect, thus emphasizing the ongoing attitude of kindness displayed by Boaz. Many English versions treat this as a request: KJV &#8220;Let me find favour in thy sight&#8221;; NAB &#8220;May I prove worthy of your kindness&#8221;; NIV &#8220;May I continue to find favor in your eyes.&#8221;</p>
