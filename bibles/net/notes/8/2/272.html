<A NAME="272"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=149><b>tc</b> MT vocalizes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1514;&#1512;&#1488;</font> as the Qal verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;&#1462;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vattere</font>&#8217;, &#8220;and she saw&#8221;), consequently of &#8220;her mother-in-law&#8221; as subject and &#8220;what she gathered&#8221; as the direct object: &#8220;her mother-in-law saw what she gathered.&#8221; A few medieval Hebrew <sc>mss (also reflected in Syriac and Vulgate) have the Hiphil <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vattar</font>&#8217;, &#8220;and she showed&#8221;), consequently taking &#8220;her mother-in-law&#8221; as the direct object and &#8220;what she gathered&#8221; as the double direct-object: &#8220;she showed her mother-in-law what she had gathered&#8221; (cf. NAB, TEV, CEV, NLT). Although the latter has the advantage of making Ruth the subject of all the verbs in this verse, it would be syntactically difficult. For one would expect the accusative sign <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et</font>) before &#8220;her mother-in-law&#8221; if it were the direct object of a Hiphil verb in a sentence with a double direct object introduced by the accusative sign <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;</font>, e.g., &#8220;to show (Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>) your servant (direct object marked by accusative sign <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;</font>) your greatness (double direct object marked by accusative sign <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;</font>) (Deut 3:24). Therefore the MT reading is preferred.</p>
