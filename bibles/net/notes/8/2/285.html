<A NAME="285"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">85</span><note=162><b>tn</b> Naomi uses the feminine form of the word &#8220;servant&#8221; (as Boaz did earlier, see v. 8), in contrast to Ruth&#8217;s use of the masculine form in the preceding verse. Since she is concerned for Ruth&#8217;s safety, she may be subtly reminding Ruth to stay with the female workers and not get too close to the men.</p>
