<A NAME="290"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">90</span><note=167><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and she lived with her mother-in-law&#8221; (so NASB). Some interpret this to mean that she lived with her mother-in-law while working in the harvest. In other words, she worked by day and then came home to Naomi each evening. Others understand this to mean that following the harvest she stayed at home each day with Naomi and no longer went out looking for work (see F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth,</i> <i>Esther</i> [WBC], 140). Others even propose that she lived away from home during this period, but this seems unlikely. A few Hebrew <sc>mss (so also Latin Vulgate) support this view by reading, &#8220;and she returned to her mother-in-law.&#8221;</p>
