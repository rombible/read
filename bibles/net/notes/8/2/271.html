<A NAME="271"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=148><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;there was an ephah.&#8221; An ephah was a dry measure, equivalent to one-tenth of a homer (see <i>HALOT</i> 43 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1508;&#1464;&#1492;</font>). An ephah was equivalent to a &#8220;bath,&#8221; a liquid measure. Jars labeled &#8220;bath&#8221; found at archaeological sites in Israel could contain approximately 5.8 gallons, or one-half to two-thirds of a bushel. Thus an ephah of barley would have weighed about 29 to 30 pounds (just over 13 kg). See R. L. Hubbard, Jr., <i>Ruth </i>(NICOT), 179.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This was a huge amount of barley for one woman to gather in a single day. It testifies both to Ruth&#8217;s industry and to Boaz&#8217;s generosity.</p>
