<A NAME="228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=105><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my daughter.&#8221; This form of address is a mild form of endearment, perhaps merely rhetorical. It might suggest that Boaz is older than Ruth, but not necessarily significantly so. A few English versions omit it entirely (e.g., TEV, CEV).</p>
