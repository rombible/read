Here it emphasizes either the clarity of the report or its completeness. See R. L. Hubbard, Jr., <i>Ruth </i>(NICOT), 153, n. 6. Most English versions tend toward the nuance of completeness (e.g., KJV &#8220;fully been shewed&#8221;; NAB &#8220;a complete account&#8221;; NASB, NRSV &#8220;All that you have done&#8221;).</p>
