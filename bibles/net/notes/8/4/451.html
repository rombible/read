<A NAME="451"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=285><b>sn</b> The theological message of the Book of Ruth may be summarized as follows: God cares for needy people like Naomi and Ruth; he is their ally in this chaotic world. He richly rewards people like Ruth and Boaz who demonstrate sacrificial love and in so doing become his instruments in helping the needy. God&#8217;s rewards for those who sacrificially love others sometimes exceed their wildest imagination and transcend their lifetime.</p>
