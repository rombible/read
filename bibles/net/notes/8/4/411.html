<A NAME="411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=245><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;before those sitting here and before the leaders of my people&#8221; appears to refer to the leaders who were specially chosen as witnesses (v. 2) and the larger group of community leaders standing by. It is possible, however, that the phrases &#8220;before those sitting here&#8221; and &#8220;before the leaders of my people&#8221; are appositional and that both refer to the ten leaders mentioned in v. 2 (cf. NLT &#8220;in the presence of these witnesses&#8221;).</p>
