<A NAME="49"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=243><b>tn</b> The perfect form of the verb here describes as a simple fact an action that is underway (cf. NIV, NRSV, CEV, NLT); NAB &#8220;is putting up for sale.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Naomi&#8230;is selling</i>. The nature of the sale is uncertain. Naomi may have been selling the property rights to the land, but this seems unlikely in light of what is known about ancient Israelite property laws. It is more likely that Naomi, being a woman, held only the right to use the land until the time of her remarriage or death (F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth,</i> <i>Esther</i> [WBC], 202-4). Because she held this right to use of the land, she also had the right to buy it back from the its current owner. (This assumes that Elimelech sold the land prior to going to Moab.) Since she did not possess the means to do so, however, she decided to dispose of her rights in the matter. She was not selling the land per se, but disposing of the right to its redemption and use, probably in exchange for room and board with the purchaser (Bush, 211-15). If this is correct, it might be preferable to translate, &#8220;Naomi is disposing of her rights to the portion of land,&#8221; although such a translation presumes some knowledge of ancient Israelite property laws.</p>
