<A NAME="424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=258><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;redeem for yourself, you, my right of redemption for I am unable to redeem.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Here it appears that the acquisition of Ruth along with the land was an obligatory package deal (&#8220;When you acquire the field from Naomi, you <i>must also</i> acquire Ruth&#8230;&#8221;). On the other hand, Boaz viewed marriage to Ruth as voluntary in 3:13 (&#8220;If he does not <i>want</i> to redeem you, I will redeem you&#8221;), and presented the acquisition of the field as voluntary in 4:4 (&#8220;If you <i>want </i>to exercise your right&#8230;but if not, tell me!&#8221;). Initially, Boaz makes the transaction appear to be a mere land deal in 4:4. When the nearest relative jumped at the land offer, Boaz confronted him with the attendant social/family obligation of marrying Ruth to raise up an heir for the deceased to inherit this very land. By conducting the transaction in public where the close relative would need to save face, Boaz forced him either to reject the offer entirely or to include Ruth in the deal &#8211; but he could not take the land and reject Ruth. Either way, Ruth would be cared for and Elimelech&#8217;s line continued. But if he took Ruth, the acquisition of the land would be more economically burdensome than beneficial, so he yielded his purchase option to Boaz. For discussion, see F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth,</i> <i>Esther</i> (WBC), 229-33. </p>
