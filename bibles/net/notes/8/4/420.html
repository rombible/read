<A NAME="420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=254><b>tc</b> The MT (<i>Kethib</i>) reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qaniti</font>, &#8220;I acquire,&#8221; Qal perfect 1st person common singular): &#8220;When you acquire the field from the hand of Naomi, <i>I acquire</i> Ruth the Moabitess&#8230;&#8221; However, the marginal reading (<i>Qere</i>) is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qanitah</font>, &#8220;you acquire,&#8221; Qal perfect 2nd person masculine singular, reflected in 2nd person masculine singular forms in Greek, Latin, Aramaic, and Syriac): &#8220;When you acquire the field from the hand of Naomi, <i>you </i>must also<i> acquire</i> Ruth the Moabitess&#8230;&#8221; The <i>Qere</i> is probably original because the <i>Kethib</i> is too difficult syntactically and contextually, while the <i>Qere</i> makes perfect sense: (1) Boaz stated in 3:13 that the nearest kinsman had the first right to acquire Ruth if he wanted to do so, and only the <i>Qere</i> reading here presents him with that option; and (2) Boaz announces in 4:9-10 that he was acquiring the field and Ruth as a package deal in 4:9-10, and only the <i>Qere</i> reading here presents the nearest kinsman with the same package deal. The <i>Kethib</i> probably arose by a scribe trying to harmonize 4:5 with the 1st person common singular form in 4:9-10 without fully understanding the ploy of Boaz in 4:5. See F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth,</i> <i>Esther</i> (WBC), 216-17.</p>
