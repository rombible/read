<A NAME="45"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=239><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;a certain one&#8221;; KJV, ASV &#8220;such a one.&#8221; The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497; &#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pÿloni </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">almoni</font>) is not the name of the nearest relative, but an idiom which literally means &#8220;such and such&#8221; or &#8220;a certain one&#8221; (BDB 811-12 s.v. <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font></i>), which is used when one wishes to be ambiguous (1 Sam 21:3; 2 Kgs 6:8). Certainly Boaz would have known his relative&#8217;s name, especially in such a small village, and would have uttered his actual name. However the narrator refuses to record his name in a form of poetic justice because he refused to preserve Mahlon&#8217;s &#8220;name&#8221; (lineage) by marrying his widow (see 4:5, 9-10). This close relative, who is a literary foil for Boaz, refuses to fulfill the role of family guardian. Because he does nothing memorable, he remains anonymous in a chapter otherwise filled with names. His anonymity contrasts sharply with Boaz&#8217;s prominence in the story and the fame he attains through the child born to Ruth. Because the actual name of this relative is not recorded, the translation of this expression is difficult since contemporary English style expects either a name or title. This is usually supplied in modern translations: &#8220;friend&#8221; (NASB, NIV, RSV, NRSV, NLT), &#8220;so-and-so&#8221; (JPS, NJPS). Perhaps &#8220;Mr. So-And-So!&#8221; or &#8220;Mr. No-Name!&#8221; makes the point. For discussion see Adele Berlin, <i>Poetics and Interpretation of Biblical Narrative</i>, 99-101; R. L. Hubbard, Jr., <i>Ruth </i>(NICOT), 233-35; F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth,</i> <i>Esther</i> (WBC), 196-97. In the present translation &#8220;John Doe&#8221; is used since it is a standard designation for someone who is a party to legal proceedings whose true name is unknown.</p>
