The grain would be thrown into the air, allowing the wind to separate the kernels (see O. Borowski, <i>Agriculture in Iron Age Israel</i>, 65-66). The threshing floor itself was usually located outside town in a place where the prevailing west wind could be used to advantage (Borowski, 62-63).</p>

L. Hubbard, Jr., <i>Ruth </i>[NICOT], 197, n. 7) or a long outer garment (see F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth,</i> <i>Esther</i> [WBC], 150-51). Mourners often wore mourning clothes and refrained from washing or using cosmetics (Gen 38:14, 19; 2 Sam 12:20; 14:2), so Ruth&#8217;s attire and appearance would signal that her period of mourning was over and she was now available for remarriage (see Bush, 152).</p>

KJV, NASB, NIV, NRSV, NLT), but in Dan 10:6 the word refers to the legs, or &#8220;region of the legs.&#8221; For this reason &#8220;legs&#8221; or &#8220;lower body&#8221; is the preferred translation (see F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth,</i> <i>Esther</i> [WBC], 152). Because &#8220;foot&#8221; is sometimes used euphemistically for the genitals, some feel that Ruth uncovered Boaz&#8217;s genitals. For a critique of this view see Bush, 153. While Ruth and Boaz did not actually have a sexual encounter at the threshing floor, there is no doubt that Ruth&#8217;s actions are symbolic and constitute a marriage proposal.</p>
<A NAME="312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=179><b>tc</b> The consonantal text (<i>Kethib</i>) has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1489;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿshakhavtiy</font>, &#8220;then <i>I</i> will lie down&#8221;; Qal perfect 1st person common singular), while the marginal reading (<i>Qere</i>) is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1489;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿshakhavt</font>, &#8220;then <i>you</i> lie down&#8221;; Qal perfect 2nd person feminine singular) which makes more sense. It is possible that the <i>Kethib</i> preserves an archaic spelling of the 2nd person feminine singular form (see F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth,</i> <i>Esther</i> [WBC], 144-45).</p>
<A NAME="313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=180><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;beside him&#8221; are supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons; cf. NLT &#8220;lie down there.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=181><b>tn</b> The disjunctive clause structure (<i>vav</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>] + subject + verb) highlights this final word of instruction or signals the conclusion of the instructions.</p>

<A NAME="316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=183><b>tn</b> The Hebrew imperfect is used, even though Naomi&#8217;s instructions appear to be concluded. The imperfect can sometimes express actions which although (strictly speaking) are already finished, yet are regarded as still lasting into the present, or continuing to operate in it (GKC 316 §107.<i>h</i>).</p>
<A NAME="317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=184><b>tc</b> The MT (<i>Kethib</i>) lacks the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1463;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elay</font>, &#8220;to me&#8221;) which is attested in the marginal reading (<i>Qere</i>). Many medieval Hebrew <sc>mss agree with the marginal reading (<i>Qere</i>) by including the phrase.</p>
<A NAME="318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=185><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;everything which you are saying I will do.&#8221; The Hebrew word order emphasizes Ruth&#8217;s intention to follow Naomi&#8217;s instructions to the letter. </p>

Here the verb seems to carry the meaning &#8220;bend, twist, turn,&#8221; like its Arabic cognate (see <i>HALOT</i> 533 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1508;&#1514;</font>, and F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth,</i> <i>Esther</i> [WBC], 163).</p>
<A NAME="327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=194><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and behold&#8221; (so KJV, NASB). The narrator invites the reader to view the situation through Boaz&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<A NAME="328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=195><b>sn</b> <i>Now he saw a woman</i>. The narrator writes from Boaz&#8217;s perspective. Both the narrator and the reader know the night visitor is Ruth, but from Boaz&#8217;s perspective she is simply &#8220;a woman.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=196><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[at] his legs.&#8221; See the note on the word &#8220;legs&#8221; in v. 4.</p>
<A NAME="330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=197><b>tn</b> When Boaz speaks, he uses the feminine form of the pronoun, indicating that he knows she is a woman.</p>
<A NAME="331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=198><b>tn</b> Here Ruth uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amah</font>), a more elevated term for a female servant than <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shifkhah</font>), the word used in 2:13. In Ruth 2, where Ruth has just arrived from Moab and is very much aware of her position as a foreigner (v. 10), she acknowledges Boaz&#8217;s kindness and emphasizes her own humility by using the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, though she admits that she does not even occupy that lowly position on the social scale. However, here in chap. 3, where Naomi sends her to Boaz to seek marriage, she uses the more elevated term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> to describe herself because she is now aware of Boaz&#8217;s responsibility as a close relative of her deceased husband and she wants to challenge him to fulfill his obligation. In her new social context she is dependent on Boaz (hence the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font>), but she is no mere <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font>.</p>
<A NAME="332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=199><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and spread your wing [or skirt] over your servant.&#8221; Many medieval Hebrew <sc>mss have the plural/dual &#8220;your wings&#8221; rather than the singular &#8220;your wing, skirt.&#8221; The latter is more likely here in the context of Ruth&#8217;s marriage proposal. In the metaphorical account in Ezek 16:8, God spreads his skirt over naked Jerusalem as an act of protection and as a precursor to marriage. Thus Ruth&#8217;s words can be taken, in effect, as a marriage proposal (and are so translated here; cf. TEV &#8220;So please marry me&#8221;). See F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth,</i> <i>Esther</i> (WBC), 164-65.</p>
<A NAME="333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=200><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for you are a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1465;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;</font> [<font face="Scholar">go</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>],&#8221; sometimes translated &#8220;redeemer&#8221; (cf. NIV &#8220;a kinsman-redeemer&#8221;; NLT &#8220;my family redeemer&#8221;). In this context Boaz, as a &#8220;redeemer,&#8221; functions as a guardian of the family interests who has responsibility for caring for the widows of his deceased kinsmen. For a discussion of the legal background, see F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth,</i> <i>Esther</i> (WBC), 166-69.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> By proposing marriage, Ruth goes beyond the letter of Naomi&#8217;s instructions (see v. 4, where Naomi told Ruth that Boaz would tell her what to do). Though she is more aggressive than Naomi told her to be, she is still carrying out the intent of Naomi&#8217;s instructions, which were designed to lead to marriage.</p>

<A NAME="336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=203><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;latter [act of] devotion&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;this last instance of your loyalty.&#8221;</p>

Ruth&#8217;s former act of devotion was her decision to remain and help Naomi. The latter act of devotion is her decision to marry Boaz to provide a child to carry on her deceased husband&#8217;s (and Elimelech&#8217;s) line and to provide for Naomi in her old age (see Ruth 4:5, 10, 15). </p>

As in v. 5, the Hebrew imperfect is used (note &#8220;you are saying&#8221;), even though Ruth&#8217;s request appears to be concluded. According to GKC 316 §107.<i>h</i>, the imperfect can sometimes &#8220;express actions, etc., which although, strictly speaking, they are already finished, are regarded as still lasting on into the present time, or continuing to operate in it.&#8221; The imperfect <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1506;&#1457;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">e</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eseh</font>) could be translated &#8220;I will do&#8221; (so NAB, NIV, NRSV, NLT), but since there are legal complications which must first be resolved, it is better to take the form as indicating Boaz&#8217;s desire or intention, if the legal matters can be worked out.</p>
<A NAME="342"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=209><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all the gate of the town,&#8221; which by metonymy could refer to everyone in town (NIV &#8220;All my fellow townsmen&#8221;; NLT &#8220;everyone in town&#8221;), or only to the leaders and prominent citizens of the community (Boaz&#8217;s peers) who transacted business and made legal decisions at the town gate (NRSV &#8220;all the assembly of my people&#8221;).</p>

Six ephahs, the equivalent of 180-300 pounds, is clearly too heavy, especially if carried in a garment. Six omers (an omer being a tenth of an ephah) seems too little, since this would have amounted to six-tenths of an ephah, less than Ruth had gleaned in a single day (cf. 2:17). Thus a seah (one third of an ephah) may be in view here; six seahs would amount to two ephahs, about 60 pounds (27 kg). See R. L. Hubbard, Jr., <i>Ruth</i> (NICOT), 222, and F. W.
