<A NAME="1518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=717><b>tn</b> The verse has a temporal clause that actually continues or supplements the temporal clause of the preceding verse. It is made up of the temporal indicator, the infinitive construct with the preposition, and the suffixed subjective genitive: &#8220;and it shall be when you eat.&#8221; Here it is translated simply &#8220;and eat&#8221; since the temporal element was introduced in the last verse.</p>
