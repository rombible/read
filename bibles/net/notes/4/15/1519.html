KJV, ASV). It may simply be called a &#8220;contribution&#8221; (so NAB). The verb of the sentence is from the same root: &#8220;you shall lift up/raise up.&#8221; It was to be an offering separated from the rest and raised up to the <sc>Lord in the sight of all. It was designed to remind the Israelites that the produce and the land belonged to God.</p>
