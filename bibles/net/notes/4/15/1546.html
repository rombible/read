<A NAME="1546"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=745><b>sn</b> This is a reference to the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1510;&#1460;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsitsit</font>), the fringes on the borders of the robes. They were meant to hang from the corners of the upper garment (Deut 22:12), which was worn on top of the clothing. The tassel was probably made by twisting the overhanging threads of the garment into a knot that would hang down. This was a reminder of the covenant. The tassels were retained down through history, and today more elaborate prayer shawls with tassels are worn during prayer. For more information, see F. J. Stephens, &#8220;The Ancient Significance of Sisith,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 50 (1931): 59-70; and S. Bertman, &#8220;Tasselled Garments in the Ancient East Mediterranean,&#8221; <i>BA</i> 24 (1961): 119-28.</p>
