<A NAME="1531"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=730><b>tn</b> The sin is described literally as acting &#8220;with a high hand&#8221; &#8211; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1491; &#1512;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492; </font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿyad ramah</font>). The expression means that someone would do something with deliberate defiance, with an arrogance in spite of what the <sc>Lord said. It is as if the sinner was about to attack God, or at least lifting his hand against God. The implication of the expression is that it was done in full knowledge of the Law (especially since this contrasts throughout with the sins of ignorance). Blatant defiance of the word of the <sc>Lord is dealt with differently. For similar expressions, see Exod 14:8 and Num 33:3.</p>
