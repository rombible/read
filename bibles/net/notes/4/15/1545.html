<A NAME="1545"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=744><b>tn</b> The construction uses the imperative followed by perfect tenses with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutives. The first perfect tense may be translated as the imperative, but the second, being a third common plural form, has to be subordinated as a purpose clause, or as the object of the preceding verb: &#8220;speak&#8230;and say&#8230;that they make.&#8221;</p>
