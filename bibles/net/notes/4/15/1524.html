<A NAME="1524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=723><b>tn</b> The idea of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1490;&#1464;&#1490;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lishgagah</font>) seems to be that of &#8220;inadvertence&#8221; or &#8220;without intent.&#8221; The text gives no indication of how this offense might be committed, or what it might include. It probably describes any transgressions done in ignorance of the Law that involved a violation of tabernacle procedure or priestly protocol or social misdemeanor. Even though it was done unintentionally, it was still a violation and called for ritual purification. </p>
