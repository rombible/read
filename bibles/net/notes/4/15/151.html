<A NAME="151"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=700><b>sn</b> The wilderness wandering officially having begun, these rules were then given for the people to be used when they finally entered the land. That they would be provided here would be of some encouragement to the nation after their great failure. God still spoke of a land that was to be their land, even though they had sinned greatly. This chapter collects a number of religious rules. The first 16 verses deal with rulings for sacrifices. Then, vv. 17-36 concerns sins of omission. Finally, rules concerning tassels are covered (vv. 37-41). For additional reading, see G. B. Gray, <i>Sacrifice in the Old Testament</i> (Oxford: Clarendon, 1925); B. A.
