<A NAME="111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=472><b>sn</b> The chapter includes the initial general complaints (vv. 1-3), the complaints about food (vv. 4-9), Moses&#8217; own complaint to the <sc>Lord (vv. 10-15), God&#8217;s response to Moses (vv. 16-25), Eldad and Medad (vv. 26-29), and the quail (vv. 30-35). The first part records the burning of the camp, named Taberah. Here is one of the several naming narratives in the wilderness experience. The occasion for divine judgment is the complaining of the people. The passages serve to warn believers of all ages not to murmur as the Israelites did, for such complaining reveals a lack of faith in the power and goodness of God. For additional literature, see W. Brueggemann, &#8220;From Hurt to Joy, from Death to Life,&#8221; <i>Int</i> 28 (1974): 3-19; B. S. Childs, &#8220;The Etiological Tale Re-examined,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 24 (1974): 387-97; G. W. Coats, <i>Rebellion in the Wilderness</i>; and A. C. Tunyogi, &#8220;The Rebellions of Israel,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 81 (1962): 385-90.</p>
<A NAME="112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=473><b>tn</b> The temporal clause uses the Hitpoel infinitive construct from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anan</font>). It is a rare word, occurring in Lam 3:39. With this blunt introduction the constant emphasis of obedience to the word of the <sc>Lord found throughout the first ten chapters suddenly comes to an end. It is probable that the people were tired of moving for several days, the excitement of the new beginning died out quickly in the &#8220;great and terrible wilderness.&#8221; Resentment, frustration, discomfort &#8211; whatever it all involved &#8211; led to complaining and not gratitude.</p>
<A NAME="113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=474><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;it was evil in the ears of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;) is a much stronger word than &#8220;displeased&#8221; would suggest. The bold anthropomorphism shows that what the <sc>Lord heard was painful to him.</p>
<A NAME="114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=475><b>tn</b> The preterite with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive is here subordinated to the next verb as a temporal clause. </p>
<A NAME="115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=476><b>tn</b> The common Hebrew expression uses the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">harah</font>, &#8220;to be hot, to burn, to be kindled&#8221;). The subject is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">appo</font>), &#8220;his anger&#8221; or more literally, his nose, which in this anthropomorphic expression flares in rage. The emphasis is superlative &#8211; &#8220;his anger raged.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=477><b>tn</b> The <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive does not simply show sequence in the verbs, but here expresses the result of the anger of the <sc>Lord for their complaining. With such a response to the complaining, one must conclude that it was unreasonable. There had been no long deprivation or endured suffering; the complaining was early and showed a rebellious spirit.</p>
<A NAME="117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=478><b>sn</b> The &#8220;fire of the <sc>Lord&#8221; is supernatural, for it is said to come from the <sc>Lord and not from a natural source. God gave them something to complain about &#8211; something to fear. The other significant place where this &#8220;fire of the <sc>Lord&#8221; destroyed was in the case of Nadab and Abihu who brought strange fire to the altar (Lev 10:2).</p>
<A NAME="118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=479><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Moses.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=480><b>sn</b> Here is the pattern that will become in the wilderness experience so common &#8211; the complaining turns to a cry to Moses, which is then interpreted as a prayer to the <sc>Lord, and there is healing. The sequence presents a symbolic lesson, an illustration of the intercession of the Holy Spirit. The NT will say that in times of suffering Christians do not know how to pray, but the Spirit intercedes for them, changing their cries into the proper prayers (Rom 8). </p>
<A NAME="1110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=481><b>tn</b> The name <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1461;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tav</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">erah</font>) is given to the spot as a commemorative of the wilderness experience. It is explained by the formula using the same verbal root, &#8220;to burn.&#8221; Such naming narratives are found dozens of times in the OT, and most frequently in the Pentateuch. The explanation is seldom an exact etymology, and so in the literature is called a popular etymology. It is best to explain the connection as a figure of speech, a paronomasia, which is a phonetic wordplay that may or may not be etymologically connected. Usually the name is connected to the explanation by a play on the verbal root &#8211; here the preterite explaining the noun. The significance of commemorating the place by such a device is to &#8220;burn&#8221; it into the memory of Israel. The narrative itself would be remembered more easily by the name and its motif. The namings in the wilderness wanderings remind the faithful of unbelief, and warn us all not to murmur as they murmured. See further A. P. Ross, &#8220;Paronomasia and Popular Etymologies in the Naming Narrative of the Old Testament,&#8221; Ph.D. diss., University of Cambridge, 1982. </p>
<A NAME="1111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=482><b>sn</b> The story of the sending of the quail is a good example of poetic justice, or talionic justice. God had provided for the people, but even in that provision they were not satisfied, for they remembered other foods they had in Egypt. No doubt there was not the variety of foods in the Sinai that might have been available in Egypt, but their life had been bitter bondage there as well. They had cried to the <sc>Lord for salvation, but now they forget, as they remember things they used to have. God will give them what they crave, but it will not do for them what they desire. For more information on this story, see B. J. Malina, <i>The Palestinian Manna Tradition</i>. For the attempt to explain manna and the other foods by natural phenomena, see F. W. Bodenheimer, &#8220;The Manna of Sinai,&#8221; <i>BA</i> 10 (1947): 1-6. </p>
<A NAME="1112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=483><b>tn</b> The mixed multitude (or &#8220;rabble,&#8221; so NASB, NIV, NRSV; NLT &#8220;foreign rabble&#8221;) is the translation of an unusual word, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1458;&#1464;&#1488;&#1505;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1505;&#1467;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">safsuf</font>). It occurs in the Hebrew Bible only here. It may mean &#8220;a gathering of people&#8221; from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asaf</font>), yielding the idea of a mixed multitude (in line with Exod 12:38). But the root is different, and so no clear connection can be established. Many commentators therefore think the word is stronger, showing contempt through a word that would be equivalent to &#8220;riff-raff.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=484><b>tn</b> The Hebrew simply uses the cognate accusative, saying &#8220;they craved a craving&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1493;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; &#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hit</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avvu ta</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">vah</font>), but the context shows that they had this strong craving for food. The verb describes a strong desire, which is not always negative (Ps 132:13-14). But the word is a significant one in the Torah; it was used in the garden story for Eve&#8217;s desire for the tree, and it is used in the Decalogue in the warning against coveting (Deut 5:21). </p>
<A NAME="1114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=485><b>tc</b> The Greek and the Latin versions read &#8220;and they sat down&#8221; for &#8220;and they returned,&#8221; involving just a change in vocalization (which they did not have). This may reflect the same expression in Judg 20:26. But the change does not improve this verse.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text uses a verbal hendiadys here, one word serving as an adverb for the other. It literally reads &#8220;and they returned and they wept,&#8221; which means they wept again. Here the weeping is put for the complaint, showing how emotionally stirred up the people had become by the craving. The words throughout here are metonymies. The craving is a metonymy of cause, for it would have then led to expressions (otherwise the desires would not have been known). And the weeping is either a metonymy of effect, or of adjunct, for the actual complaints follow.</p>
<A NAME="1115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=486><b>tn</b> The Hebrew expresses the strong wish or longing idiomatically: &#8220;Who will give us flesh to eat?&#8221; It is a rhetorical expression not intended to be taken literally, but merely to give expression to the longing they had. See GKC 476 §151.<i>a</i>.1.</p>
<A NAME="1116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=487><b>tn</b> The perfect tense here expresses the experience of a state of mind.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> As with all who complain in such situations, their memory was selective. It was their bitter cries to the <sc>Lord from the suffering in bondage that God heard and answered. And now, shortly after being set free, their memory of Egypt is for things they do not now have. It is also somewhat unlikely that they as slaves had such abundant foods in Egypt.</p>
<A NAME="1117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=488><b>tn</b> The imperfect tense would here be the customary imperfect, showing continual or incomplete action in past time.</p>
<A NAME="1118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=489><b>tn</b> The adverb &#8220;freely&#8221; is from the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khanan</font>, &#8220;to be gracious&#8221;), from which is derived the noun &#8220;grace.&#8221; The word underscores the idea of &#8220;free, without cost, for no reason, gratis.&#8221; Here the simple sense is &#8220;freely,&#8221; without any cost. But there may be more significance in the choice of the words in this passage, showing the ingratitude of the Israelites to God for His deliverance from bondage. To them now the bondage is preferable to the salvation &#8211; this is what angered the <sc>Lord.</p>
<A NAME="1119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=490><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;our souls.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=491><b>sn</b> The Hebrews were complaining both about the bland taste of the manna and dehydration &#8211; they were parched in the wilderness.</p>
<A NAME="1121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=492><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;before our eyes,&#8221; meaning that &#8220;we see nothing except this manna.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=493><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And its taste was like the taste of fresh olive oil.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=494><b>tn</b> The temporal clause is constructed of the infinitive construct from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1491;</font><font face="Scholar"> </font>(<font face="Scholar">yarad</font>) with a temporal preposition, followed by the subjective genitive. </p>
<A NAME="1124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=495><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;came down.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=496><b>sn</b> Moses begins to feel the burden of caring for this people, a stubborn and rebellious people. His complaint shows how contagious their complaining has been. It is one thing to cry out to God about the load of ministry, but it is quite another to do it in such a way as to reflect a lack of faith in God&#8217;s provision. God has to remind the leader Moses that he, the <sc>Lord, can do anything. This is a variation on the theme from Exodus &#8211; &#8220;who am I that I should lead&#8230;.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=497><b>tn</b> The participle &#8220;weeping&#8221; is functioning here as the noun in the accusative case, an adverbial accusative of state. It is explicative of the object.</p>
<A NAME="1127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=498><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;it was evil in the eyes of Moses.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=499><b>tn</b> The verb is the Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">a</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to be evil&#8221;). Moses laments (with the rhetorical question) that God seems to have caused him evil. </p>
<A NAME="1129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=500><b>tn</b> The infinitive construct with the preposition is expressing the result of not finding favor with God (see R. J. Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 12-13, §57). What Moses is claiming is that because he has been given this burden God did not show him favor.</p>
<A NAME="1130"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=501><b>sn</b> The questions Moses asks are rhetorical. He is actually affirming that they are not his people, that he did not produce them, but now is to support them. His point is that God produced this nation, but has put the burden of caring for their needs on him.</p>
<A NAME="1131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=502><b>tn</b> The verb means &#8220;to beget, give birth to.&#8221; The figurative image from procreation completes the parallel question, first the conceiving and second the giving birth to the nation.</p>
<A NAME="1132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=503><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1465;&#1502;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">omen</font>) is often translated &#8220;nurse,&#8221; but the form is a masculine form and would better be rendered as a &#8220;foster parent.&#8221; This does not work as well, though, with the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1465;&#1504;&#1461;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yoneq</font>), the &#8220;sucking child.&#8221; The two metaphors are simply designed to portray the duty of a parent to a child as a picture of Moses&#8217; duty for the nation. The idea that it portrays God as a mother pushes it too far (see M. Noth, <i>Numbers</i> [OTL]<i>, </i>86-87).</p>
<A NAME="1133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=504><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text simply has &#8220;from where to me flesh?&#8221; which means &#8220;from where will I have meat?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=505><b>tn</b> The cohortative coming after the imperative stresses purpose (it is an indirect volitive).</p>
<A NAME="1135"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=506><b>tn</b> The word order shows the emphasis: &#8220;I am not able, I by myself, to bear all this people.&#8221; The infinitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1461;&#1488;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lase</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">t</font>) serves as the direct object of the verb. The expression is figurative, for bearing or carrying the people means being responsible for all their needs and cares. </p>
<A NAME="1136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=507><b>tn</b> The subject of the verb &#8220;heavy&#8221; is unstated; in the context it probably refers to the people, or the burden of caring for the people. This responsibility was turning out to be a heavier responsibility than Moses anticipated. Alone he was totally inadequate.</p>
<A NAME="1137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=508><b>tn</b> The participle expresses the future idea of what God is doing, or what he is going to be doing. Moses would rather be killed than be given a totally impossible duty over a people that were not his.</p>
<A NAME="1138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=509><b>tn</b> The imperative of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1490;</font> (<font face="Scholar">harag</font>) is followed by the infinitive absolute for emphasis. The point is more that the infinitive adds to the emphasis of the imperative mood, which would be immediate compliance.</p>
<A NAME="1139"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=510><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;my own ruin&#8221; (NIV). The word &#8220;trouble&#8221; here probably refers to the stress and difficulty of caring for a complaining group of people. The suffix on the noun would be objective, perhaps stressing the indirect object of the noun &#8211; trouble for me. The expression &#8220;on my trouble&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bÿra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ati</font>) is one of the so-called <i>tiqqune sopherim</i>, or &#8220;emendations of the scribes.&#8221; According to this tradition the original reading in v. 15 was [to look] &#8220;on your evil&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1514;&#1462;&#1498;&#1464;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bÿra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">atekha</font>), meaning &#8220;the calamity that you bring about&#8221; for Israel. However, since such an expression could be mistakenly thought to attribute evil to the Lord, the ancient scribes changed it to the reading found in the MT.</p>
<A NAME="1140"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=511><b>sn</b> The <sc>Lord provides Spirit-empowered assistance for Moses. Here is another variation on the theme of Moses&#8217; faith. Just as he refused to lead alone and was given Aaron to share the work, so here he protests the burden and will share it with seventy elders. If God&#8217;s servant will not trust wholeheartedly, that individual will not be used by God as he or she might have been. Others will share in the power and the work. Probably one could say that it was God&#8217;s will for others to share this leadership &#8211; but not to receive it through these circumstances.</p>
<A NAME="1141"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=512><b>tn</b> The &#8220;officials&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1496;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shottÿrim</font>) were a group of the elders who seem to have had some administrative capacities. The LXX used the word &#8220;scribes.&#8221; For further discussion, see R. de Vaux, <i>Ancient Israel,</i> 69-70.</p>
<A NAME="1142"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=513><b>tn</b> The imperfect tense here is to be classified as a final imperfect, showing the result of this action by God. Moses would be relieved of some of the responsibility when these others were given the grace to understand and to resolve cases.</p>
<A NAME="1143"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=514><b>tn</b> The Hitpael is used to stress that they are to prepare for a holy appearance. The day was going to be special and so required their being set apart for it. But it is a holy day in the sense of the judgment that was to follow.</p>
<A NAME="1144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=515><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the ears.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1145"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=516><b>tn</b> Possibly this could be given an optative translation, to reflect the earlier one: &#8220;O that someone would give&#8230;.&#8221; But the verb is not the same; here it is the Hiphil<i> </i>of the verb &#8220;to eat&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;who will make us eat&#8221; (i.e., provide meat for us to eat). </p>
<A NAME="1146"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=517><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;life&#8221; is not in the text. The expression is simply &#8220;it was for us,&#8221; or &#8220;we had good,&#8221; meaning &#8220;we had it good,&#8221; or &#8220;life was good.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1147"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=518><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a month of days.&#8221; So also in v. 21.</p>
<A NAME="1148"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=519><b>tn</b> The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1494;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿzarah</font>) has been translated &#8220;ill&#8221; or &#8220;loathsome.&#8221; It occurs only here in the Hebrew Bible. The Greek text interprets it as &#8220;sickness.&#8221; It could be nausea or vomiting (so G. B. Gray, <i>Numbers</i> [ICC], 112) from overeating.</p>
<A NAME="1149"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=520><b>sn</b> The explanation is the interpretation of their behavior &#8211; it is in reality what they have done, even though they would not say they despised the <sc>Lord. They had complained and shown a lack of faith and a contempt for the program, which was in essence despising the <sc>Lord.</p>
<A NAME="1150"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=521><b>tn</b> The use of the demonstrative pronoun here (&#8220;why is this we went out &#8230;&#8221;) is enclitic, providing emphasis to the sentence: &#8220;Why in the world did we ever leave Egypt?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1151"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=522><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;the people who I am in their midst,&#8221; i.e., among whom I am.</p>
<A NAME="1152"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=523><b>tn</b> The Hebrew sentence stresses the number. The sentence begins &#8220;600,000&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1153"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=524><b>tn</b> The word order places the object first here: &#8220;Meat I will give them.&#8221; This adds to the contrast between the number and the statement of the <sc>Lord.</p>
<A NAME="1154"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=525><b>tn</b> The verb is the perfect tense with a <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive, carrying the sequence from the preceding imperfect tense. However, this verb may be subordinated to the preceding to express a purpose clause.</p>
<A NAME="1155"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=526><b>sn</b> This anthropomorphic expression concerns the power of God. The &#8220;hand of the <sc>Lord&#8221; is idiomatic for his power, what he is able to do. The question is rhetorical; it is affirming that his hand is not shortened, i.e., that his power is not limited. Moses should have known this, and so this is a rebuke for him at this point. God had provided the manna, among all the other powerful acts they had witnessed. Meat would be no problem. But the lack of faith by the people was infectious. </p>
<A NAME="1156"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=527><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;will happen&#8221; (TEV); KJV &#8220;shall come to pass unto thee.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1157"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=528><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;on him&#8221;; the referent (Moses) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1158"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=529><b>tn</b> The temporal clause is introduced by the temporal indicator <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayÿhi</font>), which need not be translated. It introduces the time of the infinitive as past time narrative. The infinitive construct is from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nuakh</font>, &#8220;to rest&#8221;). The figurative expression of the Spirit resting upon them indicates the temporary indwelling and empowering by the Spirit in their lives.</p>
<A NAME="1159"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=530><b>tn</b> The text may mean that these men gave ecstatic utterances, much like Saul did when the Spirit came upon him and he made the same prophetic utterances (see 1 Sam 10:10-13). But there is no strong evidence for this (see K. L. Barker, &#8220;Zechariah,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 7:605-6). In fact there is no consensus among scholars as to the origin and meaning of the verb &#8220;prophesy&#8221; or the noun &#8220;prophet.&#8221; It has something to do with speech, being God&#8217;s spokesman or spokeswoman or making predictions or authoritative utterances or ecstatic utterances. It certainly does mean that the same Holy Spirit, the same divine provision that was for Moses to enable him to do the things that God had commanded him to do, was now given to them. It would have included wisdom and power with what they were saying and doing &#8211; in a way that was visible and demonstrable to the people! The people needed to know that the same provision was given to these men, authenticating their leadership among the clans. And so it could not simply be a change in their understanding and wisdom. </p>
<A NAME="1160"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=531><b>tn</b> The final verb of the clause stresses that this was not repeated: &#8220;they did not add&#8221; is the literal rendering of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1488; &#1497;&#1464;&#1505;&#1464;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿlo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> yasafu</font>). It was a one-time spiritual experience associated with their installation.</p>
<A NAME="1161"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=532><b>tn</b> The form of the word is the passive participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1514;&#1467;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kÿtuvim</font>, &#8220;written&#8221;). It is normally taken to mean &#8220;among those registered,&#8221; but it is not clear if that means they were to be among the seventy or not. That seems unlikely since there is no mention of the seventy being registered, and vv. 24-25 says all seventy went out and prophesied. The registration may be to eldership, or the role of the officer.</p>
<A NAME="1162"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=533><b>tn</b> The article indicates that the &#8220;young man&#8221; was definite in the mind of the writer, but indefinite in English.</p>
<A NAME="1163"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=534><b>tn</b> The form is the Piel participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;&#1461;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿsharet</font>), meaning &#8220;minister, servant, assistant.&#8221; The word has a loftier meaning than the ordinary word for slave.</p>
<A NAME="1164"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=535><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bakhar</font>, &#8220;to choose&#8221;); here the form is the masculine plural participle with a suffix, serving as the object of the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">min</font>). It would therefore mean &#8220;[one of] his chosen men,&#8221; or &#8220;[one of] his choice men.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1165"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=536><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;answered and said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1166"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=537><b>sn</b> The effort of Joshua is to protect Moses&#8217; prerogative as leader by stopping these men in the camp from prophesying. Joshua did not understand the significance in the <sc>Lord&#8217;s plan to let other share the burden of leadership.</p>
<A NAME="1167"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=538><b>tn</b> The Piel<i> </i>participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1511;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿqanne</font>&#8217;) serves as a verb here in this interrogative sentence. The word means &#8220;to be jealous; to be envious.&#8221; That can be in a good sense, such as with the translation &#8220;zeal,&#8221; or it can be in a negative sense as here. Joshua&#8217;s apparent &#8220;zeal&#8221; is questioned by Moses &#8211; was he zealous/envious for Moses sake, or for some other reason? </p>
<A NAME="1168"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=539><b>tn</b> The optative is expressed by the interrogative clause in Hebrew, &#8220;who will give&#8230;.&#8221; Moses expresses here the wish that the whole nation would have that portion of the Spirit. The new covenant, of course, would turn Moses&#8217; wish into a certainty.</p>
<A NAME="1169"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=540><b>sn</b> The irony in this chapter is expressed in part by the use of the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ruakh</font>). In the last episode it clearly meant the Spirit of the <sc>Lord that empowered the men for their spiritual service. But here the word is &#8220;wind.&#8221; Both the spiritual service and the judgment come from God.</p>
<A NAME="1170"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=541><b>tn</b> The verb means &#8220;burst forth&#8221; or &#8220;sprang up.&#8221; See the ways it is used in Gen 33:12, Judg 16:3, 14; Isa 33:20.</p>
<A NAME="1171"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=542><b>sn</b> The &#8220;quail&#8221; ordinarily cross the Sinai at various times of the year, but what is described here is not the natural phenomenon. Biblical scholars looking for natural explanations usually note that these birds fly at a low height and can be swatted down easily. But the description here is more of a supernatural supply and provision. See J. Gray, &#8220;The Desert Sojourn of the Hebrews and the Sinai Horeb Tradition,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 4 (1954): 148-54.</p>
<A NAME="1172"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=543><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;left them fluttering.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1173"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=544><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;two cubits.&#8221; The standard cubit in the OT is assumed by most authorities to be about eighteen inches (45 cm) in length.</p>

<A NAME="1176"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">76</span><note=547><b>tn</b> The verb (a preterite) is followed by the infinitive absolute of the same root, to emphasize the action of spreading out the quail. Although it is hard to translate the expression, it indicates that they spread these quail out all over the area. The vision of them spread all over was evidence of God&#8217;s abundant provision for their needs.</p>
<A NAME="1177"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=548><b>tn</b> The verb is a prefixed conjugation, normally an imperfect tense. But coming after the adverb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">terem</font>) it is treated as a preterite.</p>
<A NAME="1178"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=549><b>sn</b> The name &#8220;the graves of the ones who craved&#8221; is again explained by a wordplay, a popular etymology. In Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514; &#1492;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qivrot hatta</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avah</font>) is the technical name. It is the place that the people craved the meat, longing for the meat of Egypt, and basically rebelled against God. The naming marks another station in the wilderness where the people failed to accept God&#8217;s good gifts with grace and to pray for their other needs to be met.</p>
<A NAME="1179"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">79</span><note=550><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;different food&#8221; are implied, and are supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
