<A NAME="61"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=244><b>sn</b> This chapter can be divided into five sections: The vow is described in vv. 1-8, then the contingencies for defilement are enumerated in vv. 9-12, then there is a discussion of discharging the vows in vv. 13-20, and then a summary in v. 21; after this is the high priestly blessing (vv. 22-27). For information on the vow, see G. B. Gray, &#8220;The Nazirite,&#8221; <i>JTS</i> 1 (1899-1900): 201-11; Z. Weisman, &#8220;The Biblical Nazirite, Its Types and Roots,&#8221; <i>Tarbiz</i> 36 (1967): 207-20; and W. Eichrodt, <i>Theology of the Old Testament </i>(OTL), 1:303-6.</p>
<A NAME="62"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=245><b>tn</b> The formula is used here again: &#8220;a man or a woman &#8211; when he takes.&#8221; The vow is open to both men and women.</p>
<A NAME="63"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=246><b>tn</b> The vow is considered special in view of the use of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yafli</font>&#8217;), the Hiphil imperfect of the verb &#8220;to be wonderful, extraordinary.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="64"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=247><b>tn</b> The construction uses the infinitive construct followed by the cognate accusative: &#8220;to vow a vow.&#8221; This intensifies the idea that the vow is being taken carefully. </p>
<A NAME="65"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=248><b>tn</b> The name of the vow is taken from the verb that follows; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nazar</font>) means &#8220;to consecrate oneself,&#8221; and so the Nazirite is a consecrated one. These are folks who would make a decision to take an oath for a time or for a lifetime to be committed to the <sc>Lord and show signs of separation from the world. Samuel was to be a Nazirite, as the fragment of the text from Qumran confirms &#8211; &#8220;he will be a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1494;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nazir</font>) forever&#8221; (1 Sam 1:22). </p>
<A NAME="66"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=249><b>tn</b> The form of the verb is an Hiphil infinitive construct, forming the wordplay and explanation for the name Nazirite. The Hiphil is here an internal causative, having the meaning of &#8220;consecrate oneself&#8221; or just &#8220;consecrate to the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="67"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=250><b>tn</b> The operative verb now will be the Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nazar</font>); the consecration to the <sc>Lord meant separation from certain things in the world. The first will be wine and strong drink &#8211; barley beer (from Akkadian <font face="Scholar">sikaru</font>, a fermented beer). But the second word may be somewhat wider in its application than beer. The Nazirite, then, was to avoid all intoxicants as a sign of his commitment to the <sc>Lord. The restriction may have proved a hardship in the daily diet of the one taking the vow, but it spoke a protest to the corrupt religious and social world that used alcohol to excess.</p>
<A NAME="68"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=251><b>tn</b> The &#8220;vinegar&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1502;&#1462;&#1509;</font>, <font face="Scholar">homets</font>) is some kind of drink preparation that has been allowed to go sour.</p>
<A NAME="69"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=252><b>tn</b> This word occurs only here. It may come from the word &#8220;to water, to be moist,&#8221; and so refer to juice.</p>
<A NAME="610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=253><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;dried&#8221; (so KJV, ASV, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=254><b>tn</b> This word also is rare, occurring only here.</p>
<A NAME="612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=255><b>sn</b> Here is another <i>hapax legomenon</i>, a word only found here. The word seems linked to the verb &#8220;to be clear,&#8221; and so may mean the thin skin of the grape. The reason for the strictness with these two words in this verse is uncertain. We know the actual meanings of the words, and the combination must form a merism here, meaning no part of the grape could be eaten. Abstaining from these common elements of food was to be a mark of commitment to the <sc>Lord. Hos 3:1 even denounces the raisin cakes as part of a pagan world, and eating them would be a violation of the oath.</p>
<A NAME="613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=256><b>tc</b> The parallel expression in v. 8 (&#8220;all the days of his separation&#8221;) lacks the word &#8220;vow.&#8221; This word is also absent in v. 5 in a few medieval Hebrew manuscripts. The presence of the word in v. 5 may be due to dittography.</p>
<A NAME="614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=257><b>sn</b> There is an interesting parallel between this prohibition and the planting of trees. They could not be pruned or trimmed for three years, but allowed to grow free (Lev 20:23). Only then could the tree be cut and the fruit eaten. The natural condition was to be a sign that it was the <sc>Lord&#8217;s. It was to be undisturbed by humans. Since the Nazirite was to be consecrated to the <sc>Lord, that meant his whole person, hair included. In the pagan world the trimming of the beard and the cutting of the hair was often a sign of devotion to some deity.</p>
<A NAME="615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=258><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;days.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=259><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;holy&#8221; here has the sense of distinct, different, set apart.</p>
<A NAME="617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=260><b>tn</b> The Piel infinitive absolute functions as a verb in this passage; the Piel carries the sense of &#8220;grow lengthy&#8221; or &#8220;let grow long.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=261><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb is simply &#8220;enter, go,&#8221; no doubt with the sense of go near. </p>
<A NAME="619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=262><b>tn</b> The Hebrew has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1461;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh met</font>), literally a &#8220;dead person.&#8221; But since the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> can also be used for animals, the restriction would be for any kind of corpse. Death was very much a part of the fallen world, and so for one so committed to the <sc>Lord, avoiding all such contamination would be a witness to the greatest separation, even in a family.</p>
<A NAME="620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=263><b>tn</b> The <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) conjunction at the beginning of the clause specifies the cases of corpses that are to be avoided, no matter how painful it might be.</p>
<A NAME="621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=264><b>tn</b> The construction uses the infinitive construct with the preposition and the suffixed subjective genitive &#8211; &#8220;in the dying of them&#8221; &#8211; to form the adverbial clause of time.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Nazirite would defile himself, i.e., ruin his vow, by contacting their corpses. Jesus&#8217; hard saying in Matt 8:22, &#8220;let the dead bury their own dead,&#8221; makes sense in the light of this passage &#8211; Jesus was calling for commitment to himself.</p>
<A NAME="622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=265><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;separation&#8221; here is metonymy of adjunct &#8211; what is on his head is long hair that goes with the vow.</p>
<A NAME="623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=266><b>tn</b> The genitive could perhaps be interpreted as possession, i.e., &#8220;the vow of his God,&#8221; but it seems more likely that an objective genitive would be more to the point.</p>
<A NAME="624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=267><b>tn</b> The construction uses the imperfect tense followed by the infinitive absolute, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; &#1502;&#1461;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yamut met</font>). Because the verb is in a conditional clause, the emphasis that is to be given through the infinitive must stress the contingency. The point is &#8220;if someone dies &#8211; unexpectedly.&#8221; The next words underscore the suddenness of this. </p>
<A NAME="625"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=268><b>tn</b> The verb is the Piel perfect with a <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive; it continues the idea within the conditional clause.</p>
<A NAME="626"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=269><b>sn</b> The expression is figurative for the vow that he took; the figure is the metonymy because the reference to the head is a reference to the long hair that symbolizes the oath.</p>
<A NAME="627"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=270><b>tn</b> The imperfect tense in this verse is still instructional rather than a simple future. The translations can vary, but the point that it is directive must be caught.</p>
<A NAME="628"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=271><b>tn</b> The traditional translation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1496;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khatta</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">t</font>) is &#8220;sin offering,&#8221; but it is more precise to render it &#8220;purification offering&#8221; (as with the other names of sacrifices) to show the outcome, not the cause of the offering (see Lev 4). Besides, this offering was made for ritual defilements (for which no confession was required) as well as certain sins (for which a confession of sin was required). This offering restored the person to the ritual state of purity by purifying the area into which he would be going. </p>
<A NAME="629"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=272><b>tn</b> The repetition of &#8220;the one&#8230;and the one&#8221; forms the distributive sense of &#8220;the one&#8230;and the other.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="630"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=273><b>tn</b> The burnt offering (Lev 1) reflects the essence of atonement: By this sacrifice the worshiper was completely surrendering to God, and God was completely accepting the worshiper.</p>
<A NAME="631"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=274><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿkhipper</font>) is the Piel perfect with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive. The meaning of the verb is &#8220;to expiate, pacify, atone.&#8221; It refers to the complete removal of the barrier of fellowship between the person and God, and the total acceptance of that person into his presence. The idea of &#8220;to cover,&#8221; often linked to this meaning, is derived from a homonym, and not from this word and its usage. </p>
<A NAME="632"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=275><b>tn</b> The verb &#8220;to sin&#8221; has a wide range of meanings, beginning with the idea of &#8220;missing the way or the goal.&#8221; In view of the nature of this case &#8211; the prescribed ritual without confession &#8211; the idea is more that he failed to keep the vow&#8217;s stipulations in this strange circumstance than that he committed intentional sin.</p>
<A NAME="633"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=276><b>tn</b> The verb simply means &#8220;to consecrate,&#8221; but because it refers to a vow that was interrupted, it must here mean to &#8220;reconsecrate.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="634"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=277><b>tn</b> The same idea is to be found now in the use of the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nazar</font>), which refers to a recommitment after the vow was interrupted.</p>
<A NAME="635"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=278><b>tn</b> The necessity of bringing the reparation offering was due to the reinstatement into the vow that had been interrupted. </p>
<A NAME="636"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=279><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;will fall&#8221;; KJV &#8220;shall be lost&#8221;; ASV, NASB, NRSV &#8220;shall be void.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="637"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=280><b>tc</b> The similar expression in v. 9 includes the word &#8220;head&#8221; (i.e., &#8220;his consecrated head&#8221;). The LXX includes this word in v. 12 as well.</p>
<A NAME="638"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=281><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has &#8220;he/one shall bring him&#8221;; since there is no expressed subject, this verb should be taken in the passive sense &#8211; &#8220;he shall be brought.&#8221; Since the context suggests an obligatory nuance, the translation &#8220;he must be brought&#8221; has been used. Some scholars solve the problem by emending the Hebrew text here, but there is no manuscript evidence to support the emendation.</p>
<A NAME="639"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=282><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he shall offer his offering&#8221; &#8211; the object is a cognate accusative.</p>
<A NAME="640"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=283><b>sn</b> The peace offering <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿlamim</font>) is instructed in Lev 3 and 7. The form is always in the plural. It was a sacrifice that celebrated the fact that the worshiper was at peace with God, and was not offered in order to make peace with God. The peace offering was essentially a communal meal in the presence of God. Some have tried to equate this offering with similar sounding names in Akkadian and Ugaritic (see B. A. Levine, <i>In the Presence of the <sc>Lord</></i> [SJLA], 3-52), but the unique features of the Israelite sacrifice make this connection untenable.</p>
<A NAME="641"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=284><b>tn</b> The suffixes in the MT are plural in this verse, whereas in v. 17 they are singular. This seems to be a matter of stylistic choice, referring to whomever may be taking the vow. </p>
<A NAME="642"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=285><b>sn</b> The offerings for the termination of the Nazirite vow would not have been inexpensive. This indicates that the person making the short term vow may have had income, or have come from a wealthier section of society. Short term vows had to be considered carefully as this ruling required a good amount of food to be brought.</p>
<A NAME="643"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=286><b>tn</b> &#8220;all these&#8221; is supplied as the object.</p>
<A NAME="644"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=287><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;make.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="645"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=288><b>tn</b> The &#8220;peace offering&#8221; is usually written as &#8220;a sacrifice of peace&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1462;&#1489;&#1463;&#1495; &#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">zevakh shÿlamim</font>). The word &#8220;sacrifice&#8221; is related to the word &#8220;to slaughter,&#8221; and so indicates that this is a bloody offering in celebration of peace with God.</p>
<A NAME="646"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=289><b>tn</b> Some versions simply interpret this to say that he shaves his hair, for it is the hair that is the sign of the consecration to God. But the text says he shaves his consecrated head. The whole person is obviously consecrated to God &#8211; not just the head. But the symbolic act of cutting the hair shows that the vow has been completed (see Acts 21:23-24). The understanding of the importance of the hair in the ancient world has been the subject of considerable study over the years (see R. de Vaux, <i>Ancient Israel</i>, 436; and J. A. Thompson, &#8220;Numbers,&#8221; <i>New Bible Commentary: Revised</i>, 177).</p>
<A NAME="647"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=290><b>sn</b> Some commentators see this burning of the hair as an offering (McNeile, <i>Numbers,</i> 35; G. B. Gray, <i>Numbers</i> [ICC]<i>,</i> 68). But others probably with more foundation see it as destroying something that has served a purpose, something that if left alone might be venerated (see R. de Vaux, <i>Israel</i>, 436). </p>
<A NAME="648"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=291><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;which is under the peace offering.&#8221; The verse does not mean that the hair had to be put under that sacrifice and directly on the fire.</p>
<A NAME="649"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=292><b>tn</b> The line does not include the word &#8220;head&#8221;; it literally has &#8220;after the consecrating of himself his consecrated [head].&#8221; The infinitive construct is here functioning in the temporal clause with the suffix as the subject and the object following.</p>
<A NAME="650"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=293><b>sn</b> The ritual of lifting the hands filled with the offering and waving them in the presence of the <sc>Lord was designed to symbolize the transfer of the offering to God in the sight of all. This concludes the worshiper&#8217;s part; the offering now becomes the property of the priest &#8211; his priest&#8217;s due (or &#8220;raised/heave offering&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="651"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=294><b>sn</b> The &#8220;wave offering&#8221; may be interpreted as a &#8220;special gift&#8221; to be transferred to the <sc>Lord, and the &#8220;heave offering&#8221; as a &#8220;special contribution&#8221; to God &#8211; the priest&#8217;s due. These two offerings have also inspired a good deal of study.</p>
<A NAME="652"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=295><b>tn</b> The imperfect tense here would then have the nuance of permission. It is not an instruction at this point; rather, the prohibition has been lifted and the person is free to drink wine.</p>
<A NAME="653"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=296><b>tn</b> Actually, &#8220;law&#8221; here means a whole set of laws, the basic rulings on this topic.</p>
<A NAME="654"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=297><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;whatever else his hand is able to provide.&#8221; The imperfect tense has the nuance of potential imperfect &#8211; &#8220;whatever he can provide.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="655"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=298><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;according to the vow that he vows, so he must do.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="656"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=299><b>sn</b> This brief section records the blessing of the priest, especially the high priest after he emerges from the holy of holies to bless the people (see Lev 9:22). The two main elements in the oracle are &#8220;grace and peace.&#8221; It is probable that the Apostle Paul based his salutations on this oracle. For additional information, see L. J. Liebreich, &#8220;The Songs of Ascent and the Priestly Blessing,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 74 (1955): 33-36; P. D. Miller, &#8220;The Blessing of God: An Interpretation of Num 6:22-27,&#8221; <i>Int</i> 29 (1975): 240-51; and A. Murtonen, &#8220;The Use and Meaning of the Words <font face="Scholar">lébarek </font>and <font face="Scholar">bérakah</font> in the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 9 (1959): 158-77. </p>
<A NAME="657"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=300><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;thus.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="658"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=301><b>tn</b> The Piel imperfect has the nuance of instruction. The particle &#8220;thus&#8221; explains that the following oracle is the form to use.</p>
<A NAME="659"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=302><b>tn</b> Here is the only use of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amar</font>) as an infinitive absolute; it functions as a verb form, an imperative or an imperfect of instruction. Several commentators have attempted to emend the text to get around the difficulty, but such emendations are unnecessary.</p>
<A NAME="660"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=303><b>tn</b> The short blessing uses the jussive throughout, here the Piel jussive with a pronominal suffix. While the jussive has quite a range of nuances, including wish, desire, prayer, or greeting, the jussives here are stronger. The formal subject of the verb is the <sc>Lord, and the speaker pronouncing the blessing is the priest, notably after emerging from the holy of holies where atonement has been made. The <sc>Lord says in this passage that when the priest says this, then the <sc>Lord will bless them. The jussive then is an oracle, not a wish or a prayer. It is a declaration of what the <sc>Lord imparts. It is as binding and sure as a patriarchal blessing which once said officially could not be taken back. The priest here is then pronouncing the word of the <sc>Lord, declaring to the congregation the outcome of the atonement.</p>
<A NAME="661"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=304><b>tn</b> The verb &#8220;to keep&#8221; concerns the divine protection of the people; its basic meaning is &#8220;to exercise great care over,&#8221; &#8220;to guard,&#8221; or &#8220;to give attention to&#8221; (see <i>TWOT</i> 2:939). No doubt the priestly blessing informed the prayer and promise that makes up Ps 121, for the verb occurs six times in the eight verses. So in addition to the divine provision (&#8220;bless&#8221; basically means &#8220;enrich&#8221; in a number of ways) there is the assurance of divine protection.</p>
<A NAME="662"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=305><b>tn</b> Whereas the first line of the blessing had three Hebrew words, the second has five, and the third has seven. In this second line and the following third, the blessing takes the form of an emblem followed by the truth. For the <sc>Lord to make his face shine on them would mean to be gracious to them. M. Noth rightly calls this image of the shining face &#8220;a figure of speech for benevolence and favour&#8221; (<i>Numbers</i> [OTL], 59); see, for example, Pss 4:7; 31:17; 44:4; 67:2; 80:4, 8, 20; 119:135; Dan 9:17). The image may have its inspiration in the theophanies. The picture is of divine favor &#8211; the beaming face of a parent for his beloved. </p>
<A NAME="663"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=306><b>tn</b> The last line of the blessing also has first the image and then the parallel interpretation &#8211; for God to lift up his face is for God to give peace. The idea of the fallen face is one of anger (see Gen 4:6,7); and the idea of the hidden face is that of withholding support, favor, or peace (see Deut 31:18; Ps 30:8; Ps 44:25). If God lifts his face toward his people, it means he has given them peace &#8211; peace, prosperity, completeness, health, safety, general well-being, and the like.</p>
<A NAME="664"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=307><b>tn</b> The idea of their putting the name of Yahweh on the people is somewhat problematic. The pronouncing of the name of Yahweh in this context over the people was taken to be the effectual means of blessings. &#8220;Putting the name on them&#8221; is an expression that emphasizes the truth that he is their God and they are his people or that having his name is having his blessing. </p>
