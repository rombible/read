<A NAME="32"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=90><b>tn</b> The construction is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492; &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1456;&#1491;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elleh tolÿdot</font>), which was traditionally translated &#8220;now these are the generations,&#8221; much as it was translated throughout the book of Genesis. The noun can refer to records, stories, genealogies, names, and accounts of people. Here it is the recorded genealogical list with assigned posts included. Like Genesis, it is a heading of a section, and not a colophon as some have suggested. It is here similar to Exodus: &#8220;these are the names of.&#8221; R. K. Harrison, <i>Numbers </i>(WEC), 62, insists that it is a colophon and should end chapter 2, but if that is followed in the Pentateuch, it creates difficulty throughout the narratives. See the discussion by A. P. Ross, <i>Creation and Blessing</i>, 69-74.</p>
<A NAME="33"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=91><b>tn</b> The expression in the Hebrew text (&#8220;in the day of&#8221;) is idiomatic for &#8220;when.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="34"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=92><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mashakh</font>) means &#8220;to anoint&#8221;; here the form modifies the &#8220;priests.&#8221; The service of consecration was carried out with anointing oil (Exod 30:30). The verb is used for the anointing of kings as well as priests in the OT, and so out of that derived the technical title &#8220;Messiah&#8221; for the coming ideal king &#8211; the &#8220;Anointed One.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="35"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=93><b>tn</b> In this verse the expression is in a relative clause: &#8220;who he filled their hand&#8221; means &#8220;whose hands he filled,&#8221; or &#8220;whom he consecrated.&#8221; The idiomatic expression used here is from Lev 8; it literally is &#8220;he filled their hand&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488; &#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mille</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> yadam</font>). In the ordination service Moses placed some of the meat from the sacrifice in the hand of the ordinand, and this signified what he was going to be about &#8211; having his hand full, or being consecrated to the priesthood. There is some evidence that this practice or expression was also known in Mesopotamia. In modern ordination services a NT or a Bible may be placed in the ordinand&#8217;s hand &#8211; it is what the ministry will be about. </p>
<A NAME="36"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=94><b>tn</b> The form is an infinitival construction for the word for the priest, showing the purpose for the filling of the hands.</p>
<A NAME="37"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=95><b>tn</b> The verb form is the preterite with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive, literally &#8220;and Nadab died.&#8221; Some commentators wish to make the verb a past perfect, rendering it &#8220;and Nadab had died,&#8221; but this is not necessary. In tracing through the line from Aaron it simply reports that the first two sons died. The reference is to the event recorded in Lev 10 where the sons brought &#8220;strange&#8221; or foreign&#8221; fire to the sanctuary. </p>
<A NAME="38"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=96><b>tc</b> This initial clause is omitted in one Hebrew <sc>ms, Smr, and the Vulgate. </p>
<A NAME="39"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=97><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1489;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿhaqrivam</font>) is the Hiphil infinitive construct functioning as a temporal clause: &#8220;when they brought near,&#8221; meaning, &#8220;when they offered.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qarav</font>) is familiar to students of the NT because of &#8220;corban&#8221; in Mark 7:11.</p>
<A NAME="310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=98><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;prohibited.&#8221; See <i>HALOT</i> 279 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1512;</font> 3.</p>
<A NAME="311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=99><b>tn</b> The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473; &#1494;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">esh zarah</font>, &#8220;strange fire&#8221;) seems imprecise and has been interpreted numerous ways (see the helpful summary in J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC 4], 132-33). The infraction may have involved any of the following or a combination thereof: (1) using coals from some place other than the burnt offering altar (i.e., &#8220;unauthorized coals&#8221; according to J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:598; cf. Lev 16:12 and cf. &#8220;unauthorized person&#8221; [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1494;&#1464;&#1512;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">ish zar</font>] in Num 16:40 [17:5 HT], NASB &#8220;layman&#8221;), (2) using the wrong kind of incense (cf. the Exod 30:9 regulation against &#8220;strange incense&#8221; [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1456;&#1496;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514; &#1494;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">qÿtoret zarah</font>] on the incense altar and the possible connection to Exod 30:34-38), (3) performing an incense offering at an unprescribed time (B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 59), or (4) entering the Holy of Holies at an inappropriate time (Lev 16:1-2).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This event is narrated in Lev 10:1-7.</p>
<A NAME="312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=100><b>sn</b> The two young priests had been cut down before they had children; the ranks of the family of Aaron were thereby cut in half in one judgment from God. The significance of the act of judgment was to show that the priests had to sanctify the <sc>Lord before the people &#8211; they were to be examples that the sanctuary and its contents were distinct.</p>
<A NAME="313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=101><b>tn</b> The verb is the Piel preterite from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kahan</font>): &#8220;to function as a priest&#8221; or &#8220;to minister.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=102><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;in the presence of&#8221; can also mean &#8220;during the lifetime of&#8221; (see Gen 11:28; see also BDB 818 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1462;&#1492;</font> II.7.a; cf. NASB, NIV, NCV, NRSV, TEV).</p>
<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=103><b>sn</b> The use of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qarav</font>) forms an interesting wordplay in the passage. The act of making an offering is described by this verb, as was the reference to the priests&#8217; offering of strange fire. Now the ceremonial presentation of the priests is expressed by the same word &#8211; they are being offered to God.</p>
<A NAME="316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=104><b>tn</b> The verb literally means &#8220;make it [the tribe] stand&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1502;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464; &#1488;&#1465;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;</font>, <font face="Scholar">vÿha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amadta </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">oto</font>). The verb is the Hiphil perfect with a <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive; it will take the same imperative nuance as the form before it, but follow in sequence (&#8220;and then&#8221;). This refers to the ceremonial presentation in which the tribe would take its place before Aaron, that is, stand before him and await their assignments. The Levites will function more like a sacred guard than anything else, for they had to protect and care for the sanctuary when it was erected and when it was transported (see J. Milgrom, <i>Studies in Levitical Terminology</i>, 8-10).</p>
<A NAME="317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=105><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿsherÿtu</font>) is the Piel perfect with a <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive; it carries the same volitional force as the preceding verb forms, but may here be subordinated in the sequence to express the purpose or result of the preceding action.</p>
<A NAME="318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=106><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text uses the perfect tense of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew"> &#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;</font>(<font face="Scholar">shamar</font>) with a <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive to continue the instruction of the preceding verse. It may be translated &#8220;and they shall keep&#8221; or &#8220;they must/are to keep,&#8221; but in this context it refers to their appointed duties. The verb is followed by its cognate accusative &#8211; &#8220;they are to keep his keeping,&#8221; or as it is often translated, &#8220;his charge.&#8221; This would mean whatever Aaron needed them to do. But the noun is also used for the people in the next phrase, and so &#8220;charge&#8221; cannot be the meaning here. The verse is explaining that the Levites will have duties to perform to meet the needs of Aaron and the congregation.</p>
<A NAME="319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=107><b>tn</b> The form is the Qal infinitive construct from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avad</font>, &#8220;to serve, to work&#8221;); it is taken here as a verbal noun and means &#8220;by (or in) serving&#8221; (see R. J. Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 36, §195). This explains the verb &#8220;keep [his charge].&#8221; Here too the form is followed by a cognate accusative; they will be there to &#8220;serve the service&#8221; or &#8220;work the work.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=108><b>tn</b> The construction uses the infinitive construct (epexegetically) followed by its cognate accusative. It would convey &#8220;to serve the service of the tabernacle,&#8221; but more simply it may be rendered as &#8220;serving.&#8221; Their spiritual and practical service is to serve.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Levites had the duty of taking care of all the tabernacle and its furnishings, especially in times when it was to be moved. But they were also appointed to be gate-keepers (2 Kgs 22:4; 1 Chr 9:19) in order to safeguard the purity of the place and the activities that went on there. Their offices seem to have then become hereditary in time (1 Sam 1:3); they even took on more priestly functions, such as pronouncing the benediction (Deut 10:8). See further R. de Vaux, <i>Ancient Israel</i>, 348-49. </p>
<A NAME="321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=109><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿnatattah</font>) is normally &#8220;give.&#8221; Here, though, the context refers to the assignment of the Levites to the priests for their duties. The form is the perfect tense with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive, continuing the sequence for the imperfect of instruction.</p>
<A NAME="322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=110><b>tn</b> This emphasis is derived from the simple repetition of the passive participle, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1460;&#1501; &#1504;&#1456;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nÿtunim nÿtunim</font>). See GKC 396 §123.<i>e</i>. The forms serve as the predicate with the subject pronoun.</p>
<A NAME="323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=111><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text simply has the preposition, &#8220;from the Israelites.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=112><b>tc</b> The LXX includes the following words here: &#8220;and all things pertaining to the altar and within the veil.&#8221; Cf. Num 18:7.</p>
<A NAME="325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=113><b>tn</b> The word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zar</font>), usually rendered &#8220;stranger, foreigner, pagan.&#8221; But in this context it simply refers to anyone who is not a Levite or a priest, an unauthorized person or intruder in the tabernacle. That person would be put to death.</p>
<A NAME="326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=114><b>tn</b> The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>) here carries its deictic force, calling attention to the fact that is being declared. It is underscoring the fact that the <sc>Lord himself chose Levi.</p>
<A NAME="327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=115><b>tn</b> Literally &#8220;in the place of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=116><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hakkoti</font>) is the Hiphil infinitive construct of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhah</font>, &#8220;to strike, smite, attack&#8221;). Here, after the idiomatic &#8220;in the day of,&#8221; the form functions in an adverbial clause of time &#8211; &#8220;when I destroyed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=117><b>sn</b> In the Exodus event of the Passover night the principle of substitution was presented. The firstborn child was redeemed by the blood of the Lamb and so belonged to God, but then God chose the Levites to serve in the place of the firstborn. The ritual of consecrating the firstborn son to the <sc>Lord was nevertheless carried out, even with Jesus, the firstborn son of Mary (Luke 2:22-23). </p>
<A NAME="330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=118><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the house of their fathers.&#8221; So also in v. 20.</p>
<A NAME="331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=119><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you are to/shall number them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=120><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;at the mouth of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=121><b>tn</b> The Pual perfect may be given the past perfect translation in this sentence because the act of commanding preceded the act of numbering.</p>
<A NAME="334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=122><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;sons of&#8221; does at the outset refer to the sons of Levi. But as the listing continues the expression refers more to the family groups of the various descendants.</p>
<A NAME="335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=123><b>tn</b> The <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) disjunctive on the noun at the beginning of the verse here signals a greater emphasis on the individual rather than another item in the numbering of the clans. </p>
<A NAME="336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=124><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a father&#8217;s house.&#8221; So also in vv. 30,35.</p>
<A NAME="337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=125><b>tn</b> The disjunctive <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) here introduces a new section, listing the various duties of the clan in the sanctuary. The Gershonites had a long tradition of service here. In the days of David Asaph and his family were prominent as musicians. Others in the clan controlled the Temple treasuries. But in the wilderness they had specific oversight concerning the tent structure, which included the holy place and the holy of holies.</p>
<A NAME="338"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=126><b>tc</b> The phrases in this verse seem to be direct objects without verbs. <i>BHS</i> suggests deleting the sign of the accusative (for which see P. P. Saydon, &#8220;Meanings and Uses of the Particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1514;</font>,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 14 [1964]: 263-75). </p>
<A NAME="339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=127><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for all the service of it [them].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="340"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=128><b>sn</b> Both Moses and Aaron came from this line (6:16-20). During the Hebrew monarchy this branch of the line of Levi was exemplary in music (1 Chr 6:33-48). They were also helpful to Hezekiah in his reforms (1 Chr 29:12-14).</p>
<A NAME="341"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=129><b>tn</b> The construction here is a little different. The Hebrew text uses the participle in construct plural: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shomÿrey</font>, literally &#8220;keepers of&#8221;). The form specifies the duties of the 8,600 Kohathites. The genitive that follows this participle is the cognate <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mishmeret</font>) that has been used before. So the expression indicates that they were responsible for the care of this part of the cult center. There is no reason to delete one of the forms (as does J. A. Paterson, <i>Numbers</i>, 42), for the repetition stresses the central importance of their work.</p>
<A NAME="342"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=130><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿsharÿtu</font>, &#8220;they will serve/minister&#8221;). The imperfect tense in this place, however, probably describes what the priests would do, what they used to do. The verb is in a relative clause: &#8220;which they would serve with them,&#8221; which should be changed to read &#8220;with which they would serve.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="343"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=131><b>tn</b> The word is literally &#8220;its [their] service.&#8221; It describes all the implements that were there for the maintenance of these things.</p>
<A NAME="344"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=132><b>tn</b> The Hebrew construction has &#8220;the leader of the leaders of&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488; &#1504;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">unÿsi</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> nÿsi</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ey</font>). </p>

The participle is a genitive specifying the duty to which he was appointed (thing possessed); its cognate genitive emphasizes that their responsibility was over the holy place. </p>
<A NAME="346"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=134><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has &#8220;these they the families of Merari.&#8221; The independent personal pronoun has an anaphoric use, somewhat equivalent to the copula &#8220;and&#8221; (see R. J. Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 23, §115).</p>
