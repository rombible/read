<A NAME="311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1338><b>sn</b> This lengthy chapter records the mobilization of the troops (vv. 1-5), the war itself (vv. 6-13), the death of the captive women (vv. 14-18), the purification of the nations (vv. 19-24), and the distribution of the spoils (vv. 25-54). For more detail, see G. W. Coats, &#8220;Moses in Midian,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 92 (1973): 3-10; and W. J. Dumbrell, &#8220;Midian &#8211; a Land or a League?&#8221; <i>VT </i>25 (1975): 323-37.</p>
<A NAME="312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1339><b>tn</b> The imperative is followed by its cognate accusative to stress this vengeance. The Midianites had attempted to destroy Israel with their corrupt pagan practices, and now will be judged. The accounts indicate that the effort by Midian was calculated and evil.</p>
<A NAME="313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1340><b>sn</b> The war was commanded by the <sc>Lord and was to be divine vengeance on the Midianites. So it was holy war. No Israelites then could take spoils in this &#8211; it was not a time for plunder and aggrandizement. It was part of the judgment of God upon those who would destroy or pervert his plan and his people.</p>
<A NAME="314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1341><b>sn</b> This would be the last major enterprise that Moses would have to undertake. He would soon die and &#8220;be gathered to his people&#8221; as Aaron was.</p>
<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1342><b>tn</b> The Niphal imperative, literally &#8220;arm yourselves,&#8221; is the call to mobilize the nation for war. It is followed by the jussive, &#8220;and they will be,&#8221; which would then be subordinated to say &#8220;that they may be.&#8221; The versions changed the verb to a<i> </i>Hiphil, but that is unnecessary: &#8220;arm some of yourselves.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1343><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;give.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1344><b>sn</b> Some commentators argue that given the size of the nation (which they reject) the small number for the army is a sign of the unrealistic character of the story. The number is a round number, but it is also a holy war, and God would give them the victory. They are beginning to learn here, and at Jericho, and later against these Midianites under Gideon, that God does not want or need a large army in order to obtain victory.</p>
<A NAME="318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1345><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text uses the idiom that these &#8220;were in his hand,&#8221; meaning that he had the responsibility over them. </p>
<A NAME="319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1346><b>sn</b> It is not clear what articles from the sanctuary were included. <i>Tg. Ps.-J.</i> adds (interpretively) &#8220;the Urim and Thummim.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1347><b>sn</b> Many modern biblical scholars assume that this passage is fictitious. The text says that they killed every male, but Judges accounts for the Midianites. The texts can be harmonized rather simply &#8211; they killed every Midianite who was in the battle. Midianite tribes and cities dotted the whole region, but that does not mean Israel went and killed every single one of them. There apparently was a core of Midianites whom Balaam had influenced to pervert Israel.</p>
<A NAME="3111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1348><b>sn</b> Here again we see that there was no unified empire, but Midianite tribal groups.</p>
<A NAME="3112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1349><b>sn</b> And what was Balaam doing among the Midianites? The implication is strong. This pagan diviner had to submit to the revealed will of God in the oracles, but he nonetheless could be hired. He had been a part of the attempt to destroy Israel that failed; he then apparently became part of the plan, if not the adviser, to destroy them with sexual immorality and pagan ritual.</p>
<A NAME="3113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1350><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;burned with fire.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1351><b>tn</b> The ban applied to the encampments and forts of this group of Midianite tribes living in the region of Moab.</p>
<A NAME="3115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1352><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;steppes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1353><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;River&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but has been supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1354><b>tn</b> Again this expression, &#8220;the Jordan of Jericho,&#8221; is used. It describes the intended location along the Jordan River, the Jordan next to or across from Jericho.</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For the location of Jericho see Map5-B2; Map6-E1; Map7-E1; Map8-E3; Map10-A2; Map11-A1.</p>
<A NAME="3118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1355><b>tn</b> The verb is the Piel perfect of the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;</font><font face="Scholar"> </font>(<font face="Scholar">khayah</font>, &#8220;to live&#8221;). In the Piel stem it must here mean &#8220;preserve alive,&#8221; or &#8220;allow to live,&#8221; rather than make alive.</p>
<A NAME="3119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1356><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;every male among the little ones.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The command in holy war to kill women and children seems in modern times a terrible thing to do (and it was), and something they ought not to have done. But this criticism fails to understand the situation in the ancient world. The entire life of the ancient world was tribal warfare. God&#8217;s judgment is poured out on whole groups of people who act with moral abandonment and in sinful pursuits. See E. J. Young, <i>My Servants, the Prophets</i>, 24; and J. W. Wenham, <i>The Enigma of Evil</i>.</p>
<A NAME="3120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1357><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;every woman who has known [a] man by lying with a man.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1358><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;girls.&#8221; The Hebrew indicates they would be female children, making the selection easy.</p>
<A NAME="3122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1359><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;who have not known [a] man by lying with a man.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1360><b>sn</b> Many contemporary scholars see this story as fictitious, composed by the Jews during the captivity. According to this interpretation, the spoils of war here indicate the wealth of the Jews in captivity, which was to be given to the Levites and priests for the restoration of the sanctuary in Jerusalem. The conclusion drawn from this interpretation is that returning Jews had the same problem as the earlier ones: to gain a foothold in the land. Against this interpretation of the account is a lack of hard evidence, a lack which makes this interpretation appear contrived and subjective. If this was the intent of a later writer, he surely could have stated this more clearly than by making up such a story.</p>
<A NAME="3124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1361><b>sn</b> These verses are a reminder that taking a life, even if justified through holy war, still separates one from the holiness of God. It is part of the violation of the fallen world, and only through the ritual of purification can one be once again made fit for the presence of the <sc>Lord. </p>
<A NAME="3125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1362><b>sn</b> Purification by fire is unique to this event. Making these metallic objects &#8220;pass through the fire&#8221; was not only a way of purifying (burning off impurities), but it seems to be a dedicatory rite as well to the <sc>Lord and his people. The aspect of passing through the fire is one used by these pagans for child sacrifice.</p>
<A NAME="3126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1363><b>tn</b> The idiom here is &#8220;take up the head,&#8221; meaning take a census, or count the totals. </p>
<A NAME="3127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1364><b>tn</b> The verb is the Hiphil, &#8220;you shall cause to be taken up.&#8221; The perfect with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) continues the sequence of the instructions. This raised offering was to be a tax of one-fifth of one percent for the <sc>Lord.</p>
<A NAME="3128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1365><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;people.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1366><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;had plundered.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3130"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1367><b>sn</b> Here again we encounter one of the difficulties of the book, the use of the large numbers. Only twelve thousand soldiers fought the Midianites, but they brought back this amount of plunder, including 32,000 girls. Until a solution for numbers in the book can be found, or the current translation confirmed, one must remain cautious in interpretation.</p>
<A NAME="3131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1368><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;numbered&#8221; has been supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1369><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;soul.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1370><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the men who were fighting.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1371><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to Moses&#8221;; the proper name has been replaced by the pronoun (&#8220;him&#8221;) in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="3135"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1372><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lifted up the head.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="3136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1373><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in our hand.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1374><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;our souls.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1375><b>sn</b> The expression here may include the idea of finding protection from divine wrath, which is so common to Leviticus, but it may also be a thank offering for the fact that their lives had been spared. </p>
<A NAME="3139"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1376><b>sn</b> Or about 420 imperial pounds.</p>
<A NAME="3140"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1377><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text does not repeat the word &#8220;commanders&#8221; here, but it is implied.</p>
<A NAME="3141"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1378><b>tn</b> The purpose of the offering was to remind the <sc>Lord to remember Israel. But it would also be an encouragement for Israel as they remembered the great victory.</p>
