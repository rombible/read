<A NAME="81"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=337><b>sn</b> This chapter has three main sections to it: the lighting of the lamps (vv. 1-4), the separation of the Levites (vv. 5-22), and the work of the Levites (vv. 23-26). Many modern scholars assume that the chapter belongs to P and was added late. But the chapter reiterates some of the Mosaic material concerning the work of the Levites in the new sanctuary. For the chapter to make sense the historical setting must be accepted; if the historical setting is accepted, the chapter is necessary as part of that early legislation. For more reading, see M. Haran, &#8220;The Nature of the<i>&#8217;ohel mo&#8216;edh </i>in the Pentateuchal Sources,&#8221; <i>JSS</i> 5 (1960): 50-65, and &#8220;The Priestly Image of the Tabernacle,&#8221; <i>HUCA</i> 36 (1965): 191-226; and C.
