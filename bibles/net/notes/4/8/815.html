<A NAME="815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=351><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text actually has &#8220;wave the Levites as a wave offering.&#8221; The wave offering was part of the ritual of the peace offering and indicated the priest&#8217;s portion being presented to God in a lifted, waving motion for all to see. The Levites were going to be in the sanctuary to serve the <sc>Lord and assist the priests. It is unclear how Moses would have presented them as wave offerings, but the intent is that they would be living sacrifices, as Paul would later say in Rom 12:1 for all Christians.</p>
