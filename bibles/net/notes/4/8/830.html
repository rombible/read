<A NAME="830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=366><b>tn</b> The verb is the Hitpael of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1496;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khatta</font>&#8217;). In this stem the meaning of the root &#8220;to sin&#8221; is likely to be connected to the noun &#8220;sin/purification&#8221; offering in a denominative sense, although some would take it as a privative usage, &#8220;to remove sin.&#8221; The idea is clear enough: They performed all the ritual in order to purify themselves ceremonially. </p>
