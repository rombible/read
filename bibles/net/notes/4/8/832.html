<A NAME="832"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=368><b>tc</b> The age of <i>twenty-five</i> indicated in v. 24 should be compared with the age of <i>thirty</i> indicated in Num 4:3,23,30. In order to harmonize the numbers given in chapter 4 with the number given in Num 8:24 the LXX (and perhaps its Hebrew <i>Vorlage</i>) has thirty in all of these references. See further G. J. Wenham, <i>Numbers</i> (TOTC 4), 97-98. </p>
