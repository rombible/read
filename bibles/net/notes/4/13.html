<A NAME="131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=577><b>sn</b> Chapter 13 provides the names of the spies sent into the land (vv. 1-16), their instructions (vv. 17-20), their activities (vv. 21-25), and their reports (vv. 26-33). It is a chapter that serves as a good lesson on faith, for some of the spies walked by faith, and some by sight.</p>
<A NAME="132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=578><b>tn</b> The verse starts with the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive on the verb: &#8220;and&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=579><b>tn</b> The imperfect tense with the conjunction is here subordinated to the preceding imperative to form the purpose clause. It can thus be translated &#8220;send&#8230;to investigate.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=580><b>tn</b> The participle here should be given a future interpretation, meaning &#8220;which I am about to give&#8221; or &#8220;which I am going to give.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="135"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=581><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;one man one man of the tribe of his fathers.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=582><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;mouth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=583><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;heads.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=584><b>tc</b> Some scholars emend &#8220;tribe&#8221; to &#8220;sons.&#8221; Cf. Num 1:10.</p>
<A NAME="139"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=585><b>sn</b> The difference in the names is slight, a change from &#8220;he saves&#8221; to &#8220;the <sc>Lord saves.&#8221; The Greek text of the OT used <i>Iesoun</i> for Hebrew<i> Yeshua</i>.</p>
<A NAME="1310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=586><b>tn</b> The preterite with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive is here subordinated to the next verb of the same formation to express a temporal clause.</p>
<A NAME="1311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=587><b>tn</b> The instructions had them first go up into the southern desert of the land, and after passing through that, into the hill country of the Canaanites. The text could be rendered &#8220;into the Negev&#8221; as well as &#8220;through the Negev.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=588><b>tn</b> The form is the perfect tense with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive; the word therefore carries the volitional mood of the preceding imperatives. It may be either another imperative, or it may be subordinated as a purpose clause.</p>
<A NAME="1313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=589><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;see the land, what it is.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=590><b>tn</b> The verb is the Hitpael perfect with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive, from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1511;</font><font face="Scholar"> </font>(<font face="Scholar">khazaq</font>, &#8220;to be strong&#8221;). Here it could mean &#8220;strengthen yourselves&#8221; or &#8220;be courageous&#8221; or &#8220;determined.&#8221; See further uses in 2 Sam 10:12; 1 Kgs 20:22; 1 Chr 19:13. </p>
<A NAME="1315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=591><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Now the days were the days of.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=592><b>sn</b> The reference to the first ripe grapes would put the time somewhere at the end of July. </p>
<A NAME="1317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=593><b>sn</b> <i>Zin</i> is on the southern edge of the land, but <i>Rehob</i> is far north, near Mount Hermon. The spies covered all the land.</p>
<A NAME="1318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=594><b>tn</b> The idiom uses the infinitive construct: &#8220;to enter Hamath,&#8221; meaning, &#8220;on the way that people go to Hamath.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=595><b>tc</b> The MT has the singular, but the ancient versions and Smr have the plural.</p>
<A NAME="1320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=596><b>tn</b> The preterite with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive is here subordinated to the following clause. The first verse gave the account of their journey over the whole land; this section focuses on what happened in the area of Hebron, which would be the basis for the false report. </p>
<A NAME="1321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=597><b>sn</b> These names are thought to be three clans that were in the Hebron area (see Josh 15:14; Judg 1:20). To call them descendants of Anak is usually taken to mean that they were large or tall people (2 Sam 21:18-22). They were ultimately driven out by Caleb.</p>
<A NAME="1322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=598><b>sn</b> The text now provides a brief historical aside for the readers. <i>Zoan</i> was probably the city of Tanis, although that is disputed today by some scholars. It was known in Egypt in the New Kingdom as &#8220;the fields of Tanis,&#8221; which corresponded to the &#8220;fields of Zoar&#8221; in the Hebrew Bible (Ps 78:12, 43). </p>
<A NAME="1323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=599><b>tn</b> The word is related etymologically to the verb for &#8220;slip, slide, bend, totter.&#8221; This would fit the use very well. A pole that would not bend would be hard to use to carry things, but a pole or stave that was flexible would serve well.</p>
<A NAME="1324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=600><b>tn</b> The verb is rendered as a passive because there is no expressed subject. </p>
<A NAME="1325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=601><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Wadi Eshcol.&#8221; The translation &#8220;brook&#8221; is too generous; the Hebrew term refers to a river bed, a ravine or valley through which torrents of rain would rush in the rainy season; at other times it might be completely dry.</p>
<A NAME="1326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=602><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;Eshcol&#8221; is drawn from the Hebrew expression concerning the &#8220;cluster of grapes.&#8221; The word is probably retained in the name Burj Haskeh, two miles north of Damascus.</p>
<A NAME="1327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=603><b>tn</b> The construction literally has &#8220;and they went and they entered,&#8221; which may be smoothed out as a verbal hendiadys, the one verb modifying the other.</p>
<A NAME="1328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=604><b>sn</b> <i>Kadesh</i> is Ain Qadeis, about 50 miles (83 km) south of Beer Sheba. It is called Kadesh-barnea in Num 32:8.</p>
<A NAME="1329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=605><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;They brought back word&#8221;; the verb is the Hiphil preterite of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shuv</font>). </p>
<A NAME="1330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=606><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;told him and said.&#8221; The referent (Moses) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=607><b>tn</b> The relative clause modifies &#8220;the land.&#8221; It is constructed with the relative and the verb: &#8220;where you sent us.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=608><b>sn</b> This is the common expression for the material abundance of the land (see further, F. C. Fensham, &#8220;An Ancient Tradition of the Fertility of Palestine,&#8221; <i>PEQ</i> 98 [1966]: 166-67). </p>
<A NAME="1333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=609><b>tn</b> The word (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1505;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">efes</font>) forms a very strong adversative. The land was indeed rich and fruitful, but&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=610><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the people who are living in the land.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=611><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;by the side [hand] of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=612><b>sn</b> For more discussion on these people groups, see D. J. Wiseman, ed., <i>Peoples of Old Testament Times</i>.<i> </i></p>
<A NAME="1337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=613><b>tn</b> The construction is emphatic, using the cohortative with the infinitive absolute to strengthen it: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492; &#1504;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aloh na</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aleh</font>, &#8220;let us go up&#8221;) with the sense of certainty and immediacy.</p>
<A NAME="1338"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=614><b>tn</b> The perfect tense with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive brings the cohortative idea forward: &#8220;and let us possess it&#8221;; it may also be subordinated to form a purpose or result idea.</p>
<A NAME="1339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=615><b>tn</b> Here again the confidence of Caleb is expressed with the infinitive absolute and the imperfect tense: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1499;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500; &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yakhol nukhal</font>), &#8220;we are fully able&#8221; to do this. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1500;</font><font face="Scholar"> </font>(<font face="Scholar">yakhal</font>) followed by the preposition <i>lamed</i> means &#8220;to prevail over, to conquer.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1340"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=616><b>tn</b> The <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) disjunctive on the noun at the beginning of the clause forms a strong adversative clause here.</p>
<A NAME="1341"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=617><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;an evil report,&#8221; i.e., one that was a defamation of the grace of God.</p>
<A NAME="1342"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=618><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;which we passed over in it&#8221;; the pronoun on the preposition serves as a resumptive pronoun for the relative, and need not be translated literally.</p>
<A NAME="1343"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=619><b>tn</b> The verb is the feminine singular participle from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1500;</font><font face="Scholar"> </font>(&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akhal</font>); it modifies the land as a &#8220;devouring land,&#8221; a bold figure for the difficulty of living in the place.</p>
<A NAME="1344"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=620><b>sn</b> The expression has been interpreted in a number of ways by commentators, such as that the land was infertile, that the Canaanites were cannibals, that it was a land filled with warlike dissensions, or that it denotes a land geared for battle. It may be that they intended the land to seem infertile and insecure.</p>
<A NAME="1345"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=621><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in its midst.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1346"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=622><b>tc</b> The Greek version uses <i>gigantes</i> (&#8220;giants&#8221;) to translate &#8220;the Nephilim,&#8221; but it does not retain the clause &#8220;the sons of Anak are from the Nephilim.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The <i>Nephilim</i> are the legendary giants of antiquity. They are first discussed in Gen 6:4. This forms part of the pessimism of the spies&#8217; report.</p>
<A NAME="1347"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=623><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in our eyes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1348"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=624><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in their eyes.&#8221;</p>
