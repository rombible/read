<A NAME="1171"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=542><b>sn</b> The &#8220;quail&#8221; ordinarily cross the Sinai at various times of the year, but what is described here is not the natural phenomenon. Biblical scholars looking for natural explanations usually note that these birds fly at a low height and can be swatted down easily. But the description here is more of a supernatural supply and provision. See J. Gray, &#8220;The Desert Sojourn of the Hebrews and the Sinai Horeb Tradition,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 4 (1954): 148-54.</p>
