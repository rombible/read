<A NAME="117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=478><b>sn</b> The &#8220;fire of the <sc>Lord&#8221; is supernatural, for it is said to come from the <sc>Lord and not from a natural source. God gave them something to complain about &#8211; something to fear. The other significant place where this &#8220;fire of the <sc>Lord&#8221; destroyed was in the case of Nadab and Abihu who brought strange fire to the altar (Lev 10:2).</p>
