<A NAME="1125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=496><b>sn</b> Moses begins to feel the burden of caring for this people, a stubborn and rebellious people. His complaint shows how contagious their complaining has been. It is one thing to cry out to God about the load of ministry, but it is quite another to do it in such a way as to reflect a lack of faith in God&#8217;s provision. God has to remind the leader Moses that he, the <sc>Lord, can do anything. This is a variation on the theme from Exodus &#8211; &#8220;who am I that I should lead&#8230;.&#8221; </p>
