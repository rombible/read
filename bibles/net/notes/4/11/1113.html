<A NAME="1113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=484><b>tn</b> The Hebrew simply uses the cognate accusative, saying &#8220;they craved a craving&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1493;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; &#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hit</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avvu ta</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">vah</font>), but the context shows that they had this strong craving for food. The verb describes a strong desire, which is not always negative (Ps 132:13-14). But the word is a significant one in the Torah; it was used in the garden story for Eve&#8217;s desire for the tree, and it is used in the Decalogue in the warning against coveting (Deut 5:21). </p>
