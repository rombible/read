<A NAME="1118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=489><b>tn</b> The adverb &#8220;freely&#8221; is from the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khanan</font>, &#8220;to be gracious&#8221;), from which is derived the noun &#8220;grace.&#8221; The word underscores the idea of &#8220;free, without cost, for no reason, gratis.&#8221; Here the simple sense is &#8220;freely,&#8221; without any cost. But there may be more significance in the choice of the words in this passage, showing the ingratitude of the Israelites to God for His deliverance from bondage. To them now the bondage is preferable to the salvation &#8211; this is what angered the <sc>Lord.</p>
