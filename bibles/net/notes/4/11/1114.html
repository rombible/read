<A NAME="1114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=485><b>tc</b> The Greek and the Latin versions read &#8220;and they sat down&#8221; for &#8220;and they returned,&#8221; involving just a change in vocalization (which they did not have). This may reflect the same expression in Judg 20:26. But the change does not improve this verse.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text uses a verbal hendiadys here, one word serving as an adverb for the other. It literally reads &#8220;and they returned and they wept,&#8221; which means they wept again. Here the weeping is put for the complaint, showing how emotionally stirred up the people had become by the craving. The words throughout here are metonymies. The craving is a metonymy of cause, for it would have then led to expressions (otherwise the desires would not have been known). And the weeping is either a metonymy of effect, or of adjunct, for the actual complaints follow.</p>
