<A NAME="1111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=482><b>sn</b> The story of the sending of the quail is a good example of poetic justice, or talionic justice. God had provided for the people, but even in that provision they were not satisfied, for they remembered other foods they had in Egypt. No doubt there was not the variety of foods in the Sinai that might have been available in Egypt, but their life had been bitter bondage there as well. They had cried to the <sc>Lord for salvation, but now they forget, as they remember things they used to have. God will give them what they crave, but it will not do for them what they desire. For more information on this story, see B. J. Malina, <i>The Palestinian Manna Tradition</i>. For the attempt to explain manna and the other foods by natural phenomena, see F. W. Bodenheimer, &#8220;The Manna of Sinai,&#8221; <i>BA</i> 10 (1947): 1-6. </p>
