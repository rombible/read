<A NAME="1161"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=532><b>tn</b> The form of the word is the passive participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1514;&#1467;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kÿtuvim</font>, &#8220;written&#8221;). It is normally taken to mean &#8220;among those registered,&#8221; but it is not clear if that means they were to be among the seventy or not. That seems unlikely since there is no mention of the seventy being registered, and vv. 24-25 says all seventy went out and prophesied. The registration may be to eldership, or the role of the officer.</p>
