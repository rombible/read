<A NAME="1132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=503><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1465;&#1502;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">omen</font>) is often translated &#8220;nurse,&#8221; but the form is a masculine form and would better be rendered as a &#8220;foster parent.&#8221; This does not work as well, though, with the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1465;&#1504;&#1461;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yoneq</font>), the &#8220;sucking child.&#8221; The two metaphors are simply designed to portray the duty of a parent to a child as a picture of Moses&#8217; duty for the nation. The idea that it portrays God as a mother pushes it too far (see M. Noth, <i>Numbers</i> [OTL]<i>, </i>86-87).</p>
