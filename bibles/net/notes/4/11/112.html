<A NAME="112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=473><b>tn</b> The temporal clause uses the Hitpoel infinitive construct from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anan</font>). It is a rare word, occurring in Lam 3:39. With this blunt introduction the constant emphasis of obedience to the word of the <sc>Lord found throughout the first ten chapters suddenly comes to an end. It is probable that the people were tired of moving for several days, the excitement of the new beginning died out quickly in the &#8220;great and terrible wilderness.&#8221; Resentment, frustration, discomfort &#8211; whatever it all involved &#8211; led to complaining and not gratitude.</p>
