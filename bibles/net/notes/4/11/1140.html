<A NAME="1140"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=511><b>sn</b> The <sc>Lord provides Spirit-empowered assistance for Moses. Here is another variation on the theme of Moses&#8217; faith. Just as he refused to lead alone and was given Aaron to share the work, so here he protests the burden and will share it with seventy elders. If God&#8217;s servant will not trust wholeheartedly, that individual will not be used by God as he or she might have been. Others will share in the power and the work. Probably one could say that it was God&#8217;s will for others to share this leadership &#8211; but not to receive it through these circumstances.</p>
