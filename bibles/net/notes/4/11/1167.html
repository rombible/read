<A NAME="1167"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=538><b>tn</b> The Piel<i> </i>participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1511;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿqanne</font>&#8217;) serves as a verb here in this interrogative sentence. The word means &#8220;to be jealous; to be envious.&#8221; That can be in a good sense, such as with the translation &#8220;zeal,&#8221; or it can be in a negative sense as here. Joshua&#8217;s apparent &#8220;zeal&#8221; is questioned by Moses &#8211; was he zealous/envious for Moses sake, or for some other reason? </p>
