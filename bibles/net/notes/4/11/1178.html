<A NAME="1178"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=549><b>sn</b> The name &#8220;the graves of the ones who craved&#8221; is again explained by a wordplay, a popular etymology. In Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514; &#1492;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qivrot hatta</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avah</font>) is the technical name. It is the place that the people craved the meat, longing for the meat of Egypt, and basically rebelled against God. The naming marks another station in the wilderness where the people failed to accept God&#8217;s good gifts with grace and to pray for their other needs to be met.</p>
