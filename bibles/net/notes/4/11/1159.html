<A NAME="1159"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=530><b>tn</b> The text may mean that these men gave ecstatic utterances, much like Saul did when the Spirit came upon him and he made the same prophetic utterances (see 1 Sam 10:10-13). But there is no strong evidence for this (see K. L. Barker, &#8220;Zechariah,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 7:605-6). In fact there is no consensus among scholars as to the origin and meaning of the verb &#8220;prophesy&#8221; or the noun &#8220;prophet.&#8221; It has something to do with speech, being God&#8217;s spokesman or spokeswoman or making predictions or authoritative utterances or ecstatic utterances. It certainly does mean that the same Holy Spirit, the same divine provision that was for Moses to enable him to do the things that God had commanded him to do, was now given to them. It would have included wisdom and power with what they were saying and doing &#8211; in a way that was visible and demonstrable to the people! The people needed to know that the same provision was given to these men, authenticating their leadership among the clans. And so it could not simply be a change in their understanding and wisdom. </p>
