<A NAME="1139"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=510><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;my own ruin&#8221; (NIV). The word &#8220;trouble&#8221; here probably refers to the stress and difficulty of caring for a complaining group of people. The suffix on the noun would be objective, perhaps stressing the indirect object of the noun &#8211; trouble for me. The expression &#8220;on my trouble&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bÿra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ati</font>) is one of the so-called <i>tiqqune sopherim</i>, or &#8220;emendations of the scribes.&#8221; According to this tradition the original reading in v. 15 was [to look] &#8220;on your evil&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1514;&#1462;&#1498;&#1464;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bÿra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">atekha</font>), meaning &#8220;the calamity that you bring about&#8221; for Israel. However, since such an expression could be mistakenly thought to attribute evil to the Lord, the ancient scribes changed it to the reading found in the MT.</p>
