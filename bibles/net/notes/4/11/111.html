<A NAME="111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=472><b>sn</b> The chapter includes the initial general complaints (vv. 1-3), the complaints about food (vv. 4-9), Moses&#8217; own complaint to the <sc>Lord (vv. 10-15), God&#8217;s response to Moses (vv. 16-25), Eldad and Medad (vv. 26-29), and the quail (vv. 30-35). The first part records the burning of the camp, named Taberah. Here is one of the several naming narratives in the wilderness experience. The occasion for divine judgment is the complaining of the people. The passages serve to warn believers of all ages not to murmur as the Israelites did, for such complaining reveals a lack of faith in the power and goodness of God. For additional literature, see W.
