<A NAME="231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1056><b>sn</b> The first part of Balaam&#8217;s activity ends in disaster for Balak &#8211; he blesses Israel. The chapter falls into four units: the first prophecy (vv. 1-10), the relocation (vv. 11-17), the second prophecy (vv. 18-24), and a further location (vv. 25-30).</p>
<A NAME="232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1057><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has &#8220;on the altar,&#8221; but since there were seven of each animal and seven altars, the implication is that this means on each altar.</p>
<A NAME="233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1058><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1497;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1461;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hityatsev</font>) means &#8220;to take a stand, station oneself.&#8221; It is more intentional than simply standing by something. He was to position himself by the sacrifice as Balaam withdrew to seek the oracle.</p>
<A NAME="234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1059><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the word of what he shows me.&#8221; The noun is in construct, and so the clause that follows functions as a noun clause in the genitive. The point is that the word will consist of divine revelation.</p>
<A NAME="235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1060><b>tn</b> The verb is the perfect tense with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive. This clause is dependent on the clause that precedes it.</p>
<A NAME="236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1061><b>sn</b> He went up to a bald spot, to a barren height. The statement underscores the general belief that such tops were the closest things to the gods. On such heights people built their shrines and temples. </p>
<A NAME="237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1062><b>tn</b> The relative pronoun is added here in place of the conjunction to clarify that Balaam is speaking to God and not vice versa.</p>
<A NAME="238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1063><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;word.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1064><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and thus you shall speak.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1065><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text draws the vividness of the scene with the deictic particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>) &#8211; Balaam returned, and <i>there he was</i>, standing there.</p>
<A NAME="2311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1066><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Balaam) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1067><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;took up.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1068><b>tn</b> The passage calls for a past tense translation; since the verb form is a prefixed conjugation, this tense should be classified as a preterite without the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>). Such forms do occur, especially in the ancient poetic passages. </p>
<A NAME="2314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1069><b>sn</b> The opening lines seem to be a formula for the seer to identify himself and the occasion for the oracle. The tension is laid out early; Balaam knows that God has intended to bless Israel, but he has been paid to curse them.</p>
<A NAME="2315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1070><b>tn</b> The figure is erotesis, a rhetorical question. He is actually saying he cannot curse them because God has not cursed them.</p>
<A NAME="2316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1071><b>tn</b> The imperfect tense should here be classified as a potential imperfect.</p>
<A NAME="2317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1072><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;him,&#8221; but here it refers to the Israelites (Israel).</p>
<A NAME="2318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1073><b>sn</b> Balaam reports his observation of the nation of Israel spread out below him in the valley. Based on that vision, and the <sc>Lord&#8217;s word, he announces the uniqueness of Israel &#8211; they are not just like one of the other nations. He was correct, of course; they were the only people linked with the living God by covenant.</p>
<A NAME="2319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1074><b>tn</b> The verb could also be taken as a reflexive &#8211; Israel does not consider itself as among the nations, meaning, they consider themselves to be unique.</p>
<A NAME="2320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1075><b>tn</b> The question is again rhetorical; it means no one can count them &#8211; they are innumerable.</p>
<A NAME="2321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1076><b>tn</b> The perfect tense can also be classified as a potential nuance. It does not occur very often, but does occur several times.</p>
<A NAME="2322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1077><b>sn</b> The reference in the oracle is back to Gen 13:16, which would not be clear to Balaam. But God had described their growth like the dust of the earth. Here it is part of the description of the vast numbers.</p>
<A NAME="2323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1078><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and as a number, the fourth part of Israel.&#8221; The noun in the MT is not in the construct state, and so it should be taken as an adverbial accusative, forming a parallel with the verb &#8220;count.&#8221; The second object of the verse then follows, &#8220;the fourth part of Israel.&#8221; Smr and the LXX have &#8220;and who has numbered&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1505;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">umispar</font>), making this colon more parallel to the preceding one. The editor of <i>BHS</i> prefers this reading.</p>
<A NAME="2324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1079><b>tn</b> The use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>) for the subject of the verb stresses the personal nature &#8211; me.</p>
<A NAME="2325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1080><b>sn</b> Here the seer&#8217;s words link with the promise of Gen 12:3, that whoever blesses Israel will be blessed. Since the blessing belongs to them, the upright (and not Balak), Balaam would like his lot to be with them.</p>
<A NAME="2326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1081><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my latter end.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1082><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1083><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>) here to stress the contrast.</p>
<A NAME="2329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1084><b>tn</b> The construction is emphatic, using the perfect tense and the infinitive absolute to give it the emphasis. It would have the force of &#8220;you have done nothing but bless,&#8221; or &#8220;you have indeed blessed.&#8221; The construction is reminiscent of the call of Abram and the promise of the blessing in such elaborate terms.</p>
<A NAME="2330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1085><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he answered and said.&#8221; The referent (Balaam) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1086><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shamar</font>) means &#8220;to guard, watch, observe&#8221; and so here with a sense of &#8220;be careful&#8221; or even &#8220;take heed&#8221; (so KJV, ASV). The nuance of the imperfect tense would be obligatory: &#8220;I must be careful&#8221; &#8211; to do what? to speak what the <sc>Lord has put in my mouth. The infinitive construct &#8220;to speak&#8221; is therefore serving as the direct object of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;</font><font face="Scholar">.</font> </p>
<A NAME="2332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1087><b>tn</b> The clause is a noun clause serving as the direct object of &#8220;to speak.&#8221; It begins with the sign of the accusative, and then the relative pronoun that indicates the whole clause is the accusative. </p>
<A NAME="2333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1088><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he brought him&#8221;; the referents (Balak and Balaam) have been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1089><b>tn</b> Some scholars do not translate this word as &#8220;Pisgah,&#8221; but rather as a &#8220;lookout post&#8221; or an &#8220;elevated place.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1090><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he built.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1091><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Balaam) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1092><b>tn</b> The verse uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">koh</font>) twice: &#8220;Station yourself <i>here</i>&#8230;I will meet [the <sc>Lord] <i>there</i>.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2338"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1093><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;word.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1094><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Balaam) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2340"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1095><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he.&#8221; The antecedent has been supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2341"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1096><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;took up.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2342"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1097><b>tn</b> The verb probably means &#8220;pay attention&#8221; in this verse.</p>
<A NAME="2343"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1098><b>tn tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;son of man.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2344"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1099><b>tn</b> The verb is the Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</font><font face="Scholar"> </font>(<font face="Scholar">qum</font>, &#8220;to cause to rise; to make stand&#8221;). The meaning here is more of the sense of fulfilling the promises made.</p>
<A NAME="2345"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1100><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text simply has &#8220;I have received [to] bless.&#8221; The infinitive is the object of the verb, telling what he received. Balaam was not actually commanded to bless, but was given the word of blessing so that he was given a divine decree that would bless Israel.</p>
<A NAME="2346"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1101><b>sn</b> The reference is probably to the first speech, where the <sc>Lord blessed Israel. Balaam knows that there is nothing he can do to reverse what God has said.</p>
<A NAME="2347"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1102><b>tn</b> The verb is the Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font><font face="Scholar"> </font>(<font face="Scholar">shuv</font>), meaning &#8220;to cause to return.&#8221; He cannot return God&#8217;s word to him, for it has been given, and it will be fulfilled.</p>
<A NAME="2348"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1103><b>tn</b> These could be understood as impersonal and so rendered &#8220;no one has discovered.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2349"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1104><b>sn</b> The line could mean that God has regarded Israel as the ideal congregation without any blemish or flaw. But it could also mean that God has not looked on their iniquity, meaning, held it against them.</p>
<A NAME="2350"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1105><b>tn</b> The word means &#8220;wrong, misery, trouble.&#8221; It can mean the idea of &#8220;disaster&#8221; as well, for that too is trouble. Here it is parallel to &#8220;iniquity&#8221; and so has the connotation of something that would give God reason to curse them. </p>
<A NAME="2351"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1106><b>tn</b> The people are blessed because God is their king. In fact, the shout of acclamation is among them &#8211; they are proclaiming the <sc>Lord God as their king. The word is used normally for the sound of the trumpet, but also of battle shouts, and then here acclamation. This would represent their conviction that Yahweh is king. On the usage of this Hebrew word see further BDB 929-30 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font>; <i>HALOT</i> 1790-91 s.v.</p>
<A NAME="2352"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=1107><b>tn</b> The form is the Hiphil participle from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatsa</font>&#8217;) with the object suffix. He is the one who brought them out.</p>
<A NAME="2353"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1108><b>sn</b> The expression is &#8220;the horns of the wild ox&#8221; (KJV &#8220;unicorn&#8221;). The point of the image is strength or power. Horns are also used in the Bible to represent kingship (see Pss 89 and 132).</p>
<A NAME="2354"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1109><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;in Jacob.&#8221; But given the context the meaning &#8220;against&#8221; is preferable. The words describe two techniques of consulting God; the first has to do with observing omens in general (&#8220;enchantments&#8221;), and the second with casting lots or arrows of the like (&#8220;divinations&#8221; [Ezek 21:26]). See N. H. Snaith, <i>Leviticus and Numbers</i> (NCB), 295-96.</p>
<A NAME="2355"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=1110><b>tn</b> The form is the preposition &#8220;like, as&#8221; and the word for &#8220;time&#8221; &#8211; according to the time, about this time, now.</p>
<A NAME="2356"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=1111><b>tn</b> The Niphal imperfect here carries the nuance of obligation &#8211; one has to say in amazement that God has done something marvelous or &#8220;it must be said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2357"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=1112><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;look at&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text but have been added in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2358"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=1113><b>tn</b> The pronoun &#8220;their&#8221; has been supplied for clarity; it is not present in the Hebrew text.</p>
<A NAME="2359"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=1114><b>sn</b> The oracle compares Israel first to a lion, or better, lioness, because she does the tracking and hunting of food while the lion moves up and down roaring and distracting the prey. But the lion is also the traditional emblem of Judah, Dan and Gad, as well as the symbol of royalty. So this also supports the motif of royalty as well as power for Israel.</p>
<A NAME="2360"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=1115><b>tn</b> The verb is preceded by the infinitive absolute: &#8220;you shall by no means curse&#8221; or &#8220;do not curse them at all.&#8221; He brought him to curse, and when he tried to curse there was a blessing. Balak can only say it would be better not to bother. </p>
<A NAME="2361"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=1116><b>tn</b> The same construction now works with &#8220;nor bless them at all.&#8221; The two together form a merism &#8211; &#8220;don&#8217;t say anything.&#8221; He does not want them blessed, so Balaam is not to do that, but the curse isn&#8217;t working either.</p>
<A NAME="2362"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=1117><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;answered and said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2363"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=1118><b>tn</b> This first clause, &#8220;all that the <sc>Lord speaks&#8221; &#8211; is a noun clause functioning as the object of the verb that comes at the end of the verse. It is something of an independent accusative case, since it is picked up with the sign of the accusative: &#8220;all that the <sc>Lord speaks, it I must do.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2364"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=1119><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;be pleasing in the eyes of God.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2365"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=1120><b>sn</b> Balak is stubborn, as indeed Balaam is persistent. But Balak still thinks that if another location were used it just might work. Balaam had actually told Balak in the prophecy that other attempts would fail. But Balak refuses to give up so easily. So he insists they perform the ritual and try again. This time, however, Balaam will change his approach, and this will result in a dramatic outpouring of power on him.</p>
<A NAME="2366"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=1121><b>tn</b> Or perhaps as a place name, &#8220;Jeshimon&#8221; (cf. 21:20).</p>
