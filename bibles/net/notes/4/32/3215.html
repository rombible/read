<A NAME="3215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1393><b>tn</b> The sentence begins with &#8220;if they see&#8230;.&#8221; This is the normal way for Hebrew to express a negative oath &#8211; &#8220;they will by no means see&#8230;.&#8221; The sentence is elliptical; it is saying something like &#8220;[May God do so to me] if they see,&#8221; meaning they won&#8217;t see. Of course here God is taking the oath, which is an anthropomorphic act. He does not need to take an oath, and certainly could not swear by anyone greater, but it communicates to people his resolve.</p>
