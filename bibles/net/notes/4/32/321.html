<A NAME="321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1379><b>sn</b> While the tribes are on the other side of Jordan, the matter of which tribes would settle there has to be discussed. This chapter begins the settlement of Israel into the tribal territories, something to be continued in Joshua. The chapter has the petitions (vv. 1-5), the response by Moses (vv. 6-15), the proposal (vv. 16-27), and the conclusion of the matter (vv. 28-42). For literature on this subject, both critical and conservative, see S. E. Loewenstein, &#8220;The Relation of the Settlement of Gad and Reuben in Numbers 32:1-38, Its Background and Its Composition,&#8221; <i>Tarbiz</i> 42 (1972): 12-26; J. Mauchline, &#8220;Gilead and Gilgal, Some Reflections on the Israelite Occupation of Palestine,&#8221; <i>VT 6 </i>(1956): 19-33; and A. Bergmann, &#8220;The Israelite Tribe of Half-Manasseh,&#8221; <i>JPOS</i> 16 (1936): 224-54.</p>
