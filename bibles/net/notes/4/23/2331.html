<A NAME="2331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1086><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shamar</font>) means &#8220;to guard, watch, observe&#8221; and so here with a sense of &#8220;be careful&#8221; or even &#8220;take heed&#8221; (so KJV, ASV). The nuance of the imperfect tense would be obligatory: &#8220;I must be careful&#8221; &#8211; to do what? to speak what the <sc>Lord has put in my mouth. The infinitive construct &#8220;to speak&#8221; is therefore serving as the direct object of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;</font><font face="Scholar">.</font> </p>
