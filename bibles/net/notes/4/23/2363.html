<A NAME="2363"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=1118><b>tn</b> This first clause, &#8220;all that the <sc>Lord speaks&#8221; &#8211; is a noun clause functioning as the object of the verb that comes at the end of the verse. It is something of an independent accusative case, since it is picked up with the sign of the accusative: &#8220;all that the <sc>Lord speaks, it I must do.&#8221; </p>
