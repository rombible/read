<A NAME="941"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=413><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all the days of &#8211; that the cloud settled over the tabernacle.&#8221; &#8220;All&#8221; is the adverbial accusative of time telling how long they camped in one spot &#8211; all. The word is then qualified by the genitive of the thing measured &#8211; &#8220;all of the days&#8221; &#8211; and this in turn is qualified by a noun clause functioning as a genitive after &#8220;days of.&#8221; </p>
