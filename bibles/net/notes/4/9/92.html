<A NAME="92"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=374><b>tn</b> The temporal clause is formed with the infinitive construct of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font><font face="Scholar"> </font>(<font face="Scholar">yatsa</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to go out; to leave&#8221;). This verse indicates that a full year had passed since the exodus and the original Passover; now a second ruling on the Passover is included at the beginning of the second year. This would have occurred immediately after the consecration of the tabernacle, in the month before the census at Sinai.</p>
