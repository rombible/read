<A NAME="922"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=394><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khadal</font>) means &#8220;to cease; to leave off; to fail.&#8221; The implication here is that it is a person who simply neglects to do it. It does not indicate that he forgot, but more likely that he made the decision to leave it undone.</p>
