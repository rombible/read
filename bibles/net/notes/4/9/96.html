<A NAME="96"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=378><b>tn</b> The literal Hebrew expression is &#8220;between the evenings&#8221; (so also in vv. 5, 11). Sunset is certainly one evening; the other may refer to the change in the middle of the afternoon to the late afternoon, or the beginning of dusk. The idea is probably just at twilight, or dusk (see R. B. Allen, <i>TWOT</i> 2:694).</p>
