<A NAME="923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=395><b>sn</b> The pronouncement of such a person&#8217;s penalty is that his life will be cut off from his people. There are at least three possible interpretations for this: physical death at the hand of the community (G. B. Gray, <i>Numbers</i> [ICC], 84-85), physical and/or spiritual death at the hand of God (J. Milgrom, &#8220;A Prolegomenon to Lev 17:11,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 90 [1971]: 154-55), or excommunication or separation from the community (R. A. Cole, <i>Exodus</i> [TOTC]<i>,</i> 109). The direct intervention of God seem to be the most likely in view of the lack of directions for the community to follow. Excommunication from the camp in the wilderness would have been tantamount to a death sentence by the community, and so there really are just two views. </p>
