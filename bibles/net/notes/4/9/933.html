<A NAME="933"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=405><b>sn</b> The explanation and identification of this cloud has been a subject of much debate. Some commentators have concluded that it was identical with the cloud that led the Israelites away from Egypt and through the sea, but others have made a more compelling case that this is a different phenomenon (see <i>ZPEB</i> 4:796). A number of modern scholars see the description as a retrojection from later, perhaps Solomonic times (see G. H. Davies, <i>IDB</i> 3:817). Others have tried to connect it with Ugaritic terminology, but unconvincingly (see T. W. Mann, &#8220;The Pillar of Cloud in the Reed Sea Narrative,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 90 [1971]: 15-30; G. E. Mendenhall, <i>The Tenth Generation</i>, 32-66, 209-13; and R. Good, &#8220;Cloud Messengers?&#8221; <i>UF</i> 10 [1978]: 436-37).</p>
