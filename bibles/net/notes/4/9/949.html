<A NAME="949"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=421><b>tn</b> The MT has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1470;&#1497;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">o-yamim</font>). Most translators use &#8220;or a year&#8221; to interpret this expression in view of the sequence of words leading up to it, as well as in comparison with passages like Judg 17:10 and 1 Sam 1:3 and 27:7. See also the uses in Gen 40:4 and 1 Kgs 17:15. For the view that it means four months, see F. S. North, &#8220;Four Month Season of the Hebrew Bible,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 11 (1961): 446-48.</p>
