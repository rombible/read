<A NAME="926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=398><b>tn</b> The verb is the simple perfect tense with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive. It is therefore the equivalent to the imperfect that comes before it. The desiderative imperfect fits this usage well, since the alien is not required to keep the feast, but may indeed desire to do so. </p>
