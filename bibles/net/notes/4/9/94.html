<A NAME="94"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=376><b>sn</b> For a detailed study note on the Passover, see the discussion with the original institution in Exod 12. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1505;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pesakh</font>) &#8211; here in pause and with the article &#8211; has become the technical name for the spring festival of Israel. In Exod 12 the name is explained by the use of the verb &#8220;to pass over&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">avar</font>), indicating that the angel of death would pass over the house with the blood applied. Many scholarly attempts have been made to supply the etymology of the word, but none has been compelling enough to be accepted by a large number of biblical scholars. For general literature on the Passover, see J. B. Segal, <i>The Hebrew Passover</i>, as well as the Bible dictionaries and encyclopedias. </p>
