<A NAME="181"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=829><b>sn</b> This chapter and the next may have been inserted here to explain how the priests are to function because in the preceding chapter Aaron&#8217;s position was affirmed. The chapter seems to fall into four units: responsibilities of priests (vv. 1-7), their portions (vv. 8-19), responsibilities of Levites (vv. 20-24), and instructions for Levites (vv. 25-32).</p>
<A NAME="182"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=830><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your father&#8217;s house.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="183"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=831><b>sn</b> The responsibility for the sanctuary included obligations relating to any violation of the sanctuary. This was stated to forestall any further violations of the sanctuary. The priests were to pay for any ritual errors, primarily if any came too near. Since the priests and Levites come near all the time, they risk violating ritual laws more than any. So, with the great privileges come great responsibilities. The bottom line is that they were responsible for the sanctuary.</p>
<A NAME="184"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=832><b>sn</b> The verb forms a wordplay on the name Levi, and makes an allusion to the naming of the tribe Levi by Leah in the book of Genesis. There Leah hoped that with the birth of Levi her husband would be attached to her. Here, with the selection of the tribe to serve in the sanctuary, there is the wordplay again showing that the Levites will be attached to Aaron and the priests. The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yillavu</font>), which forms a nice wordplay with <font face="Scholar">Levi</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1461;&#1493;&#1460;&#1497;</font>). The tribe will now be attached to the sanctuary. The verb is the imperfect with a <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) that shows volitive sequence after the imperative, here indicating a purpose clause.</p>
<A NAME="185"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=833><b>tn</b> The clause is a circumstantial clause because the disjunctive <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) is on a nonverb to start the clause. </p>
<A NAME="186"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=834><b>tn</b> Now the sentence uses the Niphal perfect with a <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive from the same root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font><font face="Scholar"> </font>(<font face="Scholar">lavah</font>).</p>
<A NAME="187"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=835><b>tn</b> The word is &#8220;stranger, alien,&#8221; but it can also mean Israelites here.</p>
<A NAME="188"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=836><b>tn</b> The clause is a purpose clause, and the imperfect tense a final imperfect.</p>
<A NAME="189"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=837><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;taken.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=838><b>tn</b> The infinitive construct in this sentence is from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avad</font>), and so is the noun that serves as its object: to serve the service.</p>
<A NAME="1811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=839><b>tn</b> This is an uncommon root. It may be connected to the word &#8220;anoint&#8221; as here (see RSV). But it may also be seen as an intended parallel to &#8220;perpetual due&#8221; (see Gen 47:22; Exod 29:28; Lev 6:11 [HT]).</p>
<A NAME="1812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=840><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from the fire.&#8221; It probably refers to those parts that were not burned.</p>
<A NAME="1813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=841><b>tn</b> This form may be classified as a perfect of resolve &#8211; he has decided to give them to them, even though this is a listing of what they will receive.</p>
<A NAME="1814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=842><b>tn</b> The &#8220;ban&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1461;&#1512;&#1462;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kherem</font>) in Hebrew describes that which is exclusively the <sc>Lord&#8217;s, either for his sanctuary use, or for his destruction. It seems to refer to an individual&#8217;s devoting something freely to God.</p>
<A NAME="1815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=843><b>tn</b> The construction uses the infinitive absolute and the imperfect tense of the verb &#8220;to redeem&#8221; in order to stress the point &#8211; they were to be redeemed. N. H. Snaith suggests that the verb means to get by payment what was not originally yours, whereas the other root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1464;&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ga</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) means to get back what was originally yours (<i>Leviticus and Numbers</i> [NCB], 268).</p>
<A NAME="1816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=844><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;throw, toss.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=845><b>sn</b> Salt was used in all the offerings; its importance as a preservative made it a natural symbol for the covenant which was established by sacrifice. Even general agreements were attested by sacrifice, and the phrase &#8220;covenant of salt&#8221; speaks of such agreements as binding and irrevocable. Note the expression in Ezra 4:14, &#8220;we have been salted with the salt of the palace.&#8221; See further J. F. Ross, <i>IDB</i> 4:167.</p>
<A NAME="1818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=846><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;of property&#8221; is supplied as a clarification.</p>
<A NAME="1819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=847><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text uses the infinitive construct of the verb &#8220;to bear&#8221; with the <font face="Scholar">lamed</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font>) preposition to express the result of such an action. &#8220;To bear their sin&#8221; would mean that they would have to suffer the consequences of their sin. </p>
<A NAME="1820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=848><b>tn</b> The verse begins with the perfect tense of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avad</font>) with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive, making the form equal to the instructions preceding it. As its object the verb has the cognate accusative &#8220;service.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=849><b>sn</b> The Levites have the care of the tent of meeting, and so they are responsible for any transgressions against it.</p>
<A NAME="1822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=850><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they&#8221;; the referent (the Levites) has been supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=851><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text uses both the verb and the object from the same root to stress the point: They will not inherit an inheritance. The inheritance refers to land.</p>
<A NAME="1824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=852><b>tn</b> The classification of the perfect tense here too could be the perfect of resolve, since this law is declaring what will be their portion &#8211; &#8220;I have decided to give.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=853><b>tn</b> In the Hebrew text the verb has no expressed subject (although the &#8220;Israelites&#8221; is certainly intended), and so it can be rendered as a passive.</p>
<A NAME="1826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=854><b>tn</b> The verb in this clause is<i> </i>the<i> </i>Hiphil perfect with a <i>vav </i>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive; it has the same force as an imperfect of instruction: &#8220;when&#8230;then you are to offer up.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=855><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khashav</font>, &#8220;to reckon; to count; to think&#8221;); it is the same verb used for &#8220;crediting&#8221; Abram with righteousness. Here the tithe of the priests will be counted as if it were a regular tithe.</p>
<A NAME="1828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=856><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fullness,&#8221; meaning the fullness of the harvest, i.e., a full harvest.</p>
<A NAME="1829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=857><b>tn</b> The construction is &#8220;every raised offering of the <sc>Lord&#8221;; the genitive here is probably to be taken as a genitive of worth &#8211; the offering that is due the <sc>Lord.</p>
<A NAME="1830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=858><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;its hallowed thing.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=859><b>tn</b> The wording of this verse is confusing; it may be that it is addressed to the priests, telling them how to deal with the offerings of the Levites. </p>
<A NAME="1832"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=860><b>tn</b> The clause begins with the infinitive construct with its preposition and suffixed subject serving to indicate the temporal clause.</p>
<A NAME="1833"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=861><b>tn</b> The verb is the perfect tense with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive; it functions as the equivalent of the imperfect of permission. </p>
<A NAME="1834"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=862><b>tn</b> The final clause could also be rendered &#8220;in order that you do not die.&#8221; The larger section can also be interpreted differently; rather than take it as a warning, it could be taken as an assurance that when they do all of this they will not be profaning it and so will not die (R. K. Harrison, <i>Numbers </i>[WEC], 253).</p>
