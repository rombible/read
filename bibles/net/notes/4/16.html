<A NAME="161"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=750><b>sn</b> There are three main movements in the story of ch. 16. The first is the rebellion itself (vv. 1-19). The second is the judgment (vv. 20-35). Third is the atonement for the rebels (vv. 36-50). The whole chapter is a marvelous account of a massive rebellion against the leaders that concludes with reconciliation. For further study see G. Hort, &#8220;The Death of Qorah,&#8221; <i>ABR</i> 7 (1959): 2-26; and J. Liver, &#8220;Korah, Dathan and Abiram,&#8221; <i>Studies</i> <i>in the Bible</i> (ScrHier 8), 189-217.</p>
<A NAME="162"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=751><b>tc</b> The MT reading is plural (&#8220;the sons of Reuben&#8221;); the Smr and LXX have the singular (&#8220;the son of Reuben&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="163"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=752><b>tn</b> In the Hebrew text there is no object for the verb &#8220;took.&#8221; The translation presented above supplies the word &#8220;men.&#8221; However, it is possible that the MT has suffered damage here. The LXX has &#8220;and he spoke.&#8221; The Syriac and Targum have &#8220;and he was divided.&#8221; The editor of <i>BHS</i> suggests that perhaps the MT should be emended to &#8220;and he arose.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="164"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=753><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;princes&#8221; (so KJV, ASV). </p>
<A NAME="165"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=754><b>tn</b> These men must have been counselors or judges of some kind. </p>
<A NAME="166"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=755><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;men of name,&#8221; or &#8220;men of renown.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="167"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=756><b>tn</b> The meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1470;&#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rab-lakhem</font>) is something like &#8220;you have assumed far too much authority.&#8221; It simply means &#8220;much to you,&#8221; perhaps &#8220;you have gone to far,&#8221; or &#8220;you are overreaching yourselves&#8221; (M. Noth, <i>Numbers </i>[OTL], 123). He is objecting to the exclusiveness of the system that Moses has been introducing.</p>
<A NAME="168"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=757><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fell on his face.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="169"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=758><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=759><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his congregation&#8221; or &#8220;his community.&#8221; The expression is unusual, but what it signifies is that Korah had set up a rival &#8220;Israel&#8221; with himself as leader.</p>
<A NAME="1611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=760><b>tn</b> The verb is the Piel<i> </i>perfect. There is no imperfect tense before this, which makes the construction a little difficult. If the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) is classified as a consecutive, then the form would stand alone as an equivalent to the imperfect, and rendered as a modal nuance such as &#8220;would you [now] seek,&#8221; or as a progressive imperfect, &#8220;are you seeking.&#8221; This latter nuance can be obtained by treating it as a regular perfect tense, with an instantaneous nuance: &#8220;do you [now] seek.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Moses discerned correctly the real motivation for the rebellion. Korah wanted to be the high priest because he saw how much power there was in the spiritual leadership in Israel. He wanted something like a general election with himself as the candidate and his supporters promoting him. The great privilege of being a Levite and serving in the sanctuary was not enough for him &#8211; the status did not satisfy him. Korah gave no rebuttal. The test would be one of ministering with incense. This would bring them into direct proximity with the <sc>Lord. If God honored Korah as a ministering priest, then it would be settled. But Moses accuses them of rebellion against the <sc>Lord, because the <sc>Lord had chosen Aaron to be the priest.</p>
<A NAME="1612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=761><b>sn</b> The question indicates that they had been murmuring against Aaron, that is, expressing disloyalty and challenging his leadership. But it is actually against the <sc>Lord that they had been murmuring because the <sc>Lord had put Aaron in that position.</p>
<A NAME="1613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=762><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Moses sent to summon.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qara</font>&#8217;) followed by the <font face="Scholar">lamed</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font>) preposition does not mean &#8220;call to&#8221; but &#8220;summon.&#8221; This is a command performance; for them to appear would be to submit to Moses&#8217; authority. This they will not do.</p>
<A NAME="1614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=763><b>tn</b> The imperfect tense <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">na</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aleh</font>) expresses their unwillingness to report: &#8220;we are not willing,&#8221; or &#8220;we <i>will</i> not.&#8221; The verb means &#8220;to go up.&#8221; It is used in the sense of appearing before an authority or a superior (see, e.g., Gen 46:31; Deut 25:7; Judg 4:5).</p>
<A NAME="1615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=764><b>tn</b> The question is rhetorical. It was not a small thing to them &#8211; it was a big thing. </p>
<A NAME="1616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=765><b>tn</b> The modern scholar who merely sees these words as belonging to an earlier tradition about going up to the land of Canaan that flows with milk and honey misses the irony here. What is happening is that the text is showing how twisted the thinking of the rebels is. They have turned things completely around. Egypt was the land flowing with milk and honey, not Canaan where they will die. The words of rebellion are seldom original, and always twisted.</p>
<A NAME="1617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=766><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">histarer</font>) is the Hitpael infinitive absolute that emphasizes the preceding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tistarer</font>), the Hitpael<i> </i>imperfect tense (both forms having metathesis). The verb means &#8220;to rule; to act like a prince; to make oneself a prince.&#8221; This is the only occurrence of the reflexive for this verb. The exact nuance is difficult to translate into English. But they are accusing Moses of seizing princely power for himself, perhaps making a sarcastic reference to his former status in Egypt. The rebels here are telling Moses that they had discerned his scheme, and so he could not &#8220;hoodwink&#8221; them (cf. NEB).</p>
<A NAME="1618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=767><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1507;</font><font face="Scholar"> </font>(&#8217;<font face="Scholar">af</font>) has the sense of &#8220;in addition.&#8221; It is not a common use.</p>
<A NAME="1619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=768><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;will you bore out the eyes of these men?&#8221; The question is &#8220;Will you continue to mislead them?&#8221; (or &#8220;hoodwink&#8221; them). In Deut 16:19 it is used for taking a bribe; something like that kind of deception is intended here. They are simply stating that Moses is a deceiver who is misleading the people with false promises.</p>
<A NAME="1620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=769><b>tn</b> The verb means &#8220;to turn toward&#8221;; it is a figurative expression that means &#8220;to pay attention to&#8221; or &#8220;to have regard for.&#8221; So this is a prayer against Dathan and Abiram.</p>
<A NAME="1621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=770><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and take, a man, his censer.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=771><b>tn</b> This verb and the following one are both perfect tenses with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutives. Following the imperative they carry the same force, but in sequence. </p>
<A NAME="1623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=772><b>tn</b> This clause is clearly foundational for the clause that follows, the appearance of the <sc>Lord; therefore it should be subordinated to the next as a temporal clause (one preterite followed by another preterite may be so subordinated).</p>
<A NAME="1624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=773><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hibbadÿlu</font>), the Niphal<i> </i>imperative of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1500;</font><font face="Scholar"> </font>(<font face="Scholar">badal</font>). This is the same word that was just used when Moses reminded the Levites that they had been separated from the community to serve the <sc>Lord.</p>
<A NAME="1625"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=774><b>sn</b> The group of people siding with Korah is meant, and not the entire community of the people of Israel. They are an assembly of rebels, their &#8220;community&#8221; consisting in their common plot.</p>
<A NAME="1626"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=775><b>sn</b> It is Moses and Aaron who prostrate themselves; they have the good of the people at heart.</p>
<A NAME="1627"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=776><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;the God of the spirits of all humanity [flesh]&#8221; is somewhat difficult. The Hebrew text says <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1497; &#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1465;&#1514; &#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohey harukhot lÿkhol-basar</font>). This expression occurs in Num 27:16 again. It also occurs in some postbiblical texts, a fact which has prompted some scholars to conclude that it is a late addition. The words clearly show that Moses is interceding for the congregation. The appeal in the verse is that it is better for one man to die for the whole nation than the whole nation for one man (see also John 11:50).</p>
<A NAME="1628"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=777><b>tn</b> The verb is the Qal imperfect <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1462;&#1495;&#1457;&#1496;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yekheta</font>&#8217;); it refers to the sinful rebellion of Korah, but Moses is stating something of a principle: &#8220;One man sins, and will you be angry&#8230;.&#8221; A past tense translation would assume that this is a preterite use of the imperfect (without <font face="Scholar">vav</font> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>] consecutive). </p>
<A NAME="1629"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=778><b>tn</b> The motif of &#8220;going up&#8221; is still present; here the Hebrew text says &#8220;go up&#8221; (the Niphal imperative &#8211; &#8220;go up yourselves&#8221;) from their tents, meaning, move away from them. </p>
<A NAME="1630"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=779><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;rose up.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1631"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=780><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rasha</font>&#8217;) has the sense of a guilty criminal. The word &#8220;wicked&#8221; sometimes gives the wrong connotation. These men were opposing the <sc>Lord, and so were condemned as criminals &#8211; they were guilty. The idea of &#8220;wickedness&#8221; therefore applies in that sense. </p>
<A NAME="1632"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=781><b>tn</b> The preposition <font face="Scholar">bet </font>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font>) in this line is causal &#8211; &#8220;on account of their sins.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1633"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=782><b>sn</b> The impression is that the people did not hear what the <sc>Lord said to Moses, but only what Moses said to the people as a result. They saw the brilliant cloud, and perhaps heard the sound of his voice, but the relaying of the instructions indicates they did not hear the actual instruction from the <sc>Lord himself. </p>
<A NAME="1634"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=783><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nitsavim</font>) suggests a defiant stance, for the word is often used in the sense of taking a stand for or against something. It can also be somewhat neutral, having the sense of positioning oneself for a purpose. </p>
<A NAME="1635"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=784><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in this.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1636"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=785><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text simply has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;&#1500;&#1465;&#1488; &#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki-lo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> millibbi</font>, &#8220;for not from my heart&#8221;). The heart is the center of the will, the place decisions are made (see H. W. Wolff, <i>Anthropology of the Old Testament</i>). Moses is saying that the things he has done have not come &#8220;from the will of man&#8221; so to speak &#8211; and certainly not from some secret desire on his part to seize power.</p>
<A NAME="1637"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=786><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;if like the death of every man they die.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1638"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=787><b>tn</b> The noun is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1511;&#1467;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pÿquddah</font>, &#8220;appointment, visitation&#8221;). The expression refers to a natural death, parallel to the first expression.</p>
<A NAME="1639"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=788><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bara</font>&#8217;) is normally translated &#8220;create&#8221; in the Bible. More specifically it means to fashion or make or do something new and fresh. Here the verb is joined with its cognate accusative to underscore that this will be so different everyone will know it is of God.</p>
<A NAME="1640"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=789><b>tn</b> The figures are personifications. But they vividly describe the catastrophe to follow &#8211; which was very much like a mouth swallowing them.</p>
<A NAME="1641"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=790><b>tn</b> The word is &#8220;life&#8221; or &#8220;lifetime&#8221;; it certainly means their lives &#8211; they themselves. But the presence of this word suggest more. It is an accusative specifying the state of the subject &#8211; they will go down <i>alive</i> to Sheol.</p>
<A NAME="1642"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=791><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;Sheol&#8221; in the Bible can be used four different ways: the grave, the realm of the departed [wicked] spirits or Hell, death in general, or a place of extreme danger (one that will lead to the grave if God does not intervene). The usage here is certainly the first, and very likely the second as well. A translation of &#8220;pit&#8221; would not be inappropriate. Since they will go down there alive, it is likely that they will sense the deprivation and the separation from the land above. See H. W. Robinson, <i>Inspiration and Revelation in the Old Testament</i>; N. J. Tromp, <i>Primitive Conceptions of Death and the Netherworld in the Old Testament </i>(BibOr 21), 21-23; and A. Heidel, <i>The Gilgamesh Epic, </i>especially ch. 3.</p>
<A NAME="1643"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=792><b>tn</b> The initial temporal clause is standard: It begins with the temporal indicator &#8220;and it was,&#8221; followed here by the Piel infinitive construct with the preposition and the subjective genitive suffix. &#8220;And it happened when he finished.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1644"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=793><b>tn</b> The infinitive construct with the preposition <font face="Scholar">lamed</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font>) functions here as the direct object of the preceding infinitive. It tells what he finished.</p>
<A NAME="1645"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=794><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all Israel.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1646"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=795><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;voice.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1647"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=796><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lest.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1648"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=797><b>tn</b> For a discussion of the fire of the <sc>Lord, see J. C. H. Laughlin, &#8220;The Strange Fire of Nadab and Abihu,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 95 (1976): 559-65.</p>
<A NAME="1649"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=798><b>sn</b> Beginning with <b>16:36</b>, the verse numbers through <b>17:13</b> in the English Bible differ from the verse numbers in the Hebrew text (<i>BHS</i>), with <b>16:36</b> ET = <b>17:1</b> HT, <b>16:37</b> ET = <b>17:2</b> HT, <b>17:1</b> ET = <b>17:16</b> HT, etc., through <b>17:13</b> ET = <b>17:28</b> HT. With <b>18:1</b> the verse numbers in the ET and HT are again the same. But in the English chap. 17 there are two parts: Aaron&#8217;s rod budding (1-9), and the rod preserved as a memorial (10-13). Both sections begin with the same formula.</p>
<A NAME="1650"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=799><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;say to.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1651"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=800><b>tn</b> The verb is the jussive with a <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) coming after the imperative; it may be subordinated to form a purpose clause (&#8220;that he may pick up&#8221;) or the object of the imperative.</p>
<A NAME="1652"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=801><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text just has &#8220;fire,&#8221; but it would be hard to conceive of this action apart from the idea of coals of fire.</p>
<A NAME="1653"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=802><b>tn</b> The expression is &#8220;in/by/against their life.&#8221; That they sinned against their life means that they brought ruin to themselves. </p>
<A NAME="1654"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=803><b>tn</b> The form is the perfect tense with <i>vav</i><font face="Scholar"> </font>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) <i>consecutive</i><font face="Scholar">.</font> But there is no expressed subject for &#8220;and they shall make them,&#8221; and so it may be treated as a passive (&#8220;they shall [must] be made&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1655"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=804><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from the seed of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1656"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=805><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;hand.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1657"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=806><b>sn</b> The whole congregation here is trying to project its guilt on Moses and Aaron. It was they and their rebellion that brought about the deaths, not Moses and Aaron. The <sc>Lord had punished the sinners. The fact that the leaders had organized a rebellion against the <sc>Lord was forgotten by these people. The point here is that the Israelites had learned nothing of spiritual value from the event. </p>
<A NAME="1658"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=807><b>tn</b> The temporal clause is constructed with the temporal indicator (&#8220;and it was&#8221;) followed by the Niphal infinitive construct and preposition.</p>
<A NAME="1659"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=808><b>tn</b> The verse uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿhinneh</font>, &#8220;and behold&#8221;). This is the deictic particle &#8211; it is used to point things out, suddenly calling attention to them, as if the reader were there. The people turned to look toward the tent &#8211; and there is the cloud! </p>
<A NAME="1660"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=809><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they fell on their faces.&#8221;</p>
