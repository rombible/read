<A NAME="2525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1195><b>sn</b> The atonement that he made in this passage refers to the killing of the two obviously blatant sinners. By doing this he dispensed with any animal sacrifice, for the sinners themselves died. In Leviticus it was the life of the substitutionary animal that was taken in place of the sinners that made atonement. The point is that sin was punished by death, and so God was free to end the plague and pardon the people. God&#8217;s holiness and righteousness have always been every bit as important as God&#8217;s mercy and compassion, for without righteousness and holiness mercy and compassion mean nothing.</p>
