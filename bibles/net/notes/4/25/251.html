<A NAME="251"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1171><b>sn</b> Chapter 25 tells of Israel&#8217;s sins on the steppes of Moab, and God&#8217;s punishment. In the overall plan of the book, here we have another possible threat to God&#8217;s program, although here it comes from within the camp (Balaam was the threat from without). If the Moabites could not defeat them one way, they would try another. The chapter has three parts: fornication (vv. 1-3), God&#8217;s punishment (vv. 4-9), and aftermath (vv. 10-18). See further G. E. Mendenhall, <i>The Tenth Generation</i>, 105-21; and S. C. Reif, &#8220;What Enraged Phinehas? A Study of Numbers 25:8,&#8221; <i>JBL </i>90<i> </i>(1971): 200-206.<i> </i></p>
