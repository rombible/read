<A NAME="2520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1190><b>tn</b> The word for &#8220;zeal&#8221; now occurs a third time. While some English versions translate this word here as &#8220;jealousy&#8221; (KJV, ASV, NASB, NRSV), it carries the force of God&#8217;s passionate determination to defend his rights and what is right about the covenant and the community and parallels the &#8220;zeal&#8221; that Phinehas had just demonstrated.</p>
