<A NAME="1047"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=471><b>sn</b> These two formulaic prayers were offered by Moses at the beginning and at the end of the journeys. They prayed for the <sc>Lord to fight ahead of the nation when it was on the move, and to protect them when they camped. The theme of the first is found in Ps 68:1. The prayers reflect the true mentality of holy war, that it was the <sc>Lord who fought for Israel and defended her. The prayers have been included in the prayer book for synagogue services.</p>
