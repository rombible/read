<A NAME="1023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=447><b>sn</b> This section is somewhat mechanical: It begins with an introduction (vv. 11, 12), and then begins with Judah (vv. 13-17), followed by the rest of the tribes (vv. 18-27), and finally closes with a summary (v. 28). The last few verses (vv. 29-36) treat the departure of Hobab. </p>
