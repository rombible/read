<A NAME="104"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=428><b>sn</b> The instructions are not clearly spelled out here. But the trumpets were to be made of silver ingots beaten out into a sheet of silver and then bent to form a trumpet. There is archaeological evidence of silver smelting as early as 3000 <sc>b.c. Making silver trumpets would have been a fairly easy thing for the Israelites to do. The trumpet would have been straight, with a tapered form, very unlike the &#8220;ram&#8217;s horn&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1465;&#1508;&#1464;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shofar</font>). The trumpets were used by the priests in Israel from the outset, but later were used more widely. The sound would be sharp and piercing, but limited in scope to a few notes. See further C. Sachs, <i>The History of Musical Instruments</i>.</p>
