<A NAME="1036"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=460><b>sn</b> There is a problem with the identity of Hobab. The MT says that he is the son of Reuel, making him the brother-in-law of Moses. But Judg 4:11 says he is the father-in-law. In Judg 1:16; 4:11 Hobab is traced to the Kenites, but in Exod 3:1 and 18:1 Jethro (Reuel) is priest of Midian. Jethro is identified with Reuel on the basis of Exod 2:18 and 3:1, and so Hobab becomes Moses&#8217; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1514;&#1461;&#1503;</font><font face="Scholar"> </font>(<font face="Scholar">khoten</font>), a relative by marriage and perhaps brother-in-law. There is not enough information to decide on the identity and relationships involved here. Some suggest that there is one person with the three names (G. B. Gray, <i>Numbers</i> [ICC], 93); others suggest Hobab is a family name (R. F. Johnson, <i>IDB</i> 2:615), and some suggest that the expression &#8220;the son of Reuel the Midianite&#8221; had dropped out of the genealogy of Judges, leading to the conflict (J. Crichton, <i>ISBE</i> 2:1055). If Hobab is the same as Jethro, then Exod 18:27 does not make much sense, for Jethro did go home. On this basis many conclude Hobab is a brother-in-law. This would mean that after Jethro returned home, Moses conversed with Hobab, his brother-in-law. For more discussion, see the articles and the commentaries.</p>
