<A NAME="271"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1242><b>sn</b> For additional information on this section, see N. H. Snaith, &#8220;The Daughters of Zelophehad,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 16 (1966): 124-27; and J. Weingreen, &#8220;The Case of the Daughters of Zelophehad,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 16 (1966): 518-22.</p>
<A NAME="272"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1243><b>tc</b> The phrase &#8220;of the families of Manasseh&#8221; is absent from the Latin Vulgate.</p>
<A NAME="273"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1244><b>tn</b> This clause begins with a <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) on a pronoun, marking it out as a disjunctive <i>vav. </i>In this context it fits best to take it as a circumstantial clause introducing concession.</p>
<A NAME="274"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1245><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the midst of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="275"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1246><b>tn</b> The word order is emphatic: &#8220;but in/on account of his own sins he died.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="276"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1247><b>tn</b> That is, the possession of land, or property, among the other families of their tribe.</p>
<A NAME="277"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1248><b>tn</b> The word is &#8220;brothers,&#8221; but this can be interpreted more loosely to relatives. So also in v. 7.</p>
<A NAME="278"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1249><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[the daughters of Zelophehad] speak right&#8221; (using the participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1465;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1465;&#1514;</font> [<font face="Scholar">dovÿrot</font>] with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503;</font> [<font face="Scholar">ken</font>]). </p>
<A NAME="279"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1250><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text uses the infinitive absolute with the imperfect tense. The imperfect is functioning as the imperfect of instruction, and so the infinitive strengthens the force of the instruction.</p>
<A NAME="2710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1251><b>tn</b> The verb is the Hiphil perfect with a <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive, from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avar</font>, &#8220;to pass over&#8221;). Here it functions as the equivalent of the imperfect of instruction: &#8220;and you shall cause to pass,&#8221; meaning, &#8220;transfer.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1252><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a man, if he dies.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1253><b>tn</b> The expression is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1467;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1514; &#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khuqqat mishpat</font>, &#8220;a statute of judgment&#8221;), which means it is a fixed enactment that determines justice. It is one which is established by God.<i> </i></p>
<A NAME="2713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1254><b>sn</b> See further J. Lindblom, &#8220;Lot Casting in the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 12 (1962): 164-78; E. Lipinski, &#8220;Urim and Thummim,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 20 (1970): 495-96; and S. E. Loewenstamm, &#8220;The Death of Moses,&#8221; <i>Tarbiz </i>27 (1957/58): 142-57.</p>
<A NAME="2714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1255><b>tc</b> The Greek version adds &#8220;which is Mount Nebo.&#8221; This is a typical scribal change to harmonize two passages.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The area is in the mountains of Moab; Deut 34:1 more precisely identifies it as Mount Nebo.</p>
<A NAME="2715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1256><b>tn</b> The imperative could be subordinated to the first to provide a purpose clause, although a second instruction fits well enough.</p>
<A NAME="2716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1257><b>tn</b> This perfect tense would best be classified as a perfect of resolve: &#8220;which I have decided to give.&#8221; God had not yet given the land to them, but it was certain he would.</p>
<A NAME="2717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1258><b>tn</b> The first verb is a perfect tense with a <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive, and the second verb is also. In such parallel clauses, the first may be subordinated, here as a temporal clause.</p>
<A NAME="2718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1259><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;people.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1260><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;was gathered.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;to his ancestors&#8221; is elided in the Hebrew text, but is an implied repetition from the beginning of the verse, and has been supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="2720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1261><b>tn</b> The preposition on the relative pronoun has the force of &#8220;because of the fact that.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2721"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1262><b>tn</b> The verb is the second masculine plural form. </p>
<A NAME="2722"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1263><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;mouth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1264><b>sn</b> Using the basic meaning of the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qadash</font>, &#8220;to be separate, distinct, set apart&#8221;), we can understand better what Moses failed to do. He was supposed to have acted in a way that would have shown God to be distinct, different, holy. Instead, he gave the impression that God was capricious and hostile &#8211; very human. The leader has to be aware of what image he is conveying to the people.</p>
<A NAME="2724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1265><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;flesh&#8221;; cf. NAB, NIV &#8220;all mankind&#8221;; NCV &#8220;all people&#8221;; NLT &#8220;all living things.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1266><b>tn</b> This is the same verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">paqad</font>) that is used throughout the book for the aspect of &#8220;numbering&#8221; the people.</p>
<A NAME="2726"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1267><b>sn</b> This is probably technical terminology for a military leader (Josh 14:11; 1 Sam 18:13-16; 1 Kgs 3:7; 2 Kgs 11:9). The image of a shepherd can also be military in nature (1 Kgs 22:17).</p>
<A NAME="2727"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1268><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has the conjunction with the negated imperfect tense, &#8220;and it will not be.&#8221; This clause should be subordinated to the preceding to form a result clause, and the imperfect then function as a final imperfect. </p>
<A NAME="2728"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1269><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1270><b>sn</b> The word &#8220;spirit&#8221; probably refers to the Holy Spirit, in which case it would be rendered &#8220;in whom is the Spirit.&#8221; This would likely be a permanent endowment for Joshua. But it is also possible to take it to refer to a proper spirit to do all the things required of such a leader (which ultimately is a gift from the Spirit of God). The Hebrew text simply says &#8220;in whom is a spirit.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2730"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1271><b>sn</b> This symbolic act would indicate the transfer of leadership to Joshua.</p>
<A NAME="2731"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1272><b>tn</b> This could be translated &#8220;position him,&#8221; or &#8220;have him stand,&#8221; since it is the causative stem of the verb &#8220;to stand.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2732"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1273><b>tn</b> The verb is the Piel perfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1493;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsivvah</font>, literally &#8220;to command&#8221;). The verb has a wide range of meanings, and so here in this context the idea of instructing gives way to a more general sense of commissioning for duty. The verb in sequence is equal to the imperfect of instruction.</p>
<A NAME="2733"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1274><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in their eyes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2734"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1275><b>tn</b> The verb is simply &#8220;give,&#8221; but in this context giving some of Moses&#8217; honor to Joshua in the presence of the people is essentially passing the leadership to him, or delegating the authority to him with the result that people would follow him.</p>
<A NAME="2735"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1276><b>tc</b> The Greek, Syriac, and Vulgate read &#8220;glory&#8221; for this form that occurs only here in the Pentateuch. Elsewhere it is rendered &#8220;majesty, splendor&#8221; (see Ps 96:6). It could even be &#8220;vitality&#8221; here. The authority being transferred here is both spiritual and civil.</p>
<A NAME="2736"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1277><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;hear.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2737"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1278><b>tn</b> The passage simply has &#8220;and he will ask,&#8221; but Eleazar is clearly the subject now.</p>
<A NAME="2738"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1279><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;ask.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2739"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1280><b>sn</b> The new leader would not have the privilege that Moses had in speaking to God face to face. Rather, he would have to inquire of the <sc>Lord through the priest, and the priest would seek a decision by means of the Urim. The Urim and the Thummim were the sacred lots that the priest had in his pouch, the &#8220;breastplate&#8221; as it has traditionally been called. Since the Law had now been fully established, there would be fewer cases that the leader would need further rulings. Now it would simply be seeking the <sc>Lord&#8217;s word for matters such as whether to advance or not. The size, shape or substance of these objects is uncertain. See further C. Van Dam, <i>The Urim and Thummim</i>.</p>
<A NAME="2740"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1281><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;mouth,&#8221; meaning what he will say.</p>
<A NAME="2741"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1282><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;stood.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2742"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1283><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;spoke.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2743"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1284><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;hand.&#8221;</p>
