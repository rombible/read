<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2> <b>sn</b> The holy name is &#8220;Yahweh.&#8221; This is the ancient name for the God of the covenant community. The name was explained or interpreted by Moses for the Israelites by the etymological connection to the verb &#8220;to be.&#8221; God said that its significance was &#8220;<span class="smallcaps">I am</span> that <span class="smallcaps">I am</span>&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1492; &#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512; &#1488;&#1462;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1492;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">ehyeh </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aser </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ehyeh</font>) using the first person of the verb; the name, the third person of the verb, would therefore mean &#8220;He is.&#8221; The name indicates that God is the sovereign <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of creation, the eternal God, the covenant Lord; he is sovereignly independent of all creation, but he is intimately involved with all his people. Most English translations do not use it, but follow the Jewish custom of using substitute words for the holy name, such as &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>,&#8221; &#8220;the Eternal One,&#8221; etc.</p>
