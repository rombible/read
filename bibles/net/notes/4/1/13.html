<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3> <b>tn</b> The book begins with the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive and the preterite, &#8220;and he spoke.&#8221; This does not indicate that the book is a continuation of the previous material, for in that case certain other books in the canon would have to be linked with the writings of other people just because they followed them. This form is simply the narrative verb; the conjunction need not be translated. The verb should not be limited to a literary formula, but does indicate the divine source of the command for Moses. God was speaking to Moses throughout the wilderness wanderings from the tent, and so the ideas are from him, and not from the &#8220;will of man.&#8221;</p>
