The term &#8220;desert&#8221; works if one thinks of land deserted by people. But to many modern readers &#8220;desert&#8221; suggests the idea of an arid land without growth. The word must not be pressed to mean only sand dunes; it describes land that has rocks, canyons, oases, shrubs and trees occasionally, some animal life, and of course sand.</p>
