<a name="117"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=17><b>tn</b> The construction uses the participle &#8220;going out&#8221; followed by the noun &#8220;army.&#8221; It describes everyone &#8220;going out in a military group,&#8221; meaning serving in the army. It was the duty of every able-bodied Israelite to serve in this &#8220;peoples&#8221; army. There were probably exemptions for the infirm or the crippled, but every male over twenty was chosen. For a discussion of warfare, see P. C. Craigie, <i>The Problem of War in the Old Testament</i>, and P. D. Miller, &#8220;The Divine Council and the Prophetic Call to War,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 18 (1968): 100-107.<i> </i></p>
