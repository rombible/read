<a name="116"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=16><b>tn</b> The verb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">paqad</font>) means &#8220;to visit, appoint, muster, number.&#8221; The word is a common one in scripture. It has as its basic meaning the idea of &#8220;determining the destiny&#8221; of someone, by appointing, mustering, or visiting. When God &#8220;visits,&#8221; it is a divine intervention for either blessing or cursing. Here it is the taking of a census for war (see G. André, <i>Determining the Destiny</i> [ConBOT], 16).</p>
