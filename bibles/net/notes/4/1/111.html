<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>tn</b> The construction is literally &#8220;lift up the head[s],&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;&#1512;&#1465;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;</font>,<font face="Scholar"> sÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">u </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et-ro</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">sh</font>). This idiom for taking a census occurs elsewhere (Exod 30:12; Lev 5:24; Num 1:24; etc.). The idea is simply that of counting heads to arrive at the base for the standing army. This is a different event than the one recorded in Exod 30:11-16, which was taken for a different purpose altogether. The verb is plural, indicating that Moses had help in taking the census.</p>
