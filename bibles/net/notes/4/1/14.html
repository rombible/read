<a name="14"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4><b>sn</b> This was one of several names by which the tabernacle was known. This was the tent with its furnishings that the Israelites built according to the book of Exodus. While that tabernacle was being built, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> met with Moses in a tent of meeting nearby (Exod 33:7), but when the project was finished, the title was transferred to the tabernacle. It may be that the expression &#8220;tent of meeting&#8221; refers to the inner tabernacle where God revealed himself to Moses and Aaron, and the word &#8220;tabernacle&#8221; refers to the whole shrine, the curtained structure with all its contents. This would mean that God addressed Moses from between the cherubim in the holy of holies (see R. A. Cole, <i>Exodus</i> [TOTC], 191). The point is clear, though &#8211; the shrine was functioning  as the sign of God&#8217;s actual presence and leadership among his people.</p>
