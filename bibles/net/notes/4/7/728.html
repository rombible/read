<A NAME="728"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=335><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kapporet</font>) has been traditionally rendered &#8220;mercy seat,&#8221; but since the ark is the footstool (see Ps 132), this translation is somewhat misleading. The word is etymologically connected to the verb &#8220;to make atonement.&#8221; A technical translation would be &#8220;place of atonement&#8221; or &#8220;propitiatory&#8221;; a more common translation would be &#8220;cover, lid&#8221; &#8211; provided that the definition &#8220;to cover&#8221; does not get transferred to the verb &#8220;to atone,&#8221; for that idea belongs to a homonym. See also Exod 25:17.</p>
