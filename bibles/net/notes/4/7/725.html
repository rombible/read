<A NAME="725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=332><b>sn</b> Even though the chapter seems wearisome and repetitious to the modern reader, it is a significant document. A. Rainey shows how it matches the exact ledgers of ancient sanctuaries (see <i>ZPEB</i> 5:202). The recording would have been done by the priestly scribes. Of the many points that can be observed here, it should not be missed that each tribe, regardless of its size or relative importance, was on equal footing before the <sc>Lord. Each tribe shared in the work of the <sc>Lord equally. Each tribe approached the sanctuary in precisely the same way on this memorable occasion. All such devotion to the work of the <sc>Lord was to receive the blessing of God.</p>
