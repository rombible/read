<A NAME="72"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=309><b>tn</b> The construction of this line begins with the temporal indicator (traditionally translated &#8220;and it came to pass&#8221;) and then after the idiomatic &#8220;in the day of&#8221; (= &#8220;when&#8221;) uses the Piel<i> </i>infinitive construct from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kalah</font>). The infinitive is governed by the subjective genitive, &#8220;Moses,&#8221; the formal subject of the clause. The object of the infinitive is the second infinitive, &#8220;to set up&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">lÿhaqim</font>). This infinitive, the Hiphil<i>,</i> serves as the direct object, answering the question of what it was that Moses completed. The entire clause is an adverbial clause of time.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This chapter belongs chronologically after Lev 8:11, because Aaron and his sons were not yet made the celebrants and officiants of the new shrine (completed in Exodus). Here then chapters 7-9 are actually earlier than chapters 1-6, and form a supplement by adding information not found in Exodus and Leviticus. The first verse here recapitulates the first act of Moses in consecrating the shrine (Exod 30:23-31).</p>
