<A NAME="646"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=289><b>tn</b> Some versions simply interpret this to say that he shaves his hair, for it is the hair that is the sign of the consecration to God. But the text says he shaves his consecrated head. The whole person is obviously consecrated to God &#8211; not just the head. But the symbolic act of cutting the hair shows that the vow has been completed (see Acts 21:23-24). The understanding of the importance of the hair in the ancient world has been the subject of considerable study over the years (see R. de Vaux, <i>Ancient Israel</i>, 436; and J. A. Thompson, &#8220;Numbers,&#8221; <i>New Bible Commentary: Revised</i>, 177).</p>
