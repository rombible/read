<A NAME="647"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=290><b>sn</b> Some commentators see this burning of the hair as an offering (McNeile, <i>Numbers,</i> 35; G. B. Gray, <i>Numbers</i> [ICC]<i>,</i> 68). But others probably with more foundation see it as destroying something that has served a purpose, something that if left alone might be venerated (see R. de Vaux, <i>Israel</i>, 436). </p>
