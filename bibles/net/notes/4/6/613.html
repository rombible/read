<A NAME="613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=256><b>tc</b> The parallel expression in v. 8 (&#8220;all the days of his separation&#8221;) lacks the word &#8220;vow.&#8221; This word is also absent in v. 5 in a few medieval Hebrew manuscripts. The presence of the word in v. 5 may be due to dittography.</p>
