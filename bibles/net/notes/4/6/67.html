<A NAME="67"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=250><b>tn</b> The operative verb now will be the Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nazar</font>); the consecration to the <sc>Lord meant separation from certain things in the world. The first will be wine and strong drink &#8211; barley beer (from Akkadian <font face="Scholar">sikaru</font>, a fermented beer). But the second word may be somewhat wider in its application than beer. The Nazirite, then, was to avoid all intoxicants as a sign of his commitment to the <sc>Lord. The restriction may have proved a hardship in the daily diet of the one taking the vow, but it spoke a protest to the corrupt religious and social world that used alcohol to excess.</p>
