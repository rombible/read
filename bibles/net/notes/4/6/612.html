<A NAME="612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=255><b>sn</b> Here is another <i>hapax legomenon</i>, a word only found here. The word seems linked to the verb &#8220;to be clear,&#8221; and so may mean the thin skin of the grape. The reason for the strictness with these two words in this verse is uncertain. We know the actual meanings of the words, and the combination must form a merism here, meaning no part of the grape could be eaten. Abstaining from these common elements of food was to be a mark of commitment to the <sc>Lord. Hos 3:1 even denounces the raisin cakes as part of a pagan world, and eating them would be a violation of the oath.</p>
