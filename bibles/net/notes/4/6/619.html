<A NAME="619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=262><b>tn</b> The Hebrew has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1461;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh met</font>), literally a &#8220;dead person.&#8221; But since the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> can also be used for animals, the restriction would be for any kind of corpse. Death was very much a part of the fallen world, and so for one so committed to the <sc>Lord, avoiding all such contamination would be a witness to the greatest separation, even in a family.</p>
