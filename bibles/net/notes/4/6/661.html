<A NAME="661"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=304><b>tn</b> The verb &#8220;to keep&#8221; concerns the divine protection of the people; its basic meaning is &#8220;to exercise great care over,&#8221; &#8220;to guard,&#8221; or &#8220;to give attention to&#8221; (see <i>TWOT</i> 2:939). No doubt the priestly blessing informed the prayer and promise that makes up Ps 121, for the verb occurs six times in the eight verses. So in addition to the divine provision (&#8220;bless&#8221; basically means &#8220;enrich&#8221; in a number of ways) there is the assurance of divine protection.</p>
