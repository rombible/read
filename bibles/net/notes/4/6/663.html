<A NAME="663"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=306><b>tn</b> The last line of the blessing also has first the image and then the parallel interpretation &#8211; for God to lift up his face is for God to give peace. The idea of the fallen face is one of anger (see Gen 4:6,7); and the idea of the hidden face is that of withholding support, favor, or peace (see Deut 31:18; Ps 30:8; Ps 44:25). If God lifts his face toward his people, it means he has given them peace &#8211; peace, prosperity, completeness, health, safety, general well-being, and the like.</p>
