<A NAME="638"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=281><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has &#8220;he/one shall bring him&#8221;; since there is no expressed subject, this verb should be taken in the passive sense &#8211; &#8220;he shall be brought.&#8221; Since the context suggests an obligatory nuance, the translation &#8220;he must be brought&#8221; has been used. Some scholars solve the problem by emending the Hebrew text here, but there is no manuscript evidence to support the emendation.</p>
