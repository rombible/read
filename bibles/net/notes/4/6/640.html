<A NAME="640"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=283><b>sn</b> The peace offering <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿlamim</font>) is instructed in Lev 3 and 7. The form is always in the plural. It was a sacrifice that celebrated the fact that the worshiper was at peace with God, and was not offered in order to make peace with God. The peace offering was essentially a communal meal in the presence of God. Some have tried to equate this offering with similar sounding names in Akkadian and Ugaritic (see B. A. Levine, <i>In the Presence of the <sc>Lord</></i> [SJLA], 3-52), but the unique features of the Israelite sacrifice make this connection untenable.</p>
