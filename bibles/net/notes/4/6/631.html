<A NAME="631"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=274><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿkhipper</font>) is the Piel perfect with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive. The meaning of the verb is &#8220;to expiate, pacify, atone.&#8221; It refers to the complete removal of the barrier of fellowship between the person and God, and the total acceptance of that person into his presence. The idea of &#8220;to cover,&#8221; often linked to this meaning, is derived from a homonym, and not from this word and its usage. </p>
