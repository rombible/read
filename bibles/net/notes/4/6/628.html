<A NAME="628"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=271><b>tn</b> The traditional translation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1496;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khatta</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">t</font>) is &#8220;sin offering,&#8221; but it is more precise to render it &#8220;purification offering&#8221; (as with the other names of sacrifices) to show the outcome, not the cause of the offering (see Lev 4). Besides, this offering was made for ritual defilements (for which no confession was required) as well as certain sins (for which a confession of sin was required). This offering restored the person to the ritual state of purity by purifying the area into which he would be going. </p>
