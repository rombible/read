<A NAME="614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=257><b>sn</b> There is an interesting parallel between this prohibition and the planting of trees. They could not be pruned or trimmed for three years, but allowed to grow free (Lev 20:23). Only then could the tree be cut and the fruit eaten. The natural condition was to be a sign that it was the <sc>Lord&#8217;s. It was to be undisturbed by humans. Since the Nazirite was to be consecrated to the <sc>Lord, that meant his whole person, hair included. In the pagan world the trimming of the beard and the cutting of the hair was often a sign of devotion to some deity.</p>
