<A NAME="664"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=307><b>tn</b> The idea of their putting the name of Yahweh on the people is somewhat problematic. The pronouncing of the name of Yahweh in this context over the people was taken to be the effectual means of blessings. &#8220;Putting the name on them&#8221; is an expression that emphasizes the truth that he is their God and they are his people or that having his name is having his blessing. </p>
