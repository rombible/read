<A NAME="660"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=303><b>tn</b> The short blessing uses the jussive throughout, here the Piel jussive with a pronominal suffix. While the jussive has quite a range of nuances, including wish, desire, prayer, or greeting, the jussives here are stronger. The formal subject of the verb is the <sc>Lord, and the speaker pronouncing the blessing is the priest, notably after emerging from the holy of holies where atonement has been made. The <sc>Lord says in this passage that when the priest says this, then the <sc>Lord will bless them. The jussive then is an oracle, not a wish or a prayer. It is a declaration of what the <sc>Lord imparts. It is as binding and sure as a patriarchal blessing which once said officially could not be taken back. The priest here is then pronouncing the word of the <sc>Lord, declaring to the congregation the outcome of the atonement.</p>
