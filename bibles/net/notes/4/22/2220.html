<A NAME="2220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1018><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">barukh</font>) is the Qal passive participle, serving here as the predicate adjective after the supplied verb &#8220;to be.&#8221; The verb means &#8220;enrich,&#8221; in any way, materially, spiritually, physically. But the indication here is that the blessing includes the promised blessing of the patriarchs, a blessing that gave Israel the land. See further, C. Westermann, <i>Blessing in the Bible and the Life of the Church</i> (OBT). </p>
