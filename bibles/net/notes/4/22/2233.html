<A NAME="2233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1031><b>sn</b> God&#8217;s anger now seems to contradict the permission he gave Balaam just before this. Some commentators argue that God&#8217;s anger is a response to Balaam&#8217;s character in setting out &#8211; which the Bible does not explain. God saw in him greed and pleasure for the riches, which is why he was so willing to go.</p>
