<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=999><b>sn</b> The fifth section of the book (22:1-33:56) traces the Israelite activities in Transjordan. It is hard to determine how long they were in Transjordan, but a good amount of time must have elapsed for the number of moves they made and the wars they fought. There is a considerable amount of information available on this section of the book. Some of the most helpful works include: H. C. Brichto, <i>The Problem of &#8220;Curse&#8221; in the Hebrew Bible</i> (JBLMS); E. Burrows, <i>The Oracles of Jacob and Balaam</i>; G. W. Coats, &#8220;Balaam, Sinner or Saint?&#8221; <i>BR</i> 18 (1973): 21-29; P. C. Craigie, &#8220;The Conquest and Early Hebrew Poetry,&#8221; <i>TynBul</i> 20 (1969): 76-94; I. Parker, &#8220;The Way of God and the Way of Balaam,&#8221; <i>ExpTim</i> 17 (1905): 45; and J. A. Wharton, &#8220;The Command to Bless: An Exposition of Numbers 22:41&#8211;23:25,&#8221; <i>Int</i> 13 (1959): 37-48. This first part introduces the characters and sets the stage for the oracles. It can be divided into four sections: the invitation declined (vv. 1-14), the second invitation extended (vv. 15-21), God opposes Balaam (vv. 22-35), and Balaam meets Balak (vv. 36-41).</p>
