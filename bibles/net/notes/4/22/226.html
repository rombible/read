<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1004><b>sn</b> There is much literature on pagan diviners and especially prophecy in places in the east like Mari (see, for example, H. B. Huffmon, &#8220;Prophecy in the Mari Letters,&#8221; <i>BA</i> 31 [1968]: 101-24). Balaam appears to be a pagan diviner who was of some reputation; he was called to curse the Israelites, but God intervened and gave him blessings only. The passage forms a nice complement to texts that deal with blessings and curses. It shows that no one can curse someone whom God has blessed.</p>
