<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1><b>sn</b> The book of Numbers is the fourth book of the Pentateuch, traditionally called the Law of Moses. It provides a record of the experience of the Israelites during the wilderness wanderings, and records the laws for the camp as they traveled from place to place. The book focuses on the difficulties of the Israelites due to their lack of faith, rebellion, and apostasy. It also records God&#8217;s protection of his people from opposition from without. The book makes a fitting contribution to the collection of holy writings as it shows the spiritual and physical progression of the company of the redeemed toward the promised land. The book has to be studied in conjunction with the other books of the Pentateuch. It builds on the promises made to Abraham in Genesis and the redemption from bondage in Exodus; it completes the cultic instructions for Israel that were laid down in Leviticus, and it concerns the worship in and the movement of the tabernacle that was built in Exodus. But the information here, both legal and historical, was not the major concern in those books. The book gets its title in English (following the Greek tradition) from the two censuses taken of the people, one at the beginning of the wanderings and the other at the end (although the Hebrew title is taken from the beginning of the book, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;</font> [<font face="Scholar">bammidbar</font>], &#8220;in the wilderness&#8221;). In these lists particular emphasis is given to the leaders of the clans, a theme that will continue in the book as the focus is on how the leaders function in all the trials and temptations of the journey. The material in this book is essentially a theological interpretation of historical events, and as such it stands as an integral part of the revelation of God. In the study of the book of Numbers, when these issues of the nature of the text are significant to the interpretation and acceptance of the text, the notes will comment on them briefly. The indication at the outset of the book is that Moses had a good number of people who were able to help him compile the statistics and the facts of the wandering community. In Num 11:16-18 there is a group of leaders known as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew"> &#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1496;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>(<font face="Scholar">shottÿrim</font>). This term was used in Exod 5:16-19 to describe the officers or foremen of the Israelites. They were appointed supervisors of the clans by Moses, and by the time of Joshua (Josh 1:10) they were a literary guild. The Hebrew word, cognate with Akkadian <font face="Scholar">sataru, </font>means &#8220;to write.&#8221; These people were to Israel what the scribes and chroniclers were to the pagan nations. They assisted Moses and the priests in their keeping of records. So no matter what they were called from time to time, there was a group of literate people who could keep the records and preserve the information from the very beginning. Their work matches the activities of scribes in the ancient world who used all the literary devices to preserve the material. There is no reason to doubt that the events recorded were attested to and preserved by such eyewitnesses. But their work would have been essentially to serve the leader, Moses. The book essentially follows the order of the events chronologically, more or less. Where it departs from that order it does so for literary or theological reasons. At the center of the theological concern is the tabernacle, its significance to the faith, and therefore the care in using it and in moving it. Its importance explains the presence and the arrangement of the ritual laws. With the records and statistics provided for him, Moses could then introduce into the record the great events in the wilderness experience of Israel, which were to become warnings and encouragements for all time. Most of this material comes from the two years at the beginning of the experience and the two years at the end. But this itself may be a literary device (<i>merism</i>) to show the nature of the wanderings throughout. The Hebrew text of the book of Numbers has been preserved fairly well. It has not been preserved as well as Leviticus, which was most important to the ministry of the priests and Levites. But in comparison with some of the prophetic writings, Numbers represents a well-preserved text. The problems will be discussed in the relevant passages. So Numbers is essentially a part of the unfolding revelation of the Torah, the Law. It shows God&#8217;s faithfulness to his covenant plan and to his covenant people, but it also shows the problems incurred by the people&#8217;s lack of faith and obedience. The book focuses frequently on the nature of the holy <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God, for at the center of all this material is the person and the works of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.<i> </i>This provided the standard for the faith and practice of the people.

<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2> <b>sn</b> The holy name is &#8220;Yahweh.&#8221; This is the ancient name for the God of the covenant community. The name was explained or interpreted by Moses for the Israelites by the etymological connection to the verb &#8220;to be.&#8221; God said that its significance was &#8220;<span class="smallcaps">I am</span> that <span class="smallcaps">I am</span>&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1492; &#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512; &#1488;&#1462;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1492;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">ehyeh </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aser </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ehyeh</font>) using the first person of the verb; the name, the third person of the verb, would therefore mean &#8220;He is.&#8221; The name indicates that God is the sovereign <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of creation, the eternal God, the covenant Lord; he is sovereignly independent of all creation, but he is intimately involved with all his people. Most English translations do not use it, but follow the Jewish custom of using substitute words for the holy name, such as &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>,&#8221; &#8220;the Eternal One,&#8221; etc.</p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3> <b>tn</b> The book begins with the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive and the preterite, &#8220;and he spoke.&#8221; This does not indicate that the book is a continuation of the previous material, for in that case certain other books in the canon would have to be linked with the writings of other people just because they followed them. This form is simply the narrative verb; the conjunction need not be translated. The verb should not be limited to a literary formula, but does indicate the divine source of the command for Moses. God was speaking to Moses throughout the wilderness wanderings from the tent, and so the ideas are from him, and not from the &#8220;will of man.&#8221;</p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4><b>sn</b> This was one of several names by which the tabernacle was known. This was the tent with its furnishings that the Israelites built according to the book of Exodus. While that tabernacle was being built, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> met with Moses in a tent of meeting nearby (Exod 33:7), but when the project was finished, the title was transferred to the tabernacle. It may be that the expression &#8220;tent of meeting&#8221; refers to the inner tabernacle where God revealed himself to Moses and Aaron, and the word &#8220;tabernacle&#8221; refers to the whole shrine, the curtained structure with all its contents. This would mean that God addressed Moses from between the cherubim in the holy of holies (see R. A. Cole, <i>Exodus</i> [TOTC], 191). The point is clear, though &#8211; the shrine was functioning  as the sign of God&#8217;s actual presence and leadership among his people.</p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>sn</b> The English word &#8220;wilderness&#8221; is workable for the Hebrew term, because it describes land that is wild. The term &#8220;desert&#8221; works if one thinks of land deserted by people. But to many modern readers &#8220;desert&#8221; suggests the idea of an arid land without growth. The word must not be pressed to mean only sand dunes; it describes land that has rocks, canyons, oases, shrubs and trees occasionally, some animal life, and of course sand.</p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=6><b>sn</b> The exact location of Mount Sinai has been debated for some time. The traditional view from very early times is that it is located in the south, Jebel Musa, south of the monastery of St. Catherine. The other plausible suggestion is Ras es-Safsafeh, which is on the other end of the valley near the monastery. The mountain is also called Horeb in the Bible. The wilderness of Sinai would refer to the large plain that is at the base of the mountain. See further G. E. Wright, <i>IDB </i>4:376-78; and G. I. Davies, <i>The Way of the Wilderness</i>. </p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=7><b>tn</b> The construction uses the infinitive construct of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatsa</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to go out&#8221;), with a suffix serving as the subjective genitive, and the <i>lamed</i> preposition providing the temporal indication: &#8220;according to the going out of them.&#8221; The Israelites are clearly intended as the subject.</p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=8><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they&#8221;; the referent (the Israelites) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=9><b>sn</b> This means that the Israelites had spent nine months at Sinai, because they had arrived there in the third month following the exodus. This account does not follow a strict chronology (see Num 9:1). The difference of one month in the narrative is not a critical difference, but a literary general reference. Here begins a new section of major importance to the future of the nation &#8211; the numbering for war and for settlement. </p>
<a name="110"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=10><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;saying.&#8221; A new sentence was started here in the English translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>tn</b> The construction is literally &#8220;lift up the head[s],&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;&#1512;&#1465;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;</font>,<font face="Scholar"> sÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">u </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et-ro</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">sh</font>). This idiom for taking a census occurs elsewhere (Exod 30:12; Lev 5:24; Num 1:24; etc.). The idea is simply that of counting heads to arrive at the base for the standing army. This is a different event than the one recorded in Exod 30:11-16, which was taken for a different purpose altogether. The verb is plural, indicating that Moses had help in taking the census.</p>

The family groups or clans (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1465;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mishpÿkhot</font>) and the households or families (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514; &#1488;&#1458;&#1489;&#1465;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bet </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avot</font>) were sub-divisions of the tribe.</p>

Except for the Levites, no male was exempt from the count.</p>
<a name="116"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=16><b>tn</b> The verb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">paqad</font>) means &#8220;to visit, appoint, muster, number.&#8221; The word is a common one in scripture. It has as its basic meaning the idea of &#8220;determining the destiny&#8221; of someone, by appointing, mustering, or visiting. When God &#8220;visits,&#8221; it is a divine intervention for either blessing or cursing. Here it is the taking of a census for war (see G. André, <i>Determining the Destiny</i> [ConBOT], 16).</p>
<a name="117"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=17><b>tn</b> The construction uses the participle &#8220;going out&#8221; followed by the noun &#8220;army.&#8221; It describes everyone &#8220;going out in a military group,&#8221; meaning serving in the army. It was the duty of every able-bodied Israelite to serve in this &#8220;peoples&#8221; army. There were probably exemptions for the infirm or the crippled, but every male over twenty was chosen. For a discussion of warfare, see P. C. Craigie, <i>The Problem of War in the Old Testament</i>, and P. D.

<a name="127"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=27><b>tn</b> The preposition <font face="Scholar">lamed </font>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font>) prefixed to the name could be taken in the sense of &#8220;from,&#8221; but could also be &#8220;with regard to&#8221; (specification).</p>

It would mean &#8220;the Almighty is my rock&#8221;; the later name means &#8220;the Almighty is my kinsman.&#8221; Other theophoric elements in the passage are &#8220;father,&#8221; &#8220;brother,&#8221; and &#8220;God.&#8221; </p>

Cf. KJV, ASV, NAB &#8220;princes.&#8221; These were men apparently revered or respected in their tribes, and so the clear choice to assist Moses with the leadership. See further, E. A.

<a name="140"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=40><b>sn</b> There has been much discussion about the numbers in the Israelite wilderness experience. The immediate difficulty for even the casual reader is the enormous number of the population. If indeed there were 603,550 men twenty years of age and older who could fight, the total population of the exodus community counting women and children would have been well over a million, or even two million as calculated by some. This is not a figure that the Bible ever gives, but given the sizes of families the estimate would not be far off. This is a staggering number to have cross the Sea, drink from the oases, or assemble in the plain by Sinai. It is not a question of whether or not God could provide for such a number; it is rather a problem of logistics for a population of that size in that period of time. The problem is not with the text itself, but with the interpretation of the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1507;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elef</font>),<font face="Scholar"> </font>traditionally translated &#8220;thousand.&#8221; The word certainly can be taken as &#8220;thousand,&#8221; and most often is. But in view of the problem of the large number here, some scholars have chosen one of the other meanings attested in literature for this word, perhaps &#8220;troop,&#8221; or &#8220;family,&#8221; or &#8220;tent group,&#8221; even though a word for &#8220;family&#8221; has already been used (see A. H. McNeile, <i>Numbers,</i> 7; J. Garstang, <i>Joshua-Judges,</i> 120; J. Bright, <i>History of Israel, </i>144). Another suggestion is to take the word as a &#8220;chief&#8221; or &#8220;captain&#8221; based on Ugaritic usage (see R. E. D. Clarke, &#8220;The Large Numbers of the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>JTVI</i> 87 [1955]: 82-92; and J. W. Wenham, &#8220;Large Numbers in the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>TynBul</i> 18 [1967]: 19-53). This interpretation would reduce the size of the Israelite army to about 18,000 men from a population of about 72,000 people. That is a radical change from the traditional reading and may be too arbitrary an estimate. A more unlikely calculation following the idea of a new meaning would attempt to divide the numbers and use the first part to refer to the units and the second the measurement (e.g., 65 thousand and four hundred would become 65 units of four hundred). Another approach has been to study the numbers rhetorically, analyzing the numerical values of letters and words. But this method, known as <i>gematria,</i> came in much later than the biblical period (see for it G. Fohrer, <i>Introduction to the Old Testament</i>, 184; and A. Noordtzij, <i>Numbers </i>[BSC], 24). On this system the numbers for &#8220;the sons of Israel&#8221; would be 603. But the number of the people in the MT is 603,550. Another rhetorical approach is that which says the text used exaggerations in the numbers on an epic scale to make the point of God&#8217;s blessing. R. B. Allen&#8217;s view that the numbers have been magnified by a factor of ten (&#8220;Numbers,&#8221; <i>The Expositor&#8217;s Bible Commentary</i>, 2:688-91), which would mean the army was only 60,000 men, seems every bit as arbitrary as Wenham&#8217;s view to get down to 18,000. Moreover, such views cannot be harmonized with the instructions in the chapter for them to count every individual skull &#8211; that seems very clear. This is not the same kind of general expression one finds in &#8220;Saul has killed his thousands, David his ten thousands&#8221; (1 Sam 18:7). <i>There </i>one expects the bragging and the exaggerations. But in a text of numbering each male, to argue that the numbers have been inflated ten-fold to form the rhetoric of praise for the way God has blessed the nation demands a much more convincing argument than has typically been given. On the surface it seems satisfactory, but it raises a lot of questions. Everything in Exodus and Numbers attests to the fact that the Israelites were in a population explosion, that their numbers were greater than their Egyptian overlords. Pharaoh had attempted to counter their growth by killing males from the ranks. That only two midwives are named must be taken to mean that they were heads of the guilds, for two could not service a population &#8211; even of the smaller estimate given above. But even though the size had to have been great and seen as a threat, we are at a loss to know exactly how to determine it. There is clearly a problem with the word &#8220;thousand&#8221; here and in many places in the OT, as the literature will show, but the problem cannot really be solved without additional information. The suggestions proposed so far seem to be rather arbitrary attempts to reduce the number to a less-embarrassing total, one that would seem more workable in the light of contemporary populations and armies, as well as space and time for the people&#8217;s movement in the wilderness. An army of 10,000 or 20,000 men in those days would have been a large army; an army of 600,000 (albeit a people&#8217;s army, which may mean that only a portion of the males would actually fight at any time &#8211; as was true at Ai) is large even by today&#8217;s standards. But the count appears to have been literal, and the totals calculated accordingly, totals which match other passages in the text. If some formula is used to reduce the thousands in this army, then there is the problem of knowing what to do when a battle has only five thousand, or three thousand men. One can only conclude that on the basis of what we know the word should be left with the translation &#8220;thousand,&#8221; no matter what difficulties this might suggest to the reader. One should be cautious, though, in speaking of a population of two million, knowing that there are serious problems with the calculation of that number, if not with the word &#8220;thousand&#8221; itself. It is very doubtful that the population of the wilderness community was in the neighborhood of two million. Nevertheless, until a more convincing explanation of the word &#8220;thousand&#8221; or the calculation of the numbers is provided, one should retain the reading of the MT but note the difficulty with the large numbers.</p>
