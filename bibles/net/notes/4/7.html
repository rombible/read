<A NAME="71"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=308><b>sn</b> This long and repetitious chapter has several parts to it: the introduction (vv. 1-3), the assigning of gifts (vv. 4-9), the time of presentation (vv. 10-11), and then the tribes (vv. 12-83), and then a summary (vv. 84-89).</p>
<A NAME="72"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=309><b>tn</b> The construction of this line begins with the temporal indicator (traditionally translated &#8220;and it came to pass&#8221;) and then after the idiomatic &#8220;in the day of&#8221; (= &#8220;when&#8221;) uses the Piel<i> </i>infinitive construct from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kalah</font>). The infinitive is governed by the subjective genitive, &#8220;Moses,&#8221; the formal subject of the clause. The object of the infinitive is the second infinitive, &#8220;to set up&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">lÿhaqim</font>). This infinitive, the Hiphil<i>,</i> serves as the direct object, answering the question of what it was that Moses completed. The entire clause is an adverbial clause of time.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This chapter belongs chronologically after Lev 8:11, because Aaron and his sons were not yet made the celebrants and officiants of the new shrine (completed in Exodus). Here then chapters 7-9 are actually earlier than chapters 1-6, and form a supplement by adding information not found in Exodus and Leviticus. The first verse here recapitulates the first act of Moses in consecrating the shrine (Exod 30:23-31).</p>
<A NAME="73"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=310><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the house of their fathers.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="74"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=311><b>tn</b> The form is the Qal<i> </i>active participle from the verb &#8220;to stand&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1491;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">amad</font>). The form describes these leaders as &#8220;the ones standing over [the ones numbered].&#8221; The expression, along with the clear indication of the first census in chapter 1, shows that this was a supervisory capacity. </p>
<A NAME="75"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=312><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they brought.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="76"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=313><b>sn</b> For a discussion and drawings, see W. S. McCullough, <i>IDB</i> 1:540. But see also D. J. Wiseman, <i>IBD</i> 1:254.</p>
<A NAME="77"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=314><b>tn</b> The object is not in the Hebrew text, but has been supplied.</p>
<A NAME="78"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=315><b>tn</b> The verb is the perfect tense with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive; following the imperative, this could be given an independent volitive translation (&#8220;they shall be&#8221;), but more fittingly a subordinated translation expressing the purpose of receiving the gifts.</p>
<A NAME="79"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=316><b>tn</b> The sentence uses the infinitive construct expressing purpose, followed by its cognate accusative: &#8220;[that they may be] for doing the work of&#8221; (literally, &#8220;serving the service of&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=317><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ish</font>) is in apposition to the word &#8220;Levites,&#8221; and is to be taken in a distributive sense: &#8220;to the Levites, [to each] man according to his service.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=318><b>tn</b> The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1508;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kÿfi</font>) is &#8220;according to the mouth of.&#8221; Here, it would say &#8220;according to the mouth of his service,&#8221; which would mean &#8220;what his service calls for.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=319><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;hand.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=320><b>tn</b> The verb is the imperfect tense, but it describes their customary activity &#8211; they had to carry, they used to carry.</p>
<A NAME="714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=321><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;upon them,&#8221; meaning &#8220;their duty.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=322><b>tn</b> The verse begins with the preterite and <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive: &#8220;and they offered.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=323><b>tn</b> The direct object, &#8220;gifts,&#8221; is implied but not actually stated in the Hebrew text. It has been supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons and for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=324><b>tn</b> The sign of the accusative here must indicate an adverbial accusative and not the direct object; they offered their gifts <i>for</i> the dedication of the altar. </p>
<A NAME="718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=325><b>sn</b> Some commentators take the word &#8220;dedication&#8221; in the sense of a dedication gift, and so make it the direct object. Many modern scholars assume that this is a late word, belonging only in P, the Chronicler, and the heading of Ps 30 (a Davidic psalm).</p>
<A NAME="719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=326><b>tn</b> The adverbial clause uses the Niphal infinitive construct as the main verb. The word is the well-known <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mashakh</font>, &#8220;to anoint, smear&#8221;). </p>
<A NAME="720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=327><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;offered,&#8221; but this is redundant and has been translated as &#8220;presented&#8221; for stylistic reasons. The same phrase occurs in vv. 11 and 12.</p>
<A NAME="721"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=328><b>tn</b> The distributive sense is achieved by repetition: &#8220;one leader for the day, one leader for the day.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="722"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=329><b>sn</b> The tribe of Judah is listed first. It seems that it had already achieved a place of prominence based on the patriarchal promise of the Messiahship in Judah (Gen 49:10).</p>
<A NAME="723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=330><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;shekels&#8221; has been supplied in the translation for clarity. So also in vv. 19, 20, 25, 26, 31, 32, 37, 38, 43, 44, 49, 50, 55, 56, 60, 62, 66, 68, 73, 74, 79, 85, 86.</p>
<A NAME="724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=331><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;presented an offering&#8221; is not found in the Hebrew text at this point but has been supplied to clarify what action is being done. The same phrase is absent from the Hebrew text in the following verses which tell who makes the offerings (7:30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, 78).</p>
<A NAME="725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=332><b>sn</b> Even though the chapter seems wearisome and repetitious to the modern reader, it is a significant document. A. Rainey shows how it matches the exact ledgers of ancient sanctuaries (see <i>ZPEB</i> 5:202). The recording would have been done by the priestly scribes. Of the many points that can be observed here, it should not be missed that each tribe, regardless of its size or relative importance, was on equal footing before the <sc>Lord. Each tribe shared in the work of the <sc>Lord equally. Each tribe approached the sanctuary in precisely the same way on this memorable occasion. All such devotion to the work of the <sc>Lord was to receive the blessing of God.</p>
<A NAME="726"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=333><b>tn</b> The adverbial clause of time is constructed with the infinitive construct of the verb &#8220;to enter&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bo</font>&#8217;) with the preposition and with the subjective genitive that follows serving as the subject of the clause. The verse is strategic in the structure of the book: At the completion of the dedication with the offerings Moses received more revelation from the <sc>Lord in the tent. This verse therefore lays the foundation for what follows.</p>
<A NAME="727"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=334><b>tc</b> The MT is obscure here, simply giving the purpose infinitive and the prepositional phrase (&#8220;with him&#8221;). But the following clause using the Hitpael of the same verb, introducing a reflexive sense: &#8220;then he heard the voice speaking with him.&#8221; The Greek clarified it by inserting &#8220;Lord&#8221; after the word &#8220;voice.&#8221; The editor of <i>BHS</i> favors emendation of the form to a Piel participle rather than the Hitpael of the MT (reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;</font> [<font face="Scholar">mÿdabber</font>] instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;</font> [<font face="Scholar">middabber</font>], the Hitpael with assimilation). Most commentators agree with the change, assuming there was a mistaken pointing in the MT. </p>
<A NAME="728"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=335><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kapporet</font>) has been traditionally rendered &#8220;mercy seat,&#8221; but since the ark is the footstool (see Ps 132), this translation is somewhat misleading. The word is etymologically connected to the verb &#8220;to make atonement.&#8221; A technical translation would be &#8220;place of atonement&#8221; or &#8220;propitiatory&#8221;; a more common translation would be &#8220;cover, lid&#8221; &#8211; provided that the definition &#8220;to cover&#8221; does not get transferred to the verb &#8220;to atone,&#8221; for that idea belongs to a homonym. See also Exod 25:17.</p>
<A NAME="729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=336><b>tn</b> The cherubim are the carved forms of the angels attached to the ark. They indicate the guarding role of this order of angels in the holy of holies. They were also embroidered on the curtains. For basic material see <i>ZPEB</i> 1:788-90, and R. K. Harrison, <i>ISBE</i> 1:642-43. </p>
