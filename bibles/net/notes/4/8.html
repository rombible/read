<A NAME="81"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=337><b>sn</b> This chapter has three main sections to it: the lighting of the lamps (vv. 1-4), the separation of the Levites (vv. 5-22), and the work of the Levites (vv. 23-26). Many modern scholars assume that the chapter belongs to P and was added late. But the chapter reiterates some of the Mosaic material concerning the work of the Levites in the new sanctuary. For the chapter to make sense the historical setting must be accepted; if the historical setting is accepted, the chapter is necessary as part of that early legislation. For more reading, see M. Haran, &#8220;The Nature of the<i>&#8217;ohel mo&#8216;edh </i>in the Pentateuchal Sources,&#8221; <i>JSS</i> 5 (1960): 50-65, and &#8220;The Priestly Image of the Tabernacle,&#8221; <i>HUCA</i> 36 (1965): 191-226; and C. L. Meyers, <i>The Tabernacle Menorah</i>.<i> </i></p>
<A NAME="82"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=338><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alah</font>). The Hiphil<i> </i>infinitive construct functions in a temporal clause. The idea of arranging the lamps on the lampstand certainly involved raising the lamps and placing them on the tops of each shaft and branch. Some have taken the idea to mean cause the flame to go up, or light the lamps. </p>
<A NAME="83"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=339><b>tn</b> The imperfect tense forms part of the instruction, and so the translation has to indicate that. The instruction would seem obvious, but the light was to shine in the area immediately in front of the lampstand, so that it would illumine the way and illumine the table that was across the room (hence, &#8220;in front of&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="84"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=340><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text literally has &#8220;and this is the work of the lampstand,&#8221; but that rendering does not convey the sense that it is describing how it was made.</p>
<A NAME="85"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=341><b>sn</b> The idea is that it was all hammered from a single plate of gold. </p>
<A NAME="86"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=342><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tahar</font>) means that Moses was &#8220;to purify&#8221; or &#8220;to make ceremonially clean&#8221; the Levites so that they could enter the sanctuary and do the work prescribed for them. Whatever is &#8220;unclean&#8221; is not permitted in the sanctuary at all. </p>
<A NAME="87"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=343><b>tn</b> Or, more literally, &#8220;and thus you shall do.&#8221; The verb is the imperfect tense of instruction or legislation. Here it introduces the procedures to be followed. </p>
<A NAME="88"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=344><b>tn</b> The genitive in this expression indicates the purpose of the water &#8211; it is for their purification. The expression is literally &#8220;the waters of sin.&#8221; The word &#8220;purification&#8221; is the same as for the &#8220;sin/purification offering&#8221; &#8211; <font face="Scholar"> </font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1496;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khatta</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">at</font>). This water seems to have been taken from the main laver and is contrasted with the complete washing of the priests in Lev 8:6.</p>
<A NAME="89"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=345><b>tn</b> The verb is the Hiphil perfect with a <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) of sequence. This verb, and those to follow, has the force of a jussive since it comes after the imperative. Here the instruction is for them to remove the hair from their bodies (&#8220;flesh&#8221;). There is no indication that this was repeated (as the Egyptian priests did every few days). It seems to have been for this special occasion only. A similar requirement was for the leper (Lev 14:7-9).</p>
<A NAME="810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=346><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;flesh.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=347><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;let/have them wash&#8221;; the priests were given new clothes (Lev 8:13), but the Levites simply washed their own. </p>
<A NAME="812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=348><b>tn</b> The verb is a reflexive (or possibly passive) in this verse, indicating the summary of the process. The ritual steps that have been prescribed will lead to this conclusion. The verb could be treated as a final imperfect (being a perfect with <i>vav</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>] consecutive), and so translated &#8220;that they may&#8230;.&#8221; The major difference here is that the ritual made the Levites &#8220;clean,&#8221; whereas the ritual for the priests made them &#8220;holy&#8221; or &#8220;sanctified&#8221; (Lev 8:12).</p>
<A NAME="813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=349><b>sn</b> The first sacrifice was for the purification of the Levites. The second animal, which Moses was to take, would be used for the purification of the tabernacle from all pollution.</p>
<A NAME="814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=350><b>sn</b> The consecration ceremony was to be done in full view of the assembled people. In all probability the laying on of the hands was done through representatives of the tribes, and not all the people. This ritual of the imposition of hands showed that the people were taking part in the consecration, and that the Levites represented them in the service of the <sc>Lord. </p>
<A NAME="815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=351><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text actually has &#8220;wave the Levites as a wave offering.&#8221; The wave offering was part of the ritual of the peace offering and indicated the priest&#8217;s portion being presented to God in a lifted, waving motion for all to see. The Levites were going to be in the sanctuary to serve the <sc>Lord and assist the priests. It is unclear how Moses would have presented them as wave offerings, but the intent is that they would be living sacrifices, as Paul would later say in Rom 12:1 for all Christians.</p>
<A NAME="816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=352><b>tn</b> The construction emphasizes the spiritual service of the Levites, using the infinitive construct of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avad</font>) followed by its cognate accusative.</p>
<A NAME="817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=353><b>tn</b> The clause begins with a <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) on the noun &#8220;the Levites,&#8221; indicating a disjunctive clause. Here it is clearly a subordinate clause prior to the instruction for Moses, and so translated as a circumstantial clause of time.</p>
<A NAME="818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=354><b>tn</b> The imperative is from the verb &#8220;to do; to make,&#8221; but in the sentence it clearly means to sacrifice the animals.</p>
<A NAME="819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=355><b>sn</b> The &#8220;purification offering&#8221; cleansed the tabernacle from impurity, and the burnt offering atoned by nullifying and removing the effects of sin in the Levites.</p>
<A NAME="820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=356><b>tc</b> The Greek text adds the <sc>Lord here: &#8220;before the <sc>Lord, before Aaron.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=357><b>tn</b> The <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive on the perfect tense not only carries the nuance of instruction forward to this clause, but also marks this clause out as a summary of what has taken place, i.e., by doing all this ritual Moses will have separated the Levites from the people for God&#8217;s own possession.</p>
<A NAME="822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=358><b>tn</b> The imperfect tense could also be given the nuance of the imperfect of permission: &#8220;the Levites may go in.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=359><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to serve.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=360><b>tn</b> The two verbs in the rest of this verse are perfect tenses with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive constructions, making them equal to the imperfect. Some commentators try to get around the difficulty of repetition by making these future perfects, &#8220;and you will have cleansed,&#8221; as opposed to a summary statement, &#8220;for thus you will cleanse&#8230;.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=361><b>tc</b> The Greek text adds &#8220;before the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=362><b>tn</b> As before, the emphasis is obtained by repeating the passive participle: &#8220;given, given to me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=363><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;as substitutes&#8221; for all the firstborn of the Israelites.</p>
<A NAME="828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=364><b>tn</b> The idiomatic &#8220;on the day of&#8221; precedes the infinitive construct of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhah</font>) to form the temporal clause: &#8220;in the day of my striking&#8230;&#8221; becomes &#8220;when I struck.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=365><b>sn</b> The firstborn were those that were essentially redeemed from death in Egypt when the blood was put on the doors. So in the very real sense they belonged to God (Exod 13:2,12). The firstborn was one who stood in special relationship to the father, being the successive offspring. Here, the Levites would stand in for the firstborn in that special role and special relationship. God also made it clear that the nation of Israel was his firstborn son (Exod 4:22-23), and so they stood in that relationship before all the nations. The tribe of Reuben was to have been the firstborn tribe, but in view of the presumptuous attempt to take over the leadership through pagan methods (Gen 35:22; 49:3-4), was passed over. The tribes of Levi and Simeon were also put down for their ancestors&#8217; activities, but sanctuary service was still given to Levi.</p>
<A NAME="830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=366><b>tn</b> The verb is the Hitpael of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1496;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khatta</font>&#8217;). In this stem the meaning of the root &#8220;to sin&#8221; is likely to be connected to the noun &#8220;sin/purification&#8221; offering in a denominative sense, although some would take it as a privative usage, &#8220;to remove sin.&#8221; The idea is clear enough: They performed all the ritual in order to purify themselves ceremonially. </p>
<A NAME="831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=367><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has &#8220;this [is that] which [pertains] to the Levites.&#8221; &#8220;This is what concerns the Levites, meaning, the following rulings are for them. </p>
<A NAME="832"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=368><b>tc</b> The age of <i>twenty-five</i> indicated in v. 24 should be compared with the age of <i>thirty</i> indicated in Num 4:3,23,30. In order to harmonize the numbers given in chapter 4 with the number given in Num 8:24 the LXX (and perhaps its Hebrew <i>Vorlage</i>) has thirty in all of these references. See further G. J. Wenham, <i>Numbers</i> (TOTC 4), 97-98. </p>
<A NAME="833"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=369><b>tn</b> The infinitive is<font face="Scholar"> </font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1489;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">litsvo</font>&#8217;), related to the word for &#8220;host, army, company,&#8221; and so &#8220;to serve as a company.&#8221; The meaning is strengthened by the cognate accusative following it.</p>
<A NAME="834"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=370><b>tn</b> The verb is the Piel perfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sharat</font>, &#8220;to serve, minister&#8221;). Here the form has the <font face="Scholar">vav </font>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive, and so is equal to the imperfect tense stressing permission. After the Levites reached the age of retirement, they were permitted to assist the others, but were not permitted to do the work themselves. </p>
<A NAME="835"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=371><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;brothers,&#8221; but the meaning in this context is &#8220;fellow Levites.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="836"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=372><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you shall do, make.&#8221;</p>
