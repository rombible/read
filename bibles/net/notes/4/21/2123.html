<A NAME="2123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=968><b>tc</b> The ancient versions show a wide variation here: Smr has &#8220;Waheb on the Sea of Reeds,&#8221; the Greek version has &#8220;he has set Zoob on fire and the torrents of Arnon.&#8221; Several modern versions treat the first line literally, taking the two main words as place names: Waheb and Suphah. This seems most likely, but then there would then be no subject or verb. One would need something like &#8220;the Israelites marched through.&#8221; The KJV, following the Vulgate, made the first word a verb and read the second as &#8220;Red Sea&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;what he did in the Red Sea.&#8221; But subject of the passage is the terrain. D. L. Christensen proposed emending the first part from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514; &#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1461;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et vahev</font>) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492; &#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<i>attah yehvah,</i> &#8220;the <sc>Lord came&#8221;). But this is subjective. See his article &#8220;Num 21:14-15 and the Book of the Wars of Yahweh,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 36 (1974): 359-60.</p>
