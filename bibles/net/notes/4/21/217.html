<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=952><b>tn</b> On the surface this does not sound like much of a vow. But the key is in the use of the verb for &#8220;utterly destroy&#8221; &#8211; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kharam</font>). Whatever was put to this &#8220;ban&#8221; or &#8220;devotion&#8221; belonged to God, either for his use, or for destruction. The oath was in fact saying that they would take nothing from this for themselves. It would simply be the removal of what was alien to the faith, or to God&#8217;s program.</p>
