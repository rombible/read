<A NAME="2142"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=987><b>sn</b> Proverbs of antiquity could include pithy sayings or longer songs, riddles, or poems composed to catch the significance or the irony of an event. This is a brief poem to remember the event, like an Egyptian victory song. It may have originated as an Amorite war taunt song; it was sung to commemorate this victory. It was cited later by Jeremiah (48:45-46). The composer invites his victorious people to rebuild the conquered city as a new capital for Sihon. He then turns to address the other cities which his God(s) has/have given to him. See P. D. Hanson, &#8220;The Song of Heshbon and David&#8217;s Nir,&#8221; <i>HTR</i> 61 (1968): 301. </p>
