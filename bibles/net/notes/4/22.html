<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=999><b>sn</b> The fifth section of the book (22:1-33:56) traces the Israelite activities in Transjordan. It is hard to determine how long they were in Transjordan, but a good amount of time must have elapsed for the number of moves they made and the wars they fought. There is a considerable amount of information available on this section of the book. Some of the most helpful works include: H. C. Brichto, <i>The Problem of &#8220;Curse&#8221; in the Hebrew Bible</i> (JBLMS); E. Burrows, <i>The Oracles of Jacob and Balaam</i>; G. W. Coats, &#8220;Balaam, Sinner or Saint?&#8221; <i>BR</i> 18 (1973): 21-29; P. C. Craigie, &#8220;The Conquest and Early Hebrew Poetry,&#8221; <i>TynBul</i> 20 (1969): 76-94; I. Parker, &#8220;The Way of God and the Way of Balaam,&#8221; <i>ExpTim</i> 17 (1905): 45; and J. A. Wharton, &#8220;The Command to Bless: An Exposition of Numbers 22:41&#8211;23:25,&#8221; <i>Int</i> 13 (1959): 37-48. This first part introduces the characters and sets the stage for the oracles. It can be divided into four sections: the invitation declined (vv. 1-14), the second invitation extended (vv. 15-21), God opposes Balaam (vv. 22-35), and Balaam meets Balak (vv. 36-41).</p>
<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1000><b>tn</b> The verse begins with the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive.</p>
<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1001><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;River&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but has been supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1002><b>map</b> For the location of Jericho see Map5-B2; Map6-E1; Map7-E1; Map8-E3; Map10-A2; Map11-A1.</p>
<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1003><b>tn</b> The word is simply &#8220;company,&#8221; but in the context he must mean a vast company &#8211; a horde of people.</p>
<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1004><b>sn</b> There is much literature on pagan diviners and especially prophecy in places in the east like Mari (see, for example, H. B. Huffmon, &#8220;Prophecy in the Mari Letters,&#8221; <i>BA</i> 31 [1968]: 101-24). Balaam appears to be a pagan diviner who was of some reputation; he was called to curse the Israelites, but God intervened and gave him blessings only. The passage forms a nice complement to texts that deal with blessings and curses. It shows that no one can curse someone whom God has blessed.</p>
<A NAME="227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1005><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;by the river&#8221;; in most contexts this expression refers to the Euphrates River (cf. NAB, NCV, NRSV, TEV, CEV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1006><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the land of Amaw&#8221; (cf. NAB, NRSV, TEV); traditionally &#8220;in the land of the sons of his people.&#8221; The LXX has &#8220;by the river of the land.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1007><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;eye.&#8221; So also in v. 11.</p>
<A NAME="2210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1008><b>tn</b> The two lines before this verse begin with the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>), and so they lay the foundation for these imperatives. In view of those circumstances, this is what should happen. </p>
<A NAME="2211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1009><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;people.&#8221; So also in vv. 10, 17, 41.</p>
<A NAME="2212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1010><b>tn</b> The construction uses the imperfect tense <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1463;&#1500;</font><font face="Scholar"> </font>(&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ukhal</font>, &#8220;I will be able&#8221;) followed by the imperfect tense <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakkeh</font>, &#8220;we will smite/attack/defeat&#8221;). The second verb is clearly the purpose or the result of the first, even though there is no conjunction or particle.</p>
<A NAME="2213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1011><b>tn</b> The verb is the Piel<i> </i>imperfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">barakh</font>), with the nuance of possibility: &#8220;whomever you may bless.&#8221; The Pual participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1489;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿvorakh</font>) serves as the predicate. </p>
<A NAME="2214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1012><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;spoke.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1013><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lin</font>) means &#8220;to lodge, spend the night.&#8221; The related noun is &#8220;a lodge&#8221; &#8211; a hotel of sorts. Balaam needed to consider the offer. And after darkness was considered the best time for diviners to consult with their deities. Balaam apparently knows of the <sc>Lord; he testifies to this effect in 22:18.</p>
<A NAME="2216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1014><b>tn</b> In this passage the text differs slightly; here it is &#8220;the nation that comes out,&#8221; using the article on the noun, and the active participle in the attributive adjective usage.</p>
<A NAME="2217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1015><b>tn</b> Here the infinitive construct is used to express the object or complement of the verb &#8220;to be able&#8221; (it answers the question of what he will be able to do).</p>
<A NAME="2218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1016><b>tn</b> The verb is the Piel<i> </i>perfect with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive. It either carries the force of an imperfect tense, or it may be subordinated to the preceding verbs.</p>
<A NAME="2219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1017><b>tn</b> The two verbs are negated imperfects; they have the nuance of prohibition: You must not go and you must not curse.</p>
<A NAME="2220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1018><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">barukh</font>) is the Qal passive participle, serving here as the predicate adjective after the supplied verb &#8220;to be.&#8221; The verb means &#8220;enrich,&#8221; in any way, materially, spiritually, physically. But the indication here is that the blessing includes the promised blessing of the patriarchs, a blessing that gave Israel the land. See further, C. Westermann, <i>Blessing in the Bible and the Life of the Church</i> (OBT). </p>
<A NAME="2221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1019><b>tc</b> The LXX adds &#8220;to your lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1020><b>tn</b> The main verb is<i> </i>the Piel<i> </i>perfect, &#8220;he has refused.&#8221; This is followed by two infinitives. The first (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">lÿtitti</font>) serves as a complement or direct object of the verb, answering the question of what he refused to do &#8211; &#8220;to give me.&#8221;<i> </i>The second infinitive (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1500;&#1465;&#1498;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">lahalokh</font>) provides the object for the preceding infinitive: &#8220;to grant me to go.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1021><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;rose up.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1022><b>tn</b> The construction is a verbal hendiadys. It uses the Hiphil preterite of the verb &#8220;to add&#8221; followed by the Qal infinitive &#8220;to send.&#8221; The infinitive becomes the main verb, and the preterite an adverb: &#8220;he added to send&#8221; means &#8220;he sent again.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1023><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;than these.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1024><b>tn</b> The infinitive construct is the object of the preposition.</p>
<A NAME="2227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1025><b>tn</b> The construction uses the Piel infinitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kabbed</font>) to intensify the verb, which is the Piel imperfect/cohortative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1499;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1491;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akhabbedkha</font>). The great honor could have been wealth, prestige, or position.</p>
<A NAME="2228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1026><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;answered and said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1027><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;mouth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1028><b>sn</b> In the light of subsequent events one should not take too seriously that Balaam referred to Yahweh as his God. He is referring properly to the deity for which he is acting as the agent. </p>
<A NAME="2231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1029><b>tn</b> In this case &#8220;lodge&#8221; is not used, but &#8220;remain, reside&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shÿvu</font>).</p>
<A NAME="2232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1030><b>tn</b> This clause is also a verbal hendiadys: &#8220;what the <sc>Lord might add to speak,&#8221; meaning, &#8220;what more the <sc>Lord might say.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1031><b>sn</b> God&#8217;s anger now seems to contradict the permission he gave Balaam just before this. Some commentators argue that God&#8217;s anger is a response to Balaam&#8217;s character in setting out &#8211; which the Bible does not explain. God saw in him greed and pleasure for the riches, which is why he was so willing to go.</p>
<A NAME="2234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1032><b>tn</b> The word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1496;&#1464;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">satan</font>, &#8220;to be an adversary, to oppose&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="2235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1033><b>tn</b> The word has the conjunction &#8220;and&#8221; on the noun, indicating this is a disjunctive <i>vav </i>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>), here serving as a circumstantial clause.</p>
<A NAME="2236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1034><b>tn</b> The word means a &#8220;narrow place,&#8221; having the root meaning &#8220;to be deep.&#8221; The Greek thought it was in a field in a narrow furrow.</p>
<A NAME="2237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1035><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a wall on this side, and a wall on that side.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1036><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he added to beat her,&#8221; another verbal hendiadys.</p>
<A NAME="2239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1037><b>tn</b> The optative clause is introduced with the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lu</font>).</p>
<A NAME="2240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1038><b>tn</b> Here the Hiphil<i> </i>perfect is preceded by the Hiphil infinitive absolute for emphasis in the sentence.</p>
<A NAME="2241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1039><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to do thus to you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1040><b>tn</b> The Hishtaphel verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492; </font> (<font face="Scholar">khavah</font>) &#8211; <font face="Scholar"> </font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shakhah</font>) with metathesis &#8211; has a basic idea of &#8220;bow oneself low to the ground,&#8221; and perhaps in some cases the idea of &#8220;coil up.&#8221; This is the normal posture of prayer and of deep humility in the ancient religious world.</p>
<A NAME="2243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1041><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your way.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2244"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1042><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1496; </font> (<font face="Scholar">yarat</font>) occurs only here and in Job 16:11. Balaam is embarking on a foolish mission with base motives. The old rendering &#8220;perverse&#8221; is still acceptable.</p>
<A NAME="2245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1043><b>tc</b> Many commentators consider <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1463;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ulay</font>, &#8220;perhaps&#8221;) to be a misspelling in the MT in place of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">luley</font>, &#8220;if not&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="2246"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1044><b>sn</b> Balaam is not here making a general confession of sin. What he is admitting to is a procedural mistake. The basic meaning of the word is &#8220;to miss the mark.&#8221; He now knows he took the wrong way, i.e., in coming to curse Israel. </p>
<A NAME="2247"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1045><b>sn</b> The reference is to Balaam&#8217;s way. He is saying that if  what he is doing is so perverse, so evil, he will turn around and go home. Of course, it did not appear that he had much of a chance of going forward.</p>
<A NAME="2248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1046><b>tn</b> The verb is the cohortative from &#8220;return&#8221;: I will return [me].</p>
<A NAME="2249"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1047><b>tn</b> The imperfect tense here can be given the nuance of permission.</p>
<A NAME="2250"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1048><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word order is a little more emphatic than this: &#8220;but only the word which I speak to you, it you shall speak.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2251"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1049><b>tn</b> The emphatic construction is made of the infinitive absolute and the perfect tense from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;</font><font face="Scholar"> </font>(<font face="Scholar">shalakh</font>, &#8220;to send&#8221;). The idea must be more intense than something like, &#8220;Did I not certainly send.&#8221; Balak is showing frustration with Balaam for refusing him. </p>
<A NAME="2252"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=1050><b>sn</b> Balak again refers to his ability to &#8220;honor&#8221; the seer. This certainly meant payment for his service, usually gold ornaments, rings and jewelry, as well as some animals.</p>
<A NAME="2253"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1051><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ukhal</font>) in a question &#8211; &#8220;am I able?&#8221; But emphasizing this is the infinitive absolute before it. So Balaam is saying something like, &#8220;Can I really say anything?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2254"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1052><b>tn</b> The Piel infinitive construct (without the preposition) serves as the object of the verb &#8220;to be able.&#8221; The whole question is rhetorical &#8211; he is saying that he will not be able to say anything God does not allow him to say.</p>
<A NAME="2255"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=1053><b>tn</b> The imperfect tense is here taken as an obligatory imperfect.</p>
<A NAME="2256"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=1054><b>sn</b> The understanding is that Balak was making a sacrifice for a covenant relationship, and so he gave some of the meat to the men and to the seer.</p>
<A NAME="2257"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=1055><b>sn</b> The name <i>Bamoth Baal</i> means &#8220;the high places of Baal.&#8221;</p>
