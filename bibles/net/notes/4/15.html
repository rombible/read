<A NAME="151"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=700><b>sn</b> The wilderness wandering officially having begun, these rules were then given for the people to be used when they finally entered the land. That they would be provided here would be of some encouragement to the nation after their great failure. God still spoke of a land that was to be their land, even though they had sinned greatly. This chapter collects a number of religious rules. The first 16 verses deal with rulings for sacrifices. Then, vv. 17-36 concerns sins of omission. Finally, rules concerning tassels are covered (vv. 37-41). For additional reading, see G. B. Gray, <i>Sacrifice in the Old Testament</i> (Oxford: Clarendon, 1925); B. A. Levine, <i>In the Presence of the <sc>Lord</></i> (SJLA);<i> </i>D. J. McCarthy<i>, </i>&#8220;The Symbolism of Blood and Sacrifice,&#8221; <i>JBL </i>88 (1969): 166-76; &#8220;Further Notes on the Symbolism of Blood and Sacrifice,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 92 (1973): 205-10; J. Milgrom, &#8220;Sin Offering or Purification Offering,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 21 (1971): 237-39; N. H. Snaith, &#8220;Sacrifices in the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 7 (1957): 308-17; R. J. Thompson, <i>Penitence and Sacrifice in Early Israel</i>; R. de Vaux, <i>Studies in Old Testament Sacrifice</i>.</p>
<A NAME="152"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=701><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the land of your habitations.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="153"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=702><b>tn</b> The Hebrew participle here has the <i>futur instans </i>use of the participle, expressing that something is going to take place. It is not imminent, but it is certain that God would give the land to Israel.</p>
<A NAME="154"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=703><b>tn</b> The three words at the beginning of this verse are all etymologically related: &#8220;the one who offers his offering shall offer.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="155"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=704><b>sn</b> Obviously, as the wording of the text affirms, this kind of offering would be made after they were in the land and able to produce the grain and oil for the sacrifices. The instructions anticipated their ability to do this, and this would give hope to them. The amounts are difficult to determine, but it may be that they were to bring 4.5 liters of flour and 1.8 liters each of oil and wine.</p>
<A NAME="156"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=705><b>sn</b> The drink-offering was an ancient custom, mentioned in the Ugaritic tablets of Ras Shamra (14th century <sc>b.c.). The drink offering was poured out at the base of the altar (see Sir 50:15 and Josephus, <i>Ant. </i>3.9.4 [3.234]).</p>
<A NAME="157"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=706><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for the one lamb,&#8221; but it clearly means &#8220;for each lamb.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="158"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=707><b>tn</b> The text changes from direct address here to the third person form of the verb. If the MT is correct, then to make a smooth translation it would need to be made a passive (in view of the fact that no subject is expressed).</p>
<A NAME="159"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=708><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;according to thus shall it be done.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=709><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gur</font>) was traditionally translated &#8220;to sojourn,&#8221; i.e., to live temporarily in a land. Here the two words are from the root: &#8220;if a sojourner sojourns.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=710><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in your midst.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=711><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text just has &#8220;to your generations,&#8221; but it means in the future.</p>
<A NAME="1513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=712><b>tn</b> The imperfect tenses must reflect the responsibility to comply with the law, and so the classifications of instruction or obligation may be applied.</p>
<A NAME="1514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=713><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;apply&#8221; is supplied in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="1515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=714><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;a statute forever.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=715><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;as you, as [so] the alien.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=716><b>tn</b> The relative clause is literally, &#8220;which I am causing you to enter there.&#8221; The final adverb is resumptive, and must be joined with the relative pronoun. </p>
<A NAME="1518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=717><b>tn</b> The verse has a temporal clause that actually continues or supplements the temporal clause of the preceding verse. It is made up of the temporal indicator, the infinitive construct with the preposition, and the suffixed subjective genitive: &#8220;and it shall be when you eat.&#8221; Here it is translated simply &#8220;and eat&#8221; since the temporal element was introduced in the last verse.</p>
<A NAME="1519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=718><b>tn</b> This is the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tÿrumah</font>), the &#8220;raised offering&#8221; or &#8220;heave offering&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV). It may simply be called a &#8220;contribution&#8221; (so NAB). The verb of the sentence is from the same root: &#8220;you shall lift up/raise up.&#8221; It was to be an offering separated from the rest and raised up to the <sc>Lord in the sight of all. It was designed to remind the Israelites that the produce and the land belonged to God.</p>
<A NAME="1520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=719><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the first of your dough.&#8221; The phrase is not very clear. N. H. Snaith thinks it means a batch of loaves from the kneading trough &#8211; the first batch of the baking (<i>Leviticus and Numbers</i> [NCB], 251).</p>
<A NAME="1521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=720><b>sn</b> These regulations supplement what was already ruled on in the Levitical code for the purification and reparation offerings. See those rulings in Lev 4-7 for all the details. Some biblical scholars view the rules in Leviticus as more elaborate and therefore later. However, this probably represents a misunderstanding of the purpose of each collection.</p>
<A NAME="1522"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=721><b>tn</b> The verb is the plural imperfect; the sin discussed here is a sin committed by the community, or the larger part of the community.</p>
<A NAME="1523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=722><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;hand.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=723><b>tn</b> The idea of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1490;&#1464;&#1490;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lishgagah</font>) seems to be that of &#8220;inadvertence&#8221; or &#8220;without intent.&#8221; The text gives no indication of how this offense might be committed, or what it might include. It probably describes any transgressions done in ignorance of the Law that involved a violation of tabernacle procedure or priestly protocol or social misdemeanor. Even though it was done unintentionally, it was still a violation and called for ritual purification. </p>
<A NAME="1525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=724><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[away] from the eyes of the community.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=725><b>tn</b> The verb is the Piel perfect with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">vÿkhipper</font>) to continue the instruction of the passage: &#8220;the priest shall make atonement,&#8221; meaning the priest is to make atonement for the sin (thus the present translation). This verb means &#8220;to expiate,&#8221; &#8220;to atone for,&#8221; &#8220;to pacify.&#8221; It describes the ritual events by which someone who was separated from the holy <sc>Lord God could find acceptance into his presence through the sacrificial blood of the substitutionary animal. See Lev 1 and Num 17:6-15.</p>
<A NAME="1527"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=726><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;they will be forgiven.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1528"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=727><b>tn</b> Again, rather than translate literally &#8220;and it shall be forgiven [to] them&#8221; (all the community), one could say, &#8220;they (all the community) will be forgiven.&#8221; The meaning is the same.</p>
<A NAME="1529"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=728><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514; </font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im-nefesh </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akhat</font>), sometime translated &#8220;and if any soul.&#8221; But the word describes the whole person, the soul in the body; it refers here to the individual who sins. </p>
<A NAME="1530"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=729><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;soul.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1531"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=730><b>tn</b> The sin is described literally as acting &#8220;with a high hand&#8221; &#8211; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1491; &#1512;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492; </font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿyad ramah</font>). The expression means that someone would do something with deliberate defiance, with an arrogance in spite of what the <sc>Lord said. It is as if the sinner was about to attack God, or at least lifting his hand against God. The implication of the expression is that it was done in full knowledge of the Law (especially since this contrasts throughout with the sins of ignorance). Blatant defiance of the word of the <sc>Lord is dealt with differently. For similar expressions, see Exod 14:8 and Num 33:3.</p>
<A NAME="1532"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=731><b>tn</b> The verb occurs only in the Piel<i>;</i> it means &#8220;to blaspheme,&#8221; &#8220;to revile.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1533"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=732><b>tn</b> The word order in the Hebrew text places &#8220;Yahweh&#8221; first for emphasis &#8211; it is the <sc>Lord such a person insults.</p>
<A NAME="1534"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=733><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;soul.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1535"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=734><b>tn</b> The clause begins with &#8220;and&#8221; because the verb is the perfect tense with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive. As discussed with Num 9:13, to be cut off could mean excommunication from the community, death by the community, or death by divine intervention. </p>
<A NAME="1536"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=735><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1494;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bazah</font>, &#8220;to despise&#8221;) means to treat something as worthless, to treat it with contempt, to look down the nose at something as it were.</p>
<A NAME="1537"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=736><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">parar</font>, &#8220;to break&#8221;) can mean to nullify, break, or violate a covenant.</p>
<A NAME="1538"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=737><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;soul.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1539"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=738><b>tn</b> The construction uses the Niphal imperfect with the modifying Niphal infinitive absolute. The infinitive makes the sentence more emphatic. If the imperfect tense is taken as an instruction imperfect, then the infinitive makes the instruction more binding. If it is a simple future, then the future is certain. In either case, there is no exclusion from being cut off.</p>
<A NAME="1540"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=739><b>sn</b> The point is that the person&#8217;s iniquity remains with him &#8211; he must pay for his sin. The judgment of God in such a case is both appropriate and unavoidable.</p>
<A NAME="1541"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=740><b>tn</b> The preterite of the verb &#8220;to be&#8221; is here subordinated to the next, parallel verb form, to form a temporal clause.</p>
<A NAME="1542"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=741><b>sn</b> For this brief passage, see A. Phillips, &#8220;The Case of the Woodgatherer Reconsidered,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 19 (1969): 125-28; J. Weingreen, &#8220;The Case of the Woodgatherer (Numbers XV 32-36),&#8221; <i>VT</i> 16 (1966): 361-64; and B. J. Bamberger, &#8220;Revelations of Torah after Sinai,&#8221; <i>HUCA</i> 16 (1941): 97-113. Weingreen argues that there is something of the Rabbinic method of setting a fence around the Law here; in other words, if this sin were not punished, the Law would have been violated in greater ways. Gathering of wood, although seemingly harmless, is done with intent to kindle fire, and so reveals a culpable intent.</p>
<A NAME="1543"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=742><b>tn</b> The sentence begins with the emphatic use of the infinitive absolute with the verb in the Hophal imperfect: &#8220;he shall surely be put to death.&#8221; Then, a second infinitive absolute <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1490;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ragom</font>) provides the explanatory activity &#8211; all the community is to stone him with stones. The punishment is consistent with other decrees from God (see Exod 31:14,15; 35:2). Moses had either forgotten such, or they had simply neglected to (or were hesitant to) enact them.</p>
<A NAME="1544"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=743><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;stoned him with stones, and he died.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1545"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=744><b>tn</b> The construction uses the imperative followed by perfect tenses with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutives. The first perfect tense may be translated as the imperative, but the second, being a third common plural form, has to be subordinated as a purpose clause, or as the object of the preceding verb: &#8220;speak&#8230;and say&#8230;that they make.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1546"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=745><b>sn</b> This is a reference to the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1510;&#1460;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsitsit</font>), the fringes on the borders of the robes. They were meant to hang from the corners of the upper garment (Deut 22:12), which was worn on top of the clothing. The tassel was probably made by twisting the overhanging threads of the garment into a knot that would hang down. This was a reminder of the covenant. The tassels were retained down through history, and today more elaborate prayer shawls with tassels are worn during prayer. For more information, see F. J. Stephens, &#8220;The Ancient Significance of Sisith,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 50 (1931): 59-70; and S. Bertman, &#8220;Tasselled Garments in the Ancient East Mediterranean,&#8221; <i>BA</i> 24 (1961): 119-28.</p>
<A NAME="1547"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=746><b>sn</b> The blue color may represent the heavenly origin of the Law, or perhaps, since it is a royal color, the majesty of the <sc>Lord.</p>
<A NAME="1548"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=747><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;seek out, look into.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1549"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=748><b>tn</b> This last clause is a relative clause explaining the influence of the human heart and physical sight. It literally says, &#8220;which you go whoring after them.&#8221; The verb for &#8220;whoring&#8221; may be interpreted to mean &#8220;act unfaithfully.&#8221; So, the idea is these influences lead to unfaithful activity: &#8220;after which you act unfaithfully.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1550"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=749><b>tn</b> This clause also serves as a purpose/result clause of the preceding &#8211; &#8220;in order that you may remember&#8230;.&#8221; But because the line is so long, it is simpler to make this a separate sentence in the translation.</p>
