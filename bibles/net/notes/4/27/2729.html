<A NAME="2729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1270><b>sn</b> The word &#8220;spirit&#8221; probably refers to the Holy Spirit, in which case it would be rendered &#8220;in whom is the Spirit.&#8221; This would likely be a permanent endowment for Joshua. But it is also possible to take it to refer to a proper spirit to do all the things required of such a leader (which ultimately is a gift from the Spirit of God). The Hebrew text simply says &#8220;in whom is a spirit.&#8221;</p>
