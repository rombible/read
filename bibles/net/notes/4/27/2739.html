<A NAME="2739"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1280><b>sn</b> The new leader would not have the privilege that Moses had in speaking to God face to face. Rather, he would have to inquire of the <sc>Lord through the priest, and the priest would seek a decision by means of the Urim. The Urim and the Thummim were the sacred lots that the priest had in his pouch, the &#8220;breastplate&#8221; as it has traditionally been called. Since the Law had now been fully established, there would be fewer cases that the leader would need further rulings. Now it would simply be seeking the <sc>Lord&#8217;s word for matters such as whether to advance or not. The size, shape or substance of these objects is uncertain. See further C. Van Dam, <i>The Urim and Thummim</i>.</p>
