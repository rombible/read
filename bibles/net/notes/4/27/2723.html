<A NAME="2723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1264><b>sn</b> Using the basic meaning of the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qadash</font>, &#8220;to be separate, distinct, set apart&#8221;), we can understand better what Moses failed to do. He was supposed to have acted in a way that would have shown God to be distinct, different, holy. Instead, he gave the impression that God was capricious and hostile &#8211; very human. The leader has to be aware of what image he is conveying to the people.</p>
