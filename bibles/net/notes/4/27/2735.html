<A NAME="2735"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1276><b>tc</b> The Greek, Syriac, and Vulgate read &#8220;glory&#8221; for this form that occurs only here in the Pentateuch. Elsewhere it is rendered &#8220;majesty, splendor&#8221; (see Ps 96:6). It could even be &#8220;vitality&#8221; here. The authority being transferred here is both spiritual and civil.</p>
