<A NAME="2014"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=913><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;give.&#8221; The verb is the perfect tense with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive, as are the next two in the verse. These are not now equal to the imperatives, but imperfects, showing the results of speaking to the rock: &#8220;speak&#8230;and it will&#8230;and so you will&#8230;.&#8221; </p>
