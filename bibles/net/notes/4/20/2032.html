<A NAME="2032"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=931><b>sn</b> This a main highway running from Damascus in the north to the Gulf of Aqaba, along the ridge of the land. Some scholars suggest that the name may have been given by the later Assyrians (see B. Obed, &#8220;Observations on Methods of Assyrian Rule in Transjordan after the Palestinian Campaign of Tiglathpileser III,&#8221; <i>JNES</i> 29 [1970]: 177-86). Bronze Age fortresses have been discovered along this highway, attesting to its existence in the time of Moses. The original name came from the king who developed the highway, probably as a trading road (see S. Cohen, <i>IDB</i> 3:35-36).</p>
