<A NAME="2036"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=935><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text uses singular pronouns, &#8220;I&#8221; and &#8220;my,&#8221; but it is the people of Israel that are intended, and so it may be rendered in the plural. Similarly, Edom speaks in the first person, probably from the king. But it too could be rendered &#8220;we.&#8221;</p>
