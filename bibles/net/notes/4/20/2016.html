<A NAME="2016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=915><b>tn</b> The word order and the emphasis of the tense are important to this passage. The word order is &#8220;from this rock must we bring out to you water?&#8221; The emphasis is clearly on &#8220;from this rock!&#8221; The verb is the imperfect tense; it has one of the modal nuances here, probably obligatory &#8211; &#8220;must we do this?&#8221;</p>
