<A NAME="206"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=905><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">riv</font>); it is often used in the Bible for a legal complaint, a law suit, at least in form. But it can also describe a quarrel, or strife, like that between Abram&#8217;s men and Lot&#8217;s men in Genesis 13. It will be the main verb behind the commemorative name Meribah, the place where the people strove with God. It is a far more serious thing than grumbling &#8211; it is directed, intentional, and well-argued. For further discussion, see J. Limburg, &#8220;The Root <i>&#8216;rib&#8217;</i> and the Prophetic Lawsuit Speeches,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 88 (1969): 291-304.</p>
