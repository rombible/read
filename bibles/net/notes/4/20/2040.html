<A NAME="2040"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=939><b>sn</b> The traditional location for this is near Petra (Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 4.4.7). There is serious doubt about this location since it is well inside Edomite territory, and since it is very inaccessible for the transfer of the office. Another view places it not too far from Kadesh Barnea, about 15 miles (25 km) northeast at Jebel Madurah, on the northwest edge of Edom and so a suitable point of departure for approaching Canaan from the south (see J. L. Mihelec, <i>IDB</i> 2:644; and J. de Vaulx, <i>Les Nombres</i> [SB], 231). Others suggest it was at the foot of Mount Hor and not actually up in the mountains (see Deut 10:6).</p>
