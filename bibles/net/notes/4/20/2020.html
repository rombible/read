<A NAME="2020"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=919><b>tn</b> There is debate as to exactly what the sin of Moses was. Some interpreters think that the real sin might have been that he refused to do this at first, but that fact has been suppressed from the text. Some think the text was deliberately vague to explain why they could not enter the land without demeaning them. Others simply, and more likely, note that in Moses there was unbelief, pride, anger, impatience &#8211; disobedience. </p>
