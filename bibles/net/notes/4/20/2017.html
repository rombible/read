<A NAME="2017"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=916><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;to sanctify me.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The verb is the main word for &#8220;believe, trust.&#8221; It is the verb that describes the faith in the Word of the <sc>Lord that leads to an appropriate action. Here God says that Moses did not believe him, meaning that what he did showed more of Moses than of what God said. Moses had taken a hostile stance toward the people, and then hit the rock twice. This showed that Moses was not satisfied with what God said, but made it more forceful and terrifying, thus giving the wrong picture of God to the people. By doing this the full power and might of the <sc>Lord was not displayed to the people. It was a momentary lack of faith, but it had to be dealt with.</p>
