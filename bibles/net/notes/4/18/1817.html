<A NAME="1817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=845><b>sn</b> Salt was used in all the offerings; its importance as a preservative made it a natural symbol for the covenant which was established by sacrifice. Even general agreements were attested by sacrifice, and the phrase &#8220;covenant of salt&#8221; speaks of such agreements as binding and irrevocable. Note the expression in Ezra 4:14, &#8220;we have been salted with the salt of the palace.&#8221; See further J. F. Ross, <i>IDB</i> 4:167.</p>
