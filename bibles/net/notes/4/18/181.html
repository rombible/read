<A NAME="181"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=829><b>sn</b> This chapter and the next may have been inserted here to explain how the priests are to function because in the preceding chapter Aaron&#8217;s position was affirmed. The chapter seems to fall into four units: responsibilities of priests (vv. 1-7), their portions (vv. 8-19), responsibilities of Levites (vv. 20-24), and instructions for Levites (vv. 25-32).</p>
