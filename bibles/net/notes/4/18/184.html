There Leah hoped that with the birth of Levi her husband would be attached to her. Here, with the selection of the tribe to serve in the sanctuary, there is the wordplay again showing that the Levites will be attached to Aaron and the priests. The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yillavu</font>), which forms a nice wordplay with <font face="Scholar">Levi</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1461;&#1493;&#1460;&#1497;</font>). The tribe will now be attached to the sanctuary. The verb is the imperfect with a <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) that shows volitive sequence after the imperative, here indicating a purpose clause.</p>
