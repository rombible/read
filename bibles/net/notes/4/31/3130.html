<A NAME="3130"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1367><b>sn</b> Here again we encounter one of the difficulties of the book, the use of the large numbers. Only twelve thousand soldiers fought the Midianites, but they brought back this amount of plunder, including 32,000 girls. Until a solution for numbers in the book can be found, or the current translation confirmed, one must remain cautious in interpretation.</p>
