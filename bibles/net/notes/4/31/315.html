<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1342><b>tn</b> The Niphal imperative, literally &#8220;arm yourselves,&#8221; is the call to mobilize the nation for war. It is followed by the jussive, &#8220;and they will be,&#8221; which would then be subordinated to say &#8220;that they may be.&#8221; The versions changed the verb to a<i> </i>Hiphil, but that is unnecessary: &#8220;arm some of yourselves.&#8221;</p>
