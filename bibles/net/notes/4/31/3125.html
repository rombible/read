<A NAME="3125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1362><b>sn</b> Purification by fire is unique to this event. Making these metallic objects &#8220;pass through the fire&#8221; was not only a way of purifying (burning off impurities), but it seems to be a dedicatory rite as well to the <sc>Lord and his people. The aspect of passing through the fire is one used by these pagans for child sacrifice.</p>
