<A NAME="301"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1311><b>sn</b> Num 30 deals with vows that are different than the vows discussed in Lev 27 and Num 6. The material is placed here after all the rulings of the offerings, but it could have been revealed to Moses at any time, such as the Nazirite vows, or the question of the daughters&#8217; inheritance. The logic of placing it here may be that a festival was the ideal place for discharging a vow. For additional material on vows, see R. de Vaux, <i>Ancient Israel</i>, 465-66.</p>
