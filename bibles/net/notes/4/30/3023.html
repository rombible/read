<A NAME="3023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1333><b>tn</b> The sentence uses the infinitive construct <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">annot</font>, &#8220;to afflict&#8221;), which is the same word used in the instructions for the day of atonement in which people are to afflict themselves (their souls). The case here may be that the woman would take a religious vow on such an occasion to humble herself, to mortify her flesh, to abstain from certain things, perhaps even sexual relations within marriage.</p>
