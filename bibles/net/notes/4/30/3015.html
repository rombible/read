<A NAME="3015"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1325><b>tn</b> The verb has often been translated &#8220;forgive&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV, NASB, NRSV, NLT), but that would suggest a sin that needed forgiving. The idea of &#8220;release from obligation&#8221; is better; the idea is like that of having a debt &#8220;forgiven&#8221; or &#8220;retired.&#8221; In other words, she is free from the vow she had made. The <sc>Lord will not hold the woman responsible to do what she vowed. </p>
