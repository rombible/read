<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=946><b>sn</b> This chapter has several events in it: the victory over Arad (vv. 1-3), the plague of serpents (vv. 4-9), the approach to Moab (vv. 10-20), and the victory over Sihon and Og (vv. 21-35). For information, see D. M. Gunn, &#8220;The &#8216;Battle Report&#8217;: Oral or Scribal Convention.&#8221; <i>JBL </i>93 (1974): 513-18; and of the extensive literature on the archaeological site, see <i>EAEHL</i> 1:74-89.</p>
<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=947><b>sn</b> The name <i>Arad</i> probably refers to a place a number of miles away from Tel Arad in southern Israel. The name could also refer to the whole region (like Edom).</p>
<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=948><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the south&#8221;; &#8220;Negev&#8221; has become a technical name for the southern desert region and is still in use in modern times.</p>
<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=949><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text uses a cognate accusative with the verb: They vowed a vow. The Israelites were therefore determined with God&#8217;s help to defeat Arad.</p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=950><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has the infinitive absolute and the imperfect tense of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">natan</font>) to stress the point &#8211; if you will surely/indeed give.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=951><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=952><b>tn</b> On the surface this does not sound like much of a vow. But the key is in the use of the verb for &#8220;utterly destroy&#8221; &#8211; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kharam</font>). Whatever was put to this &#8220;ban&#8221; or &#8220;devotion&#8221; belonged to God, either for his use, or for destruction. The oath was in fact saying that they would take nothing from this for themselves. It would simply be the removal of what was alien to the faith, or to God&#8217;s program.</p>
<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=953><b>tc</b> Smr, Greek, and Syriac add &#8220;into his hand.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=954><b>tn</b> In the Hebrew text the verb has no expressed subject, and so here too is made passive. The name &#8220;Hormah&#8221; is etymologically connected to the verb &#8220;utterly destroy,&#8221; forming the popular etymology (or paronomasia, a phonetic wordplay capturing the significance of the event).</p>
<A NAME="2110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=955><b>tn</b> The &#8220;Red Sea&#8221; is the general designation for the bodies of water on either side of the Sinai peninsula, even though they are technically gulfs from the Red Sea.</p>
<A NAME="2111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=956><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the soul of the people,&#8221; expressing the innermost being of the people as they became frustrated. </p>
<A NAME="2112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=957><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;our souls.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=958><b>tn</b> The Israelites&#8217; opinion about the manna was clear enough &#8211; &#8220;worthless.&#8221; The word used is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1511;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qÿloqel</font>, &#8220;good for nothing, worthless, miserable&#8221;). </p>
<A NAME="2114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=959><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fiery.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=960><b>tn</b> The designation of the serpents/ snakes is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nÿkhashim</font>), which is similar to the word for &#8220;bronze&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1495;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nÿkhoshet</font>). This has led some scholars to describe the serpents as bronze in color. The description of them as fiery indicates they were poisonous. Perhaps the snake in question is a species of adder.</p>
<A NAME="2116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=961><b>tn</b> The verb is the Hiphil jussive with a <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sur</font>); after the imperative this form may be subordinated to become a purpose clause.</p>
<A NAME="2117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=962><b>tn</b> The word order is slightly different in Hebrew: &#8220;and it shall be anyone who is bitten when he looks at it he shall live.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=963><b>sn</b> The image of the snake was to be a symbol of the curse that the Israelites were experiencing; by lifting the snake up on a pole Moses was indicating that the curse would be drawn away from the people &#8211; if they looked to it, which was a sign of faith. This symbol was later stored in the temple, until it became an object of worship and had to be removed (2 Kgs 18:4). Jesus, of course, alluded to it and used it as an illustration of his own mission. He would become the curse, and be lifted up, so that people who looked by faith to him would live (John 3:14). For further material, see D. J. Wiseman, &#8220;Flying Serpents,&#8221; <i>TynBul</i> 23 (1972): 108-10; and K. R. Joines, &#8220;The Bronze Serpent in the Israelite Cult,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 87 (1968): 245-56.</p>
<A NAME="2119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=964><b>sn</b> See further D. L. Christensen, &#8220;Numbers 21:14-15 and the Book of the Wars of Yahweh,&#8221; <i>CBQ </i>36 (1974): 359-60; G. W. Coats, &#8220;The Wilderness Itinerary,&#8221; <i>CBQ </i>34 (1972): 135-52; G. I. Davies, &#8220;The Wilderness Itinerary,&#8221; <i>TB</i> 25 (1974): 46-81; idem, <i>The Way of the Wilderness</i>; G. E. Mendenhall, &#8220;The Hebrew Conquest of Palestine,&#8221; <i>BA</i> 25 (1962): 66-87. </p>
<A NAME="2120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=965><b>sn</b> These places are uncertain. <i>Oboth</i> may be some 15 miles (25 km) from the south end of the Dead Sea at a place called &#8216;Ain el-Weiba. <i>Iye Abarim</i> may be the modern Mahay at the southeastern corner of Moab. See J. Simons, <i>The Geographical and Topographical Texts of the Old Testament</i>.</p>
<A NAME="2121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=966><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the rising of the sun.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=967><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;border.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=968><b>tc</b> The ancient versions show a wide variation here: Smr has &#8220;Waheb on the Sea of Reeds,&#8221; the Greek version has &#8220;he has set Zoob on fire and the torrents of Arnon.&#8221; Several modern versions treat the first line literally, taking the two main words as place names: Waheb and Suphah. This seems most likely, but then there would then be no subject or verb. One would need something like &#8220;the Israelites marched through.&#8221; The KJV, following the Vulgate, made the first word a verb and read the second as &#8220;Red Sea&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;what he did in the Red Sea.&#8221; But subject of the passage is the terrain. D. L. Christensen proposed emending the first part from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514; &#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1461;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et vahev</font>) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492; &#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<i>attah yehvah,</i> &#8220;the <sc>Lord came&#8221;). But this is subjective. See his article &#8220;Num 21:14-15 and the Book of the Wars of Yahweh,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 36 (1974): 359-60.</p>
<A NAME="2124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=969><b>tc</b> There are many variations in this text, but the MT reading of something like &#8220;the descent of the torrents/valleys&#8221; is preferable, since it is describing the topography.</p>
<A NAME="2125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=970><b>sn</b> The place is unknown; it is apparently an important city in the region.</p>
<A NAME="2126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=971><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;they traveled&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text, but are supplied here because of English style. The same phrase is supplied at the end of v. 18.</p>
<A NAME="2127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=972><b>sn</b> Isa 15:8 mentions a Moabite Beerelim, which Simons suggests is Wadi Ettemed.</p>
<A NAME="2128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=973><b>tn</b> After the adverb &#8220;then&#8221; the prefixed conjugation has the preterite force. For the archaic constructions, see D. N. Freedman, &#8220;Archaic Forms in Early Hebrew Poetry,&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 72 (1960): 101-7. The poem shows all the marks of being ancient.</p>
<A NAME="2129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=974><b>sn</b> The brief song is supposed to be an old workers&#8217; song, and so the mention of leaders and princes is unusual. Some think they are given credit because they directed where the workers were to dig. The scepter and staff might have served some symbolic or divining custom.</p>
<A NAME="2130"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=975><b>tn</b> Or perhaps as a place name, &#8220;Jeshimon.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=976><b>sn</b> For this section, see further J. R. Bartlett, &#8220;Sihon and Og of the Amorites,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 20 (1970): 257-77, and &#8220;The Moabites and the Edomites,&#8221; <i>Peoples of Old Testament Times</i>, 229-58; S. H. Horn, &#8220;The Excavations at Tell Hesban, 1973,&#8221; <i>ADAJ</i> 18 (1973): 87-88.</p>
<A NAME="2132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=977><b>tc</b> Smr and the LXX have &#8220;words of peace.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=978><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text uses the singular in these verses to match the reference to &#8220;Israel.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=979><b>tc</b> Smr has &#8220;by the King&#8217;s way I will go. I will not turn aside to the right or the left.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2135"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=980><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Sihon.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=981><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;people.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=982><b>tn</b> The clause begins with a preterite with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive, but may be subordinated to the next preterite as a temporal clause. </p>
<A NAME="2138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=983><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has &#8220;Israel,&#8221; but the verb is plural.</p>
<A NAME="2139"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=984><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;with the edge of the sword.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2140"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=985><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;its daughters.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2141"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=986><b>sn</b> There is a justice, always, in the divine plan for the conquest of the land. Modern students of the Bible often think that the conquest passages are crude and unjust. But an understanding of the ancient Near East is critical here. This Sihon was not a part of the original population of the land. He himself invaded the territory and destroyed the population of Moab that was indigenous there and established his own kingdom. The ancient history is filled with such events; it is the way of life they chose &#8211; conquer or be conquered. For Israel to defeat them was in part a turning of their own devices back on their heads &#8211; &#8220;those that live by the sword will die by the sword.&#8221; Sihon knew this, and he did not wait, but took the war to Israel. Israel wanted to pass through, not fight. But now they would either fight or be pushed into the gorge. So God used Israel to defeat Sihon, who had no claim to the land, as part of divine judgment.</p>
<A NAME="2142"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=987><b>sn</b> Proverbs of antiquity could include pithy sayings or longer songs, riddles, or poems composed to catch the significance or the irony of an event. This is a brief poem to remember the event, like an Egyptian victory song. It may have originated as an Amorite war taunt song; it was sung to commemorate this victory. It was cited later by Jeremiah (48:45-46). The composer invites his victorious people to rebuild the conquered city as a new capital for Sihon. He then turns to address the other cities which his God(s) has/have given to him. See P. D. Hanson, &#8220;The Song of Heshbon and David&#8217;s Nir,&#8221; <i>HTR</i> 61 (1968): 301. </p>
<A NAME="2143"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=988><b>tn</b> Meaning, &#8220;rebuilt and restored.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=989><b>tc</b> Some scholars emend to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bal</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>), reading &#8220;and devoured,&#8221; instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aley</font>, &#8220;its lords&#8221;); cf. NAB, NRSV, TEV. This emendation is closer to the Greek and makes a better parallelism, but the MT makes good sense as it stands.</p>
<A NAME="2145"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=990><b>sn</b> The note of holy war emerges here as the victory is a victory over the local gods as well as over the people.</p>
<A NAME="2146"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=991><b>tc</b> The first verb is difficult. MT has &#8220;we shot at them.&#8221; The Greek has &#8220;their posterity perished&#8221; (see GKC 218 §76.<i>f</i>).</p>
<A NAME="2147"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=992><b>tc</b> The relative pronoun &#8220;which&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">asher</font>) posed a problem for the ancient scribes here, as indicated by the so-called extraordinary point (<i>punta extraordinaria</i>) over the letter <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">resh</font>) of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;</font>.

Some modern scholars emend the word to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sho</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>, &#8220;devastation&#8221;).</p>
