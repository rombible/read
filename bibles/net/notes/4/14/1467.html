<A NAME="1467"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=691><b>sn</b> Their sin was unbelief. They could have gone and conquered the area if they had trusted the <sc>Lord for their victory. They did not, and so they were condemned to perish in the wilderness. Now, thinking that by going they can undo all that, they plan to go. But this is also disobedience, for the <sc>Lord said they would not now take the land, and yet they think they can. Here is their second sin, presumption. </p>
