<A NAME="143"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=627><b>tn</b> There are a number of things that the verb &#8220;to weep&#8221; or &#8220;wail&#8221; can connote. It could reflect joy, grief, lamentation, or repentance, but here it reflects fear, hopelessness, or vexation at the thought of coming all this way and being defeated by the Canaanite armies. See Judg 20:23, 26.</p>
