<A NAME="1438"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=662><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1505;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nasah</font>) means &#8220;to test, to tempt, to prove.&#8221; It can be used to indicate things are tried or proven, or for testing in a good sense, or tempting in the bad sense, i.e., putting God to the test. In all uses there is uncertainty or doubt about the outcome. Some uses of the verb are positive: If God tests Abraham in Genesis 22:1, it is because there is uncertainty whether he fears the <sc>Lord or not; if people like Gideon put out the fleece and test the <sc>Lord, it is done by faith but in order to be certain of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s presence. But here, when these people put God to the test ten times, it was because they doubted the goodness and ability of God, and this was a major weakness. They had proof to the contrary, but chose to challenge God.</p>
