<A NAME="1443"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=667><b>sn</b> The judgment on Israel is that they turn back to the desert and not attack the tribes in the land. So a parenthetical clause is inserted to state who was living there. They would surely block the entrance to the land from the south &#8211; unless God removed them. And he is not going to do that for Israel. </p>
