<A NAME="1441"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=665><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>) indicates a negative oath formula: &#8220;if&#8221; means &#8220;they will not.&#8221; It is elliptical. In a human oath one would be saying: &#8220;The <sc>Lord do to me <i>if they see</i>&#8230;,&#8221; meaning &#8220;they will by no means see.&#8221; Here God is swearing that they will not see the land.</p>
