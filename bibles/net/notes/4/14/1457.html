<A NAME="1457"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=681><b>tn</b> The infinitive is from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tamam</font>), which means &#8220;to be complete.&#8221; The word is often used to express completeness in a good sense &#8211; whole, blameless, or the like. Here and in v. 35 it seems to mean &#8220;until your deaths have been completed.&#8221; See also Gen 47:15; Deut 2:15.</p>
