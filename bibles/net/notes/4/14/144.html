<A NAME="144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=628><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb &#8220;to murmur&#8221; is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lun</font>). It is a strong word, signifying far more than complaining or grumbling, as some of the modern translations have it. The word is most often connected to the wilderness experience. It is paralleled in the literature with the word &#8220;to rebel.&#8221; The murmuring is like a parliamentary vote of no confidence, for they no longer trusted their leaders and wished to choose a new leader and return. This &#8220;return to Egypt&#8221; becomes a symbol of their lack of faith in the <sc>Lord. </p>
