<A NAME="1424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=648><b>tn</b> The construction is unusual in that we have here a perfect tense with a <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive with no verb before it to establish the time sequence. The context requires that this be taken as a <i>vav </i>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive. It actually forms the protasis for the next verse, and would best be rendered &#8220;when<i>&#8230;</i>then they will say.&#8221;</p>
