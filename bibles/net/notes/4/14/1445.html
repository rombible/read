<A NAME="1445"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=669><b>sn</b> It is worth mentioning in passing that this is one of the Rabbinic proof texts for having at least ten men to form a congregation and have prayer. If God called ten men (the bad spies) a &#8220;congregation,&#8221; then a congregation must have ten men. But here the word &#8220;community/congregation&#8221; refers in this context to the people of Israel as a whole, not just to the ten spies.</p>
