It arranged the general duties of each of the tribes. The second census of Levites now will focus on those between 30 and 50 years of age, those who were actually in service. These are the working Levites. The duties here will be more specific for each of the families. The Kohathites, although part of the ordinary ministry of Levites, were a special group chosen to handle the most holy furnishings. J. Milgrom shows three aspects of their service: (1) skilled labor (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1488;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mÿla</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">khah</font>) or &#8220;work,&#8221; (2) physical labor (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1489;&#1465;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">&#8216;avodah</font>) or &#8220;service,&#8221; and (3) assisting the priests (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;&#1461;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">sharet</font>) or &#8220;ministering&#8221; (see his <i>Studies in Levitical Terminology</i>, 1:60-70).</p>
