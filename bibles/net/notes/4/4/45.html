<A NAME="45"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=152><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text uses the infinitive construct in an adverbial clause of time; literally it says &#8220;in the journeying of the camp.&#8221; The genitive in such constructions is usually the subject. Here the implication is that people would be preparing to transport the camp and its equipment.</p>
