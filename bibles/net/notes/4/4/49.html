<A NAME="49"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=156><b>tn</b> The &#8220;pole&#8221; or &#8220;bar&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1496;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mot</font>) is of a different style than the poles used for transporting the ark. It seems to be a flexible bar carried by two men with the implements being transported tied to the bar. The NEB suggests the items were put in a bag and slung over the bar, but there is no indication of the manner.</p>
