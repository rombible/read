<A NAME="46"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=153><b>tn</b> The exact meaning of the Hebrew word here is difficult to determine. The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">takhash</font>) has been translated &#8220;badgers&#8217; [skins]&#8221; by KJV. ASV has &#8220;sealskin&#8221; while RSV uses &#8220;goatskin&#8221;; NEB and NASB have &#8220;porpoise skin,&#8221; and NIV has &#8220;hides of sea cows.&#8221; This is close to &#8220;porpoise,&#8221; and seems influenced by the Arabic. The evidence is not strong for any of these meanings, and some of the suggestions would be problematic. It is possible the word is simply used for &#8220;fine leather,&#8221; based on the Egyptian <font face="Scholar">ths</font>. This has been followed by NRSV (&#8220;fine leather&#8221;) and NLT (&#8220;fine goatskin leather&#8221;) along with the present translation.
