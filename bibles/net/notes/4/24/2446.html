<A NAME="2446"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1167><b>tc</b> The MT is difficult. The Kittim refers normally to Cyprus, or any maritime people to the west. W. F. Albright proposed emending the line to &#8220;islands will gather in the north, ships from the distant sea&#8221; (&#8220;The Oracles of Balaam,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 63 [1944]: 222-23).
