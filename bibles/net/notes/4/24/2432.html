<A NAME="2432"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1153><b>sn</b> This is a figure for a king (see also Isa 14:12) not only in the Bible but in the ancient Near Eastern literature as a whole. The immediate reference of the prophecy seems to be to David, but the eschatological theme goes beyond him. There is to be a connection made between this passage and the sighting of a star in its ascendancy by the magi, who then traveled to Bethlehem to see the one born King of the Jews (Matt 2:2). The expression &#8220;son of a star&#8221; (<i>Aram Bar Kochba</i>)<i> </i>became a title for a later claimant to kingship, but he was doomed by the Romans in <sc>a.d. 135.</></p>
