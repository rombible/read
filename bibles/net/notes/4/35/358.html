<A NAME="358"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1452><b>sn</b> The precise nature of the layout described here is not altogether clear. V. 4 speaks of the distance from the wall as being 500 yards; v. 5, however, describes measurements of 1,000 yards. Various proposals have been made in order to harmonize vv. 4 and 5. P. J. Budd, <i>Numbers</i> (WBC), 376, makes the following suggestion: &#8220;It may be best to assume that the cubits of the Levitical pasture lands are cubit frontages of land &#8211; in other words on each side of the city there was a block of land with a frontage of two thousand cubits (v 5), and a depth of 1000 cubits (v 4).&#8221;</p>
