<A NAME="351"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1445><b>sn</b> This section has two main parts, the Levitical cities (vv. 1-8) and the Cities of Refuge (vv. 9-34). </p>
<A NAME="352"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1446><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B2; Map6-E1; Map7-E1; Map8-E3; Map10-A2; Map11-A1.</p>
<A NAME="353"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1447><b>tn</b> The verb is the perfect tense with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive: &#8220;command&#8230;and they will give,&#8221; or &#8220;that they give.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="354"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1448><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they&#8221;; the referent (the Israelites) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="355"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1449><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;one thousand cubits.&#8221; The standard cubit in the OT is assumed by most authorities to be about eighteen inches (45 cm) in length, so this would be a distance of 1,500 feet or 500 yards (675 meters).</p>
<A NAME="356"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1450><b>tn</b> The verb is the Qal perfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">madad</font>, &#8220;to measure&#8221;). With its <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive it carries the same instructional force as the imperfect.</p>
<A NAME="357"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1451><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;two thousand cubits&#8221; (also three more times in this verse). This would be a distance of 3,000 feet or 1,000 yards (1,350 meters).</p>
<A NAME="358"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1452><b>sn</b> The precise nature of the layout described here is not altogether clear. V. 4 speaks of the distance from the wall as being 500 yards; v. 5, however, describes measurements of 1,000 yards. Various proposals have been made in order to harmonize vv. 4 and 5. P. J. Budd, <i>Numbers</i> (WBC), 376, makes the following suggestion: &#8220;It may be best to assume that the cubits of the Levitical pasture lands are cubit frontages of land &#8211; in other words on each side of the city there was a block of land with a frontage of two thousand cubits (v 5), and a depth of 1000 cubits (v 4).&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="359"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1453><b>tn</b> The &#8220;manslayer&#8221; is the verb &#8220;to kill&#8221; in a participial form, providing the subject of the clause. The verb means &#8220;to kill&#8221;; it can mean accidental killing, premeditated killing, or capital punishment. The clause uses the infinitive to express purpose or result: &#8220;to flee there the manslayer,&#8221; means &#8220;so that the manslayer may flee there.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1454><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;River&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but has been supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1455><b>tn</b> the verb is the preterite of &#8220;die.&#8221; The sentence has :&#8220;if&#8230;he strikes him and he dies.&#8221; The <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive is showing the natural result of the blow.</p>
<A NAME="3512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1456><b>tn</b> The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">go</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>) is the one who protects the family by seeking vengeance for a crime. This is the same verb used for levirate marriages and other related customs.</p>
<A NAME="3513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1457><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text is more vivid: &#8220;by lying in wait.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1458><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in it.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1459><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1460><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a statute of judgment&#8221; (so KJV).</p>
<A NAME="3517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1461><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220; at the mouth of&#8221;; the metonymy stresses it is at their report.</p>
<A NAME="3518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1462><b>tn</b> The verb should be given the nuance of imperfect of potentiality.</p>
<A NAME="3519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1463><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the priest.&#8221; The Greek and the Syriac have &#8220;high priest.&#8221; The present translation, along with many English versions, uses &#8220;high priest&#8221; as a clarification.</p>
