<A NAME="241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1122><b>sn</b> For a thorough study of the arrangement of this passage, see E. B. Smick, &#8220;A Study of the Structure of the Third Balaam Oracle,&#8221; <i>The Law and the Prophets</i>, 242-52. He sees the oracle as having an introductory strophe (vv. 3, 4), followed by two stanzas (vv. 5, 6) that introduce the body (vv. 7b-9b) before the final benediction (v. 9b).</p>
<A NAME="242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1123><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;it was good in the eyes of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1124><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;as time after time.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="244"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1125><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nÿkhashim</font>) means &#8220;omens,&#8221; or possibly &#8220;auguries.&#8221; Balaam is not even making a pretense now of looking for such things, because they are not going to work. God has overruled them.</p>
<A NAME="245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1126><b>tn</b> The idiom signifies that he had a determination and resolution to look out over where the Israelites were, so that he could appreciate more their presence and use that as the basis for his expressing of the oracle.</p>
<A NAME="246"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1127><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;living according to their tribes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="247"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1128><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he took up his oracle and said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1129><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1488;&#1467;&#1501;</font><font face="Scholar"> </font>(<font face="Scholar">nÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">um</font>) is an &#8220;oracle.&#8221; It is usually followed by a subjective genitive, indicating the doer of the action. The word could be rendered &#8220;says,&#8221; but this translations is more specific.</p>
<A NAME="249"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1130><b>tn</b> The Greek version reads &#8220;the one who sees truly.&#8221; The word has been interpreted in both ways, &#8220;shut&#8221; or &#8220;open.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1131><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;flat on the ground&#8221; is supplied in the translation for clarity. The Greek version interprets the line to mean &#8220;falling asleep.&#8221; It may mean falling into a trance. </p>
<A NAME="2411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1132><b>tn</b> The last colon simply has &#8220;falling, but opened eyes.&#8221; The falling may simply refer to lying prone; and the opened eyes may refer to his receiving a vision. See H. E. Freeman, <i>An Introduction to the Old Testament Prophets</i>, 37-41. </p>
<A NAME="2412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1133><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mah</font>) has an exclamatory sense: &#8220;How!&#8221; (see Gen 28:17). </p>
<A NAME="2413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1134><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;as valleys they spread forth.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1135><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;rows of palms.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1136><b>sn</b> The language seems to be more poetic than precise. N. H. Snaith notes that cedars do not grow beside water; he also connects &#8220;aloes&#8221; to the eaglewood that is more exotic, and capable of giving off an aroma (<i>Leviticus and Numbers</i> [NCB], 298).</p>
<A NAME="2416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1137><b>tc</b> For this colon the LXX has &#8220;a man shall come out of his seed.&#8221; Cf. the Syriac Peshitta and Targum.</p>
<A NAME="2417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1138><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;many.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1139><b>sn</b> These two lines are difficult, but the general sense is that of irrigation buckets and a well-watered land. The point is that Israel will be prosperous and fruitful.</p>
<A NAME="2419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1140><b>sn</b> Many commentators see this as a reference to Agag of 1 Sam 15:32-33, the Amalekite king slain by Samuel, for that is the one we know. But that is by no means clear, for this text does not identify this Agag. If it is that king, then this poem, or this line in this poem, would have to be later, unless one were to try to argue for a specific prophecy. Whoever this Agag is, he is a symbol of power.</p>
<A NAME="2420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1141><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they will devour nations,&#8221; their adversaries.</p>
<A NAME="2421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1142><b>tn</b> On the usage of this word see <i>HALOT</i> 517 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;</font>.</p>
<A NAME="2422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1143><b>sn</b> This is apparently a sign of contempt or derision (see Job 27:23; and Lam 2:15).</p>
<A NAME="2423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1144><b>tn</b> The construction is emphatic, using the infinitive absolute with the perfect tense for &#8220;bless.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1145><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;flee to your place.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1146><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I am not able to go beyond.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2426"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1147><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;mouth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2427"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1148><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from my heart.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2428"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1149><b>tn</b> The construction is the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>) suffixed followed by the active participle. This is the <i>futur instans </i>use of the participle, to express something that is about to happen: &#8220;I am about to go.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2429"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1150><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the latter days.&#8221; For more on this expression, see E. Lipinski, &#8220;<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;</font> dans les textes préexiliques,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 20 (1970): 445-50.</p>
<A NAME="2430"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1151><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he took up his oracle and said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2431"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1152><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;near.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2432"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1153><b>sn</b> This is a figure for a king (see also Isa 14:12) not only in the Bible but in the ancient Near Eastern literature as a whole. The immediate reference of the prophecy seems to be to David, but the eschatological theme goes beyond him. There is to be a connection made between this passage and the sighting of a star in its ascendancy by the magi, who then traveled to Bethlehem to see the one born King of the Jews (Matt 2:2). The expression &#8220;son of a star&#8221; (<i>Aram Bar Kochba</i>)<i> </i>became a title for a later claimant to kingship, but he was doomed by the Romans in <sc>a.d. 135.</></p>
<A NAME="2433"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1154><b>tn</b> The verb is the perfect tense with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive; it is equal to the imperfect expressing the future. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font><font face="Scholar"> </font>(<font face="Scholar">darakh</font>), related to the noun &#8220;way, road,&#8221; seems to mean something like tread on, walk, march.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2434"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1155><b>sn</b> The &#8220;scepter&#8221; is metonymical for a king who will rise to power. NEB strangely rendered this as &#8220;comet&#8221; to make a parallel with &#8220;star.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2435"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1156><b>tn</b> The word is literally &#8220;corners,&#8221; but may refer to the corners of the head, and so &#8220;skull.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2436"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1157><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;shatter, devastate.&#8221; Smr reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1465;&#1491;&#1456;&#1511;&#1465;&#1491;</font><font face="Scholar"> </font>(<font face="Scholar">qodqod</font>, &#8220;head; crown; pate&#8221;). Smr follows Jer 48:45 which appears to reflect Num 24:17.</p>
<A NAME="2437"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1158><b>sn</b> The prophecy begins to be fulfilled when David defeated Moab and Edom and established an empire including them. But the Messianic promise extends far beyond that to the end of the age and the inclusion of these defeated people in the program of the coming King. </p>
<A NAME="2438"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1159><b>sn</b> <i>Seir</i> is the chief mountain range of Edom (Deut 33:2), and so the reference here is to the general area of Edom.</p>
<A NAME="2439"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1160><b>tn</b> Or, understanding the Hebrew word for &#8220;city&#8221; as a place name, &#8220;of Ir&#8221; (cf. NRSV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="2440"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1161><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Balaam) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2441"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1162><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he lifted up his oracle and said.&#8221; So also in vv. 21, 23.</p>
<A NAME="2442"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1163><b>sn</b> This probably means that it held first place, or it thought that it was &#8220;the first of the nations.&#8221; It was not the first, either in order or greatness.</p>
<A NAME="2443"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1164><b>sn</b> A pun is made on the name Kenite by using the word &#8220;your nest&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1462;&#1498;&#1464;</font>, <font face="Scholar">qinnekha</font>); the location may be the rocky cliffs overlooking Petra.</p>
<A NAME="2444"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1165><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Nevertheless Cain will be wasted; how long will Asshur take you captive?&#8221; Cain was believed to be the ancestor of the Kenites. The NAB has &#8220;yet destined for burning, even as I watch, are your inhabitants.&#8221; Asshur may refer to a north Arabian group of people of Abrahamic stock (Gen 25:3), and not the Assyrian empire.</p>
<A NAME="2445"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1166><b>tc</b> Because there is no parallel line, some have thought that it dropped out (see de Vaulx, <i>Les Nombres</i>, 296).</p>
<A NAME="2446"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1167><b>tc</b> The MT is difficult. The Kittim refers normally to Cyprus, or any maritime people to the west. W. F. Albright proposed emending the line to &#8220;islands will gather in the north, ships from the distant sea&#8221; (&#8220;The Oracles of Balaam,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 63 [1944]: 222-23). Some commentators accept that reading as the original state of the text, since the present MT makes little sense.</p>
<A NAME="2447"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1168><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;Assyria&#8221; (so NCV, TEV, CEV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="2448"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1169><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;it will end in utter destruction.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2449"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1170><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;place.&#8221;</p>
