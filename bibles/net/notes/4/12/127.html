<A NAME="127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=557><b>tn</b> There is irony in the construction in the text. The expression &#8220;speak through us&#8221; also uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;</font> + <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font>(<font face="Scholar">dibber + bÿ</font>). They ask if God has not also spoken through them, after they have spoken against Moses. Shortly God will speak against them &#8211; their words are prophetic, but not as they imagined.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The questions are rhetorical. They are affirming that God does not only speak through Moses, but also speaks through them. They see themselves as equal with Moses. The question that was asked of the earlier presumptuous Moses &#8211; &#8220;Who made you a ruler over us?&#8221; &#8211; could also be asked of them. God had not placed them as equals with Moses. The passage is relevant for today when so many clamor for equal authority and leadership with those whom God has legitimately called. </p>
