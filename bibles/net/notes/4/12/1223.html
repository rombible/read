<A NAME="1223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=573><b>tc</b> The words &#8220;its mother&#8221; and &#8220;its flesh&#8221; are among the so-called <i>tiqqune sopherim</i>, or &#8220;emendations of the scribes.&#8221; According to this tradition the text originally had here &#8220;<i>our</i> mother&#8221; and &#8220;<i>our</i> flesh,&#8221; but the ancient scribes changed these pronouns from the first person to the third person. Apparently they were concerned that the image of Moses&#8217; mother giving birth to a baby with physical defects of the sort described here was somehow inappropriate, given the stature and importance of Moses.</p>
