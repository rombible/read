<A NAME="121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=551><b>sn</b> In this short chapter we find a prime example of jealousy among leaders and how God dealt with it. Miriam and Aaron are envious of Moses&#8217; leadership, but they use an occasion &#8211; his marriage &#8211; to criticize him. Often the immediate criticism is simply a surface issue for a deeper matter. God indicates very clearly he will speak through many people, including them, but Moses is different. Moses is the mediator of the covenant. The chapter is a lesson of what not to do. They should have fulfilled their duties before God and not tried to compete or challenge the leader in this way. There is a touch of divine irony here, for Miriam is turned white with leprosy. The chapter falls easily into the sections of the story: the accusation (vv. 1-3), the <sc>Lord&#8217;s response (vv. 4-10), the intercession of Moses (vv. 11-16). For further information, see J. S. Kselman, &#8220;A Note on Numbers 12:6-8,&#8221; <i>VT </i>26 (1976): 500-504.</p>
