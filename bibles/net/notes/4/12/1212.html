<A NAME="1212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=562><b>tn</b> The Hebrew syntax is difficult here. &#8220;The Lord&#8221; is separated from the verb by two intervening prepositional phrases. Some scholars conclude that this word belongs with the verb at the beginning of v. 6 (&#8220;And the Lord spoke&#8221;).</p>
