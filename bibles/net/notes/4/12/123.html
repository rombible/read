<A NAME="123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=553><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1467;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;</font> (<i>hakkushit</i>, &#8220;the Cushite&#8221;) as the modifier of &#8220;woman.&#8221; The Greek text interpreted this correctly as &#8220;Ethiopian.&#8221; The word Cush in the Bible can describe the Cassites, east of Babylon of the later period (Gen 10:18), or Ethiopia (Isa 20:3; Nah 3:5; et al). Another suggestion is that it would refer to Cushan of Hab 3:7, perhaps close to Midian, and so the area Moses had been. This would suggest it could be Zipporah &#8211; but the Bible does not identify the Cushite as Zipporah. The most natural understanding would be that it refers to an Egyptian/Ethiopian woman. The text does not say when Moses married this woman, or what Miriam&#8217;s problem with her was. It is clear that it was a racial issue, by virtue of the use of &#8220;Cushite.&#8221; Whether she was of darker skin than the Hebrews would be hard to say, since the Bible gives no further detail. Neither does it say if this is a second wife, or a woman Moses married since Zipporah went home (Exod 18:2). These do not seem to be the issues the text wishes to elaborate on; it is simply stating that this woman was the occasion for a deeper challenge. </p>
