<A NAME="122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=552><b>tn</b> The preposition <font face="Scholar">bet </font>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font>) has the adversative sense here, &#8220;[speak] against&#8221; (see also its use for hostile speech in 21:5, 7). Speaking against is equal to the murmuring throughout the wilderness period. The verb of the sentence is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vattÿdabber</font>), the <font face="Scholar">feminine</font> form of the verb. This indicates that Miriam was the main speaker for the two, the verb agreeing with the first of the compound subject.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> It may be that Miriam was envious of the Cushite woman Moses married. And, in view of the previous chapter&#8217;s content about others being given a portion of the Spirit to share in the leadership role, she may have seen this as her chance finally to become just as important in the nation as her younger brother. After all, she safeguarded his birth and early years (Exod 2). But there are two issues here &#8211; the reason she gives (&#8220;does the <sc>Lord only speak through Moses?&#8221;), and the reason the text gives (the Cushite woman). </p>
