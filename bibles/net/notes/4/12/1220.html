<A NAME="1220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=570><b>sn</b> The word &#8220;leprosy&#8221; and &#8220;leprous&#8221; covers a wide variety of skin diseases, and need not be limited to the actual disease of leprosy known today as Hansen&#8217;s disease. The description of it here has to do with snow, either the whiteness or the wetness. If that is the case then there would be open wounds and sores &#8211; like Job&#8217;s illness (see M. Noth, <i>Numbers </i>[OTL]<i>, </i>95-96).</p>
