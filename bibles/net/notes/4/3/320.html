<A NAME="320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=108><b>tn</b> The construction uses the infinitive construct (epexegetically) followed by its cognate accusative. It would convey &#8220;to serve the service of the tabernacle,&#8221; but more simply it may be rendered as &#8220;serving.&#8221; Their spiritual and practical service is to serve.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Levites had the duty of taking care of all the tabernacle and its furnishings, especially in times when it was to be moved. But they were also appointed to be gate-keepers (2 Kgs 22:4; 1 Chr 9:19) in order to safeguard the purity of the place and the activities that went on there. Their offices seem to have then become hereditary in time (1 Sam 1:3); they even took on more priestly functions, such as pronouncing the benediction (Deut 10:8).
