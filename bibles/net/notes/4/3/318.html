<A NAME="318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=106><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text uses the perfect tense of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew"> &#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;</font>(<font face="Scholar">shamar</font>) with a <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive to continue the instruction of the preceding verse. It may be translated &#8220;and they shall keep&#8221; or &#8220;they must/are to keep,&#8221; but in this context it refers to their appointed duties. The verb is followed by its cognate accusative &#8211; &#8220;they are to keep his keeping,&#8221; or as it is often translated, &#8220;his charge.&#8221; This would mean whatever Aaron needed them to do. But the noun is also used for the people in the next phrase, and so &#8220;charge&#8221; cannot be the meaning here. The verse is explaining that the Levites will have duties to perform to meet the needs of Aaron and the congregation.</p>
