<A NAME="316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=104><b>tn</b> The verb literally means &#8220;make it [the tribe] stand&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1502;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464; &#1488;&#1465;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;</font>, <font face="Scholar">vÿha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amadta </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">oto</font>). The verb is the Hiphil perfect with a <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive; it will take the same imperative nuance as the form before it, but follow in sequence (&#8220;and then&#8221;). This refers to the ceremonial presentation in which the tribe would take its place before Aaron, that is, stand before him and await their assignments. The Levites will function more like a sacred guard than anything else, for they had to protect and care for the sanctuary when it was erected and when it was transported (see J. Milgrom, <i>Studies in Levitical Terminology</i>, 8-10).</p>
