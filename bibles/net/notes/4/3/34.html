<A NAME="34"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=92><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mashakh</font>) means &#8220;to anoint&#8221;; here the form modifies the &#8220;priests.&#8221; The service of consecration was carried out with anointing oil (Exod 30:30). The verb is used for the anointing of kings as well as priests in the OT, and so out of that derived the technical title &#8220;Messiah&#8221; for the coming ideal king &#8211; the &#8220;Anointed One.&#8221;</p>
