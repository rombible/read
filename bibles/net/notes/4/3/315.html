<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=103><b>sn</b> The use of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qarav</font>) forms an interesting wordplay in the passage. The act of making an offering is described by this verb, as was the reference to the priests&#8217; offering of strange fire. Now the ceremonial presentation of the priests is expressed by the same word &#8211; they are being offered to God.</p>
