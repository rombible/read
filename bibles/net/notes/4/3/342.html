<A NAME="342"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=130><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿsharÿtu</font>, &#8220;they will serve/minister&#8221;). The imperfect tense in this place, however, probably describes what the priests would do, what they used to do. The verb is in a relative clause: &#8220;which they would serve with them,&#8221; which should be changed to read &#8220;with which they would serve.&#8221;</p>
