<A NAME="35"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=93><b>tn</b> In this verse the expression is in a relative clause: &#8220;who he filled their hand&#8221; means &#8220;whose hands he filled,&#8221; or &#8220;whom he consecrated.&#8221; The idiomatic expression used here is from Lev 8; it literally is &#8220;he filled their hand&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488; &#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mille</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> yadam</font>). In the ordination service Moses placed some of the meat from the sacrifice in the hand of the ordinand, and this signified what he was going to be about &#8211; having his hand full, or being consecrated to the priesthood. There is some evidence that this practice or expression was also known in Mesopotamia. In modern ordination services a NT or a Bible may be placed in the ordinand&#8217;s hand &#8211; it is what the ministry will be about. </p>
