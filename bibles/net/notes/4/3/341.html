<A NAME="341"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=129><b>tn</b> The construction here is a little different. The Hebrew text uses the participle in construct plural: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shomÿrey</font>, literally &#8220;keepers of&#8221;). The form specifies the duties of the 8,600 Kohathites. The genitive that follows this participle is the cognate <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mishmeret</font>) that has been used before. So the expression indicates that they were responsible for the care of this part of the cult center. There is no reason to delete one of the forms (as does J. A. Paterson, <i>Numbers</i>, 42), for the repetition stresses the central importance of their work.</p>
