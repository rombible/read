<A NAME="37"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=95><b>tn</b> The verb form is the preterite with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive, literally &#8220;and Nadab died.&#8221; Some commentators wish to make the verb a past perfect, rendering it &#8220;and Nadab had died,&#8221; but this is not necessary. In tracing through the line from Aaron it simply reports that the first two sons died. The reference is to the event recorded in Lev 10 where the sons brought &#8220;strange&#8221; or foreign&#8221; fire to the sanctuary. </p>
