<A NAME="1919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=881><b>tn</b> The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1461;&#1497; &#1504;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿme niddah</font>) is &#8220;for waters of impurity.&#8221; The genitive must designate the purpose of the waters &#8211; they are for cases of impurity, and so serve for cleansing or purifying, thus &#8220;water of purification.&#8221; The word &#8220;impurity&#8221; can also mean &#8220;abhorrent&#8221; because it refers to so many kinds of impurities. It is also called a purification offering; Milgrom notes that this is fitting because the sacrificial ritual involved transfers impurity from the purified to the purifier (pp. 62-72). </p>
