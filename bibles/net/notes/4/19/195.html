<A NAME="195"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=867><b>sn</b> Some modern commentators prefer &#8220;cow&#8221; to &#8220;heifer,&#8221; thinking that the latter came from the influence of the Greek. Young animals were usually prescribed for the ritual, especially here, and so &#8220;heifer&#8221; is the better translation. A bull could not be given for this purification ritual because that is what was given for the high priests or the community according to Lev 4. </p>
