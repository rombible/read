<A NAME="191"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=863><b>sn</b> In the last chapter the needs of the priests and Levites were addressed. Now the concern is for the people. This provision from the sacrifice of the red heifer is a precaution to ensure that the purity of the tabernacle was not violated by pollutions of impurity or death. This chapter has two main parts, both dealing with ceremonial purity: the ritual of the red heifer (vv. 1-10), and the purification from uncleanness (vv. 11-22). For further study see J. Milgrom, &#8220;The Paradox of the Red Cow (Num 19),&#8221; <i>VT</i> 31 (1981): 62-72.</p>
