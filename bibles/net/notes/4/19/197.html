<A NAME="197"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=869><b>tc</b> The clause is a little ambiguous. It reads &#8220;and he shall slaughter it before him.&#8221; It sounds as if someone else will kill the heifer in the priest&#8217;s presence. Since no one is named as the subject, it may be translated as a passive. Some commentators simply interpret that Eleazar was to kill the animal personally, but that is a little forced for &#8220;before him.&#8221; The Greek text gives a third person plural sense to the verb; the Vulgate follows that reading. </p>
