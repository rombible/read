<A NAME="1931"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=893><b>tn</b> The verb is the perfect tense, third masculine plural, with a <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive. The verb may be worded as a passive, &#8220;ashes must be taken,&#8221; but that may be too awkward for this sentence. It may be best to render it with a generic &#8220;you&#8221; to fit the instruction of the text.</p>
