<A NAME="1925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=887><b>tn</b> The verb is the Hitpael of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1496;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khata</font>&#8217;), a verb that normally means &#8220;to sin.&#8221; But the Piel idea in many places is &#8220;to cleanse; to purify.&#8221; This may be explained as a privative use (&#8220;to un-sin&#8221; someone, meaning cleanse) or denominative (&#8220;make a sin offering for someone&#8221;). It is surely connected to the purification offering, and so a sense of purify is what is wanted here.</p>
