<A NAME="1323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=599><b>tn</b> The word is related etymologically to the verb for &#8220;slip, slide, bend, totter.&#8221; This would fit the use very well. A pole that would not bend would be hard to use to carry things, but a pole or stave that was flexible would serve well.</p>
