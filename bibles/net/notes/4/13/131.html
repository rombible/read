<A NAME="131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=577><b>sn</b> Chapter 13 provides the names of the spies sent into the land (vv. 1-16), their instructions (vv. 17-20), their activities (vv. 21-25), and their reports (vv. 26-33). It is a chapter that serves as a good lesson on faith, for some of the spies walked by faith, and some by sight.</p>
