<A NAME="1711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=822><b>sn</b> There is no clear answer why the tribe of Levi had used an almond staff. The almond tree is one of the first to bud in the spring, and its white blossoms are a beautiful sign that winter is over. Its name became a name for &#8220;watcher&#8221;; Jeremiah plays on this name for God&#8217;s watching over his people (1:11-12). </p>
