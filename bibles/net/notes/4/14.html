<A NAME="141"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=625><b>sn</b> This chapter forms part of the story already begun. There are three major sections here: dissatisfaction with the reports (vv. 1-10), the threat of divine punishment (vv. 11-38), and the defeat of the Israelites (vv. 39-45). See K. D. Sakenfeld, &#8220;The Problem of Divine Forgiveness in Num 14,&#8221; <i>CBQ </i>37 (1975): 317-30; also J. R. Bartlett, &#8220;The Use of the Word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1465;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;</font> as a Title in the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 19 (1969): 1-10. </p>
<A NAME="142"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=626><b>tn</b> The two verbs &#8220;lifted up their voice and cried&#8221; form a hendiadys; the idiom of raising the voice means that they cried aloud.</p>
<A NAME="143"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=627><b>tn</b> There are a number of things that the verb &#8220;to weep&#8221; or &#8220;wail&#8221; can connote. It could reflect joy, grief, lamentation, or repentance, but here it reflects fear, hopelessness, or vexation at the thought of coming all this way and being defeated by the Canaanite armies. See Judg 20:23, 26.</p>
<A NAME="144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=628><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb &#8220;to murmur&#8221; is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lun</font>). It is a strong word, signifying far more than complaining or grumbling, as some of the modern translations have it. The word is most often connected to the wilderness experience. It is paralleled in the literature with the word &#8220;to rebel.&#8221; The murmuring is like a parliamentary vote of no confidence, for they no longer trusted their leaders and wished to choose a new leader and return. This &#8220;return to Egypt&#8221; becomes a symbol of their lack of faith in the <sc>Lord. </p>
<A NAME="145"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=629><b>tn</b> The optative is expressed by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;</font><font face="Scholar"> </font>(<font face="Scholar">lu</font>) and then the verb, here the perfect tense <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1514;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">matnu</font>) &#8211; &#8220;O that we had died&#8230;.&#8221; Had they wanted to die in Egypt they should not have cried out to the <sc>Lord to deliver them from bondage. Here the people became consumed with the fear and worry of what lay ahead, and in their panic they revealed a lack of trust in God.</p>
<A NAME="146"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=630><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;died.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="147"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=631><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a man to his brother.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="148"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=632><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1503;</font><font face="Scholar"> </font>(<font face="Scholar">natan</font>, &#8220;to give&#8221;), but this verb has quite a wide range of meanings in the Bible. Here it must mean &#8220;to make,&#8221; &#8220;to choose,&#8221; &#8220;to designate&#8221; or the like. </p>
<A NAME="149"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=633><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;head&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1465;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ro</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">sh</font>) probably refers to a tribal chief who was capable to judge and to lead to war (see J. R. Bartlett, &#8220;The Use of the Word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1465;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;</font> as a Title in the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 19 [1969]: 1-10).</p>
<A NAME="1410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=634><b>tn</b> The form is a cohortative with a <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) prefixed. After the preceding cohortative this could also be interpreted as a purpose or result clause &#8211; in order that we may return.</p>
<A NAME="1411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=635><b>sn</b> This action of Moses and Aaron is typical of them in the wilderness with the Israelites. The act shows self-abasement and deference before the sovereign <sc>Lord. They are not bowing before the people here, but in front of the people they bow before God. According to Num 17:6-15 this prostration is for the purpose of intercessory prayer. Here it prevents immediate wrath from God.</p>
<A NAME="1412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=636><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;before all the assembly of the congregation.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=637><b>tn</b> The repetition of the adverb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1488;&#1465;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">od</font>) is used to express this: &#8220;very, very [good].&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=638><b>tn</b> The subjective genitives &#8220;milk and honey&#8221; are symbols of the wealth of the land, second only to bread. Milk was a sign of such abundance (Gen 49:12; Isa 7:21,22). Because of the climate the milk would thicken quickly and become curds, eaten with bread or turned into butter. The honey mentioned here is the wild honey (see Deut 32:13; Judg 14:8-9). It signified sweetness, or the finer things of life (Ezek 3:3).</p>
<A NAME="1415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=639><b>sn</b> The expression must indicate that they could destroy the enemies as easily as they could eat bread. </p>
<A NAME="1416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=640><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;their shade.&#8221; The figure compares the shade from the sun with the protection from the enemy. It is also possible that the text is alluding to their deities here.</p>
<A NAME="1417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=641><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;said to stone them with stones.&#8221; The verb and the object are not from the same root, but the combination nonetheless forms an emphasis equal to the cognate accusative.</p>
<A NAME="1418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=642><b>tn</b> The <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) on the noun &#8220;glory&#8221; indicates a strong contrast, one that interrupts their threatened attack.</p>
<A NAME="1419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=643><b>sn</b> <i>The glory of the <sc>Lord</></i> refers to the reality of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s presence in a manifestation of his power and splendor. It showed to all that God was a living God. The appearance of the glory indicated blessing for the obedient, but disaster for the disobedient.</p>
<A NAME="1420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=644><b>tc</b> The Greek, Syriac, and <i>Tg. Ps.-J. </i>have &#8220;in the cloud over the tent.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=645><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1488;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">na</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ats</font>) means &#8220;to condemn, spurn&#8221; (BDB 610 s.v.). Coats suggests that in some contexts the word means actual rejection or renunciation (<i>Rebellion in the Wilderness</i>, 146, 7). This would include the idea of distaste.</p>
<A NAME="1422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=646><b>tn</b> The verb &#8220;to believe&#8221; (root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1503;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">aman</font>) has the basic idea of support, dependability for the root. The Hiphil has a declarative sense, namely, to consider something reliable or dependable and to act on it. The people did not trust what the <sc>Lord said. </p>
<A NAME="1423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=647><b>tc</b> The Greek version has &#8220;death.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=648><b>tn</b> The construction is unusual in that we have here a perfect tense with a <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive with no verb before it to establish the time sequence. The context requires that this be taken as a <i>vav </i>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive. It actually forms the protasis for the next verse, and would best be rendered &#8220;when<i>&#8230;</i>then they will say.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=649><b>tn</b> The singular participle is to be taken here as a collective, representing all the inhabitants of the land.</p>
<A NAME="1426"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=650><b>tn</b> &#8220;Face to face&#8221; is literally &#8220;eye to eye.&#8221; It only occurs elsewhere in Isa 52:8. This expresses the closest communication possible.</p>
<A NAME="1427"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=651><b>tn</b> The verb is the Hiphil<i> </i>perfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mut</font>), <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1461;&#1502;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿhemattah</font>). The <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive makes this also a future time sequence verb, but again in a conditional clause.</p>
<A NAME="1428"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=652><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;as one man.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1429"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=653><b>tc</b> The form in the text is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adonay</font>), the word that is usually used in place of the tetragrammaton. It is the plural form with the pronominal suffix, and so must refer to God.</p>
<A NAME="1430"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=654><b>tn</b> The expression is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1470;&#1495;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rav khesed</font>) means &#8220;much of loyal love,&#8221; or &#8220;faithful love.&#8221; Some have it &#8220;totally faithful,&#8221; but that omits the aspect of his love. </p>
<A NAME="1431"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=655><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;rebellion.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1432"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=656><b>tn</b> The infinitive absolute emphasizes the verbal activity of the imperfect tense, which here serves as a habitual imperfect. Negated it states what God does not do; and the infinitive makes that certain.</p>
<A NAME="1433"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=657><b>sn</b> The Decalogue adds &#8220;to those who hate me.&#8221; The point of the line is that the effects of sin, if not the sinful traits themselves, are passed on to the next generation. </p>
<A NAME="1434"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=658><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;&#1470;&#1504;&#1464;&#1488;</font><font face="Scholar"> </font>(<font face="Scholar">selakh-na</font>&#8217;), the imperative form, means &#8220;forgive&#8221; (see Ps 130:4), &#8220;pardon,&#8221; &#8220;excuse.&#8221; The imperative is of course a prayer, a desire, and not a command. </p>
<A NAME="1435"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=659><b>tn</b> The construct unit is &#8220;the greatness of your loyal love.&#8221; This is the genitive of specification, the first word being the modifier. </p>
<A NAME="1436"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=660><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;forgiven according to your word.&#8221; The direct object, &#8220;them,&#8221; is implied.</p>
<A NAME="1437"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=661><b>sn</b> This is the oath formula, but in the Pentateuch it occurs here and in v. 28.</p>
<A NAME="1438"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=662><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1505;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nasah</font>) means &#8220;to test, to tempt, to prove.&#8221; It can be used to indicate things are tried or proven, or for testing in a good sense, or tempting in the bad sense, i.e., putting God to the test. In all uses there is uncertainty or doubt about the outcome. Some uses of the verb are positive: If God tests Abraham in Genesis 22:1, it is because there is uncertainty whether he fears the <sc>Lord or not; if people like Gideon put out the fleece and test the <sc>Lord, it is done by faith but in order to be certain of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s presence. But here, when these people put God to the test ten times, it was because they doubted the goodness and ability of God, and this was a major weakness. They had proof to the contrary, but chose to challenge God.</p>
<A NAME="1439"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=663><b>tn</b> &#8220;Ten&#8221; is here a round figure, emphasizing the complete testing. But see F. V. Winnett, <i>The Mosaic Tradition</i>, 121-54.</p>
<A NAME="1440"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=664><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;listened to my voice.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1441"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=665><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>) indicates a negative oath formula: &#8220;if&#8221; means &#8220;they will not.&#8221; It is elliptical. In a human oath one would be saying: &#8220;The <sc>Lord do to me <i>if they see</i>&#8230;,&#8221; meaning &#8220;they will by no means see.&#8221; Here God is swearing that they will not see the land.</p>
<A NAME="1442"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=666><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;seed.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1443"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=667><b>sn</b> The judgment on Israel is that they turn back to the desert and not attack the tribes in the land. So a parenthetical clause is inserted to state who was living there. They would surely block the entrance to the land from the south &#8211; unless God removed them. And he is not going to do that for Israel. </p>
<A NAME="1444"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=668><b>tn</b> The figure is aposiopesis, or sudden silence. The main verb is deleted from the line, &#8220;how long&#8230;this evil community.&#8221; The intensity of the emotion is the reason for the ellipsis.</p>
<A NAME="1445"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=669><b>sn</b> It is worth mentioning in passing that this is one of the Rabbinic proof texts for having at least ten men to form a congregation and have prayer. If God called ten men (the bad spies) a &#8220;congregation,&#8221; then a congregation must have ten men. But here the word &#8220;community/congregation&#8221; refers in this context to the people of Israel as a whole, not just to the ten spies.</p>
<A NAME="1446"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=670><b>sn</b> Here again is the oath that God swore in his wrath, an oath he swore by himself, that they would not enter the land. &#8220;As the <sc>Lord lives,&#8221; or &#8220;by the life of the <sc>Lord,&#8221; are ways to render it. </p>
<A NAME="1447"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=671><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1488;&#1467;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">um</font>) is an &#8220;oracle.&#8221; It is followed by the subjective genitive: &#8220;the oracle of the <sc>Lord&#8221; is equal to saying &#8220;the <sc>Lord says.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1448"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=672><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in my ears.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> They had expressed the longing to have died in the wilderness, and not in war. God will now give them that. They would not say to God &#8220;your will be done,&#8221; so he says to them, &#8220;your will be done&#8221; (to borrow from C. S. Lewis).</p>
<A NAME="1449"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=673><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;your corpses&#8221; (also in vv. 32, 33).</p>
<A NAME="1450"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=674><b>tn</b> The relative pronoun &#8220;which&#8221; is joined with the resumptive pronoun &#8220;in it&#8221; to form a smoother reading &#8220;where.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1451"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=675><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text uses the anthropomorphic expression &#8220;I raised my hand&#8221; in taking an oath.</p>
<A NAME="1452"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=676><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to cause you to dwell; to cause you to settle.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1453"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=677><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;plunder.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1454"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=678><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;know.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1455"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=679><b>tn</b> The word is &#8220;shepherds.&#8221; It means that the people would be wilderness nomads, grazing their flock on available land.</p>
<A NAME="1456"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=680><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you shall bear your whoredoms.&#8221; The imagery of prostitution is used throughout the Bible to reflect spiritual unfaithfulness, leaving the covenant relationship and following after false gods. Here it is used generally for their rebellion in the wilderness, but not for following other gods.</p>
<A NAME="1457"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=681><b>tn</b> The infinitive is from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tamam</font>), which means &#8220;to be complete.&#8221; The word is often used to express completeness in a good sense &#8211; whole, blameless, or the like. Here and in v. 35 it seems to mean &#8220;until your deaths have been completed.&#8221; See also Gen 47:15; Deut 2:15.</p>
<A NAME="1458"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=682><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you shall bear.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1459"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=683><b>tn</b> The phrase refers to the consequences of open hostility to God, or perhaps abandonment of God. The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tÿnu</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>) occurs in Job 33:10 (perhaps). The related verb occurs in Num 30:6 HT (30:5 ET) and 32:7 with the sense of &#8220;disallow, discourage.&#8221; The sense of the expression adopted in this translation comes from the meticulous study of R. Loewe, &#8220;Divine Frustration Exegetically Frustrated,&#8221; <i>Words and Meanings</i>, 137-58. </p>
<A NAME="1460"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=684><b>tn</b> The verb is the Hiphil infinitive construct with a <font face="Scholar">lamed</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font>) preposition from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatsa</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to bring out&#8221;). The use of the infinitive here is epexegetical, that is, explaining how they caused the people to murmur. </p>
<A NAME="1461"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=685><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text uses the preposition &#8220;from,&#8221; &#8220;some of&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;from those men.&#8221; The relative pronoun is added to make a smoother reading.</p>
<A NAME="1462"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=686><b>tn</b> The preterite here is subordinated to the next preterite to form a temporal clause. </p>
<A NAME="1463"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=687><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aval</font>) is rare, used mostly for mourning over deaths, but it is used here of mourning over bad news (see also Exod 33:4; 1 Sam 15:35; 16:1; etc.).</p>
<A NAME="1464"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=688><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyashkimu</font>) is often found in a verbal hendiadys construction: &#8220;They rose early&#8230;and they went up&#8221; means &#8220;they went up early.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1465"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=689><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text says literally &#8220;the top of the hill,&#8221; but judging from the location and the terrain it probably means the heights of the hill country.</p>
<A NAME="1466"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=690><b>tn</b> The verb is simply &#8220;said,&#8221; but it means the place that the <sc>Lord said to go up to in order to fight.</p>
