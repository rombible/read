<A NAME="532"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=221><b>tn</b> This is probably water taken from the large bronze basin in the courtyard. It is water set apart for sacred service. &#8220;Clean water&#8221; (so NEB) does not capture the sense very well, but it does have the support of the Greek that has &#8220;pure running water.&#8221; That pure water would no doubt be from the bronze basin anyway.</p>
