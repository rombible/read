<A NAME="528"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=217><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word is &#8220;jealousy,&#8221; which also would be an acceptable translation here. But since the connotation is that suspicion has been raised about the other person, &#8220;suspicion&#8221; seems to be a better rendering in this context.</p>
