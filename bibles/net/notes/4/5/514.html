<A NAME="514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=203><b>tn</b> This is now the third use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asham</font>); the first referred to &#8220;guilt,&#8221; the second to &#8220;reparation,&#8221; and now &#8220;wronged.&#8221; The idea of &#8220;guilt&#8221; lies behind the second two uses as well as the first. In the second &#8220;he must repay his guilt&#8221; (meaning what he is guilty of); and here it can also mean &#8220;the one against whom he is guilty of sinning.&#8221; </p>
