<A NAME="516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=205><b>tc</b> The editors of <i>BHS</i> prefer to follow the Greek, Syriac, and Latin and not read &#8220;for the <sc>Lord&#8221; here, but read a form of the verb &#8220;to be&#8221; instead. But the text makes more sense as it stands: The payment is to be made to the <sc>Lord for the benefit of the priests.</p>
