<A NAME="529"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=218><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;remembering&#8221; is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zikkaron</font>); the meaning of the word here is not so much &#8220;memorial,&#8221; which would not communicate much, but the idea of bearing witness before God concerning the charges. The truth would come to light through this ritual, and so the attestation would stand. This memorial would bring the truth to light. It was a somber occasion, and so no sweet smelling additives were placed on the altar.</p>
