<A NAME="59"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=198><b>tn</b> The verse simply says &#8220;any sin of a man,&#8221; but the genitive could mean that it is any sin that a man would commit (subjective genitive), or one committed against a man (objective genitive). Because of the similarity with Lev 5:22, the subjective is better. The sin is essentially &#8220;missing the mark&#8221; which is the standard of the Law of the <sc>Lord. The sin is not in this case accidental or inadvertent. It means here simply failing to live up to the standard of the <sc>Lord. Since both men and women are mentioned in the preceding clause, the translation uses &#8220;people&#8221; here.</p>
