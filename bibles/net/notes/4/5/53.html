<A NAME="53"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=192><b>sn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsarua</font>&#8217;), although translated &#8220;leper,&#8221; does not primarily refer to leprosy proper (i.e., Hansen&#8217;s disease). The RSV and the NASB continued the KJV tradition of using &#8220;leper&#8221; and &#8220;leprosy.&#8221; More recent studies have concluded that the Hebrew word is a generic term covering all infectious skin diseases (including leprosy when that actually showed up). True leprosy was known and feared certainly by the time of Amos (ca. 760 <sc>b.c.). There is evidence that the disease was known in Egypt by 1500 <sc>b.c. So this term would include that disease in all probability. But in view of the diagnosis and healing described in Leviticus 13 and 14, the term must be broader. The whole basis for the laws of separation may be found in the book of Leviticus. The holiness of the <sc>Lord who dwelt among his people meant that a high standard was imposed on them for their living arrangements as well as access to the sanctuary. Anything that was corrupted, diseased, dying, or contaminated was simply not compatible with the holiness of God and was therefore excluded. This is not to say that it was treated as sin, or the afflicted as sinners. It simply was revealing &#8211; and safeguarding &#8211; the holiness of the <sc>Lord. It thus provided a revelation for all time that in the world to come nothing unclean will enter into the heavenly sanctuary. As the Apostle Paul says, we will all be changed from this corruptible body into one that is incorruptible (1 Cor 15:53). So while the laws of purity and holiness were practical for the immediate audience, they have far-reaching implications for theology. The purity <i>regulations</i> have been done away with in Christ &#8211; the problem is dealt with differently in the new covenant. There is no earthly temple, and so the separation laws are not in force. Wisdom would instruct someone with an infectious disease to isolate, however. But just because the procedure is fulfilled in Christ does not mean that believers today are fit for glory just as they are. On the contrary, they must be changed before going into his presence. In like manner the sacrifices have been done away in Christ &#8211; not what they covered. Sin is still sin, even though it is dealt with differently on this side of the cross. But the ritual and the regulations of the old covenant at Sinai have been fulfilled in Christ.</p>
