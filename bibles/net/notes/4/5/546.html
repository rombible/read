<A NAME="546"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=235><b>sn</b> Most commentators take the expressions to be euphemisms of miscarriage or stillbirth, meaning that there would be no fruit from an illegitimate union. The idea of the abdomen swelling has been reinterpreted by NEB to mean &#8220;fall away.&#8221; If this interpretation stands, then the idea is that the woman has become pregnant, and that has aroused the suspicion of the husband for some reason. R. K. Harrison (<i>Numbers</i> [WEC], 111-13) discusses a variety of other explanations for diseases and conditions that might be described by these terms. He translates it with &#8220;miscarriage,&#8221; but leaves open what the description might actually be. Cf. NRSV &#8220;makes your uterus drop, your womb discharge.&#8221;</p>
