<A NAME="512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=201><b>tn</b> The verb is the Hitpael perfect tense with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yadah</font>), which in this stem means &#8220;acknowledge, confess sin,&#8221; but in the Hiphil (primarily) it means &#8220;praise, give thanks.&#8221; In both cases one is acknowledging something, either the sin, or the person and work of the <sc>Lord. Here the verb comes in the apodosis: &#8220;when&#8230;then he must confess.&#8221;</p>
