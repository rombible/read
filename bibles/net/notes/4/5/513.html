<A NAME="513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=202><b>tn</b> The verb is the Hiphil perfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font><font face="Scholar"> </font>(<font face="Scholar">shuv</font>, &#8220;return&#8221;). Here it has the sense of &#8220;repay&#8221; with the word &#8220;reparation&#8221; (traditionally rendered &#8220;guilt offering,&#8221; but now is understood to refer to what was defrauded). The Levitical rulings called for the guilty to restore what was taken, if it could be made right, and pay a fifth more as a surcharge. </p>
