<A NAME="21"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=67><b>sn</b> For this chapter, see C. E. Douglas, &#8220;The Twelve Houses of Israel,&#8221; <i>JTS</i> 37 (1936): 49-56; C. C. Roach, &#8220;The Camp in the Wilderness: A Sermon on Numbers 2:2,&#8221; <i>Int</i> 13 (1959): 49-54; and G. St. Clair, &#8220;Israel in Camp: A Study,&#8221; <i>JTS</i> 8 (1907): 185-217.</p>
<A NAME="22"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=68><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a man by his own standard.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="23"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=69><b>tn</b> The imperfect tense is to be taken in the nuance of instruction.</p>
<A NAME="24"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=70><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;of/for the house of their fathers.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="25"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=71><b>tn</b> The Hebrew expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1462;&#1490;&#1462;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">minneged</font>) means &#8220;from before&#8221; or &#8220;opposite; facing&#8221; and &#8220;at some distance&#8221; or &#8220;away from the front of&#8221; (see BDB 617 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1490;&#1462;&#1491;</font> 2.c.<i>a</i>; <i>DCH</i> 5:603-4 s.v. 3.b).</p>
<A NAME="26"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=72><b>sn</b> The Israelites were camping as a military camp, each tribe with the standards and emblems of the family. The standard was the symbol fastened to the end of a pole and carried to battle. It served to rally the tribe to the battle. The Bible nowhere describes these, although the serpent emblem of Numbers 21:8-9 may give a clue. But they probably did not have shapes of animals in view of the prohibition in the Decalogue. The standards may have been smaller for the families than the ones for the tribes. See further K. A. Kitchen, &#8220;Some Egyptian Background to the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>TynBul</i> 5 (1960): 11; and T. W. Mann, <i>Divine Presence and Guidance in Israelite Tradition</i>, 169-73.</p>
<A NAME="27"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=73><b>tn</b> The sentence begins with a <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) on a word that is not a finite verb, indicating a new section begins here. The verbal form is a participle with the article used substantivally, with the meaning &#8220;and/now those camping.&#8221; Many English versions employ a finite verb; cf. KJV &#8220;on the east side&#8230;shall they of the standard of the camp of Judah pitch.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="28"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=74><b>tc</b> The two synonyms might seem to be tautological, but this is fairly common and therefore acceptable in Hebrew prose (cf. Exod 26:18; 38:13; etc.).</p>
<A NAME="29"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=75><b>tn</b> The sentence actually has &#8220;[those camping&#8230;are] the standard of the camp of Judah according to their divisions.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=76><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;will be.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=77><b>tc</b> The expression &#8220;and his divisions and those numbered of them&#8221; is somewhat tautological. The words are synonyms used for statistical purposes, and so neither should be simply deleted. </p>
<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=78><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;by him&#8221; [i.e., Judah].</p>
<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=79><b>tn</b> This part has been supplied; the text simply has &#8220;the tribe of Zebulun.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=80><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1505;&#1464;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nasa</font>&#8217;): &#8220;to journey, travel, set out,&#8221; and here, &#8220;to move camp.&#8221; Judah will go first, or, literally, at the head of the nation, when they begin to travel.</p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=81><b>tn</b> Here and throughout the line is literally &#8220;[under] the standard of the camp of Reuben&#8230;according to their divisions.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=82><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text simply has &#8220;and the tribe of Gad.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=83><b>tc</b> The Leningrad codex, upon which <i>BHS</i> is based, has &#8220;Reuel&#8221; here. In reading &#8220;Deuel&#8221; the translation presented above follows many medieval Hebrew manuscripts, Smr, and the Latin Vulgate. Cf. Num 1:14.</p>
<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=84><b>tn</b> The Hebrew expression is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al-yado</font>, &#8220;upon his hand&#8221;). This clearly refers to a specifically designated place for each man. </p>
<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=85><b>tn</b> Here too the Hebrew text simply has &#8220;and the tribe of Benjamin.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=86><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has &#8220;and the tribe of Naphtali.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=87><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the house of their fathers.&#8221; So also in v. 34.</p>
<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=88><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ken</font>, &#8220;thus, so&#8221;).</p>
