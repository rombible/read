<A NAME="161"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=750><b>sn</b> There are three main movements in the story of ch. 16. The first is the rebellion itself (vv. 1-19). The second is the judgment (vv. 20-35). Third is the atonement for the rebels (vv. 36-50). The whole chapter is a marvelous account of a massive rebellion against the leaders that concludes with reconciliation. For further study see G. Hort, &#8220;The Death of Qorah,&#8221; <i>ABR</i> 7 (1959): 2-26; and J. Liver, &#8220;Korah, Dathan and Abiram,&#8221; <i>Studies</i> <i>in the Bible</i> (ScrHier 8), 189-217.</p>
