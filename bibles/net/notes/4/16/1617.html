<A NAME="1617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=766><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">histarer</font>) is the Hitpael infinitive absolute that emphasizes the preceding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tistarer</font>), the Hitpael<i> </i>imperfect tense (both forms having metathesis). The verb means &#8220;to rule; to act like a prince; to make oneself a prince.&#8221; This is the only occurrence of the reflexive for this verb. The exact nuance is difficult to translate into English. But they are accusing Moses of seizing princely power for himself, perhaps making a sarcastic reference to his former status in Egypt. The rebels here are telling Moses that they had discerned his scheme, and so he could not &#8220;hoodwink&#8221; them (cf. NEB).</p>
