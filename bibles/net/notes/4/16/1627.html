<A NAME="1627"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=776><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;the God of the spirits of all humanity [flesh]&#8221; is somewhat difficult. The Hebrew text says <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1497; &#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1465;&#1514; &#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohey harukhot lÿkhol-basar</font>). This expression occurs in Num 27:16 again. It also occurs in some postbiblical texts, a fact which has prompted some scholars to conclude that it is a late addition. The words clearly show that Moses is interceding for the congregation. The appeal in the verse is that it is better for one man to die for the whole nation than the whole nation for one man (see also John 11:50).</p>
