<A NAME="1657"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=806><b>sn</b> The whole congregation here is trying to project its guilt on Moses and Aaron. It was they and their rebellion that brought about the deaths, not Moses and Aaron. The <sc>Lord had punished the sinners. The fact that the leaders had organized a rebellion against the <sc>Lord was forgotten by these people. The point here is that the Israelites had learned nothing of spiritual value from the event. </p>
