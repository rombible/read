<A NAME="1642"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=791><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;Sheol&#8221; in the Bible can be used four different ways: the grave, the realm of the departed [wicked] spirits or Hell, death in general, or a place of extreme danger (one that will lead to the grave if God does not intervene). The usage here is certainly the first, and very likely the second as well. A translation of &#8220;pit&#8221; would not be inappropriate. Since they will go down there alive, it is likely that they will sense the deprivation and the separation from the land above. See H. W. Robinson, <i>Inspiration and Revelation in the Old Testament</i>; N. J. Tromp, <i>Primitive Conceptions of Death and the Netherworld in the Old Testament </i>(BibOr 21), 21-23; and A. Heidel, <i>The Gilgamesh Epic, </i>especially ch. 3.</p>
