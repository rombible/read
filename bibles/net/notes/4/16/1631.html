<A NAME="1631"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=780><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rasha</font>&#8217;) has the sense of a guilty criminal. The word &#8220;wicked&#8221; sometimes gives the wrong connotation. These men were opposing the <sc>Lord, and so were condemned as criminals &#8211; they were guilty. The idea of &#8220;wickedness&#8221; therefore applies in that sense. </p>
