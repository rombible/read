<A NAME="167"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=756><b>tn</b> The meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1470;&#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rab-lakhem</font>) is something like &#8220;you have assumed far too much authority.&#8221; It simply means &#8220;much to you,&#8221; perhaps &#8220;you have gone to far,&#8221; or &#8220;you are overreaching yourselves&#8221; (M. Noth, <i>Numbers </i>[OTL], 123). He is objecting to the exclusiveness of the system that Moses has been introducing.</p>
