<A NAME="1611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=760><b>tn</b> The verb is the Piel<i> </i>perfect. There is no imperfect tense before this, which makes the construction a little difficult. If the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) is classified as a consecutive, then the form would stand alone as an equivalent to the imperfect, and rendered as a modal nuance such as &#8220;would you [now] seek,&#8221; or as a progressive imperfect, &#8220;are you seeking.&#8221; This latter nuance can be obtained by treating it as a regular perfect tense, with an instantaneous nuance: &#8220;do you [now] seek.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Moses discerned correctly the real motivation for the rebellion. Korah wanted to be the high priest because he saw how much power there was in the spiritual leadership in Israel. He wanted something like a general election with himself as the candidate and his supporters promoting him. The great privilege of being a Levite and serving in the sanctuary was not enough for him &#8211; the status did not satisfy him. Korah gave no rebuttal. The test would be one of ministering with incense. This would bring them into direct proximity with the <sc>Lord. If God honored Korah as a ministering priest, then it would be settled. But Moses accuses them of rebellion against the <sc>Lord, because the <sc>Lord had chosen Aaron to be the priest.</p>
