<A NAME="163"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=752><b>tn</b> In the Hebrew text there is no object for the verb &#8220;took.&#8221; The translation presented above supplies the word &#8220;men.&#8221; However, it is possible that the MT has suffered damage here. The LXX has &#8220;and he spoke.&#8221; The Syriac and Targum have &#8220;and he was divided.&#8221; The editor of <i>BHS</i> suggests that perhaps the MT should be emended to &#8220;and he arose.&#8221;</p>
