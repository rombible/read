<A NAME="1619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=768><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;will you bore out the eyes of these men?&#8221; The question is &#8220;Will you continue to mislead them?&#8221; (or &#8220;hoodwink&#8221; them). In Deut 16:19 it is used for taking a bribe; something like that kind of deception is intended here. They are simply stating that Moses is a deceiver who is misleading the people with false promises.</p>
