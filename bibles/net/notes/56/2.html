<A NAME="210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=26><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;sensible.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=27><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;put to shame.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=28><b>tn</b> See the note on the word &#8220;slave&#8221; in 1:1.</p>
<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=29><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;to be subject to their own masters, to do what is wanted in everything.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=30><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;showing that genuine faith is productive.&#8221; At issue between these two translations is the force of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#8053;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">agaqhn</font>): Is it attributive (as the text has it) or predicate (as in this note)? A number of considerations point in the direction of a predicate <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#8053;&#957;</font> (e.g., separation from the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pistin</font>) by the verb, the possibility that the construction is an object-complement, etc.), though is not usually seen as an option in either translations or commentaries. Cf. <i>ExSyn</i> 188-89, 312-13, for a discussion. Contextually, it makes an intriguing statement, for it suggests a synthetic or synonymous parallel: &#8220;&#8216;Slaves should be wholly subject to their masters&#8230;demonstrating that all [genuine] faith is productive, with the result [ecbatic <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font>] that they will completely adorn the doctrine of God.&#8217; The point of the text, then, if this understanding is correct, is an exhortation to slaves to demonstrate that their faith is sincere and results in holy behavior. If taken this way, the text seems to support the idea that saving faith does not fail, but even results in good works&#8221; (<i>ExSyn</i> 312-13). The translation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#8053;&#957;</font> as an attributive adjective, however, also makes good sense.</p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=31><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;adorn,&#8221; &#8220;show the beauty of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=32><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;all men&#8221;; but <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#8061;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anqrwpois</font>) is generic here, referring to both men and women.</p>
<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=33><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;training us&#8221; (as a continuation of the previous clause). Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started at the beginning of v. 12 by translating the participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#949;&#973;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">paideuousa</font>) as a finite verb and supplying the pronoun &#8220;it&#8221; as subject.</p>
<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=34><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;ungodliness.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=35><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the blessed hope and glorious appearing.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=36><b>tn</b> The terms &#8220;God and Savior&#8221; both refer to the same person, Jesus Christ. This is one of the clearest statements in the NT concerning the deity of Christ. The construction in Greek is known as the Granville Sharp rule, named after the English philanthropist-linguist who first clearly articulated the rule in 1798. Sharp pointed out that in the construction article-noun-<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font>-noun (where <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943; </font>[<font face="Greektl">kai</font>] = &#8220;and&#8221;), when two nouns are singular, personal, and common (i.e., not proper names), they <i>always</i> had the same referent. Illustrations such as &#8220;the friend and brother,&#8221; &#8220;the God and Father,&#8221; etc. abound in the NT to prove Sharp&#8217;s point. The only issue is whether terms such as &#8220;God&#8221; and &#8220;Savior&#8221; could be considered common nouns as opposed to proper names. Sharp and others who followed (such as T. F. Middleton in his masterful <i>The Doctrine of the Greek Article</i>) demonstrated that a proper name in Greek was one that could not be pluralized. Since both &#8220;God&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">qeos</font>) and &#8220;savior&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#969;&#964;&#8053;&#961;</font>, <font face="Greektl">swthr</font>) were occasionally found in the plural, they did not constitute proper names, and hence, do fit Sharp&#8217;s rule. Although there have been 200 years of attempts to dislodge Sharp&#8217;s rule, all attempts have been futile. Sharp&#8217;s rule stands vindicated after all the dust has settled. For more information on Sharp&#8217;s rule see <i>ExSyn</i> 270-78, esp. 276. See also 2 Pet 1:1 and Jude 4.</p>
<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=37><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;who&#8221; (as a continuation of the previous clause).</p>
<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=38><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;a people who are his very own.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=39><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;for good works.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=40><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;reproof,&#8221; &#8220;censure.&#8221; The Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#955;&#941;&#947;&#967;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">elencw</font>) implies exposing someone&#8217;s sin in order to bring correction.</p>
<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=41><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;speak these things and exhort and rebuke with all authority.&#8221;</p>
