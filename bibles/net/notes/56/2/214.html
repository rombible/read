<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=30><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;showing that genuine faith is productive.&#8221; At issue between these two translations is the force of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#8053;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">agaqhn</font>): Is it attributive (as the text has it) or predicate (as in this note)? A number of considerations point in the direction of a predicate <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#8053;&#957;</font> (e.g., separation from the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pistin</font>) by the verb, the possibility that the construction is an object-complement, etc.), though is not usually seen as an option in either translations or commentaries. Cf. <i>ExSyn</i> 188-89, 312-13, for a discussion. Contextually, it makes an intriguing statement, for it suggests a synthetic or synonymous parallel: &#8220;&#8216;Slaves should be wholly subject to their masters&#8230;demonstrating that all [genuine] faith is productive, with the result [ecbatic <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font>] that they will completely adorn the doctrine of God.&#8217; The point of the text, then, if this understanding is correct, is an exhortation to slaves to demonstrate that their faith is sincere and results in holy behavior. If taken this way, the text seems to support the idea that saving faith does not fail, but even results in good works&#8221; (<i>ExSyn</i> 312-13). The translation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#8053;&#957;</font> as an attributive adjective, however, also makes good sense.</p>
