<A NAME="220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=36><b>tn</b> The terms &#8220;God and Savior&#8221; both refer to the same person, Jesus Christ. This is one of the clearest statements in the NT concerning the deity of Christ. The construction in Greek is known as the Granville Sharp rule, named after the English philanthropist-linguist who first clearly articulated the rule in 1798. Sharp pointed out that in the construction article-noun-<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font>-noun (where <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943; </font>[<font face="Greektl">kai</font>] = &#8220;and&#8221;), when two nouns are singular, personal, and common (i.e., not proper names), they <i>always</i> had the same referent. Illustrations such as &#8220;the friend and brother,&#8221; &#8220;the God and Father,&#8221; etc. abound in the NT to prove Sharp&#8217;s point. The only issue is whether terms such as &#8220;God&#8221; and &#8220;Savior&#8221; could be considered common nouns as opposed to proper names. Sharp and others who followed (such as T. F. Middleton in his masterful <i>The Doctrine of the Greek Article</i>) demonstrated that a proper name in Greek was one that could not be pluralized. Since both &#8220;God&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">qeos</font>) and &#8220;savior&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#969;&#964;&#8053;&#961;</font>, <font face="Greektl">swthr</font>) were occasionally found in the plural, they did not constitute proper names, and hence, do fit Sharp&#8217;s rule. Although there have been 200 years of attempts to dislodge Sharp&#8217;s rule, all attempts have been futile. Sharp&#8217;s rule stands vindicated after all the dust has settled. For more information on Sharp&#8217;s rule see <i>ExSyn</i> 270-78, esp. 276. See also 2 Pet 1:1 and Jude 4.</p>
