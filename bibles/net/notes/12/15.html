For a discussion of various proposals, see M. Cogan and H. Tadmor, <i>II Kings</i> (AB), 166-67.</p>
<A NAME="155"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=694><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;As for the rest of the events of Azariah, and all which he did, are they not written on the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah?&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=700><b>tc</b> The MT reads, &#8220;and he struck him down before the people and killed him&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV, NASB, NIV, NRSV, NLT). However, the reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1500; &#1506;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qaval </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">am</font>), &#8220;before the people,&#8221; is problematic to some because <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1500;</font> is a relatively late Aramaic term. Nevertheless, the Aramaic term <i>qobel</i> certainly antedates the writing of Kings. The bigger problem seems to be the unnecessary intrusion of an Aramaic word at all here. Most interpreters prefer to follow Lucian&#8217;s Greek version and read &#8220;in Ibleam&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1456;&#1497;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1500;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bÿivle</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">am</font>).

<A NAME="1525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=714><b>tc</b> The MT of v. 18 ends with the words, &#8220;all his days.&#8221; If this phrase is taken with what precedes, then one should translate, &#8220;[who encouraged Israel to sin] throughout his reign.&#8221; However, it may be preferable to emend the text to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1456;&#1497;&#1465;&#1502;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿyomav</font>), &#8220;in his days,&#8221; and join the phrase to what follows. The translation assumes this change.</p>
<A NAME="1526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=715><b>sn</b> <i>Pul</i> was a nickname of Tiglath-pileser III (cf. 15:29). See M. Cogan and H. Tadmor, <i>II Kings</i> (AB), 171-72.</p>

When used of metals it can refer to a disk-shaped weight made of the metal or to a standard unit of weight, generally regarded as a talent. Since the accepted weight for a talent of metal is about 75 pounds, this would have amounted to about 75,000 pounds of silver (cf. NCV &#8220;about seventy-four thousand pounds&#8221;); NLT &#8220;thirty-seven tons&#8221;; CEV &#8220;over thirty tons&#8221;; TEV &#8220;34,000 kilogrammes.&#8221;</p>
