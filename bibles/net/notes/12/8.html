<A NAME="817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=342><b>sn</b> The words &#8220;your son&#8221; emphasize the king&#8217;s respect for the prophet.</p>

See M. Cogan and H. Tadmor, <i>II Kings</i> (AB), 90. Another possibility is that a scribe has decided to harmonize Elisha&#8217;s message with Hazael&#8217;s words in v. 14. But it is possible that Hazael, once he found out he would become the next king, decided to lie to the king to facilitate his assassination plot by making the king feel secure. </p>
<A NAME="820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=345><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Elisha) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>

<A NAME="822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=347><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Indeed, what is your servant, a dog, that he could do this great thing?&#8221; With his reference to a dog, Hazael is not denying that he is a &#8220;dog&#8221; and protesting that he would never commit such a dastardly &#8220;dog-like&#8221; deed. Rather, as Elisha&#8217;s response indicates, Hazael is suggesting that he, like a dog, is too insignificant to ever be in a position to lead such conquests. </p>
<A NAME="823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=348><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The <sc>Lord has shown me you [as] king over Syria.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=353><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text reads, &#8220;and in the fifth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel, and [or, &#8216;while&#8217;?] Jehoshaphat [was?] king of Judah, Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah became king.&#8221; The first reference to &#8220;Jehoshaphat king of Judah&#8221; is probably due to a scribe accidentally copying the phrase from the later in the verse. If the Hebrew text is retained, the verse probably refers to the beginning of a coregency between Jehoshaphat and Jehoram. </p>
<A NAME="829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=354><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=355><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab did, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=356><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the eyes of.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="833"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=358><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;just as he had promised to give him and his sons a lamp all the days.&#8221; The metaphorical &#8220;lamp&#8221; symbolizes the Davidic dynasty; this is reflected in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="834"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=359><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in his days Edom rebelled from under the hand of Judah and enthroned a king over them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="835"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=360><b>sn</b> <i>Joram</i> is a short form of the name Jehoram. </p>
<A NAME="836"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=361><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he arose at night and defeated Edom, who had surrounded him, and the chariot officers.&#8221; The Hebrew text as it stands gives the impression that Joram was surrounded and launched a victorious night counterattack. It would then be quite natural to understand the last statement in the verse to refer to an Edomite retreat. Yet v. 22 goes on to state that the Edomite revolt was successful. Therefore, if the MT is retained, it may be better to understand the final statement in v. 21 as a reference to an Israelite retreat (made in spite of the success described in the preceding sentence). The translation above assumes an emendation of the Hebrew text. Adding a third masculine singular pronominal suffix to the accusative sign before Edom (reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eto</font>], &#8220;him,&#8221; instead of just <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et</font>]) and taking Edom as the subject of verbs allows one to translate the verse in a way that is more consistent with the context, which depicts an Israelite defeat, not victory. There is, however, no evidence for this emendation.</p>
<A NAME="837"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=362><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the people fled to their tents.&#8221;</p>
