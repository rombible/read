<A NAME="1015"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=457><b>sn</b> Jehu&#8217;s command is intentionally vague. Does he mean that they should bring the guardians (those who are &#8220;heads&#8221; over Ahab&#8217;s sons) for a meeting, or does he mean that they should bring the literal heads of Ahab&#8217;s sons with them? (So LXX, Syriac Peshitta, and some <sc>mss of the Targum) The city leaders interpret his words in the literal sense, but Jehu&#8217;s command is so ambiguous he is able to deny complicity in the executions (see v. 9). </p>
