<A NAME="210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=50><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;You have made difficult [your] request.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=51><b>tn</b> Though the noun is singular here, it may be collective, in which case it could be translated &#8220;chariots.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=53><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they made a division between the two of them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=54><b>sn</b> Elisha may be referring to the fiery chariot(s) and horses as the Lord&#8217;s spiritual army that fights on behalf of Israel (see 2 Kgs 6:15-17; 7:6). However, the juxtaposition with &#8220;my father&#8221; (clearly a reference to Elijah as Elisha&#8217;s mentor), and the parallel in 2 Kgs 13:14 (where the king addresses Elisha with these words), suggest that Elisha is referring to Elijah. In this case Elijah is viewed as a one man army, as it were. When the Lord spoke through him, his prophetic word was as powerful as an army of chariots and horses. See M. A. Beek, &#8220;The Meaning of the Expression &#8216;The Chariots and Horsemen of Israel&#8217; (II Kings ii 12),&#8221;<i> The Witness of Tradition</i> (<i>OTS </i>17), 1-10. </p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=55><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Elijah&#8217;s cloak, which had fallen off him.&#8221; The wording is changed slightly in the translation for the sake of variety of expression (see v. 13).</p>

<A NAME="230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=70><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">na</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ar</font>), here translated &#8220;boy,&#8221; can refer to a broad age range, including infants as well as young men. But the qualifying term &#8220;young&#8221; (or &#8220;small&#8221;) suggests these youths were relatively young. The phrase in question (&#8220;young boy&#8221;) occurs elsewhere in 1 Sam 20:35; 1 Kgs 3:7 (used by Solomon in an hyperbolic manner); 11:17; 2 Kgs 5:14; and Isa 11:6.</p>
<A NAME="231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=71><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he cursed them in the name of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; A curse was a formal appeal to a higher authority (here the Lord) to vindicate one&#8217;s cause through judgment. As in chapter one, this account makes it clear that disrespect for the Lord&#8217;s designated spokesmen can be deadly, for it is ultimately rejection of the Lord&#8217;s authority.</p>
<A NAME="232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=72><b>sn</b> The two brief episodes recorded in vv. 19-25 demonstrate Elisha&#8217;s authority and prove that he is the legitimate prophetic heir of Elijah. He has the capacity to bring life and blessing to those who recognize his authority, or death and judgment to those who reject him.</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map2-B1; Map4-D3; Map5-E2; Map6-A4; Map7-C1.</p>
