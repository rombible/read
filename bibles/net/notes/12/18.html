<A NAME="185"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=847><b>tn</b> The term is singular in the MT but plural in the LXX and other ancient versions. It is also possible to regard the singular as a collective singular, especially in the context of other plural items.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Asherah</i> was a leading deity of the Canaanite pantheon, wife/sister of El and goddess of fertility. She was commonly worshiped at shrines in or near groves of evergreen trees, or, failing that, at places marked by wooden poles. These were to be burned or cut down (Deut 12:3; 16:21; Judg 6:25, 28, 30; 2 Kgs 18:4).</p>
<A NAME="186"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=848><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;until those days.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="187"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=849><b>tn</b> In Hebrew the name sounds like the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nÿkhash hannÿkhoshet</font>), &#8220;bronze serpent.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=856><b>sn</b> See the note at 2 Kgs 17:9.</p>
<A NAME="1815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=857><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;went&#8221; (also in v. 13).</p>
<A NAME="1816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=858><b>map</b> For location see Map2-B1; Map4-D3; Map5-E2; Map6-A4; Map7-C1.</p>
<A NAME="1817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=859><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has simply &#8220;Israel&#8221; as the object of the verb.</p>
<A NAME="1818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=860><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;listen to the voice of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=861><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his covenant.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=862><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all that Moses, the <sc>Lord&#8217;s servant, had commanded, and they did not listen and they did not act.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=863><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I have done wrong.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=864><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Return from upon me; what you place upon me, I will carry.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=865><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kikkar</font>, &#8220;circle&#8221;) refers generally to something that is round. When used of metals it can refer to a disk-shaped weight made of the metal or to a standard unit of weight, generally regarded as a talent. Since the accepted weight for a talent of metal is about 75 pounds, this would have amounted to about 22,500 pounds of silver and 2,250 pounds of gold.</p>
<A NAME="1824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=866><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;that was found.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=867><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;At that time Hezekiah stripped the doors of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s temple, and the posts which Hezekiah king of Judah had plated.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=868><b>sn</b> For a discussion of these titles see M. Cogan and H. Tadmor, <i>II Kings</i> (AB), 229-30.</p>
<A NAME="1827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=869><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="1828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=870><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they went up and came.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=871><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the field of the washer.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=872><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;What is this object of trust in which you are trusting?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=873><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you say only a word of lips, counsel and might for battle.&#8221; Sennacherib&#8217;s message appears to be in broken Hebrew at this point. The phrase &#8220;word of lips&#8221; refers to mere or empty talk in Prov 14:23. </p>
<A NAME="1832"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=874><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;exchange pledges.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1833"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=875><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;How can you turn back the face of an official [from among] the least of my master&#8217;s servants and trust in Egypt for chariots and horsemen?&#8221; In vv. 23-24 the chief adviser develops further the argument begun in v. 21. His reasoning seems to be as follows: &#8220;In your weakened condition you obviously need military strength. Agree to the king&#8217;s terms and I will personally give you more horses than you are capable of outfitting. If I, a mere minor official, am capable of giving you such military might, just think what power the king has. There is no way the Egyptians can match our strength. It makes much better sense to deal with us.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1834"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=876><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Go.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1835"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=877><b>sn</b> In v. 25 the chief adviser develops further the argument begun in v. 22. He claims that Hezekiah has offended the Lord and that the Lord has commissioned Assyria as his instrument of discipline and judgment.</p>
<A NAME="1836"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=878><b>sn</b> Aramaic was the diplomatic language of the empire.</p>
<A NAME="1837"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=879><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Hebrew.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1838"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=880><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;To your master and to you did my master send me to speak these words?&#8221; The rhetorical question expects a negative answer.</p>
<A NAME="1839"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=881><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[Is it] not [also] to the men&#8230;?&#8221; The rhetorical question expects the answer, &#8220;Yes, it is.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The chief adviser alludes to the horrible reality of siege warfare, when the starving people in the besieged city would resort to eating and drinking anything to stay alive.</p>
<A NAME="1840"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=882><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text also has, &#8220;and he spoke and said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1841"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=883><b>tc</b> The MT has &#8220;his hand,&#8221; but this is due to graphic confusion of <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) and <i>yod</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font>). The translation reads &#8220;my hand,&#8221; along with many medieval Hebrew <sc>mss, the LXX, Syriac Peshitta, Targum, and Vulgate.</p>
<A NAME="1842"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=884><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;make with me a blessing and come out to me.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1843"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=885><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Have the gods of the nations really rescued, each his land, from the hand of the king of Assyria?&#8221; The infinitive absolute lends emphasis to the main verb. The rhetorical question expects the answer, &#8220;Of course not!&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1844"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=886><b>tn</b> The parallel passage in Isa 36:19 omits &#8220;Hena and Ivvah.&#8221; The rhetorical questions in v. 34a suggest the answer, &#8220;Nowhere, they seem to have disappeared in the face of Assyria&#8217;s might.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1845"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=887><b>map</b> For location see Map2-B1; Map4-D3; Map5-E2; Map6-A4; Map7-C1.</p>
<A NAME="1846"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=888><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;that they rescued Samaria from my hand?&#8221; But this gives the impression that the gods of Sepharvaim were responsible for protecting Samaria, which is obviously not the case. The implied subject of the plural verb &#8220;rescued&#8221; must be the generic &#8220;gods of the nations/lands&#8221; (vv. 33, 35). </p>
<A NAME="1847"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=889><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;that the <sc>Lord might rescue Jerusalem from my hand?&#8221; The logic runs as follows: Since no god has ever been able to withstand the Assyrian onslaught, how can the people of Jerusalem possibly think the <sc>Lord will rescue them?</p>
