<A NAME="96"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=377><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the young man, the young man, the prophet.&#8221; The MT is probably dittographic, the phrase &#8220;the young man&#8221; being accidentally repeated. The phrases &#8220;the young man&#8221; and &#8220;the prophet&#8221; are appositional, with the latter qualifying more specifically the former. </p>
<A NAME="97"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=378><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he arrived and look, the officers of the army were sitting.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=387><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;house.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="917"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=388><b>sn</b> Note how the young prophet greatly expands the message Elisha had given to him. In addition to lengthening the introductory formula (by adding &#8220;the God of Israel&#8221;) and the official declaration that accompanies the act of anointing (by adding &#8220;the <sc>Lord&#8217;s people&#8221;), he goes on to tell how Jehu will become king (by a revolt against Ahab&#8217;s dynasty), makes it clear that Jehu will be an instrument of divine vengeance, and predicts the utter annihilation of Ahab&#8217;s family and the violent death of Jezebel.</p>
<A NAME="918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=389><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;went out to.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=390><b>tc</b> The MT has the singular, &#8220;he said,&#8221; but many witnesses correctly read the plural.</p>
<A NAME="920"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=391><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Is there peace?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="921"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=392><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;He said, &#8216;You, you know the man and his thoughts.&#8217;&#8221; Jehu tries to deflect their question by reminding them that the man is an eccentric individual who says strange things. His reply suggests that the man said nothing of importance. The translation seeks to bring out the tone and intent of Jehu&#8217;s reply. </p>
<A NAME="922"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=393><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;So he said, &#8216;Like this and like this he said to me, saying.&#8217;&#8221; The words &#8220;like this and like this&#8221; are probably not a direct quote of Jehu&#8217;s words to his colleagues. Rather this is the narrator&#8217;s way of avoiding repetition and indicating that Jehu repeated, or at least summarized, what the prophet had said to him.</p>
<A NAME="923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=394><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his&#8221;; the referent (Jehu) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="924"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=395><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they hurried and took, each one his garment, and they placed [them] beneath him on the bone [?] of the steps.&#8221; The precise nuance of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gerem</font>), &#8220;bone,&#8221; is unclear. Some suggest the nuance &#8220;bare&#8221; here; it may be a technical architectural term in this context. </p>
<A NAME="925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=396><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they blew the trumpet.&#8221; This has been translated as a passive to avoid the implication that the same ones who shouted had all blown trumpets.</p>
<A NAME="926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=397><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;has become.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=398><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he and all Israel.&#8221;</p>

For other examples of this use of the word, see BDB 660-61 s.v.</p>
<A NAME="932"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=403><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;rode [or, &#8216;mounted&#8217;] and went.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="933"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=404><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lying down.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="936"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=407><b>tn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shifat</font>) appears to be a construct form of the noun, but no genitive follows. </p>
<A NAME="937"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=408><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="938"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=409><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Get a rider and send [him] to meet him and let him ask, &#8216;Is there peace?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="941"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=412><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;What concerning you and concerning peace?&#8221; That is, &#8220;What concern is that to you?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="942"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=413><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he came to them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="943"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=414><b>tc</b> The MT has simply &#8220;peace,&#8221; omitting the prefixed interrogative particle. It is likely that the particle has been accidentally omitted; several ancient witnesses include it or assume its presence.</p>
<A NAME="944"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=415><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the driving is like the driving of Jehu son of Nimshi.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="945"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=416><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;my chariot&#8221; are added for clarification.</p>
<A NAME="946"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=417><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he hitched up his chariot.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="949"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=420><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;How [can there be] peace as long as the adulterous acts of Jezebel your mother and her many acts of sorcery [continue]?&#8221; In this instance &#8220;adulterous acts&#8221; is employed metaphorically for idolatry. As elsewhere in the OT, worshiping other gods is viewed as spiritual adultery and unfaithfulness to the one true God. The phrase &#8220;many acts of sorcery&#8221; could be taken literally, for Jezebel undoubtedly utilized pagan divination practices, but the phrase may be metaphorical, pointing to her devotion to pagan customs in general. </p>
<A NAME="950"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=421><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Jehoram turned his hands and fled.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;turned his hands&#8221; refers to how he would have pulled on the reins in order to make his horses turn around. </p>

<A NAME="954"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=425><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;said to.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="955"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=426><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and I will repay you in this plot of land.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="956"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=427><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;according to the word of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="958"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=429><b>tn</b> After Jehu&#8217;s order (&#8220;kill him too&#8221;), the MT has simply, &#8220;to the chariot in the ascent of Gur which is near Ibleam.&#8221; The main verb in the clause, &#8220;they shot him&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</font>, <font face="Scholar">vayyikhhu</font>), has been accidentally omitted by virtual haplography/homoioteleuton. Note that the immediately preceding form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1467;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hakkuhu</font>), &#8220;shoot him,&#8221; ends with the same suffix. </p>
<A NAME="959"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=430><b>map</b> For location see Map1-D4; Map2-C1; Map4-C2; Map5-F2; Map7-B1.</p>
<A NAME="960"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=431><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;drove him.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="962"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=433><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;she fixed her eyes with antimony.&#8221; Antimony (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">pukh</font>) was used as a cosmetic. The narrator portrays her as a prostitute (see Jer 4:30), a role she has played in the spiritual realm (see the note at v. 22). </p>
<A NAME="963"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=434><b>sn</b> Jezebel associates Jehu with another assassin, Zimri, who approximately 44 years before had murdered King Elah, only to meet a violent death just a few days later (1 Kgs 16:9-20). On the surface Jezebel&#8217;s actions seem contradictory. On the one hand, she beautifies herself as if to seduce Jehu, but on the other hand, she insults and indirectly threatens him with this comparison to Zimri. Upon further reflection, however, her actions reveal a clear underlying motive. She wants to retain her power, not to mention her life. By beautifying herself, she appeals to Jehu&#8217;s sexual impulses; by threatening him, she reminds him that he is in the same precarious position as Zimri. But, if he makes Jezebel his queen, he can consolidate his power. In other words through her actions and words Jezebel is saying to Jehu, &#8220;You desire me, don&#8217;t you? And you need me!&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="964"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=435><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;two, three.&#8221; The narrator may be intentionally vague or uncertain here, or the two numbers may represent alternate traditions.</p>
<A NAME="965"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=436><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;when she hit the ground&#8221; are added for stylistic reasons.</p>

<A NAME="969"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=440><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they did not find her, except for.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="970"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=441><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;It is the word of the <sc>Lord, which he spoke by the hand of his servant, Elijah the Tishbite, saying.&#8221;</p>
