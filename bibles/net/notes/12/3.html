<A NAME="34"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=76><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text has the singular, &#8220;it.&#8221; Some ancient witnesses read the plural, which seems preferable since the antecedent (&#8220;sins&#8221;) is plural. Another option is to emend the plural &#8220;sins&#8221; to a singular. One ancient Greek witness has the singular &#8220;sin.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=94><b>tn</b> The term used refers to one who plays a stringed instrument, perhaps a harp.</p>
<A NAME="323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=95><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the hand of the <sc>Lord came on him.&#8221; This may refer to what typically happened, &#8220;[for] when a musician played, the hand of the <sc>Lord would come upon him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=96><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;making this valley cisterns, cisterns.&#8221; The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1461;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gev</font>) means &#8220;cistern&#8221; in Jer 14:3 (cf. Jer 39:10). The repetition of the noun is for emphasis. See GKC 396 §123.<i>e</i>. The verb (&#8220;making&#8221;) is an infinitive absolute, which has to be interpreted in light of the context. The translation above takes it in an imperatival sense. The command need not be understood as literal, but as hyperbolic. Telling them to build cisterns is a dramatic way of leading into the announcement that he would miraculously provide water in the desert. Some prefer to translate the infinitive as an imperfect with the Lord as the understood subject, &#8220;I will turn this valley [into] many pools.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=97><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;see.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=100><b>tn</b> Elisha places the object first and uses an imperfect verb form. The stylistic shift may signal that he is now instructing them what to do, rather than merely predicting what would happen.</p>
<A NAME="329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=101><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;good.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=102><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and ruin every good portion with stones.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=103><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and in the morning, when the offering is offered up, look, water was coming from the way of Edom, and the land was filled with water.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=104><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;had come up to fight them.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=106><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they&#8221;; the referent (the Moabites) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=107><b>tn</b> The translation assumes the verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kharav</font>, &#8220;to be desolate&#8221;). The infinitive absolute precedes the finite verb form for emphasis. (For another example of the Hophal infinitive with a Niphal finite verb, see Lev 19:20. Cf. also <i>IBHS</i> 582 §35.2.1c.) Some prefer to derive the verb from a proposed homonym meaning &#8220;at <i>HALOT</i> 349 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;</font> and BDB 352 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font>). </p>
<A NAME="336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=108><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=109><b>tc</b> The consonantal text (<i>Kethib</i>) suggests, &#8220;and they went, striking down,&#8221; but the marginal reading (<i>Qere</i>) is &#8220;they struck down, striking down.&#8221; For a discussion of the textual problem, see M. Cogan and H. Tadmor, <i>II Kings</i> (AB), 46.</p>
<A NAME="338"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=110><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and [on] every good portion they were throwing each man his stone and they filled it.&#8221; The <font face="Scholar">vav</font> + perfect (&#8220;and they filled&#8221;) here indicates customary action contemporary with the situation described in the preceding main clause (where a customary imperfect is used, &#8220;they were throwing&#8221;). See the note at 3:4. </p>
<A NAME="339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=111><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;until he had allowed its stones to remain in Kir Hareseth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="340"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=112><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the king of Moab saw that the battle was too strong for him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="341"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=113><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he took with him seven hundred men, who drew the sword, to break through against.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="342"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=114><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;there was great anger against Israel.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The meaning of this statement is uncertain, for the subject of the anger is not indicated. Except for two relatively late texts, the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1462;&#1510;&#1462;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qetsef</font>) refers to an outburst of divine anger. But it seems unlikely the Lord would be angry with Israel, for he placed his stamp of approval on the campaign (vv. 16-19). D. N. Freedman suggests the narrator, who obviously has a bias against the Omride dynasty, included this observation to show that the Lord would not allow the Israelite king to &#8220;have an undiluted victory&#8221; (as quoted in M. Cogan and H. Tadmor, <i>II Kings</i> [AB], 52, n. 8). Some suggest that the original source identified Chemosh the Moabite god as the subject and that his name was later suppressed by a conscientious scribe, but this proposal raises more questions than it answers. For a discussion of various views, see M. Cogan and H. Tadmor, <i>II Kings</i> (AB), 47-48, 51-52. </p>
<A NAME="343"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=115><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they departed from him.&#8221;</p>
