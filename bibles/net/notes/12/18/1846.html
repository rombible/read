<A NAME="1846"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=888><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;that they rescued Samaria from my hand?&#8221; But this gives the impression that the gods of Sepharvaim were responsible for protecting Samaria, which is obviously not the case. The implied subject of the plural verb &#8220;rescued&#8221; must be the generic &#8220;gods of the nations/lands&#8221; (vv. 33, 35). </p>
