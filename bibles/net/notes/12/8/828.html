<A NAME="828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=353><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text reads, &#8220;and in the fifth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel, and [or, &#8216;while&#8217;?] Jehoshaphat [was?] king of Judah, Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah became king.&#8221; The first reference to &#8220;Jehoshaphat king of Judah&#8221; is probably due to a scribe accidentally copying the phrase from the later in the verse. If the Hebrew text is retained, the verse probably refers to the beginning of a coregency between Jehoshaphat and Jehoram. </p>
