<A NAME="819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=344><b>tc</b> The consonantal text (<i>Kethib</i>) reads, &#8220;Go, say, &#8216;Surely you will not (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;) recover&#8221; In this case the <i>vav</i> beginning the next clause should be translated, &#8220;for, because.&#8221; The marginal reading (<i>Qere</i>) has, &#8220;Go, say to him (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font>, <font face="Scholar">lo</font>), &#8216;You will surely recover.&#8221; In this case the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) beginning the next clause should be translated, &#8220;although, but.&#8221; The <i>Qere</i> has the support of some medieval Hebrew <sc>mss and the ancient versions, and is consistent with v. 14, where Hazael tells the king, &#8220;You will surely recover.&#8221; It is possible that a scribe has changed <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font>, &#8220;to him,&#8221; to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;</font>, &#8220;not,&#8221; because he felt that Elisha would not lie to the king. See M. Cogan and H. Tadmor, <i>II Kings</i> (AB), 90. Another possibility is that a scribe has decided to harmonize Elisha&#8217;s message with Hazael&#8217;s words in v. 14. But it is possible that Hazael, once he found out he would become the next king, decided to lie to the king to facilitate his assassination plot by making the king feel secure. </p>
