<A NAME="34"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=76><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text has the singular, &#8220;it.&#8221; Some ancient witnesses read the plural, which seems preferable since the antecedent (&#8220;sins&#8221;) is plural. Another option is to emend the plural &#8220;sins&#8221; to a singular. One ancient Greek witness has the singular &#8220;sin.&#8221;</p>
