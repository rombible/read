<A NAME="342"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=114><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;there was great anger against Israel.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The meaning of this statement is uncertain, for the subject of the anger is not indicated. Except for two relatively late texts, the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1462;&#1510;&#1462;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qetsef</font>) refers to an outburst of divine anger. But it seems unlikely the Lord would be angry with Israel, for he placed his stamp of approval on the campaign (vv. 16-19). D. N. Freedman suggests the narrator, who obviously has a bias against the Omride dynasty, included this observation to show that the Lord would not allow the Israelite king to &#8220;have an undiluted victory&#8221; (as quoted in M. Cogan and H. Tadmor, <i>II Kings</i> [AB], 52, n. 8). Some suggest that the original source identified Chemosh the Moabite god as the subject and that his name was later suppressed by a conscientious scribe, but this proposal raises more questions than it answers. For a discussion of various views, see M. Cogan and H. Tadmor, <i>II Kings</i> (AB), 47-48, 51-52. </p>
