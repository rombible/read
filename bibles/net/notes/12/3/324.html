<A NAME="324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=96><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;making this valley cisterns, cisterns.&#8221; The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1461;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gev</font>) means &#8220;cistern&#8221; in Jer 14:3 (cf. Jer 39:10). The repetition of the noun is for emphasis. See GKC 396 §123.<i>e</i>. The verb (&#8220;making&#8221;) is an infinitive absolute, which has to be interpreted in light of the context. The translation above takes it in an imperatival sense. The command need not be understood as literal, but as hyperbolic. Telling them to build cisterns is a dramatic way of leading into the announcement that he would miraculously provide water in the desert. Some prefer to translate the infinitive as an imperfect with the Lord as the understood subject, &#8220;I will turn this valley [into] many pools.&#8221; </p>
