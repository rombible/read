<A NAME="113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=510><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;him and his nurse in an inner room of beds.&#8221; The verb is missing in the Hebrew text. The parallel passage in 2 Chr 22:11 has &#8220;and she put&#8221; at the beginning of the clause. M. Cogan and H. Tadmor (<i>II Kings</i> [AB], 126) regard the Chronicles passage as an editorial attempt to clarify the difficulty of the original text. They prefer to take &#8220;him and his nurse&#8221; as objects of the verb &#8220;stole&#8221; and understand &#8220;in the bedroom&#8221; as the place where the royal descendants were executed. The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1491;&#1463;&#1512; &#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bakhadar hammittot</font>), &#8220;an inner room of beds,&#8221; is sometimes understood as referring to a bedroom (<i>HALOT</i> 293 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1491;&#1462;&#1512;</font>), though some prefer to see here a &#8220;room where the covers and cloths were kept for the beds (<i>HALOT</i> 573 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1496;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;</font>). In either case, it may have been a temporary hideout, for v. 3 indicates that the child hid in the temple for six years.</p>
