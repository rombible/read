<A NAME="1131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=538><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Jehoiada made a covenant between the <sc>Lord and [between] the king and [between] the people, to become a people for the <sc>Lord, and between the king and [between] the people.&#8221; The final words of the verse (&#8220;and between the king and [between] the people&#8221;) are probably accidentally repeated from earlier in the verse. They do not appear in the parallel account in 2 Chr 23:16. If retained, they probably point to an agreement governing how the king and people should relate to one another.</p>
