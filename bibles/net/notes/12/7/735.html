Look, they are like all the people of Israel that remain in it.

Look they are like all the people of Israel&#8221; have been accidentally repeated. The original text read, &#8220;Let them take five of the remaining horses that remain in it. Look, they are like all the people of Israel that have come to an end.&#8221; </p>
