<A NAME="1210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=554><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Let the priests take for themselves, each from his treasurer, and let them repair the damage of the temple, with respect to all the damage that is found there.&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">makar</font>), translated here &#8220;treasurer,&#8221; occurs only in this passage. Some suggest it means &#8220;merchant&#8221; or &#8220;benefactor.&#8221; Its usage in Ugaritic texts, where it appears in a list of temple officials, suggests that it refers in this context to individuals who were in charge of disbursing temple funds. </p>
