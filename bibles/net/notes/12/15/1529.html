<A NAME="1529"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=718><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kikkar</font>, &#8220;circle&#8221;) refers generally to something that is round. When used of metals it can refer to a disk-shaped weight made of the metal or to a standard unit of weight, generally regarded as a talent. Since the accepted weight for a talent of metal is about 75 pounds, this would have amounted to about 75,000 pounds of silver (cf. NCV &#8220;about seventy-four thousand pounds&#8221;); NLT &#8220;thirty-seven tons&#8221;; CEV &#8220;over thirty tons&#8221;; TEV &#8220;34,000 kilogrammes.&#8221;</p>
