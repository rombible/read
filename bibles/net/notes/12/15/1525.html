<A NAME="1525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=714><b>tc</b> The MT of v. 18 ends with the words, &#8220;all his days.&#8221; If this phrase is taken with what precedes, then one should translate, &#8220;[who encouraged Israel to sin] throughout his reign.&#8221; However, it may be preferable to emend the text to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1456;&#1497;&#1465;&#1502;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿyomav</font>), &#8220;in his days,&#8221; and join the phrase to what follows. The translation assumes this change.</p>
