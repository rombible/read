<A NAME="1958"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=947><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the zeal of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; In this context the Lord&#8217;s &#8220;zeal&#8221; refers to his intense devotion to and love for his people which prompts him to protect and restore them. The <i>Qere</i>, along with many medieval Hebrew <sc>mss and the ancient versions, has &#8220;the zeal of the LORD of hosts&#8221; rather than &#8220;the zeal of the LORD&#8221; (<i>Kethib</i>). The translation follows the <i>Qere</i> here.</p>
