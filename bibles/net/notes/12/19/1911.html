<A NAME="1911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=900><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will put in him a spirit.&#8221; The precise sense of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ruakh</font>), &#8220;spirit,&#8221; is uncertain in this context. It may refer to a spiritual being who will take control of his mind (see 1 Kgs 22:19), or it could refer to a disposition of concern and fear. In either case the <sc>Lord&#8217;s sovereignty over the king is apparent.</p>
