<A NAME="56"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=191><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kikkar</font>, &#8220;circle&#8221;) refers generally to something that is round. When used of metals it can refer to a disk-shaped weight made of the metal or to a standard unit of weight, generally regarded as a talent. Since the accepted weight for a talent of metal is about 75 pounds, this would have amounted to about 750 pounds of silver (cf. NCV, NLT, CEV).</p>
