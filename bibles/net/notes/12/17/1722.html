<A NAME="1722"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=799><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;They went [or, &#8216;followed&#8217;] after.&#8221; This idiom probably does not mean much if translated literally. It is found most often in Deuteronomy or in literature related to the covenant. It refers in the first instance to loyalty to God and to His covenant or His commandments (1 Kgs 14:8; 2 Chr 34:31) with the metaphor of a path or way underlying it (Deut 11:28; 28:14). To &#8220;follow other gods&#8221; was to abandon this way and this loyalty (to &#8220;abandon&#8221; or &#8220;forget&#8221; God, Judg 2:12; Hos 2:13) and to follow the customs or religious traditions of the pagan nations (2 Kgs 17:15). The classic text on &#8220;following&#8221; God or another god is 1 Kgs 18:18, 21 where Elijah taunts the people with &#8220;halting between two opinions&#8221; whether the <sc>Lord was the true God or Baal was. The idiom is often found followed by &#8220;to serve and to worship&#8221; or &#8220;they served and worshiped&#8221; such and such a god or entity (Jer 8:2; 11:10; 13:10; 16:11; 25:6; 35:15).</p>
