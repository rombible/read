<A NAME="1723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=800><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they followed after the worthless thing/things and became worthless.&#8221; The words &#8220;to the <sc>Lord&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text but are implicit from the context. There is an obvious wordplay on the verb &#8220;became worthless&#8221; and the noun &#8220;worthless thing&#8221;, which is probably to be understood collectively and to refer to idols as it does in Jer 8:19; 10:8; 14:22; Jonah 2:8.</p>
