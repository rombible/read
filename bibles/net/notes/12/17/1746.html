<A NAME="1746"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=823><b>tc</b> The second plural subject may refer to the leaders of the Assyrian army. However, some prefer to read &#8220;whom I deported,&#8221; changing the verb to a first person singular form with a third masculine plural pronominal suffix. This reading has some support from Hebrew, Greek, and Aramaic witnesses.</p>
