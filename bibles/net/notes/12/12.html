<A NAME="121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=545><b>sn</b> Beginning with <b>11:21</b>, the verse numbers through <b>12:21</b> in the English Bible differ from the verse numbers in the Hebrew text (<i>BHS</i>), with <b>11:21</b> ET = <b>12:1</b> HT, <b>12:1</b> ET = <b>12:2</b> HT, <b>12:2</b> ET = <b>12:3</b> HT, etc., through <b>12:21</b> ET = <b>12:22</b> HT. With <b>13:1</b> the verse numbers in the ET and HT are again the same.</p>
<A NAME="122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=546><b>tn</b> Jehoash is an alternate name for Joash (see 11:2).</p>
<A NAME="123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=547><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=548><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Jehoash did what was proper in the eyes of the <sc>Lord all his days.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=549><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;that which.&#8221; Jehoiada taught the king the Lord&#8217;s will.</p>
<A NAME="126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=550><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;I place at your disposal&#8221; are added in the translation for clarification.</p>
<A NAME="127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=551><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the silver of passing over a man.&#8221; The precise meaning of the phrase is debated, but <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avar</font>), &#8220;pass over,&#8221; probably refers here to counting, suggesting the reference is to a census conducted for taxation purposes. See M. Cogan and H. Tadmor, <i>II Kings</i> (AB), 137. </p>
<A NAME="128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=552><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the silver of persons, his valuation.&#8221; The precise meaning of the phrase is uncertain, but parallels in Lev 27 suggest that personal vows are referred to here. See M. Cogan and H. Tadmor, <i>II Kings</i> (AB), 137.</p>
<A NAME="129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=553><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all the silver which goes up on the heart of a man to bring to the house of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=554><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Let the priests take for themselves, each from his treasurer, and let them repair the damage of the temple, with respect to all the damage that is found there.&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">makar</font>), translated here &#8220;treasurer,&#8221; occurs only in this passage. Some suggest it means &#8220;merchant&#8221; or &#8220;benefactor.&#8221; Its usage in Ugaritic texts, where it appears in a list of temple officials, suggests that it refers in this context to individuals who were in charge of disbursing temple funds. </p>
<A NAME="1211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=555><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Now, do not take silver from your treasurers, because for the damages to the temple you must give it.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=556><b>tn</b> Outside of this passage the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ut</font>) appears only in Gen 34:15-22.</p>
<A NAME="1213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=557><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and not to repair the damages to the temple.&#8221; This does not mean that the priests were no longer interested in repairing the temple. As the following context makes clear, the priests decided to hire skilled workers to repair the damage to the temple, rather than trying to make the repairs themselves.</p>
<A NAME="1214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=558><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;on the right side of the altar as a man enters.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=559><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the king&#8217;s scribe.&#8221;</p>

NIV, NCV, NRSV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="1217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=561><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;would give.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=564><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;was given.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=565><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;gave.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=566><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they did not conduct a reckoning of the men who gave the silver into their hand to give to the doers of the work, for in honesty they were working.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=567><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;went up and fought against.&#8221;</p>
