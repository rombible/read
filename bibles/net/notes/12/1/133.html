<a name="133"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=33><b>sn</b> In this third panel the verb &#8220;come down&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yarad</font>) occurs again, this time describing Elijah&#8217;s descent from the hill at the Lord&#8217;s command. The moral of the story seems clear: Those who act as if they have authority over God and his servants just may pay for their arrogance with their lives; those who, like the third commander, humble themselves and show the proper respect for God&#8217;s authority and for his servants will be spared and find God quite cooperative.</p>
