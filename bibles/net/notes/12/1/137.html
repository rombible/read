<a name="137"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=37><b>sn</b> For the third time in this chapter we read the Lord&#8217;s sarcastic question to king and the accompanying announcement of judgment. The repetition emphasizes one of the chapter&#8217;s main themes. Israel&#8217;s leaders should seek guidance from their own God, not a pagan deity, for Israel&#8217;s sovereign God is the one who controls life and death.</p>
