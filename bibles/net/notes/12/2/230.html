<A NAME="230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=70><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">na</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ar</font>), here translated &#8220;boy,&#8221; can refer to a broad age range, including infants as well as young men. But the qualifying term &#8220;young&#8221; (or &#8220;small&#8221;) suggests these youths were relatively young. The phrase in question (&#8220;young boy&#8221;) occurs elsewhere in 1 Sam 20:35; 1 Kgs 3:7 (used by Solomon in an hyperbolic manner); 11:17; 2 Kgs 5:14; and Isa 11:6.</p>
