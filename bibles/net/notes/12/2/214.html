<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=54><b>sn</b> Elisha may be referring to the fiery chariot(s) and horses as the Lord&#8217;s spiritual army that fights on behalf of Israel (see 2 Kgs 6:15-17; 7:6). However, the juxtaposition with &#8220;my father&#8221; (clearly a reference to Elijah as Elisha&#8217;s mentor), and the parallel in 2 Kgs 13:14 (where the king addresses Elisha with these words), suggest that Elisha is referring to Elijah. In this case Elijah is viewed as a one man army, as it were. When the Lord spoke through him, his prophetic word was as powerful as an army of chariots and horses. See M. A. Beek, &#8220;The Meaning of the Expression &#8216;The Chariots and Horsemen of Israel&#8217; (II Kings ii 12),&#8221;<i> The Witness of Tradition</i> (<i>OTS </i>17), 1-10. </p>
