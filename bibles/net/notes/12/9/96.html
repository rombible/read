<A NAME="96"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=377><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the young man, the young man, the prophet.&#8221; The MT is probably dittographic, the phrase &#8220;the young man&#8221; being accidentally repeated. The phrases &#8220;the young man&#8221; and &#8220;the prophet&#8221; are appositional, with the latter qualifying more specifically the former. </p>
