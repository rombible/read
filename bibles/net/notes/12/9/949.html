<A NAME="949"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=420><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;How [can there be] peace as long as the adulterous acts of Jezebel your mother and her many acts of sorcery [continue]?&#8221; In this instance &#8220;adulterous acts&#8221; is employed metaphorically for idolatry. As elsewhere in the OT, worshiping other gods is viewed as spiritual adultery and unfaithfulness to the one true God. The phrase &#8220;many acts of sorcery&#8221; could be taken literally, for Jezebel undoubtedly utilized pagan divination practices, but the phrase may be metaphorical, pointing to her devotion to pagan customs in general. </p>
