<A NAME="917"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=388><b>sn</b> Note how the young prophet greatly expands the message Elisha had given to him. In addition to lengthening the introductory formula (by adding &#8220;the God of Israel&#8221;) and the official declaration that accompanies the act of anointing (by adding &#8220;the <sc>Lord&#8217;s people&#8221;), he goes on to tell how Jehu will become king (by a revolt against Ahab&#8217;s dynasty), makes it clear that Jehu will be an instrument of divine vengeance, and predicts the utter annihilation of Ahab&#8217;s family and the violent death of Jezebel.</p>
