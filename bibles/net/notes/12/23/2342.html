<A NAME="2342"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1091><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they left undisturbed his bones, the bones of the prophet who came from Samaria.&#8221; If the phrase &#8220;the bones of the prophet&#8221; were appositional to &#8220;his bones,&#8221; one would expect the sentence to end &#8220;from Judah&#8221; (see v. 17). Apparently the &#8220;prophet&#8221; referred to in the second half of the verse is the old prophet from Bethel who buried the man of God from Judah in his own tomb and instructed his sons to bury his bones there as well (1 Kgs 13:30-31). One expects the text to read &#8220;from Bethel,&#8221; but &#8220;Samaria&#8221; (which was not even built at the time of the incident recorded in 1 Kgs 13) is probably an anachronistic reference to the northern kingdom in general. See the note at 1 Kgs 13:32 and the discussion in M. Cogan and H. Tadmor, <i>II Kings</i> (AB), 290.</p>
