<A NAME="2339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1088><b>tc</b> The MT is much shorter than this. It reads, &#8220;according to the word of the <sc>Lord which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.&#8221; The LXX has a much longer text at this point. It reads: &#8220;[which was proclaimed by the man of God] while Jeroboam stood by the altar at a celebration. Then he turned and saw the grave of the man of God [who proclaimed these words].&#8221; The extra material attested in the LXX was probably accidentally omitted in the Hebrew tradition when a scribe&#8217;s eye jumped from the first occurrence of the phrase &#8220;man of God&#8221; (which appears right before the extra material) and the second occurrence of the phrase (which appears at the end of the extra material).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This recalls the prophecy recorded in 1 Kgs 13:2. </p>
