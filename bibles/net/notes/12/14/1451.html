<A NAME="1451"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=689><b>tn</b> The MT has simply &#8220;with the kings of Israel,&#8221; which appears to stand in apposition to the immediately preceding &#8220;with his fathers.&#8221; But it is likely that the words &#8220;and he was buried in Samaria&#8221; have been accidentally omitted from the text. See 13:13 and 14:16. </p>
