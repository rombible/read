<A NAME="1425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=663><b>tc</b> The MT has the plural form of the verb, but the final <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) is virtually dittographic. The word that immediately follows in the Hebrew text begins with a <i>yod</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font>). The form should be emended to the singular, which is consistent in number with the verb (&#8220;he broke down&#8221;) that follows.</p>
