<A NAME="1449"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=687><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;As for the rest of the events of Jeroboam, and all which he did and his strength, [and] how he fought and how he restored Damascus and Hamath to Judah in Israel, are they not written on the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Israel?&#8221; The phrase &#8220;to Judah&#8221; is probably not original; it may be a scribal addition by a Judahite scribe who was trying to link Jeroboam&#8217;s conquests with the earlier achievements of David and Solomon, who ruled in Judah. The Syriac Peshitta has simply &#8220;to Israel.&#8221; M. Cogan and H. Tadmor (<i>II Kings</i> [AB], 162) offer this proposal, but acknowledge that it is &#8220;highly speculative.&#8221; </p>
