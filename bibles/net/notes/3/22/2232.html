<A NAME="2232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1084><b>tn</b> Contextually, &#8220;They&#8221; could refer either to the people (v. 14a; cf. NRSV &#8220;No one&#8221;) or the priests (v. 14b; cf. NIV &#8220;The priests&#8221;), but the latter seems more likely (see J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 356, and B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 150). The priests were responsible to see that the portions of the offerings that were to be consumed by the priests as prebends did not become accessible to the people. Mistakes in this matter (cf. v. 14) would bring &#8220;guilt&#8221; on the people, requiring punishment (v. 16). </p>
