<A NAME="2254"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1106><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;the care of&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text, but are implied. Although many modern English versions render &#8220;with its mother&#8221; (e.g., NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV, NLT), the literal phrase &#8220;under its mother&#8221; refers to the young animal nursing from its mother. Cf. KJV, ASV &#8220;it shall be seven days under the dam,&#8221; which would probably be misunderstood.</p>
