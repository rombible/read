<A NAME="2214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1066><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to all his impurity.&#8221; The phrase refers to the impurity of the person whom the man touches to become unclean (see the previous clause). To clarify this, the translation uses &#8220;that person&#8217;s&#8221; rather than &#8220;his.&#8221;</p>
