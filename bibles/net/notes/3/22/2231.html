<A NAME="2231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1083><b>sn</b> When a person trespassed in regard to something sacred to the <sc>Lord, reparation was to be made for the trespass, involving restitution of that which was violated plus one fifth of its value as a fine. It is possible that the restoration of the offering and the additional one fifth of its value were made as a monetary payment (see, e.g., B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 150). See the regulations for the &#8220;guilt offering&#8221; in Lev 5:16; 6:5 [5:24 HT] and the notes there. </p>
