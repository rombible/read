<A NAME="2131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1044><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;who there is in him a broken leg or a broken arm,&#8221; or perhaps &#8220;broken foot or broken hand.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1462;&#1490;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">regel</font>) is commonly rendered &#8220;foot,&#8221; but it can also refer to the &#8220;leg,&#8221; and the Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yad</font>) is most often translated &#8220;hand,&#8221; but can also refer to the &#8220;[fore]arm&#8221; (as opposed to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1507;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kaf</font>, &#8220;palm of the hand&#8221; or &#8220;hand&#8221;). See <i>HALOT</i> 386 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;</font> and 1184 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1462;&#1490;&#1462;&#1500;</font> respectively (cf. the NJPS translation). In this context, these terms probably apply to any part of the limb that was broken, including hand and the foot. B. A. Levine (<i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 146) points out that such injuries often did not heal properly in antiquity because they were not properly set and, therefore, remained a &#8220;physical flaw&#8221; permanently. </p>
