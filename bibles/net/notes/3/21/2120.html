<A NAME="2120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1033><b>tn</b> Regarding these signs of mourning see the note on Lev 10:6. His head had been anointed (v. 10a) so it must not be unkempt (v. 10b), and his garments were special priestly garments (v. 10a) so he must not tear them (v. 10b). In the translation &#8220;garments&#8221; has been employed rather than &#8220;clothes&#8221; to suggest that the special priestly garments are referred to here; cf. NRSV &#8220;nor tear his vestments.&#8221;</p>
