<A NAME="2112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1025><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;A wife harlot and profaned they shall not take.&#8221; The structure of the verse (e.g., &#8220;wife&#8221; at the beginning of the two main clauses) suggests that &#8220;harlot and profaned&#8221; constitutes a hendiadys, meaning &#8220;a wife defiled by harlotry&#8221; (see the explanation in B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 143, as opposed to that in J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 343, 348; cf. v. 14 below). Cf. NASB &#8220;a woman who is profaned by harlotry.&#8221;</p>
