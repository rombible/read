<A NAME="246"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1180><b>tn</b> Alternatively, &#8220;pure [gold] lampstand,&#8221; based on Exod 25:31, etc., where the term for &#8220;gold&#8221; actually appears (see NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV, NLT, and the remarks in J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 395, etc.). However, in Lev 24:4 the adjective &#8220;pure&#8221; is feminine, corresponding to &#8220;lampstand,&#8221; not an assumed noun &#8220;gold&#8221; (contrast Exod 25:31), and the &#8220;table&#8221; in v. 6 was overlaid with gold, but was not made of pure gold. Therefore, it is probably better to translate &#8220;[ceremonially] pure lampstand&#8221; (v. 4) and &#8220;[ceremonially] pure table&#8221; (v. 6); see NEB; cf. KJV, ASV; B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 164-65; and G. J. Wenham, <i>Leviticus</i> [NICOT], 307.</p>
