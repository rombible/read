<A NAME="2421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1195><b>tn</b> The verb rendered &#8220;misused&#8221; means literally &#8220;to bore through, to pierce&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 719 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1511;&#1489;</font> qal); it is from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">naqav</font>), not <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qavav</font>; see the participial form in v. 16a). Its exact meaning here is uncertain. The two verbs together may form a hendiadys, &#8220;he pronounced by cursing blasphemously&#8221; (B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 166), the idea being one of the following: (1) he pronounced the name &#8220;Yahweh&#8221; in a way or with words that amounted to &#8220;some sort of verbal aggression against Yahweh himself&#8221; (E. S. Gerstenberger, <i>Leviticus</i> [OTL], 362), (2) he pronounced a curse against the man using the name &#8220;Yahweh&#8221; (N. H. Snaith, <i>Leviticus and Numbers</i> [NCBC], 110; G. J. Wenham, <i>Leviticus</i> [NICOT], 311), or (3) he pronounced the name &#8220;Yahweh&#8221; and thereby blasphemed, since the &#8220;Name&#8221; was never to be pronounced (a standard Jewish explanation). In one way or another, the offense surely violated Exod 20:7, one of the ten commandments, and the same verb for cursing is used explicitly in Exod 22:28 (27 HT) prohibition against &#8220;cursing&#8221; God. For a full discussion of these and related options for interpreting this verse see P. J. Budd, <i>Leviticus</i> (NCBC), 335-36; J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> (WBC), 408-9; and Levine, 166. </p>
