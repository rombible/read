<A NAME="1216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=463><b>sn</b> See the note on Lev 1:4 &#8220;make atonement.&#8221; The purpose of sin offering &#8220;atonement,&#8221; in particular, was to purge impurities from the tabernacle (see Lev 15:31 and 16:5-19, 29-34), whether they were caused by physical uncleannesses or by sins and iniquities. In this case, the woman has not &#8220;sinned&#8221; morally by having a child. Even Mary brought such offerings for giving birth to Jesus (Luke 2:22-24), though she certainly did not &#8220;sin&#8221; in giving birth to him. Note that the result of bringing this &#8220;sin offering&#8221; was &#8220;she will be clean,&#8221; not &#8220;she will be forgiven&#8221; (cf. Lev 4:20, 26, 31, 35; 5:10, 13). The impurity of the blood flow has caused the need for this &#8220;sin offering,&#8221; not some moral or relational infringement of the law (contrast Lev 4:2, &#8220;When a person sins by straying unintentionally from any of the commandments of the <sc>Lord&#8221;). </p>
