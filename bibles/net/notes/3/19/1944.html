<A NAME="1944"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=951><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to add to you its produce.&#8221; The rendering here assumes that the point of this clause is simply that finally being allowed to eat the fruit in the fifth year adds the fruit of the tree to their harvest. Some take the verb to be from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asaf</font>, &#8220;to gather&#8221;) rather than <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yasaf</font>, &#8220;to add; to increase&#8221;), rendering the verse, &#8220;to gather to you the produce&#8221; (E. S. Gerstenberger, <i>Leviticus</i> [OTL], 260, and see the versions referenced in J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 306). Others take it to mean that by following the regulations given previously they will honor the <sc>Lord so that the <sc>Lord will cause the trees to increase the amount of fruit they would normally produce (Hartley, 303, 306; cf. NASB, NIV, NRSV, NLT).</p>
