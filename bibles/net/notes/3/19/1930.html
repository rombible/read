<A NAME="1930"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=937><b>sn</b> Some scholars make a distinction between the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ahav</font>, &#8220;to love&#8221;) with the direct object and the more unusual construction with the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font> (<i>lamed</i>) as it is here and in Lev 19:34 and 2 Chr 19:2 only. If there is a distinction, the construction here probably calls for direct and helpful action toward one&#8217;s neighbor (see the discussion in J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 305, and esp. 317-18). Such love stands in contrast to taking vengeance or bearing a grudge against someone and, in NT terms, amounts to fulfilling the so-called &#8220;golden rule&#8221; (Matt 7:12). </p>
