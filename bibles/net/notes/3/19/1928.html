<A NAME="1928"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=935><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and you will not lift up on him sin.&#8221; The meaning of the line is somewhat obscure. It means either (1) that one should rebuke one&#8217;s neighbor when he sins lest one also becomes guilty, which is the way it is rendered here (see NIV, NRSV, NEB, JB; see also B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 129-30, and J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 303, and the discussion on pp. 316-17), or (2) one may rebuke one&#8217;s neighbor without incurring sin just as long as he does not hate him in his heart (see the first part of the verse; cf. NASB, NAB). </p>
