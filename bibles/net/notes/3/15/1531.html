<A NAME="1531"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=738><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and if on the bed it (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hu</font>&#8217;) is or on the vessel which she sits on it, when he touches it&#8230;.&#8221; The translation and meaning of this verse is a subject of much debate in the commentaries (see the summary in J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:938-40). It is difficult to determine what <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</font> refers to, whether it means &#8220;he&#8221; referring to the one who does the touching, &#8220;it&#8221; for the furniture or the seat in v. 22, &#8220;she&#8221; referring to the woman herself (see Smr <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1497;&#1488;</font> rather than <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1488;</font>), or perhaps anything that was lying on the furniture or the bed of vv. 21-22. The latter view is taken here (cf. J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 202).</p>
