<A NAME="1513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=720><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term for &#8220;means of riding&#8221; is a cognate noun from the verb &#8220;ride&#8221; later in this verse. It refers to anything on which one may ride without the feet touching the ground including, for example, a saddle, a (saddle) blanket, or a seat on a chariot (see, e.g., J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:916).</p>
