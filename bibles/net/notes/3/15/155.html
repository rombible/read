<A NAME="155"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=712><b>tc</b> Smr, LXX, and the Paleo-Hebrew Leviticus Scroll from Qumran (11QpaleoLev; Fragment G contains Lev 14:52-15:5 and 16:2-4, and agrees with the LXX of Lev 15:3b) are in essential (although not complete) agreement against the MT in Lev 15:3b and are to be preferred in this case. The shorter MT text has probably arisen due to a lengthy haplography. See K. A. Mathews, &#8220;The Leviticus Scroll (11QpaleoLev) and the Text of the Hebrew Bible,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 48 (1986): 177-78, 198; D. N. Freedman, &#8220;Variant Readings in the Leviticus Scroll from Qumran Cave 11,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 36 (1974): 528-29; D. N. Freedman and K. A. Mathews, <i>The Paleo-Hebrew Leviticus Scroll</i>, 32. The MT of Lev 15:3 reads: &#8220;Now this is his uncleanness in [regard to] his discharge &#8211; whether his body secretes his discharge or blocks his discharge, this is his uncleanness.&#8221; Smr adds after MT&#8217;s &#8220;blocks his discharge&#8221; the following: &#8220;he is unclean; all the days that his body has a discharge or his body blocks his discharge, this is his uncleanness.&#8221; Thus, the MT appears to skip from Smr <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1502;&#1488; &#1492;&#1493;&#1488;</font> &#8220;he is unclean&#8221; in the middle of the verse to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1488;</font>/<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1502;&#1488;&#1514;&#1493; &#1492;&#1493;</font> &#8220;this is his uncleanness&#8221; at the end of the verse, leaving out &#8220;he is unclean; all the days that his body has a discharge or his body blocks his discharge&#8221; (cf. the <i>BHS</i> footnote). 11Q1 (paleoLev<sup>a</sup> frag. G) is indeed fragmentary, but it does have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1502;&#1497; &#1494;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1493; &#1499;&#1500;</font> &#8220;&#8230;in him, all the days of the fl[ow],&#8221; supporting Smr and LXX tradition. The LXX adds after MT &#8220;blocks his discharge&#8221; the following: &#8220;all the days of the flow of his body, by which his body is affected by the flow,&#8221; followed by &#8220;it is his uncleanness&#8221; (i.e., the last two words of the MT). </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The contrast between the dripping or flowing from the male sexual member as opposed to there being a blockage is important. One might not understand that even though a blockage actually causes a lack of discharge, it is still unclean.</p>
