<A NAME="1520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=727><b>tc</b> The MT has the Qal form of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bo</font>&#8217;) &#8220;to come&#8221; here, but the LXX (followed generally by the Syriac and <i>Tg. Ps.-J.</i>) reflects the Hiphil form of the same verb, &#8220;to bring&#8221; as in v. 29 below. In v. 29, however, there is no additional clause &#8220;and give them to the priest,&#8221; so the Hiphil is necessary in that context while it is not necessary here in v. 14.</p>
