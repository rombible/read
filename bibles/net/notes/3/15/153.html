<A NAME="153"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=710><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;man, man when there is a discharge from his flesh.&#8221; The repetition of the word &#8220;man&#8221; is distributive, meaning &#8220;any [or &#8220;every&#8221;] man&#8221; (GKC 395-96 §123.<i>c</i>). It is well-recognized that the term &#8220;flesh&#8221; (i.e., &#8220;body&#8221;) in this chapter refers regularly and euphemistically to the male and female genital members or areas of the body (<i>HALOT</i> 164 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1512;</font> 5.b; see also, e.g., B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 93). The euphemism has been retained in this translation since it is, in fact, intended in the Hebrew text. Some English versions partially remove the euphemism (e.g., NAB &#8220;from his private parts&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;from his member&#8221;) while some remove it completely (e.g., NLT &#8220;a genital discharge&#8221;; TEV &#8220;from his penis&#8221;; CEV &#8220;with an infected penis&#8221;).</p>
