<A NAME="79"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=260><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and all made in the pan&#8221;; cf. KJV &#8220;fryingpan&#8221;; NAB &#8220;deep-fried in a pot.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=261><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a man like his brother.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=262><b>tn</b> This &#8220;he&#8221; pronoun refers to the offerer. Smr and LXX have plural &#8220;they.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=263><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;for a thank offering.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=264><b>tn</b> See the notes on Lev 2:4.</p>
<A NAME="714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=265><b>tn</b> See the note on Lev 6:21 [6:14 HT].</p>
<A NAME="715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=266><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;choice wheat flour well soaked ring-shaped loaves.&#8221; See the note on Lev 2:1.</p>
<A NAME="716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=267><b>tn</b> The rendering &#8220;this [grain] offering&#8221; is more literally &#8220;his offering,&#8221; but it refers to the series of grain offerings listed just previously in v. 12.</p>
<A NAME="717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=268><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;which regularly accompany&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text, but are supplied for clarity.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The translation &#8220;[which regularly accompany]&#8230;&#8221; is based on the practice of bringing bread (and wine) to eat with the portions of the peace offering meat eaten by the priests and worshipers (see v. 14 and Num 15:1-13). This was in addition to the memorial portion of the unleavened bread that was offered to the <sc>Lord on the altar (cf. Lev 2:2, 9, and the note on 7:12).</p>
<A NAME="718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=269><b>tn</b> Here the Hebrew text reads &#8220;offering&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">qorbban</font>), not &#8220;grain offering&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">minkhah</font>), but in this context the term refers once again to the list in 7:12.</p>
<A NAME="719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=270><b>tn</b> The term rendered &#8220;contribution offering&#8221; is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tÿrumah</font>), which generally refers to that which is set aside from the offerings to the <sc>Lord as prebends for the officiating priests (cf. esp. Lev 7:28-34 and R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE </i>4:335-37). Cf. TEV &#8220;as a special contribution.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=271><b>tn</b> In the verse &#8220;his&#8221; refers to the offerer. </p>
<A NAME="721"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=272><b>tn</b> For the distinction between votive and freewill offerings see the note on Lev 22:23 and the literature cited there. </p>
<A NAME="722"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=273><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and on the next day and the left over from it shall be eaten.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=274><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;burned with fire,&#8221; an expression which is sometimes redundant in English, but here means &#8220;burned up,&#8221; &#8220;burned up entirely&#8221; (likewise in v. 19).</p>
<A NAME="724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=275><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;desecrated,&#8221; or &#8220;defiled,&#8221; or &#8220;forbidden.&#8221; For this difficult term see J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>(AB), 1:422. Cf. NIV &#8220;it is impure&#8221;; NCV &#8220;it will become unclean&#8221;; NLT &#8220;will be contaminated.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=276><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his iniquity he shall bear&#8221; (cf. Lev 5:1); NIV &#8220;will be held responsible&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;shall incur guilt&#8221;; TEV &#8220;will suffer the consequences.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="726"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=277><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;ceremonially&#8221; has been supplied in the translation both here and in the following sentence to clarify that the uncleanness involved is ritual or ceremonial in nature.</p>
<A NAME="727"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=278><b>tn</b> The Hebrew has simply &#8220;the flesh,&#8221; but this certainly refers to &#8220;clean&#8221; flesh in contrast to the unclean flesh in the first half of the verse. </p>
<A NAME="728"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=279><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and his unclean condition is on him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=280><b>sn</b> The exact meaning of this penalty clause is not certain. It could mean that he will be executed, whether by God or by man, he will be excommunicated from sanctuary worship and/or community benefits (cf. TEV, CEV), or his line will be terminated by God (i.e., extirpation), etc. See J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> (WBC), 100; J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>(AB), 1:457-60; and B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> (JPSTC), 241-42 for further discussion.</p>
<A NAME="730"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=281><b>sn</b> For these categories of unclean animals see Lev 11.</p>
<A NAME="731"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=282><b>sn</b> For the interpretation of this last clause see the note on Lev 7:20.</p>
<A NAME="732"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=283><b>sn</b> See the note on Lev 6:8 [6:1 HT] above.</p>
<A NAME="733"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=284><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;carcass,&#8221; referring to the carcass of an animal that has died on its own, not the carcass of an animal slaughtered for sacrifice or killed by wild beasts. This has been clarified in the translation by supplying the phrase &#8220;of natural causes&#8221;; cf. NAB, TEV &#8220;that has died a natural death.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="734"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=285><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;shall be used for any work&#8221;; cf. NIV, NLT &#8220;may be used for any other purpose.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="735"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=286><b>sn</b> See the note on Lev 7:20.</p>
<A NAME="736"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=287><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and any blood you must not eat in any of your dwelling places, to the bird and to the animal.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="737"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=288><b>sn</b> See the note on Lev 7:20.</p>
<A NAME="738"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=289><b>sn</b> See the note on Lev 6:8 [6:1 HT].</p>
<A NAME="739"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=290><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;on the breast.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="740"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=291><b>tc</b> Many Hebrew <sc>mss and some versions (esp. the LXX) limit the offerings in the last part of this verse to the fat portions, specifically, the fat and the fat lobe of the liver (see the <i>BHS</i> footnote). The verse is somewhat awkward in Hebrew but nevertheless correct.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the breast to wave it, a wave offering before the <sc>Lord.&#8221; Other possible translations are &#8220;to elevate the breast [as] an elevation offering before the <sc>Lord&#8221; (cf. NRSV) or &#8220;to present the breast [as] a presentation offering before the <sc>Lord.&#8221; See J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> (WBC), 91, J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>(AB), 1:430-31, 461-72, and R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 3:63-67. </p>
<A NAME="741"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=292><b>tn</b> Older English versions (e.g., KJV, ASV) translate this Hebrew term (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tÿrumah</font>) &#8220;heave offering,&#8221; derived from the idea of &#8220;to raise, to lift&#8221; found in the verbal root (cf. NAB &#8220;a raised offering&#8221;). &#8220;Contribution offering&#8221; is a better English rendering because it refers to something &#8220;taken out from&#8221; (i.e., &#8220;lifted up from&#8221;; cf. the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1461;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">herim</font>) in, e.g., Lev 2:9; 4:8, etc.) the offering as a special contribution to the specific priest who presided over the offering procedures in any particular instance (see the next verse and R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 4:335-37). Cf. TEV &#8220;as a special contribution&#8221;; NCV, NLT &#8220;as a gift.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="742"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=293><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;a perpetual regulation&#8221;; cf. NASB &#8220;as their due forever&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;as a perpetual due&#8221;; NLT &#8220;their regular share.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="743"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=294><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the day he&#8221;; the referent (Moses) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="744"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=295><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the day of he presented them to serve as priests to the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The grammar here is relatively unusual. First, the verb &#8220;presented&#8221; appears to be in the perfect rather than the infinitive (but see GKC 531), the latter being normal in such temporal expressions. Second, the active verb form appears to be used as a passive plural (&#8220;they were presented&#8221;). However, if it is translated active and singular then Moses would be the subject: &#8220;on the day he [Moses] offered them [Aaron and his sons].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="745"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=296><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the day he&#8221;; the referent (Moses) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="746"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=297><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;which the <sc>Lord commanded to give to them in the day he anointed them from the children of Israel.&#8221; Thus v. 36 is tied syntactically to v. 35 (see the note there).</p>
<A NAME="747"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=298><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for your generations&#8221;; cf. NIV &#8220;for the generations to come&#8221;; TEV &#8220;for all time to come.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="748"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=299><b>sn</b> The Hebrew term translated &#8220;law&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">torah</font>]) occurs up to this point in the book only in Lev 6:9 [6:2 HT], 14 [7 HT], 25 [18 HT], 7:1, 7, 11, and here in 7:37. This suggests that Lev 7:37-38 is a summary of only this section of the book (i.e., Lev 6:8 [6:1 HT]-7:36), not all of Lev 1-7.</p>
<A NAME="749"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=300><b>tc</b> In the MT only &#8220;the grain offering&#8221; lacks a connecting <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vav</font>). However, many Hebrew , Smr, LXX, Syriac, and some <sc>mss of <i>Tg. Onq. </i>have the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vav</font>) on &#8220;the grain offering&#8221; as well.</p>
<A NAME="750"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=301><b>sn</b> The inclusion of the &#8220;ordination offering&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">milu</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>; the term apparently comes from the notion of &#8220;filling [of the hand],&#8221; cf. Lev 8:33) here anticipates Lev 8. It is a kind of peace offering, as the regulations in Lev 8:22-32 will show (cf. Exod 29:19-34). In the context of the ordination ritual for the priests it fits into the sequence of offerings as a peace offering would: sin offering (Lev 8:14-17), burnt and grain offering (Lev 8:18-21), and finally peace (i.e., ordination) offering (Lev 8:22-32). Moreover, in this case, Moses received the breast of the ordination offering as his due since he was the presiding priest over the sacrificial procedures (Lev 8:29; cf. Lev 7:30-31), while Aaron and his sons ate the portions that would have been consumed by the common worshipers in a regular peace offering procedure (Exod 29:31-34; cf. Lev 7:15-18). For a general introduction to the peace offering see the note on Lev 3:1.</p>
