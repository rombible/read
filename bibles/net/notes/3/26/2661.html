<A NAME="2661"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=1375><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And.&#8221; Many English versions take this to be a conditional clause (&#8220;if&#8230;&#8221;) though there is no conditional particle (see, e.g., NASB, NIV, NRSV; but see the very different rendering in B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 190). The temporal translation offered here (&#8220;when&#8221;) takes into account the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1494;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">az</font>, &#8220;then&#8221;), which occurs twice in v. 41. The obvious contextual contrast between vv. 39 and 40 is expressed by &#8220;however&#8221; in the translation.</p>
