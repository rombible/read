<A NAME="612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=213><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to whom it is to him he shall give it in the day of his being guilty.&#8221; The present translation is based on the view that he has been found guilty through the legal process (see the note on v. 4 above; cf., e.g., TEV and B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 33-34). Others translate the latter part as &#8220;in the day he offers his guilt [reparation] offering&#8221; (e.g., NIV and J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 73, 84), or &#8220;in the day he realizes his guilt&#8221; (e.g., NRSV and J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:319, 338).</p>
