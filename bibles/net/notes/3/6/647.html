<A NAME="647"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=248><b>tc</b> The translation &#8220;you must wash&#8221; is based on the MT as it stands (cf. NASB, NIV). Smr, LXX, Syriac, <i>Tg. Ps.-J.</i>, and the Vulgate have a third person masculine singular passive form (Pual), &#8220;[the garment] must be washed&#8221; (cf. NAB, NRSV, NLT). This could also be supported from the verbs in the following verse, and it requires only a repointing of the Hebrew text with no change in consonants. See the remarks in J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> (WBC), 90 and J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>(AB), 1:404.</p>
