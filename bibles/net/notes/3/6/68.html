<A NAME="68"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=209><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and it shall happen, when he sins and becomes guilty,&#8221; which is both resumptive of the previous (vv. 2-3) and the conclusion to the protasis (cf. &#8220;then&#8221; introducing the next clause as the apodosis). In this case, &#8220;becomes guilty&#8221; (cf. NASB, NIV) probably refers to his legal status as one who has been convicted of a crime in court; thus the translation &#8220;he is found guilty.&#8221; See R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 1:559-61.</p>
