<A NAME="41"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=77><b>sn</b> The quotation introduced here extends from Lev 4:2 through 5:13, and encompasses all the sin offering regulations. Compare the notes on Lev 1:1 above, and 5:14 and 6:1 [5:20 HT] below.</p>
<A NAME="42"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=78><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And a person, when he sins in straying.&#8221; The English translation of &#8220;by straying&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1490;&#1464;&#1490;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">bishgagah</font>] literally, &#8220;in going astray; in making an error&#8221;) varies greatly, but almost all suggest that this term refers to sins that were committed by mistake or done not knowing that the particular act was sinful (J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:228-29). See, e.g., LXX &#8220;involuntarily&#8221;; <i>Tg. Onq. </i>&#8220;by neglect&#8221;; KJV &#8220;through ignorance&#8221;; ASV, RSV, NJPS &#8220;unwittingly&#8221;; NASB, NIV, NRSV, NLT &#8220;unintentionally&#8221;; NAB, NEB &#8220;inadvertently&#8221;; NCV &#8220;by accident.&#8221; However, we know from Num 15:27-31 that committing a sin &#8220;by straying&#8221; is the opposite of committing a sin &#8220;defiantly&#8221; (i.e., <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1497;&#1463;&#1491; &#1512;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">bÿyad ramah</font>] &#8220;with a raised hand,&#8221; v. 30). In the latter case the person, as it were, raises his fist in presumptuous defiance against the <sc>Lord. Thus, he &#8220;blasphemes&#8221; the <sc>Lord and has &#8220;despised&#8221; his word, for which he should be &#8220;cut off from among his people&#8221; (Num 15:30-31). One could not bring an offering for such a sin. The expression here in Lev 4:2 combines &#8220;by straying&#8221; with the preposition &#8220;from&#8221; which fits naturally with &#8220;straying&#8221; (i.e., &#8220;straying from&#8221; the <sc>Lord&#8217;s commandments). For sins committed &#8220;by straying&#8221; from the commandments (Lev 4 throughout) or other types of transgressions (Lev 5:1-6) there was indeed forgiveness available through the sin offering. See R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 2:94-95.</p>
<A NAME="43"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=79><b>tn</b> This is an emphatic use of the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">min</font>; see R. J. Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 56-57, §325).</p>
<A NAME="44"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=80><b>tn</b> The &#8220;when&#8221; clause (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ki</font>) breaks off here before its resolution, thus creating an open-ended introduction to the following subsections, which are introduced by &#8220;if&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>] vv. 3, 13, 27, 32). Also, the last part of the verse reads literally, &#8220;which must not be done and does from one from them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="45"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=81><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the anointed priest&#8221; (so ASV, NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV). This refers to the high priest (cf. TEV, CEV, NLT).</p>

One can tell which rendering is intended only by the context. The primary purpose of the &#8220;sin offering&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1496;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khatta</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">t</font>) was to &#8220;purge&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kipper</font>, &#8220;to make atonement,&#8221; see 4:20, 26, 31, 35, and the notes on Lev 1:4 and esp. Lev 16:20, 33) the sanctuary or its furniture in order to cleanse it from any impurities and/or (re)consecrate it for holy purposes (see, e.g., Lev 8:15; 16:19). By making this atonement the impurities of the person or community were cleansed and the people became clean. See R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 2:93-103.</p>
<A NAME="49"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=85><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from the blood of the bull&#8221; (and similarly throughout this chapter).</p>

<A NAME="411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=87><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;of the blood.&#8221; The relative pronoun (&#8220;it&#8221;) has been used in the translation here for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=88><b>tn</b> The particle here translated &#8220;toward&#8221; usually serves as a direct object indicator or a preposition meaning &#8220;with.&#8221; With the verb of motion it probably means &#8220;toward,&#8221; &#8220;in the direction of&#8221; (J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:234; J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 60); cf. NAB, CEV.</p>
<A NAME="413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=89><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1465;&#1499;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">parokhet</font>) is usually translated &#8220;veil&#8221; (e.g., ASV, NAB, NASB) or &#8220;curtain&#8221; (e.g., NIV, NRSV), but it seems to have stretched not only in front of but also over the top of the ark of the covenant which stood behind and under it inside the most holy place (see R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 3:687-89).</p>
<A NAME="414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=90><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all the fat of the bull of the sin offering he shall take up from it.&#8221;</p>

Lev 3:3, 9, 14). It may have been mistakenly inserted here under the influence of &#8220;on (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font>) the entrails&#8221; at the end of the verse.</p>
<A NAME="416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=92><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and all the fat on the entrails.&#8221; The fat layer that covers the entrails as a whole (i.e., &#8220;that covers the entrails&#8221;) is different from the fat that surrounds and adheres to the various organs (&#8220;on the entrails,&#8221; i.e., surrounding them; J.

<A NAME="423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=99><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;burn with fire.&#8221; This expression is somewhat redundant in English, so the translation collocates &#8220;fire&#8221; with &#8220;wood,&#8221; thus &#8220;a wood fire.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=100><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;strays&#8221;; KJV &#8220;sin through ignorance.&#8221; The verb &#8220;strays&#8221; here is the verbal form of the noun in the expression &#8220;by straying&#8221; (see the note on Lev 4:2 above).</p>

<A NAME="428"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=104><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he shall slaughter.&#8221; The singular verb seems to refer to an individual who represents the whole congregation, perhaps one of the elders referred to at the beginning of the verse, or the officiating priest (cf. v. 21).

Compare v. 6, which has literally, &#8220;and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle from the blood seven times.&#8221; The MT appears to be corrupt by haplography (i.e., assuming v. 6 to be the correct form, in v. 17 the scribe skipped from &#8220;his finger&#8221; to &#8220;from the blood,&#8221; thus missing &#8220;in the blood&#8221;) and metathesis (i.e., this also resulted in a text where &#8220;from the blood&#8221; stands before &#8220;sprinkle&#8221; rather than after it; J.
