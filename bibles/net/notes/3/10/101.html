<A NAME="101"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=378><b>tn</b> Although it has been used elsewhere in this translation as an English variation from the ubiquitous use of <i>vav </i>in Hebrew, in this instance &#8220;then&#8221; as a rendering for <i>vav </i>is intended to show that the Nadab and Abihu catastrophe took place on the inauguration day described in Lev 9. The tragic incident in Lev 10 happened in close temporal connection to the <sc>Lord&#8217;s fire that consumed the offerings at the end of Lev 9. Thus, for example, the &#8220;sin offering&#8221; male goat referred to in Lev 10:16-19 is the very one referred to in Lev 9:15.</p>
