<A NAME="1011"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=388><b>sn</b> The two pairs of categories in this verse refer to: (1) the <i>status</i> of a person, place, thing, or time &#8211; &#8220;holy&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1465;&#1491;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font>, <font face="Scholar">qodesh</font>) versus &#8220;common&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khol</font>); as opposed to (2) the <i>condition</i> of a person, place, or thing &#8211; &#8220;unclean&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1464;&#1502;&#1461;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tame</font>&#8217;) versus &#8220;clean&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tahor</font>). Someone or something could gain &#8220;holy&#8221; <i>status</i> by being &#8220;consecrated&#8221; (i.e., made holy; e.g., the Hebrew Piel <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qiddesh</font>) in Lev 8:15, 30), and to treat someone or something that was holy as if it were &#8220;common&#8221; would be to &#8220;profane&#8221; that person or thing (the Hebrew Piel <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1500;</font> [<font face="Scholar">hillel</font>], e.g., in Lev 19:29 and 22:15). Similarly, on another level, someone or something could be in a &#8220;clean&#8221; <i>condition</i>, but one could &#8220;defile&#8221; (the Hebrew Piel <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;</font> [<font face="Scholar">timme</font>&#8217;], e.g., in Gen 34:5 and Num 6:9) that person or thing and thereby make it &#8220;unclean.&#8221; To &#8220;purify&#8221; (the Hebrew Piel <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1460;&#1492;&#1461;&#1512;</font> [<font face="Scholar">tiher</font>], e.g., in Lev 16:19 and Num 8:6, 15) that unclean person or thing would be to make it &#8220;clean&#8221; once again. With regard to the animals (Lev 11), some were by nature &#8220;unclean,&#8221; so they could never be eaten, but others were by nature &#8220;clean&#8221; and, therefore, edible (Lev 11:2, 46-47). The meat of clean animals could become inedible by too long of a delay in eating it, in which case the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pigul</font>) &#8220;foul, spoiled&#8221; is used to describe it (Lev 7:18; 19:7; cf. also Ezek 4:14 and Isa 65:4), not the term for &#8220;unclean&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tahor</font>). Strictly speaking, therefore, unclean meat never becomes clean, and clean meat never becomes unclean. </p>
