<A NAME="105"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=382><b>tn</b> In this context the Niphal of the Hebrew root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1461;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kaved</font>) can mean &#8220;to be honored&#8221; (e.g., NASB and NIV here), &#8220;be glorified&#8221; (ASV, NRSV and NLT here), or &#8220;glorify oneself, show one&#8217;s glory&#8221; (cf. NAB; e.g., specifically in this verse <i>HALOT</i> 455 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew"> &#1499;&#1489;&#1491;</font>nif.3; J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:595, 603-4; and J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 126, 134). Comparing this clause with the previous one (see the note above), the point may be that when the <sc>Lord shows himself to be holy as he has done in 10:1-2, this results in him being honored (i.e., reverenced, feared, treated with respect) among the people. This suggests the passive rendering. It is possible, however, that one should use the reflexive rendering here as in the previous clause. If so, the passage means that the <sc>Lord showed both his holiness and his glory in one outbreak against Nadab and Abihu. </p>
