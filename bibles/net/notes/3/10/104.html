<A NAME="104"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=381><b>tn</b> The Niphal verb of the Hebrew root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qadash</font>) can mean either &#8220;to be treated as holy&#8221; (so here, e.g., BDB 873 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font>, LXX, NASB, and NEB) or &#8220;to show oneself holy&#8221; (so here, e.g., <i>HALOT</i> 1073 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew"> &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;</font>nif.1, NIV, NRSV, NLT; J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:595, 601-3; and J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 133-34). The latter rendering seems more likely here since, in the immediate context, the <sc>Lord himself had indeed shown himself to be holy by the way he responded to the illegitimate incense offering of Nadab and Abihu. They had not treated the <sc>Lord as holy, so the <sc>Lord acted on his own behalf to show that he was indeed holy. </p>
