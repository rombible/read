<A NAME="109"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=386><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;a perpetual statute for your generations&#8221;; NAB &#8220;a perpetual ordinance&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;a statute forever&#8221;; NLT &#8220;a permanent law.&#8221; The Hebrew grammar here suggests that the last portion of v. 9 functions as both a conclusion to v. 9 and an introduction to vv. 10-11. It is a pivot clause, as it were. Thus, it was a &#8220;perpetual statute&#8221; to not drink alcoholic beverages when ministering in the tabernacle, but it was also a &#8220;perpetual statue&#8221; to distinguish between holy and profane and unclean and clean (v. 10) as well as to teach the children of Israel all such statutes (v. 11).</p>
