<A NAME="1020"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=397><b>sn</b> This translation is quite literal. On the surface it appears to mean that the priests would &#8220;bear the iniquity&#8221; of the congregation by the act of eating the sin offering (so J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:622-25, 635-40). Such a notion is, however, found nowhere else in the Levitical regulations and seems unlikely (so J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 136). A more likely interpretation is reflected in this interpretive rendering: &#8220;he gave it to you [as payment] for [your work of] bearing the iniquity of the congregation.&#8221; The previous section of the chapter deals with the prebends that the priests received for performing the ministry of the tabernacle (Lev 10:12-15). Lev 10:16-18, therefore, seems to continue the very same topic in the light of the most immediate situation (see R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 2:702-4).</p>
