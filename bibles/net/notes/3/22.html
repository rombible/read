<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1053><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;holy things,&#8221; which means the &#8220;holy offerings&#8221; in this context, as the following verses show. The referent has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1054><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from the holy things of the sons of Israel, and they shall not profane my holy name, which they are consecrating to me.&#8221; The latter (relative) clause applies to the &#8220;the holy things of the sons of Israel&#8221; (the first clause), not the <sc>Lord&#8217;s name (i.e., the immediately preceding clause). The clause order in the translation has been rearranged to indicate this.</p>
<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1055><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;To your generations.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1056><b>tn</b> The Piel (v. 2) and Hiphil (v. 3) forms of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qadash</font>) appear to be interchangeable in this context. Both mean &#8220;to consecrate&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;make holy [or &#8220;sacred&#8221;]&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1057><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and his impurity [is] on him&#8221;; NIV &#8220;is ceremonially unclean&#8221;; NAB, NRSV &#8220;while he is in a state of uncleanness.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1058><b>sn</b> Regarding the &#8220;cut off&#8221; penalty, see the note on Lev 7:20. Cf. the interpretive translation of TEV &#8220;he can never again serve at the altar.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1059><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Man man.&#8221; The reduplication is a way of saying &#8220;any man&#8221; (cf. Lev 15:2; 17:3, etc.), but with a negative command it means &#8220;No man&#8221; (see B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 147). </p>
<A NAME="228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1060><b>sn</b> The diseases and discharges mentioned here are those described in Lev 13-15. </p>
<A NAME="229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1061><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And the one.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1062><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in all unclean of a person/soul&#8221;; for the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>) meaning &#8220;a [dead] person,&#8221; see the note on Lev 19:28. </p>
<A NAME="2211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1063><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;or a man who goes out from him a lying of seed.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1064><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;which there shall be uncleanness to him.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1065><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term for &#8220;person&#8221; here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">adam</font>, &#8220;human being&#8221;), which could either a male or a female person. </p>
<A NAME="2214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1066><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to all his impurity.&#8221; The phrase refers to the impurity of the person whom the man touches to become unclean (see the previous clause). To clarify this, the translation uses &#8220;that person&#8217;s&#8221; rather than &#8220;his.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1067><b>sn</b> The phrase &#8220;any of these&#8221; refers back to the unclean things touched in vv. 4b-5. </p>
<A NAME="2216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1068><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a carcass,&#8221; referring to the carcass of an animal that has died on its own, not the carcass of an animal slaughtered for sacrifice or killed by wild beasts. This has been clarified in the translation by supplying the phrase &#8220;of natural causes&#8221;; cf. NAB &#8220;that has died of itself&#8221;; TEV &#8220;that has died a natural death.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1069><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they will not lift up on it sin.&#8221; The pronoun &#8220;it&#8221; (masculine) apparently refers to any item of food that belongs to the category of &#8220;holy offerings&#8221; (see above). </p>
<A NAME="2218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1070><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and die in it.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1071><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;No stranger&#8221; (so KJV, ASV), which refers here to anyone other than the Aaronic priests. Some English versions reverse the negation and state positively: NIV &#8220;No one outside a priest&#8217;s family&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;Only a member of a priestly family&#8221;; CEV &#8220;Only you priests and your families.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1072><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;A resident [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">toshav</font>) from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yashav</font>, &#8220;to dwell, to reside&#8221;)] of a priest.&#8221; The meaning of the term is uncertain. It could refer to a &#8220;guest&#8221; (NIV) or perhaps &#8220;bound servant&#8221; (NRSV; see B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 149). In the translation &#8220;lodger&#8221; was used instead of &#8220;boarder&#8221; precisely because a boarder would be provided meals with his lodging, the very issue at stake here.</p>
<A NAME="2221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1073><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and a priest, if he buys a person, the property of his silver.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1074><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (the person whom the priest has purchased) has been specified in the translation for clarity. </p>
<A NAME="2223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1075><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;eat it&#8221;; the referent (the holy offerings) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1076><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his&#8221;; the referent (the priest) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1077><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the [slave] born of his house, they shall eat in his food.&#8221; The LXX, Syriac, <i>Tg. Onq.</i>, <i>Tg. Ps.-J.</i>, and some <sc>mss of Smr have plural &#8220;ones born,&#8221; which matches the following plural &#8220;they&#8221; pronoun and the plural form of the verb. </p>
<A NAME="2226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1078><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And a daughter of a priest, if she is to a man, a stranger&#8221; (cf. the note on v. 10 above). </p>
<A NAME="2227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1079><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;she in the contribution of the holy offerings shall not eat.&#8221; For &#8220;contribution [offering]&#8221; see the note on Lev 7:14 and the literature cited there. Cf. NCV &#8220;the holy offerings&#8221;; TEV, NLT &#8220;the sacred offerings.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1080><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to&#8221;; the words &#8220;live in&#8221; have been supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1081><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and seed there is not to her and she returns to the house of her father as her youth.&#8221; The mention of having &#8220;no children&#8221; appears to imply that her children, if she had any, should support her; this is made explicit by NLT&#8217;s &#8220;and has no children to support her.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1082><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And a man, if he eats a holy thing in error&#8221; (see the Lev 4:2 not on &#8220;straying,&#8221; which is the term rendered &#8220;by mistake&#8221; here). </p>
<A NAME="2231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1083><b>sn</b> When a person trespassed in regard to something sacred to the <sc>Lord, reparation was to be made for the trespass, involving restitution of that which was violated plus one fifth of its value as a fine. It is possible that the restoration of the offering and the additional one fifth of its value were made as a monetary payment (see, e.g., B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 150). See the regulations for the &#8220;guilt offering&#8221; in Lev 5:16; 6:5 [5:24 HT] and the notes there. </p>
<A NAME="2232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1084><b>tn</b> Contextually, &#8220;They&#8221; could refer either to the people (v. 14a; cf. NRSV &#8220;No one&#8221;) or the priests (v. 14b; cf. NIV &#8220;The priests&#8221;), but the latter seems more likely (see J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 356, and B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 150). The priests were responsible to see that the portions of the offerings that were to be consumed by the priests as prebends did not become accessible to the people. Mistakes in this matter (cf. v. 14) would bring &#8220;guilt&#8221; on the people, requiring punishment (v. 16). </p>
<A NAME="2233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1085><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1461;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">herim</font>, rendered &#8220;contribute&#8221; here) is commonly used for setting aside portions of an offering (see, e.g., Lev 4:8-10 and R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 4:335-36). </p>
<A NAME="2234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1086><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the holy offerings of the sons of Israel which they contribute to the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The subject &#8220;they&#8221; here refers to the Israelites (&#8220;the sons of Israel&#8221;) which is the most immediate antecedent. To make this clear, the present translation has &#8220;the holy offerings which the Israelites contribute to the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1087><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;iniquity of guilt&#8221;; NASB &#8220;cause them to bear punishment for guilt.&#8221; The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avon</font>, &#8220;iniquity&#8221;) can designate either acts of iniquity or the penalty (i.e., punishment) for such acts. </p>
<A NAME="2236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1088><b>sn</b> That is, when the lay people eat portions of offerings that should have been eaten only by priests and those who belonged to priestly households. </p>
<A NAME="2237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1089><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Man, man.&#8221; The reduplication is a way of saying &#8220;any man&#8221; (cf. Lev 15:2; 17:3, etc.; see the distributive repetition of the noun in GKC 395-96 §123.<i>c</i>).</p>
<A NAME="2238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1090><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and from the foreigner [singular] in Israel.&#8221; Some medieval Hebrew <sc>mss, Smr, LXX, Syriac, and Vulgate add &#8220;who resides&#8221; after &#8220;foreigner&#8221;: &#8220;the foreigner who resides in Israel&#8221; (cf., e.g., Lev 20:2 above).</p>
<A NAME="2239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1091><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for your acceptance.&#8221; See Lev 1:3-4 above and the notes there.</p>
<A NAME="2240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1092><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all which in it [is] a flaw.&#8221; Note that the same term is used for physical flaws of people in Lev 21:17-24. Cf. KJV, ASV, NRSV &#8220;blemish&#8221;; NASB, NIV, TEV &#8220;defect&#8221;; NLT &#8220;with physical defects.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1093><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;not for acceptance shall it be for you&#8221;; NIV &#8220;it will not be accepted on your behalf&#8221; (NRSV and NLT both similar).</p>
<A NAME="2242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1094><b>tn</b> The meaning of the expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1508;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;&#1470;&#1504;&#1462;&#1491;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿfalle</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">-neder</font>) rendered here &#8220;for a special votive offering&#8221; is much debated. Some take it as an expression for fulfilling a vow, &#8220;to fulfill a vow&#8221; (e.g., <i>HALOT</i> 927-28 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1500;&#1488;</font> piel and NASB; cf. NAB, NRSV &#8220;in fulfillment of a vow&#8221;) or, alternatively, &#8220;to make a vow&#8221; or &#8220;for making a vow&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 928 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1500;&#1488;</font> piel [II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1500;&#1488;</font>]). Perhaps it refers to the making a special vow, from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pala</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to be wonderful, to be remarkable&#8221;); cf. J. Milgrom, <i>Numbers</i> (JPSTC), 44. B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> (JPSTC), 151 and 193, suggests that this is a special term for &#8220;setting aside a votive offering&#8221; (related to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">palah</font>, &#8220;to set aside&#8221;]). In general, the point of the expression seems to be that this sacrifice arises as a special gift to God out of special circumstances in the life of the worshiper.</p>
<A NAME="2243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1095><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for acceptance&#8221;; NAB &#8220;if it is to find acceptance.&#8221; </p>

<A NAME="2245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1097><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;a wart&#8221; (cf.

<A NAME="2246"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1098><b>sn</b> See the note on Lev 21:20 above. </p>
<A NAME="2247"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1099><b>sn</b> This term for offering &#8220;gift&#8221; is explained in the note on Lev 1:9. </p>
<A NAME="2248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1100><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And an ox.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2249"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1101><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and stunted&#8221; (see <i>HALOT</i> 1102 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1500;&#1496;</font>). </p>
<A NAME="2250"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1102><b>sn</b> The freewill offering was voluntary, so the regulations regarding it were more relaxed. Once a vow was made, the paying of it was not voluntary (see B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 151-52, for very helpful remarks on this verse). </p>
<A NAME="2251"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1103><b>sn</b> Compare Lev 21:20b. </p>

The Qumran Leviticus scroll (11QpaleoLev) has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1497;&#1502; &#1492;&#1501;</font>[&#8230;], in which case the restored participle would appear to be the same as Smr, but there is no <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet</font>) preposition before the pronoun, yielding &#8220;they are deformed&#8221; (see D. N. Freedman and K. A. Mathews, <i>The Paleo-Hebrew Leviticus Scroll</i>, 41 and the remarks in J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 358).</p>
<A NAME="2254"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1106><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;the care of&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text, but are implied. Although many modern English versions render &#8220;with its mother&#8221; (e.g., NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV, NLT), the literal phrase &#8220;under its mother&#8221; refers to the young animal nursing from its mother. Cf. KJV, ASV &#8220;it shall be seven days under the dam,&#8221; which would probably be misunderstood.</p>
