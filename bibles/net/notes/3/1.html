<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And he (the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>) called (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">vayyiqra</font>&#8217;) to Moses and the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> spoke (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">vayÿdabber</font>) to him from the tent of meeting.&#8221; The MT assumes &#8220;<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221; in the first clause but places it in the second clause (after &#8220;spoke&#8221;). This is somewhat awkward, especially in terms of English style; most English versions reverse this and place &#8220;<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221; in the first clause (right after &#8220;called&#8221;). The Syriac version does the same.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The best explanation for the MT of Lev 1:1 arises from its function as a transition from Exod 40 to Lev 1. The first clause, &#8220;And he (the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>) called to Moses,&#8221; links v. 1 back to Exod 40:35, &#8220;But Moses was not able to enter into the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled on it and the glory of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> had filled the tabernacle&#8221; (cf. J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:134). Exod 40:36-38 is a parenthetical explanation of the ongoing function of the cloud in leading the people through the wilderness. Since Moses could not enter the tent of meeting, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> &#8220;called&#8221; to him &#8220;from&#8221; the tent of meeting.</p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2><b>sn</b> The second clause of v. 1, &#8220;and the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> spoke to him from the tent of meeting, saying,&#8221; introduces the following discourse. This is a standard introductory formula (see, e.g., Exod 20:1; 25:1; 31:1; etc.). The combination of the first and second clauses is, therefore, &#8220;bulky&#8221; because of the way they happen to be juxtaposed in this transitional verse (J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 8). The first clause of v. 1 connects the book back to the end of the Book of Exodus while the second looks forward the ritual legislation that follows in Lev 1:2ff. There are two &#8220;Tents of Meeting&#8221;: the one that stood outside the camp (see, e.g., Exod 33:7) and the one that stood in the midst of the camp (Exod 40:2; Num 2:2ff) and served as the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s residence until the construction of the temple in the days of Solomon (Exod 27:21; 29:4; 1 Kgs 8:4; 2 Chr 5:5, etc.; cf. 2 Sam 7:6). Exod 40:35 uses both &#8220;tabernacle&#8221; and &#8220;tent of meeting&#8221; to refer to the same tent: &#8220;Moses could not enter the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and the glory of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> filled the tabernacle.&#8221; It is clear that &#8220;tent of meeting&#8221; in Lev 1:1 refers to the &#8220;tabernacle.&#8221; The latter term refers to the tent as a &#8220;residence,&#8221; while the former refers to it as a divinely appointed place of &#8220;meeting&#8221; between God and man (see R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 2:873-77 and 2:1130-34). This corresponds to the change in terms in Exod 40:35, where &#8220;tent of meeting&#8221; is used when referring to Moses&#8217; inability to enter the tent, but &#8220;tabernacle&#8221; when referring to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> taking up residence there in the form of the glory cloud. The quotation introduced here extends from Lev 1:2 through 3:17, and encompasses the burnt, grain, and peace offering regulations. Compare the notes on Lev 4:1; 5:14; and 6:1 [5:20 HT] below.</p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3><b>tn</b> &#8220;When&#8221; here translates the MT&#8217;s <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>, &#8220;if, when&#8221;), which regularly introduces main clauses in legislative contexts (see, e.g., Lev 2:1, 4; 4:2, etc.) in contrast to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>, &#8220;if&#8221;), which usually introduces subordinate sections (see, e.g., Lev 1:3, 10, 14; 2:5, 7, 14; 4:3, 13, etc.; cf. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> in Exod 21:2 and 7 as opposed to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> in vv. 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, and 11).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Lev 1:1-2 serves as a heading for Lev 1-3 (i.e., the basic regulations regarding the presentation of the burnt, grain, and peace offerings) and, at the same time, leads directly into the section on &#8220;burnt offerings&#8221; in Lev 1:3. In turn, Lev 1:3-17 divides into three subsections, all introduced by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> &#8220;if&#8221; (Lev 1:3-9, 10-13, and 14-17, respectively). Similar patterns are discernible throughout Lev 1:2-6:7 [5:26 HT].</p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a man, human being&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">adam</font>), which in this case refers to any person among &#8220;mankind,&#8221; male or female, since women could also bring such offerings (see, e.g., Lev 12:6-8; 15:29-30; cf. <i>HALOT</i> 14 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501;</font>); cf. NIV &#8220;any of you.&#8221;</p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>tn</b> The verb &#8220;presents&#8221; is cognate to the noun &#8220;offering&#8221; in v. 2 and throughout the book of Leviticus (both from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;</font> [<font face="Scholar">qrb</font>]). One could translate the verb &#8220;offers,&#8221; but this becomes awkward and, in fact, inaccurate in some passages. For example, in Lev 9:9 this verb is used for the presenting or giving of the blood to Aaron so that he could offer it to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. The blood is certainly not being &#8220;offered&#8221; as an offering to Aaron there.</p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=6><b>tn</b> The whole clause reads more literally, &#8220;A human being (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">adam</font>), if he brings from among you an offering to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.&#8221;</p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=7><b>tn</b> The shift to the second person plural verb here corresponds to the previous second person plural pronoun &#8220;among <i>you</i>.&#8221; It is distinct from the regular pattern of third person singular verbs throughout the rest of Lev 1-3. This too labels Lev 1:1-2 as an introduction to all of Lev 1-3, not just the burnt offering regulations in Lev 1 (J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:146; cf. note 3 above).</p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=8><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from the domesticated animal, from the herd, and from the flock.&#8221; It is clear from the subsequent division between animals from the &#8220;herd&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">baqar</font>, in Lev 1:3-9) and the &#8220;flock&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1465;&#1488;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tso</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">n</font>; see Lev 1:10-13) that the term for &#8220;domesticated animal&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1461;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bÿhemah</font>) is a general term meant to introduce the category of pastoral quadrupeds. The stronger disjunctive accent over <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1461;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> in the MT as well as the lack of a <i>vav </i>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) between it and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;</font> also suggest <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1461;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> is an overall category that includes both &#8220;herd&#8221; and &#8220;flock&#8221; quadrupeds. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The bird category (Lev 1:14-17) is not included in this introduction because bird offerings were, by and large, concessions to the poor (cf., e.g., Lev 5:7-10; 12:8; 14:21-32) and, therefore, not considered to be one of the primary categories of animal offerings.</p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=9><b>sn</b> The <i>burnt offering</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">olah</font>) was basically a &#8220;a gift of a soothing aroma to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221; (vv. 9, 13, 17). It could serve as a votive or freewill offering (e.g., Lev 22:18-20), an accompaniment of prayer and supplication (e.g., 1 Sam 7:9-10), part of the regular daily, weekly, monthly, and festival cultic pattern (e.g., Num 28-29), or to make atonement either alone (e.g., Lev 1:4; 16:24) or in combination with the grain offering (e.g., Lev 14:20) or sin offering (e.g., Lev 5:7; 9:7). See R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 4:996-1022.</p>
<a name="110"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=10><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;door&#8221; (so KJV, ASV); NASB &#8220;doorway&#8221; (likewise throughout the book of Leviticus). The translation &#8220;door&#8221; or &#8220;doorway&#8221; may suggest a framed door in a casing to the modern reader, but here the term refers to the entrance to a tent.</p>
<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>tn</b> The NIV correctly has &#8220;it&#8221; in the text, referring to the acceptance of the animal (cf., e.g., RSV, NEB, NLT), but &#8220;he&#8221; in the margin, referring to the acceptance of the offerer (cf. ASV, NASB, JB). The reference to a &#8220;flawless male&#8221; in the first half of this verse suggests that the issue here is the acceptability of the animal to make atonement <i>on behalf of </i>the offerer (Lev 1:4; cf. NRSV &#8220;for acceptance in your behalf&#8221;).</p>
<a name="112"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=12><b>tn</b> &#8220;To make atonement&#8221; is the standard translation of the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;</font>, (<font face="Scholar">kipper</font>); cf. however TEV &#8220;as a sacrifice to take away his sins&#8221; (CEV similar). The English word derives from a combination of &#8220;at&#8221; plus Middle English &#8220;one[ment],&#8221; referring primarily to reconciliation or reparation that is made in order to accomplish reconciliation. The primary meaning of the Hebrew verb, however, is &#8220;to wipe [something off (or on)]&#8221; (see esp. the goal of the sin offering, Lev 4, &#8220;to purge&#8221; the tabernacle from impurities), but in some cases it refers metaphorically to &#8220;wiping away&#8221; anything that might stand in the way of good relations by bringing a gift (see, e.g., Gen 32:20 [21 HT], &#8220;to appease; to pacify&#8221; as an illustration of this). The translation &#8220;make atonement&#8221; has been retained here because, ultimately, the goal of either purging or appeasing was to maintain a proper relationship between the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> (who dwelt in the tabernacle) and Israelites in whose midst the tabernacle was pitched (see R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 2:689-710 for a full discussion of the Hebrew word meaning &#8220;to make atonement&#8221; and its theological significance).</p>
<a name="113"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=13><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Then he&#8221;; the referent (the offerer) has been specified in the translation for clarity. The LXX has &#8220;they&#8221; rather than &#8220;he,&#8221; suggesting that the priests, not the offerer, were to slaughter the bull (cf. the notes on vv. 6a and 9a).</p>
<a name="114"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=14><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the son of the herd&#8221;; cf. KJV &#8220;bullock&#8221;; NASB, NIV &#8220;young bull.&#8221;</p>

NRSV) is better than &#8220;sprinkle,&#8221; which is the common English translation of this verb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1511;</font>, <font face="Scholar">zaraq</font>; see, e.g., KJV, NASB, NIV, NLT). &#8220;Sprinkle&#8221; is not strong enough (contrast <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1494;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">nazah</font>], which does indeed mean &#8220;to sprinkle&#8221; or &#8220;to splatter&#8221;; cf. Lev 4:6).</p>
<a name="116"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=16><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Then he&#8221;; the referent (the offerer) has been specified in the translation for clarity. The LXX and Smr have &#8220;they&#8221; rather than &#8220;he&#8221; in both halves of this verse, suggesting that the priests, not the offerer, were to skin and cut the carcass of the bull into pieces (cf. the notes on vv. 5a and 9a).</p>
<a name="117"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=17><b>tc</b> A few medieval Hebrew <span class="smallcaps">mss</span>, Smr, LXX, Syriac, and <i>Tg. Onq. </i>have plural &#8220;priests&#8221; here (cf. 1:5, 8) rather than the MT singular &#8220;priest&#8221; (cf. NAB). The singular &#8220;priest&#8221; would mean (1) Aaron, the (high) priest, or (2) the officiating priest, as in Lev 1:9 (cf. 6:10 [3 HT], etc.). &#8220;The sons of Aaron&#8221; is probably a textual corruption caused by conflation with Lev 1:5, 8 (cf. the remarks in J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 13).</p>
<a name="118"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=18><b>tc</b> A few Hebrew <span class="smallcaps">mss</span>, Smr, LXX, Syriac, and <i>Tg. Onq. </i>have the conjunction &#8220;and&#8221; before &#8220;the head,&#8221; which would suggest the rendering &#8220;and the head and the suet&#8221; rather than the rendering of the MT here, &#8220;with the head and the suet.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> &#8220;Suet&#8221; is the specific term used for the hard, fatty tissues found around the kidneys of sheep and cattle. A number of modern English versions have simplified this to &#8220;fat&#8221; (e.g., NIV, NCV, TEV, CEV, NLT).</p>
<a name="119"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=19><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;on the wood, which is on the fire, which is on the altar.&#8221; Cf. NIV &#8220;on the burning wood&#8221;; NLT &#8220;on the wood fire.&#8221;</p>
<a name="120"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=20><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Finally, he&#8221;; the referent (the offerer) has been specified in the translation for clarity. Once again, the MT assigns the preparation of the offering (here the entrails and legs) to the offerer because it did not bring him into direct contact with the altar, but reserves the actual placing of the sacrifice on the altar for the officiating priest (cf. the notes on vv. 5a and 6a).</p>
<a name="121"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=21><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;toward the altar,&#8221; but the so-called locative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hey</font>) attached to the word for &#8220;altar&#8221; can indicate the place where something is or happens (GKC 250 §90.<i>d</i> and GKC 373-74 §118.<i>g</i>; cf. also J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:161). This is a standard way of expressing &#8220;on/at the altar&#8221; with the verb &#8220;to offer up in smoke&#8221; (Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1496;&#1463;&#1512;</font> [<font face="Scholar">qatar</font>]; cf. also Exod 29:13, 18, 25; Lev 1:9, 13, 15, 17; 2:2, etc.).</p>
<a name="122"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=22><b>tc</b> A few Hebrew <span class="smallcaps">mss </span>and possibly the Leningrad B19a <span class="smallcaps">ms </span>itself (the basis of the <i>BHS</i> Hebrew text of the MT), under an apparent erasure, plus Smr, LXX, Syriac, and <i>Tg. Ps.-J.</i> suggest that Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hu</font>&#8217;, translated as &#8220;it is&#8221;) should be added here as in vv. 13 and 17. Whether or not the text should be changed, the meaning is the same as in vv. 13 and 17, so it has been included in the translation here.</p>
<a name="123"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=23><b>sn</b> The standard English translation of &#8220;gift&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">isheh</font>) is &#8220;an offering [made] by fire&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV). It is based on a supposed etymological relationship to the Hebrew word for &#8220;fire&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">esh</font>) and is still maintained in many versions (e.g., NIV, RSV, NRSV, NLT; B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 7-8). For various reasons, including the fact that some offerings referred to by this term are not burned on the altar (see, e.g., Lev 24:9), it is probably better to understand the term to mean &#8220;gift&#8221; (J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 22) or &#8220;food gift&#8221; (&#8220;food offering&#8221; in NEB and TEV; J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:161-62). See R. E.

<a name="128"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=28><b>tn</b> The action here seems to involve both a twisting action, breaking the neck of the bird and severing its vertebrae, as well as pinching or nipping the skin to sever the head from the main body. Cf. NASB, NRSV &#8220;wring off its head&#8221;; NAB &#8220;snap its head loose&#8221;; NLT &#8220;twist off its head.&#8221;</p>
<a name="129"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=29><b>tn</b> Many English versions have &#8220;it&#8221; here, referring to the head of the bird, which the priest immediately tossed on the altar fire. However, &#8220;it&#8221; could be misunderstood to refer to the bird&#8217;s body, so &#8220;head&#8221; is repeated in the present translation for clarity. As the following lines show, certain things needed to be done to the body of the bird before it could be placed on the altar.</p>
