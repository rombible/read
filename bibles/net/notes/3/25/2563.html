<A NAME="2563"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=1274><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And which he shall redeem from the Levites shall go out, sale of house and city, his property in the jubilee.&#8221; Although the end of this verse is clear, the first part is notoriously difficult. There are five main views. (1) The first clause of the verse actually attaches to the previous verse, and refers to the fact that their houses retain a perpetual right of redemption (v. 32b), &#8220;which any of the Levites may exercise&#8221; (v. 33a; J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 418, 421). (2) It refers to property that one Levite sells to another Levite, which is then redeemed by still another Levite (v. 33a). In such cases, the property reverts to the original Levite owner in the jubilee year (v. 33b; G. J. Wenham, <i>Leviticus</i> [NICOT], 321). (3) It refers to houses in a city that had come to be declared as a Levitical city but had original non-Levitical owners. Once the city was declared to belong to the Levites, however, an owner could only sell his house to a Levite, and he could only redeem it back from a Levite up until the time of the first jubilee after the city was declared to be a Levitical city. In this case the first part of the verse would be translated, &#8220;Such property as may be redeemed from the Levites&#8221; (NRSV, NJPS). At the first jubilee, however, all such houses became the property of the Levites (v. 33b; P. J. Budd, <i>Leviticus</i> [NCBC], 353). (4) It refers to property &#8220;which is <i>appropriated</i> from the Levites&#8221; (not &#8220;<i>redeemed</i> from the Levites,&#8221; v. 33a) by those who have bought it or taken it as security for debts owed to them by Levites who had fallen on bad times. Again, such property reverts back to the original Levite owners at the jubilee (B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 177). (5) It simply refers to the fact that a Levite has the option of redeeming his house (i.e., the prefix form of the verb is taken to be subjunctive, &#8220;may or might redeem&#8221;), which he had to sell because he had fallen into debt or perhaps even become destitute. Even if he never gained the resources to do so, however, it would still revert to him in the jubilee year. The present translation is intended to reflect this latter view. </p>
