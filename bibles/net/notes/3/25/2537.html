<A NAME="2537"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1248><b>tn</b> The term rendered &#8220;without reclaim&#8221; means that the land has been bought for the full price and is, therefore, not subject to reclaim under any circumstances. This was not to be done with land in ancient Israel (contrast the final full sale of houses in v. 30; see the evidence cited in B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 174). </p>
