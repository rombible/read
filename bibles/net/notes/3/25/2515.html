<A NAME="2515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1226><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;A jubilee that shall be to you.&#8221; Although there has been some significant debate about the original meaning of the Hebrew word translated &#8220;jubilee&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;&#1461;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yovel</font>; see the summary in J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 434), the term most likely means &#8220;ram&#8221; and can refer also to a &#8220;ram&#8217;s horn.&#8221; The fiftieth year would, therefore, be called the &#8220;jubilee&#8221; because of the associated sounding of the &#8220;ram&#8217;s horn&#8221; (see B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 172, and the literature cited there). </p>
