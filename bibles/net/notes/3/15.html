<A NAME="151"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=708><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Man man.&#8221; The reduplication is a way of saying &#8220;any man&#8221; (cf. Lev 17:3; 22:18, etc.; see the distributive repetition of the noun in GKC 395-96 §123.<i>c</i>).</p>
<A NAME="152"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=709><b>tn</b> The term &#8220;discharge&#8221; actually means &#8220;to flow,&#8221; whether referring to a full flow as at a spring of water (Ps 78:20 and parallels) or in reference to the promised land as &#8220;a land <i>flowing</i> with milk and honey&#8221; (Exod 3:8 and parallels).</p>
<A NAME="153"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=710><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;man, man when there is a discharge from his flesh.&#8221; The repetition of the word &#8220;man&#8221; is distributive, meaning &#8220;any [or &#8220;every&#8221;] man&#8221; (GKC 395-96 §123.<i>c</i>). It is well-recognized that the term &#8220;flesh&#8221; (i.e., &#8220;body&#8221;) in this chapter refers regularly and euphemistically to the male and female genital members or areas of the body (<i>HALOT</i> 164 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1512;</font> 5.b; see also, e.g., B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 93). The euphemism has been retained in this translation since it is, in fact, intended in the Hebrew text. Some English versions partially remove the euphemism (e.g., NAB &#8220;from his private parts&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;from his member&#8221;) while some remove it completely (e.g., NLT &#8220;a genital discharge&#8221;; TEV &#8220;from his penis&#8221;; CEV &#8220;with an infected penis&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="154"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=711><b>tn</b> The LXX has &#8220;this <i>the law of</i> his uncleanness&#8230;&#8221; (cf. v. 32 and compare, e.g., 13:59; 14:2, 56). </p>
<A NAME="155"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=712><b>tc</b> Smr, LXX, and the Paleo-Hebrew Leviticus Scroll from Qumran (11QpaleoLev; Fragment G contains Lev 14:52-15:5 and 16:2-4, and agrees with the LXX of Lev 15:3b) are in essential (although not complete) agreement against the MT in Lev 15:3b and are to be preferred in this case. The shorter MT text has probably arisen due to a lengthy haplography. See K. A. Mathews, &#8220;The Leviticus Scroll (11QpaleoLev) and the Text of the Hebrew Bible,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 48 (1986): 177-78, 198; D. N. Freedman, &#8220;Variant Readings in the Leviticus Scroll from Qumran Cave 11,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 36 (1974): 528-29; D. N. Freedman and K. A. Mathews, <i>The Paleo-Hebrew Leviticus Scroll</i>, 32. The MT of Lev 15:3 reads: &#8220;Now this is his uncleanness in [regard to] his discharge &#8211; whether his body secretes his discharge or blocks his discharge, this is his uncleanness.&#8221; Smr adds after MT&#8217;s &#8220;blocks his discharge&#8221; the following: &#8220;he is unclean; all the days that his body has a discharge or his body blocks his discharge, this is his uncleanness.&#8221; Thus, the MT appears to skip from Smr <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1502;&#1488; &#1492;&#1493;&#1488;</font> &#8220;he is unclean&#8221; in the middle of the verse to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1488;</font>/<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1502;&#1488;&#1514;&#1493; &#1492;&#1493;</font> &#8220;this is his uncleanness&#8221; at the end of the verse, leaving out &#8220;he is unclean; all the days that his body has a discharge or his body blocks his discharge&#8221; (cf. the <i>BHS</i> footnote). 11Q1 (paleoLev<sup>a</sup> frag. G) is indeed fragmentary, but it does have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1502;&#1497; &#1494;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1493; &#1499;&#1500;</font> &#8220;&#8230;in him, all the days of the fl[ow],&#8221; supporting Smr and LXX tradition. The LXX adds after MT &#8220;blocks his discharge&#8221; the following: &#8220;all the days of the flow of his body, by which his body is affected by the flow,&#8221; followed by &#8220;it is his uncleanness&#8221; (i.e., the last two words of the MT). </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The contrast between the dripping or flowing from the male sexual member as opposed to there being a blockage is important. One might not understand that even though a blockage actually causes a lack of discharge, it is still unclean.</p>
<A NAME="156"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=713><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;it is his uncleanness,&#8221; but the last clause recapitulates the effect of the first clause in this verse, both of which introduce the regulations for such uncleanness in the following verses. In other words, whether his discharge flows from his penis or is blocked in it, he is still unclean and must proceed according to the following regulations (vv. 4ff). </p>
<A NAME="157"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=714><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;All the bed which the man with a discharge sits on it shall be unclean&#8221;; cf. NLT &#8220;Any bedding.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="158"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=715><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and all the vessel which he sits on it shall be unclean&#8221;; NASB &#8220;everything on which he sits.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="159"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=716><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And a man who touches in his bed&#8221;; NLT &#8220;touch the man&#8217;s bedding.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=717><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until the evening&#8221; (cf. also vv. 6-8, 10-11, etc.). </p>
<A NAME="1511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=718><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And the one who touches in the flesh.&#8221; In this instance, &#8220;flesh&#8221; (or &#8220;body&#8221;) probably refers literally to any part of the body, not the genitals specifically (see the discussion in J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:914). </p>
<A NAME="1512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=719><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And if the man with a discharge spits in the clean one.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=720><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term for &#8220;means of riding&#8221; is a cognate noun from the verb &#8220;ride&#8221; later in this verse. It refers to anything on which one may ride without the feet touching the ground including, for example, a saddle, a (saddle) blanket, or a seat on a chariot (see, e.g., J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:916).</p>
<A NAME="1514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=721><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;which shall be under him.&#8221; The verb is perhaps a future perfect, &#8220;which shall have been.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=722><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;them&#8221;; the referent (the previously mentioned items which were under the unclean person) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=723><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And all who the man with the discharge touches in him and his hands he has not rinsed in water.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=724><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kÿli</font>) can mean &#8220;vessel&#8221; (v. 12a) or &#8220;utensil, implement, article&#8221; (v. 12b). An article of clay would refer to a vessel or container of some sort, while one made of wood would refer to some kind of tool or instrument. </p>
<A NAME="1518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=725><b>tn</b> For the expression &#8220;fresh water&#8221; see the note on Lev 14:5 above. </p>
<A NAME="1519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=726><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from the sons of the pigeon,&#8221; referring either to &#8220;young pigeons&#8221; or &#8220;various species of pigeon&#8221; (contrast J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:168 with J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 14; cf. Lev 1:14 and esp. 5:7-10). </p>
<A NAME="1520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=727><b>tc</b> The MT has the Qal form of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bo</font>&#8217;) &#8220;to come&#8221; here, but the LXX (followed generally by the Syriac and <i>Tg. Ps.-J.</i>) reflects the Hiphil form of the same verb, &#8220;to bring&#8221; as in v. 29 below. In v. 29, however, there is no additional clause &#8220;and give them to the priest,&#8221; so the Hiphil is necessary in that context while it is not necessary here in v. 14.</p>
<A NAME="1521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=728><b>sn</b> See the note on Lev 4:3 regarding the term &#8220;sin offering.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1522"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=729><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the priest shall make them one a sin offering and the one a burnt offering.&#8221; See the note on Lev 1:3 regarding the &#8220;burnt offering.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=730><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And the priest.&#8221; The Hebrew conjunction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vav</font>, &#8220;and&#8221;) can be considered to have resultative force here.</p>
<A NAME="1524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=731><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from&#8221;; see the note on 4:26.</p>
<A NAME="1525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=732><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And a man when a lying of seed goes out from him&#8221;; KJV, ASV &#8220;any man&#8217;s seed of copulation&#8221;; NIV, NRSV, TEV, NLT &#8220;an emission of semen.&#8221; </p>

<A NAME="1529"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=736><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;blood shall be her discharge in her flesh.&#8221; The term &#8220;flesh&#8221; here refers euphemistically to the female sexual area (cf. the note on v. 2 above). </p>
<A NAME="1530"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=737><b>tn</b> See the note on Lev 12:2 and R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE </i>1:925-27. </p>
<A NAME="1531"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=738><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and if on the bed it (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hu</font>&#8217;) is or on the vessel which she sits on it, when he touches it&#8230;.&#8221; The translation and meaning of this verse is a subject of much debate in the commentaries (see the summary in J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:938-40). It is difficult to determine what <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</font> refers to, whether it means &#8220;he&#8221; referring to the one who does the touching, &#8220;it&#8221; for the furniture or the seat in v. 22, &#8220;she&#8221; referring to the woman herself (see Smr <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1497;&#1488;</font> rather than <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1488;</font>), or perhaps anything that was lying on the furniture or the bed of vv. 21-22. The latter view is taken here (cf. J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 202).</p>
<A NAME="1532"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=739><b>tn</b> The MT accent suggest that &#8220;when he touches it&#8221; goes with the preceding line, but it seems to be better to take it as an introduction to what follows (see J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 202).</p>
<A NAME="1533"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=740><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and if a man indeed lies with her and her menstrual impurity is on him.&#8221; </p>
