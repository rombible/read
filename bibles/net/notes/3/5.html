<A NAME="51"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=144><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And a person when he sins.&#8221; Most English versions translate this as the protasis of a conditional clause: &#8220;if a person sins&#8221; (NASB, NIV).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The same expression occurs in Lev 4:2 where it introduces sins done &#8220;by straying unintentionally from any of the commandments of the <sc>Lord which must not be done&#8221; (see the notes there). Lev 5:1-13 is an additional section of sin offering regulations directed at violations other than those referred to by this expression in Lev 4:2 (see esp. 5:1-6), and expanding on the offering regulations for the common person in Lev 4:27-35 with concessions to the poor common person (5:7-13). </p>
<A NAME="52"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=145><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;against one who fails to testify&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text, but have been supplied to make sense of the remark about the &#8220;curse&#8221; (&#8220;imprecation&#8221; or &#8220;oath&#8221;; cf. ASV &#8220;adjuration&#8221;; NIV &#8220;public charge&#8221;) for the modern reader. For the interpretation of this verse reflected in the present translation see J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>(AB), 1:292-97.</p>
<A NAME="53"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=146><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;what had happened&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text, but are implied.</p>
<A NAME="54"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=147><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and hears a voice of curse, and he is a witness or he saw or he knew, if he does not declare.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="55"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=148><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he shall bear his iniquity.&#8221; The rendering &#8220;bear the punishment (for the iniquity)&#8221; reflects the use of the word &#8220;iniquity&#8221; to refer to the punishment for iniquity (cf. NRSV, NLT &#8220;subject to punishment&#8221;). It is sometimes referred to as the consequential use of the term (cf. Lev 5:17; 7:18; 10:17; etc.).</p>
<A NAME="56"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=149><b>tc</b> The insertion of the words &#8220;when there is&#8221; is a reflection of the few Hebrew <sc>mss, Smr, and LXX that have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>, &#8220;when, if&#8221;; cf. vv. 3 and esp. 4) rather than the MT&#8217;s <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asher</font>, &#8220;who&#8221;). Many English versions render this as a conditional clause (&#8220;if&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="57"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=150><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;ceremonially&#8221; has been supplied in the translation to clarify that the uncleanness involved is ritual or ceremonial in nature.</p>
<A NAME="58"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=151><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and it is hidden from him,&#8221; meaning that the person who contracted the ceremonial uncleanness was not aware at the time what had happened, but later found out that he had become ceremonially unclean. This same phrase occurs again in both vv. 3 and 4.</p>
<A NAME="59"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=152><b>sn</b> Lev 5:2-3 are parallel laws of uncleanness (contracted from animals and people, respectively), and both seem to assume that the contraction of uncleanness was originally unknown to the person (vv. 2 and 3) but became known to him or her at a later time (v. 3; i.e., &#8220;has come to know&#8221; in v. 3 is to be assumed for v. 2 as well). Uncleanness itself did not make a person &#8220;guilty&#8221; unless he or she failed to handle it according to the normal purification regulations (see, e.g., &#8220;wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean till evening,&#8221; Lev 15:5 NIV; cf. Lev 11:39-40; 15:5-12, 16-24; Num 19, etc.). The problem here in Lev 5:2-3 is that, because the person had not been aware of his or her uncleanness, he or she had incurred guilt for not carrying out these regular procedures, and it would now be too late for that. Thus, the unclean person needs to bring a sin offering to atone for the contamination caused by his or her neglect of the purity regulations. </p>
<A NAME="510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=153><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;or if he touches uncleanness of mankind to any of his uncleanness which he becomes unclean in it.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=154><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to speak thoughtlessly&#8221;; cf. NAB &#8220;rashly utters an oath.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=155><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and is guilty to one from these,&#8221; probably referring here to any of &#8220;these&#8221; things about which one might swear a thoughtless oath (J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 45), with the word &#8220;oath&#8221; supplied in the translation for clarity. Another possibility is that &#8220;to one from these&#8221; is a dittography from v. 5 (cf. the note on v. 5a), and that v. 4 ends with &#8220;and is guilty&#8221; like vv. 2 and 3 (J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:300).</p>
<A NAME="513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=156><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and it shall happen when he becomes guilty to one from these,&#8221; referring to any of &#8220;these&#8221; possible transgressions in Lev 5:1-4. <i>Tg. Onq.</i>, the original Greek translation, and the Latin Vulgate omit this clause, possibly due to homoioteleuton because of the repetition of &#8220;to one from these&#8221; from the end of v. 4 in v. 5a (cf. the note on v. 4b).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> What all the transgressions in Lev 5:1-4 have in common is that the time is past for handling the original situation properly (i.e., testifying in court, following purity regulations, or fulfilling an oath), so now the person has become guilty and needs to follow corrective sacrificial procedures. </p>
<A NAME="514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=157><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;which he sinned on it&#8221;; cf. ASV &#8220;confess that wherein he hath sinned&#8221;; NCV &#8220;must tell how he sinned.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=158><b>tn</b> In this context the word for &#8220;guilt&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">asham</font>) refers to the &#8220;penalty&#8221; for incurring guilt, the so-called consequential <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:303; cf. the note on Lev 5:1). </p>
<A NAME="516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=159><b>sn</b> The focus of sin offering &#8220;atonement&#8221; was purging impurities from the tabernacle (see the note on Lev 1:4). </p>

<A NAME="518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=161><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and if his hand does not reach enough of a flock animal&#8221; (see the note on v. 11 below). The term translated &#8220;animal from the flock&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">seh</font>) is often translated &#8220;lamb&#8221; (e.g., KJV, NASB, NIV, NCV) or &#8220;sheep&#8221; (e.g., NRSV, TEV, NLT), but it clearly includes either a sheep or a goat here (cf. v. 6), referring to the smaller pasture animals as opposed to the larger ones (i.e., cattle; cf. 4:3). Some English versions use the more generic &#8220;animal&#8221; (e.g., NAB, CEV).</p>
<A NAME="519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=162><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he shall bring his guilt which he sinned,&#8221; which is an abbreviated form of Lev 5:6, &#8220;and he shall bring his [penalty for] guilt to the <sc>Lord for his sin which he committed.&#8221; The words &#8220;for his sin&#8221; have been left out in v. 7, and &#8220;to the <sc>Lord&#8221; has been moved so that it follows the mention of the birds.</p>
<A NAME="520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=163><b>tn</b> See the note on Lev 1:14 above.</p>

<A NAME="522"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=165><b>sn</b> The action seems to involve both a twisting action, breaking the neck of the bird and severing its vertebrae, as well as pinching or nipping the skin, but in this case not severing the head from the main body (note the rest of this verse).</p>
<A NAME="523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=166><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he shall not divide [it]&#8221; (see J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:305).</p>

Lev 4:6, 17). Contrast &#8220;splash&#8221; in Lev 1:5, etc. (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1511;</font>, <font face="Scholar">zaraq</font>). </p>

<A NAME="526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=169><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;bird&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but is supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>

<A NAME="534"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=177><b>sn</b> <i>A tenth of an ephah</i> would be about 2.3 liters, one day&#8217;s ration for a single person (J.

NCV &#8220;about two quarts&#8221;; TEV &#8220;one kilogramme&#8221;; CEV &#8220;two pounds.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="535"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=178><b>tn</b> See the note on Lev 2:1 above. </p>

It was probably intended to call to mind (i.e., memorialize) before the <sc>Lord the reason for the presentation of the particular offering (see the remarks in R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 1:335-39).</p>
<A NAME="537"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=180><b>sn</b> The focus of sin offering &#8220;atonement&#8221; was purging impurities from the tabernacle (see the note on Lev 1:4). </p>

<A NAME="542"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=185><b>sn</b> The quotation introduced here extends from Lev 5:14 through 5:19, encompassing the first main section of guilt offering regulations. Compare the notes on Lev 1:1; 4:1; and 6:1 [5:20 HT].</p>
<A NAME="543"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=186><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;trespasses a trespass&#8221; (verb and direct object from the same Hebrew root, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ma</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>); cf. NIV &#8220;commits a violation.&#8221; The word refers to some kind of overstepping of the boundary between that which is common (i.e., available for common use by common people) and that which is holy (i.e., to be used only for holy purposes because it has been consecrated to the <sc>Lord, see further below). See the note on Lev 10:10. </p>
<A NAME="544"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=187><b>tn</b> See Lev 4:2 above for a note on &#8220;straying.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="545"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=188><b>sn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from the holy things of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The Hebrew expression here has the same structure as Lev 4:2, &#8220;from any of the commandments of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The latter introduces the sin offering regulations and the former the guilt offering regulations. The sin offering deals with violations of &#8220;any of the commandments,&#8221; whereas the guilt offering focuses specifically on violations of regulations regarding &#8220;holy things&#8221; (i.e., things that have been consecrated to the <sc>Lord; see the full discussion in J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:320-27). </p>
<A NAME="546"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=189><b>tn</b> Here the word for &#8220;guilt&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">asham</font>) refers to the &#8220;penalty&#8221; for incurring guilt, the so-called consequential use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asham</font>; see J.

Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:326-27). Others still maintain the view that it refers to the value of the ram that was offered (see, e.g., NIV &#8220;of the proper value in silver, according to the sanctuary shekel&#8221;; also NAB, NLT; J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 72-73, 81). </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The <i>sanctuary</i> <i>shekel</i> was about 10 grams (= ca. two fifths of an ounce; J. E. Shepherd, <i>NIDOTTE </i>4:237-38).</p>
<A NAME="548"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=191><b>tn</b> The word for &#8220;guilt offering&#8221; (sometimes translated &#8220;reparation offering&#8221;) is the same as &#8220;guilt&#8221; earlier in the verse (rendered there &#8220;[penalty for] guilt&#8221;). One can tell which is intended only by the context.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The primary purpose of the <i>guilt offering</i> was to &#8220;atone&#8221; (see the note on Lev 1:4 above) for &#8220;trespassing&#8221; on the <sc>Lord&#8217;s &#8220;holy things&#8221; (see later in this verse) or the property of others in the community (Lev 6:1-7 [5:20-26 HT]; 19:20-22; Num 5:5-10). It was closely associated with reconsecration of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s sacred things or his sacred people (see, e.g., Lev 14:12-18; Num 6:11b-12). Moreover, there was usually an associated reparation made for the trespass, including restitution of that which was violated plus one fifth of its value as a fine (Lev 5:16; 6:5 [5:24 HT]). See R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 1:557-66. </p>

This portion of v. 17 is especially difficult. The translation offered here suggests (as in many other English versions) that the offender did not originally know that he had violated the <sc>Lord&#8217;s commandments, but then came to know it and dealt with it accordingly (cf. the corresponding sin offering section in Lev 5:1-4). Another possibility is that it refers to a situation where a person suspects that he violated something although he does not recollect it. Thus, he brings a guilt offering for his suspected violation (J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:331-34, 361-63). See also R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 1:561-62. </p>
