<A NAME="1811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=871><b>tn</b> The verbal negative here is the same as that used in the Ten Commandments (Exod 20:4-5, 7, 13-17). It suggests permanent prohibition rather than a simple negative command and could, therefore, be rendered &#8220;must not&#8221; here and throughout the following section as it is in vv. 3-4 above. </p>
