<A NAME="1830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=890><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And from your seed you shall not give to cause to pass over to Molech.&#8221; Smr (cf. also the LXX) has &#8220;to cause to serve&#8221; rather than &#8220;to cause to pass over.&#8221; For detailed remarks on Molech and Molech worship see N. H. Snaith, <i>Leviticus and Numbers</i> (NCBC), 87-88; P. J. Budd, <i>Leviticus</i> (NCBC), 259-60; and J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> (WBC), 333-37, and the literature cited there. It could refer to either human sacrifice or a devotion of children to some sort of service of Molech, perhaps of a sexual sort (cf. Lev 20:2-5; 2 Kgs 23:10, etc.). The inclusion of this prohibition against Molech worship here may be due to some sexual connection of this kind, or perhaps simply to the lexical link between <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1462;&#1512;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zera</font>&#8217;) meaning &#8220;seed, semen&#8221; in v. 20 but &#8220;offspring&#8221; in v. 21.</p>
