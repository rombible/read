<A NAME="189"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=869><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to uncover [her] nakedness&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV, NASB, NRSV), which is clearly euphemistic for sexual intercourse (see J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 282, and B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 119). This expression occurs a number of times in the following context and is generally translated &#8220;have sexual intercourse with [someone],&#8221; although in the case of the father mentioned in the following verse the expression may be connected to the shame or disgrace that would belong to the father whose wife&#8217;s sexuality is violated by his son. See the note on the word &#8220;mother&#8221; in v. 7.</p>
