<A NAME="1823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=883><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;You must not uncover the nakedness of both a woman and her daughter; the daughter of her son and the daughter of her daughter you must not take to uncover her nakedness.&#8221; Translating &#8220;her&#8221; as &#8220;them&#8221; provides consistency in the English. In this kind of context, &#8220;take&#8221; means to &#8220;take in marriage&#8221; (cf. also v. 18). The LXX and Syriac have &#8220;their nakedness,&#8221; referring to the nakedness of the woman&#8217;s granddaughters, rather than the nakedness of the woman herself. </p>
