<A NAME="1812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=872><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The nakedness of your father and [i.e., even] the nakedness of your mother you shall not uncover.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Commentators suggest that the point of referring to the father&#8217;s nakedness is that the mother&#8217;s sexuality belongs to the father and is forbidden to the son on that account (see B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 120, and J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 294). The expression may, however, derive from the shame of nakedness when exposed. If one exposes his mother&#8217;s nakedness to himself it is like openly exposing the father&#8217;s nakedness (cf. Gen 9:22-23 with the background of Gen 2:25 and 3:7, 21). The same essential construction is used in v. 10 where the latter explanation makes more sense than the former. </p>
