<A NAME="101"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=378><b>tn</b> Although it has been used elsewhere in this translation as an English variation from the ubiquitous use of <i>vav </i>in Hebrew, in this instance &#8220;then&#8221; as a rendering for <i>vav </i>is intended to show that the Nadab and Abihu catastrophe took place on the inauguration day described in Lev 9. The tragic incident in Lev 10 happened in close temporal connection to the <sc>Lord&#8217;s fire that consumed the offerings at the end of Lev 9. Thus, for example, the &#8220;sin offering&#8221; male goat referred to in Lev 10:16-19 is the very one referred to in Lev 9:15.</p>
<A NAME="102"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=379><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;strange fire&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473; &#1494;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">esh zarah</font>) seems imprecise (cf. NAB &#8220;profane fire&#8221;; NIV &#8220;unauthorized fire&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;unholy fire&#8221;; NLT &#8220;a different kind of fire&#8221;) and has been interpreted numerous ways (see the helpful summary in J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 132-33). The infraction may have involved any of the following or a combination thereof: (1) using coals from someplace other than the burnt offering altar (i.e., &#8220;unauthorized coals&#8221; according to J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:598; cf. Lev 16:12 and cf. &#8220;unauthorized person&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1494;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ish zar</font>) in Num 16:40 [17:5 HT], NASB &#8220;layman&#8221;), (2) using the wrong kind of incense (cf. the Exod 30:9 regulation against &#8220;strange incense&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1456;&#1496;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514; &#1494;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qÿtoreh zarah</font>) on the incense altar and the possible connection to Exod 30:34-38), (3) performing an incense offering at an unprescribed time (B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 59), or (4) entering the Holy of Holies at an inappropriate time (Lev 16:1-2).</p>
<A NAME="103"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=380><b>tn</b> See the note on 9:24a. </p>
<A NAME="104"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=381><b>tn</b> The Niphal verb of the Hebrew root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qadash</font>) can mean either &#8220;to be treated as holy&#8221; (so here, e.g., BDB 873 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font>, LXX, NASB, and NEB) or &#8220;to show oneself holy&#8221; (so here, e.g., <i>HALOT</i> 1073 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew"> &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;</font>nif.1, NIV, NRSV, NLT; J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:595, 601-3; and J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 133-34). The latter rendering seems more likely here since, in the immediate context, the <sc>Lord himself had indeed shown himself to be holy by the way he responded to the illegitimate incense offering of Nadab and Abihu. They had not treated the <sc>Lord as holy, so the <sc>Lord acted on his own behalf to show that he was indeed holy. </p>
<A NAME="105"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=382><b>tn</b> In this context the Niphal of the Hebrew root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1461;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kaved</font>) can mean &#8220;to be honored&#8221; (e.g., NASB and NIV here), &#8220;be glorified&#8221; (ASV, NRSV and NLT here), or &#8220;glorify oneself, show one&#8217;s glory&#8221; (cf. NAB; e.g., specifically in this verse <i>HALOT</i> 455 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew"> &#1499;&#1489;&#1491;</font>nif.3; J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:595, 603-4; and J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 126, 134). Comparing this clause with the previous one (see the note above), the point may be that when the <sc>Lord shows himself to be holy as he has done in 10:1-2, this results in him being honored (i.e., reverenced, feared, treated with respect) among the people. This suggests the passive rendering. It is possible, however, that one should use the reflexive rendering here as in the previous clause. If so, the passage means that the <sc>Lord showed both his holiness and his glory in one outbreak against Nadab and Abihu. </p>
<A NAME="106"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=383><b>tc</b> Smr has &#8220;you must not&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;) rather than the MT&#8217;s &#8220;do not&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>; cf. the following negative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;, in the MT).</p>
<A NAME="107"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=384><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;do not let free your heads.&#8221; Some have taken this to mean, &#8220;do not take off your headgear&#8221; (cf. NAB, NASB), but it probably also involves leaving one&#8217;s hair unkempt as a sign of mourning (see J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:608-9; cf. NCV, TEV, CEV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="108"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=385><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;shall weep [for] the burning which the <sc>Lord has burned&#8221;; NIV &#8220;may mourn for those the Lord has destroyed by fire.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="109"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=386><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;a perpetual statute for your generations&#8221;; NAB &#8220;a perpetual ordinance&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;a statute forever&#8221;; NLT &#8220;a permanent law.&#8221; The Hebrew grammar here suggests that the last portion of v. 9 functions as both a conclusion to v. 9 and an introduction to vv. 10-11. It is a pivot clause, as it were. Thus, it was a &#8220;perpetual statute&#8221; to not drink alcoholic beverages when ministering in the tabernacle, but it was also a &#8220;perpetual statue&#8221; to distinguish between holy and profane and unclean and clean (v. 10) as well as to teach the children of Israel all such statutes (v. 11).</p>
<A NAME="1010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=387><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and,&#8221; but regarding the translation &#8220;as well as,&#8221; see the note at the end of v. 9. </p>
<A NAME="1011"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=388><b>sn</b> The two pairs of categories in this verse refer to: (1) the <i>status</i> of a person, place, thing, or time &#8211; &#8220;holy&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1465;&#1491;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font>, <font face="Scholar">qodesh</font>) versus &#8220;common&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khol</font>); as opposed to (2) the <i>condition</i> of a person, place, or thing &#8211; &#8220;unclean&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1464;&#1502;&#1461;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tame</font>&#8217;) versus &#8220;clean&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tahor</font>). Someone or something could gain &#8220;holy&#8221; <i>status</i> by being &#8220;consecrated&#8221; (i.e., made holy; e.g., the Hebrew Piel <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qiddesh</font>) in Lev 8:15, 30), and to treat someone or something that was holy as if it were &#8220;common&#8221; would be to &#8220;profane&#8221; that person or thing (the Hebrew Piel <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1500;</font> [<font face="Scholar">hillel</font>], e.g., in Lev 19:29 and 22:15). Similarly, on another level, someone or something could be in a &#8220;clean&#8221; <i>condition</i>, but one could &#8220;defile&#8221; (the Hebrew Piel <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;</font> [<font face="Scholar">timme</font>&#8217;], e.g., in Gen 34:5 and Num 6:9) that person or thing and thereby make it &#8220;unclean.&#8221; To &#8220;purify&#8221; (the Hebrew Piel <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1460;&#1492;&#1461;&#1512;</font> [<font face="Scholar">tiher</font>], e.g., in Lev 16:19 and Num 8:6, 15) that unclean person or thing would be to make it &#8220;clean&#8221; once again. With regard to the animals (Lev 11), some were by nature &#8220;unclean,&#8221; so they could never be eaten, but others were by nature &#8220;clean&#8221; and, therefore, edible (Lev 11:2, 46-47). The meat of clean animals could become inedible by too long of a delay in eating it, in which case the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pigul</font>) &#8220;foul, spoiled&#8221; is used to describe it (Lev 7:18; 19:7; cf. also Ezek 4:14 and Isa 65:4), not the term for &#8220;unclean&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tahor</font>). Strictly speaking, therefore, unclean meat never becomes clean, and clean meat never becomes unclean. </p>
<A NAME="1012"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=389><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;by the hand of&#8221; (so KJV).</p>
<A NAME="1013"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=390><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;statute&#8221; (cf. 10:9, 11); cf. KJV, NAB, NASB, NRSV &#8220;due&#8221;; NIV &#8220;share&#8221;; NLT &#8220;regular share.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1014"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=391><b>tn</b> For the rendering of the Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">isheh</font>) as &#8220;gift&#8221; rather than &#8220;offering [made] by fire,&#8221; see the note on Lev 1:9.</p>
<A NAME="1015"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=392><b>sn</b> Cf. Lev 2:3 and 6:14-18 [6:7-11 HT] for these regulations.</p>
<A NAME="1016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=393><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;ceremonially&#8221; has been supplied in the translation to clarify that the cleanness of the place specified is ritual or ceremonial in nature.</p>
<A NAME="1017"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=394><b>sn</b> Cf. Lev 7:14, 28-34 for these regulations.</p>
<A NAME="1018"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=395><b>sn</b> This is the very same male goat offered in Lev 9:15 (cf. the note on Lev 10:1 above).</p>
<A NAME="1019"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=396><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;but behold, it had been burnt&#8221; (KJV and NASB both similar).</p>
<A NAME="1020"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=397><b>sn</b> This translation is quite literal. On the surface it appears to mean that the priests would &#8220;bear the iniquity&#8221; of the congregation by the act of eating the sin offering (so J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:622-25, 635-40). Such a notion is, however, found nowhere else in the Levitical regulations and seems unlikely (so J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 136). A more likely interpretation is reflected in this interpretive rendering: &#8220;he gave it to you [as payment] for [your work of] bearing the iniquity of the congregation.&#8221; The previous section of the chapter deals with the prebends that the priests received for performing the ministry of the tabernacle (Lev 10:12-15). Lev 10:16-18, therefore, seems to continue the very same topic in the light of the most immediate situation (see R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 2:702-4).</p>
<A NAME="1021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=398><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Behold!&#8221; (so KJV, ASV, NASB).</p>
<A NAME="1022"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=399><b>sn</b> The term here rendered &#8220;within&#8221; refers to the bringing of the blood inside the holy place for application to the altar of incense rather than to the altar of burnt offering in the courtyard of the tabernacle (cf. Lev 4:7, 16-18; 6:30 [23 HT]).</p>
<A NAME="1023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=400><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Behold!&#8221; (so KJV, ASV, NASB); NRSV &#8220;See.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1024"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=401><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;today they presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before the <sc>Lord, and like these things have happened to me, and (if) I had eaten sin offering today would it be good in the eyes of the <sc>Lord?&#8221; The idiom &#8220;would it be good in the eyes of [the <sc>Lord]&#8221; has been translated &#8220;would [the <sc>Lord] have been pleased.&#8221; Cf. NRSV &#8220;would it have been agreeable to the Lord?&#8221;; CEV, NLT &#8220;Would the Lord have approved?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1025"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=402><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;it was good in his eyes&#8221; (an idiom). Cf. KJV &#8220;he was content&#8221;; NLT &#8220;he approved.&#8221;</p>
