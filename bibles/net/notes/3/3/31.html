<A NAME="31"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=60><b>sn</b> The <i>peace offering sacrifice</i> primarily enacted and practiced communion between God and man (and between the people of God). This was illustrated by the fact that the fat parts of the animal were consumed on the altar of the <sc>Lord but the meat was consumed by the worshipers in a meal before God. This is the only kind of offering in which common worshipers partook of the meat of the animal. When there was a series of offerings that included a peace offering (see, e.g., Lev 9:8-21, sin offerings, burnt offerings, and afterward the peace offerings in vv. 18-21), the peace offering was always offered last because it expressed the fact that all was well between God and his worshiper(s). There were various kinds of peace offerings, depending on the worship intended on the specific occasion. The &#8220;thank offering&#8221; expressed thanksgiving (e.g., Lev 7:11-15; 22:29-30), the &#8220;votive offering&#8221; fulfilled a vow (e.g., Lev 7:16-18; 22:21-25), and the &#8220;freewill offering&#8221; was offered as an expression of devotion and praise to God (e.g., Lev 7:16-18; 22:21-25). The so-called &#8220;ordination offering&#8221; was also a kind of peace offering that was used to consecrate the priests at their ordination (e.g., Exod 29:19-34; Lev 7:37; 8:22-32). See R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 1:1066-73 and 4:135-43.</p>
