<A NAME="21"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=34><b>sn</b> The &#8220;grain offering&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew"> &#1502;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font>[<font face="Scholar">minkhah</font>]; here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1503; &#1502;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, [<font face="Scholar">qorbban minkhah</font>], &#8220;an offering of a grain offering&#8221;) generally accompanied a burnt or peace offering to supplement the meat with bread (the libation provided the drink; cf. Num 15:1-10), thus completing the food &#8220;gift&#8221; to the <sc>Lord. It made atonement (see the note on Lev 1:4) along with the burnt offering (e.g., Lev 14:20) or alone as a sin offering for the poor (Lev 5:11-13).</p>
<A NAME="22"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=35><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term for &#8220;choice wheat flour&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1465;&#1500;&#1462;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">selet</font>) is often translated &#8220;fine flour&#8221; (cf. KJV, NAB, NIV, NCV), but it refers specifically to wheat as opposed to barley (B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 10). Moreover, the translation &#8220;flour&#8221; might be problematic, since the Hebrew term may designate the &#8220;grits&#8221; rather than the more finely ground &#8220;flour&#8221; (see J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:179 as opposed to Levine, 10, and J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 30).</p>
<A NAME="23"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=36><b>sn</b> This is not just any &#8220;incense&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1456;&#1496;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">qÿtoret</font>; R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 3:913-16), but specifically &#8220;frankincense&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">lÿvonah</font>; R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 2:756-57).</p>
<A NAME="24"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=37><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he&#8221;; the referent has been specified in the translation for clarity. The syntax is strange here and might suggest that it was the offerer who scooped out a handful of the grain offering for the memorial portion (G. J. Wenham, <i>Leviticus</i> [NICOT], 66), but based on v. 9 below it should be understood that it was the priest who performed this act (see, e.g., NRSV &#8220;After taking from it a handful of the choice flour and oil&#8230;the priest shall&#8230;&#8221;; see also J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:177, 181 and J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 30).</p>
<A NAME="25"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=38><b>sn</b> The &#8220;memorial portion&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1494;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">azkharah</font>) was the part of the grain offering that was burnt on the altar (see the previous clause), as opposed to the remainder, which was normally consumed by the priests (v. 3; see the full regulations in Lev 6:14-23[7-16]). It was probably intended to call to mind (i.e., memorialize) before the <sc>Lord the reason for the presentation of the particular offering (see the remarks in R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 1:335-39).</p>
<A NAME="26"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=39><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;it is&#8221; have been supplied. See the notes on Lev 1:9 and 2:3. There is no text critical problem here, but the syntax suggests the same translation.</p>
<A NAME="27"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=40><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;&#8230;is to Aaron and to his sons.&#8221; The preposition &#8220;to&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font>, <i>lamed</i>) indicates ownership. Cf. NAB, NASB, NIV and other English versions.</p>
<A NAME="28"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=41><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;it is&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hu</font>&#8217;) are not in the MT, but are supplied for the sake of translation into English. The Syriac also for translational reasons adds it between &#8220;most holy&#8221; and &#8220;from the gifts&#8221; (cf. 1:13, 17).</p>
<A NAME="29"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=42><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;holy of holies&#8221;; KJV, NASB &#8220;a thing most holy.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=43><b>tn</b> The insertion of the words &#8220;it must be made of&#8221; is justified by the context and the expressed words &#8220;it shall be made of&#8221; in vv. 7 and 8 below.</p>
<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=44><b>sn</b> These &#8220;loaves&#8221; were either &#8220;ring-shaped&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 317 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font>) or &#8220;perforated&#8221; (BDB 319 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font>; cf. J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:184).</p>
<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=45><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and.&#8221; Here the conjunction <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) has an alternative sense (&#8220;or&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=46><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿshukhim</font>) translated here as &#8220;smeared&#8221; is often translated &#8220;anointed&#8221; in other contexts. Cf. TEV &#8220;brushed with olive oil&#8221; (CEV similar).</p>
<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=47><b>tn</b> There is no <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>, &#8220;and&#8221;) in the MT at the beginning of v. 6 and the verb is pointed as an infinite absolute. The present translation has rendered it as an imperative (see GKC 346 §113.<i>bb</i>) and, therefore, the same for the following <i>vav</i> consecutive perfect verb (cf. NIV &#8220;Crumble it and pour oil on it&#8221;; cf. also NRSV, NEB, NLT, and J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:185, but note the objections to this rendering in J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 26). The LXX seems to suggest adding a <i>vav</i> (&#8220;and&#8221;) and pointing the verb as a consecutive perfect, which yields &#8220;and you shall break it in pieces&#8221; (cf. the <i>BHS</i> textual note; Hartley, 26, prefers the LXX rendering).</p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=48><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a grain offering of a pan&#8221;; cf. KJV &#8220;fryingpan&#8221;; NAB &#8220;pot&#8221;; CEV &#8220;pan with a lid on it.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=49><b>sn</b> Lev 7:9 makes it clear that one cooked &#8220;on&#8221; a griddle but &#8220;in&#8221; a pan. This suggests that the oil in the pan served for deep fat frying, hence the translation &#8220;deep fried in olive oil&#8221; (see, e.g., J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:185); cf. also NAB.</p>
<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=50><b>tc</b> There are several person, gender, and voice verb problems in this verse. First, the MT has &#8220;And you shall bring the grain offering,&#8221; but the LXX and Qumran have &#8220;he&#8221; rather than &#8220;you&#8221; (J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:185). Second, the MT has &#8220;which shall be made&#8221; (i.e., the 3rd person masculine Niphal passive verb which, in fact, does not agree with its feminine subject, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">minkhah</font>, &#8220;grain offering&#8221;), while the LXX has &#8220;which he shall make&#8221; (3rd person Qal), thus agreeing with the LXX 3rd person verb at the beginning of the verse (see above). Third, the MT has a 3rd person <i>vav</i> consecutive verb &#8220;and he shall present it to the priest,&#8221; which agrees with the LXX but is not internally consistent with the 2nd person verb at the beginning of the verse in the MT. The <i>BHS</i> editors conjecture that the latter might be repointed to an imperative verb yielding &#8220;present it to the priest.&#8221; This would require no change of consonants and corresponds to the person of the first verb in the MT. This solution has been tentatively accepted here (cf. also J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 26-27), even though it neither resolves the gender problem of the second verb nor fits the general grammatical pattern of the chapter in the MT.</p>
<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=51><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1461;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">herim</font>, &#8220;to take up&#8221;; cf. NAB &#8220;lift&#8221;) is commonly used for setting aside portions of an offering (see, e.g., Lev 4:8-10 and R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 4:335-36). A number of English versions employ the more normal English idiom &#8220;take out&#8221; here (e.g., NIV, NCV); cf. NRSV &#8220;remove.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=52><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;it is&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hu</font>&#8217;) both here and in vv. 10 and 16 are not in the MT, but are assumed. (cf. vv. 2b and 3b and the notes there).</p>
<A NAME="220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=53><b>tn</b> See the note on &#8220;it is&#8221; in v. 9b.</p>
<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=54><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Every grain offering which you offer to the <sc>Lord must not be made leavened.&#8221; The noun &#8220;leaven&#8221; is traditional in English versions (cf. KJV, ASV, NASB, NRSV), but &#8220;yeast&#8221; is more commonly used today.</p>
<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=55><b>tc</b> A few Hebrew <sc>mss, Smr, LXX, and <i>Tg. Ps.-J.</i> have the verb &#8220;present&#8221; rather than &#8220;offer up in smoke,&#8221; but the MT is clearly correct. One could indeed present leavened and honey sweetened offerings as first fruit offerings, which were not burned on the altar (see v. 12 and the note there), but they could not be offered up in fire on the altar. Cf. the TEV&#8217;s ambiguous &#8220;you must never use yeast or honey in food offered to the Lord.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for all leaven and all honey you must not offer up in smoke from it a gift to the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=56><b>sn</b> The &#8220;first fruit&#8221; referred to here was given to the priests as a prebend for their service to the <sc>Lord, not offered on the altar (Num 18:12).</p>
<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=57><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from upon your grain offering.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=58><b>tn</b> The translation of this whole section of the clause is difficult. Theoretically, it could describe one, two, or three different ways of preparing first ripe grain offerings (J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 27). The translation here takes it as a description of only one kind of prepared grain. This is suggested by the fact that v. 16 uses only one term &#8220;crushed bits&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1513;&#1474;</font>, <font face="Scholar">geres</font>) to refer back to the grain as it is prepared in v. 14 (a more technical translation is &#8220;groats&#8221;; see J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:178, 194). Cf. NAB &#8220;fresh grits of new ears of grain&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;coarse new grain from fresh ears.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=59><b>tn</b> See the note on &#8220;it is&#8221; in 2:9b.</p>
