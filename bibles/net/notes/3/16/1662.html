<A NAME="1662"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=815><b>tn</b> The MT of Lev 16:34b reads literally, &#8220;and he did just as the <sc>Lord had commanded Moses.&#8221; This has been retained here in spite of the fact that it suggests that Aaron immediately performed the rituals outlined in Lev 16 (see, e.g., J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 224 and 243; J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:1059; note that Aaron was the one to whom Moses was to speak the regulations in this chapter, v. 2). The problem is that the chapter presents these procedures as regulations for &#8220;the tenth day of the seventh month&#8221; and calls for their fulfillment at that time (Lev 16:29; cf. Lev 23:26-32 and the remarks in P. J. Budd, <i>Leviticus</i> [NCBC], 237), not during the current (first) month (Exod 40:2; note also that they left Sinai in the second month, long before the next seventh month, Num 10:11). The LXX translates, &#8220;once in the year it shall be done as the <sc>Lord commanded Moses,&#8221; attaching &#8220;once in the year&#8221; to this clause rather than the former one, and rendering the verb as passive, &#8220;it shall be done&#8221; (cf. NAB, NIV, etc.). We have already observed the passive use of active verbs in this context (see the note on v. 32 above). The RSV (cf. also the NRSV, TEV, CEV, NLT) translates, &#8220;And Moses did as the <sc>Lord commanded him,&#8221; ignoring the fact that the name Moses in the Hebrew text has the direct object indicator. Passive verbs, however, regularly take subjects with direct object indicators (see, e.g., v. 27 above). The NIV renders it &#8220;And it was done, as the <sc>Lord commanded Moses,&#8221; following the LXX passive translation. The NASB translates, &#8220;And just as the <sc>Lord had commanded Moses, <i>so</i> he did,&#8221; transposing the introductory verb to the end of the sentence and supplying &#8220;so&#8221; in order to make it fit the context.</p>
