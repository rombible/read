<A NAME="163"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=756><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to the faces of the atonement plate.&#8221; The exact meaning of the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kapporet</font>) here rendered &#8220;atonement plate&#8221; is much debated. The traditional &#8220;<i>mercy</i> seat&#8221; (KJV, ASV, NASB, NRSV) does not suit the cognate relationship between this term and the Piel verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kipper</font>, &#8220;to make atonement, to make expiation&#8221;). The translation of the word should also reflect the fact that the most important atonement procedures on the Day of Atonement were performed in relation to it. Since the <sc>Lord would &#8220;appear in the cloud over the atonement plate,&#8221; and since it was so closely associated with the ark of the covenant (the ark being his &#8220;footstool&#8221;; cf. 1 Chr 28:2 and Ps 132:7-8), one could take it to be the place of his throne at which he accepts atonement. See J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>(AB), 1:1014; J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> (WBC), 234-35; and R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 2:691, 699. Cf. NIV &#8220;the atonement cover&#8221;; NCV &#8220;the lid on the Ark&#8221;; NLT &#8220;the Ark&#8217;s cover &#8211; the place of atonement.&#8221;</p>
