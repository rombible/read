<A NAME="1615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=768><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Aaron shall give lots on the two he-goats.&#8221; See the note on Lev 8:8 for the priestly casting of lots in Israel and the explanation in B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> (JPSTC), 102, on Lev 16:8-9. J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>(AB), 1:1019-20, suggests, however, that the expression here signifies that, the lots having been cast, the priest was to literally &#8220;place&#8221; (<i>Heb </i>&#8220;give&#8221;) the one marked &#8220;for the <sc>Lord&#8221; on the head of the goat to be sacrificed and the one marked &#8220;for Azazel&#8221; on the head of the one to be released in the wilderness in order to avoid confusing them later in the ritual sequence. </p>
