<A NAME="1623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=776><b>tn</b> The text here has only &#8220;above the testimony,&#8221; but this is surely a shortened form of &#8220;above <i>the ark of</i> the testimony&#8221; (see Exod 25:22 etc.; cf. Lev 16:2). The term &#8220;testimony&#8221; in this expression refers to the ark as the container of the two stone tablets with the Ten Commandments written on them (see Exod 25:16 with Deut 10:1, 5, etc.). </p>
