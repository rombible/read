<A NAME="1625"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=778><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;on the faces of the atonement plate toward the east.&#8221; Some have taken this to mean that the ark was stationed just behind the veil-canopy on the eastern side of the most holy place. Thus, the high priest would need to enter and walk toward the west end of the most holy place and then turn eastward in order to face the ark and sprinkle the blood in an eastward direction. The rendering here, however, requires that the ark was stationed on the western end, or perhaps in the middle of the area, so that as the priest entered he was already facing the ark and would sprinkle the blood on the eastern face of the atonement plate, in a westward direction (see, e.g., J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 239 versus J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:1032).</p>
