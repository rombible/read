<A NAME="168"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=761><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;shall be on his flesh.&#8221; As in many instances in Lev 15, the term &#8220;flesh&#8221; or &#8220;body&#8221; here is euphemistic for the male genitals (J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:1017, and J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 222; cf. the note on Lev 15:2), which the priest must be careful not to expose during such ritual procedures (see Exod 20:26 with 28:42-43). </p>
