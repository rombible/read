<A NAME="1647"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=800><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And it [feminine] shall be for you a perpetual statute.&#8221; Verse 34 begins with the same clause except for the missing demonstrative pronoun &#8220;this&#8221; here in v. 29. The LXX has &#8220;this&#8221; in both places and it suits the sense of the passage, although both the verb and the pronoun are sometimes missing in this clause elsewhere in the book (see, e.g., Lev 3:17).</p>
