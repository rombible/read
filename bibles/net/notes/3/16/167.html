<A NAME="167"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=760><b>sn</b> The term &#8220;tunic&#8221; refers to a shirt-like garment worn next to the skin and, therefore, put on first (cf. Exod 28:4, 39-40; 29:5, 8; 39:27). It covered the upper body only. For detailed remarks on the terminology for the priestly clothing in this verse (except the &#8220;linen leggings&#8221;) see the notes on Lev 8:7-9 and the literature cited there.</p>
