<A NAME="1657"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=810><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the tent of meeting and the alter he shall atone.&#8221; The repetition of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kipper</font>, &#8220;to atone&#8221;) at the beginning and end of the sequence appears to be strange, but the MT accents suggest that only &#8220;the Most Holy Place&#8221; goes with the verb at the beginning of the verse. Of course, the purging of &#8220;the Most Holy Place&#8221; has been the main emphasis of this chapter from the start (see vv. 2-3 and 11-17). </p>
