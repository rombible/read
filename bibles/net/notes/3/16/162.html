Exod 26:33-34). The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1465;&#1499;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">parokhet</font>) is usually translated &#8220;veil&#8221; or &#8220;curtain,&#8221; but it seems to have stretched not only in front of but also over the top of the ark of the covenant which stood behind and under it inside the most holy place, and thus formed more of a canopy than simply a curtain (see R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 3:687-89). </p>
