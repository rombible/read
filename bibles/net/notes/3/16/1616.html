<A NAME="1616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=769><b>tn</b> The meaning of the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1494;&#1464;&#1488;&#1494;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aza</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">zel</font>, four times in the OT, all of them in this chapter; vv. 8, 10 [2 times], and 26) is much debated. There are three or perhaps four major views (see the summaries and literature cited in J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:1020-21; B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 102; J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 237-38; D. P. Wright, <i>The Disposal of Impurity</i> [SBLDS], 21-25; M. V. Van Pelt and W. C. Kaiser, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 3:362-63; and M. S. Moore, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 4:421-22). (1) Some derive the term from a combination of the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1494;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ez</font>, &#8220;goat&#8221;; i.e., the word for &#8220;goats&#8221; in v. 5) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">azal</font>, &#8220;to go away&#8221;), meaning &#8220;the goat that departs&#8221; or &#8220;scapegoat&#8221; (cf., e.g., the LXX and KJV, NASB, NIV, NLT). This meaning suits the ritual practice of sending the so-called &#8220;scapegoat&#8221; away into the wilderness (vv. 10, 21-22, 26). Similarly, some derive the term from Arabic &#8217;<font face="Scholar">azala</font> (&#8220;to banish, remove&#8221;), meaning &#8220;entire removal&#8221; as an abstract concept (see BDB 736 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1494;&#1464;&#1488;&#1494;&#1461;&#1500;</font>). (2) Some see the term as a description of the wilderness area to which the goat was dispatched, deriving it somehow from Arabic &#8217;<font face="Scholar">azazu</font> (&#8220;rough ground&#8221;) or perhaps <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1494;&#1464;&#1494;</font>, (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">azaz,</font> &#8220;to be strong, fierce&#8221;). (3) The most common view among scholars today is that it is the proper name of a particular demon (perhaps even the Devil himself) associated with the wilderness desert regions. Levine has proposed that it may perhaps derive from a reduplication of the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;</font> (<i>zayin</i>) in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1494;</font> combined with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>, &#8220;mighty&#8221;), meaning &#8220;mighty goat.&#8221; The final consonantal form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1494;&#1464;&#1488;&#1494;&#1461;&#1500;</font> would have resulted from the inversion of the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> (<i>aleph</i>) with the second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;</font>. He makes the point that the close association between <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1494;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">irim</font>), which seems to refer to &#8220;goat-demons&#8221; of the desert in Lev 17:7 (cf. Isa 13:21, etc.), should not be ignored in the derivation of Azazel, although the term ultimately became the name of &#8220;the demonic ruler of the wilderness.&#8221; The latter view is supported by the parallel between the one goat &#8220;for (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font>, <i>lamed</i> preposition) the <sc>Lord&#8221; and the one &#8220;for (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font>) Azazel&#8221; here in v. 8. The rendering as a proper name has been tentatively accepted here (cf. ASV, NAB, NRSV, TEV, CEV). Perhaps a play on words between the proper name and the term for &#8220;goat&#8221; has occurred so that the etymology has become obscure. Even if a demon or the demonic realm is the source for the name, however, there is no intention here of appeasing the demons. The goal is to remove the impurity and iniquity from the community in order to avoid offending the <sc>Lord and the repercussions of such (see esp. vv. 21-22 and cf. Lev 15:31). </p>
