<A NAME="147"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=612><b>tn</b> The MT reads literally, &#8220;And the priest shall command and he shall take.&#8221; Clearly, the second verb (&#8220;and he shall take&#8221;) contains the thrust of the priest&#8217;s command, which suggests the translation &#8220;that he take&#8221; (cf. also v. 5a). Since the priest issues the command here, he cannot be the subject of the second verb because he cannot be commanding himself to &#8220;take&#8221; up these ritual materials. Moreover, since the ritual is being performed &#8220;for the one being cleansed,&#8221; the antecedent of the pronoun &#8220;he&#8221; cannot refer to him. The LXX, Smr, and Syriac versions have the third person plural here and in v. 5a, which corresponds to other combinations with the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1510;&#1460;&#1493;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿtsivvah</font>) &#8220;and he (the priest) shall command&#8221; in this context (see Lev 13:54; 14:36, 40). This suggests an impersonal (i.e., &#8220;someone shall take&#8221; and &#8220;someone shall slaughter,&#8221; respectively) or perhaps even passive rendering of the verbs in 14:4, 5 (i.e., &#8220;there shall be taken&#8221; and &#8220;there shall be slaughtered,&#8221; respectively). The latter option has been chosen here. </p>
