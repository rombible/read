<A NAME="1456"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=661><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from which his hand reaches.&#8221; The repetition of virtually the same expression at the beginning of v. 31 in the MT is probably due to dittography (cf. the LXX and Syriac). However, the MT may be retained if it is understood as &#8220;one of the turtledoves or young pigeons that are within his means &#8211; whichever he can afford&#8221; (see J. Milgrom&#8217;s translation in <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:828, <i>contra</i> his commentary, 862; cf. REB).</p>
