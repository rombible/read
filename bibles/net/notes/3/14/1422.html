<A NAME="1422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=627><b>tn</b> The MT here is awkward to translate into English. It reads literally, &#8220;and the priest who pronounces clean (Piel participle of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;&#1461;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">taher</font>) shall cause to stand (Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1491;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">amad</font>) the man who is cleansing himself (Hitpael participle of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;&#1461;&#1512;</font>) and them&#8221; (i.e., the offerings listed in v. 10; the referent has been specified in the translation for clarity). Alternatively, the Piel of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;&#1461;&#1512;</font> could be rendered &#8220;who performs the cleansing/purification&#8221; (J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:827), perhaps even as a technical term for one who holds the office of &#8220;purification priest&#8221; (B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 87). It is probably better, however, to retain the same meaning here as in v. 7 above (see the note there regarding the declarative Piel use of this verb). </p>
