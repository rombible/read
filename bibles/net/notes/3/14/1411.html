<A NAME="1411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=616><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the live bird he [i.e., the priest] shall take it.&#8221; Although the MT has no <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vav</font>, &#8220;and&#8221;) at the beginning of this clause, a few medieval Hebrew <sc>mss and Smr have one and the LXX, Syriac, and Vulgate translate as if it is there. The &#8220;but&#8221; in the present translation reflects this text critical background, the object-first word order in the clause with the resumptive pronoun at the end, and the obvious contrast between the slaughtered bird in v. 5 and the live bird in v. 6.</p>
