<A NAME="1416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=621><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he shall be clean&#8221; (so ASV). The end result of the ritual procedures in vv. 4-7 and the washing and shaving in v. 8a is that the formerly diseased person has now officially become clean in the sense that he can reenter the community (see v. 8b; contrast living outside the community as an unclean diseased person, Lev 13:46). There are, however, further cleansing rituals and pronouncements for him to undergo in the tabernacle as outlined in vv. 10-20 (see Qal &#8220;be[come] clean&#8221; in vv. 9 and 20, Piel &#8220;pronounce clean&#8221; in v. 11, and Hitpael &#8220;the one being cleansed&#8221; in vv. 11, 14, 17, 18, and 19). Obviously, in order to enter the tabernacle he must already &#8220;be clean&#8221; in the sense of having access to the community.</p>
