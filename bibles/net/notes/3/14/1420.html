<A NAME="1420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=625><b>tn</b> This term is often rendered &#8220;fine flour,&#8221; but it refers specifically to wheat as opposed to barley (B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 10) and, although the translation &#8220;flour&#8221; is used here, it may indicate &#8220;grits&#8221; rather than finely ground flour (J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:179; see the note on Lev 2:1). The unit of measure is most certainly an &#8220;ephah&#8221; even though it is not stated explicitly (see, e.g., Num 28:5; cf. 15:4, 6, 8), and three-tenths of an ephah would amount to about a gallon, or perhaps one-third of a bushel (J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 196; Milgrom, 845). Since the normal amount of flour for a lamb is one-tenth of an ephah (Num 28:4-5; cf. 15:4), three-tenths is about right for the three lambs offered in Lev 14:10-20. </p>
