<A NAME="1430"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=635><b>tn</b> Since the priest himself presents this offering as a wave offering (v. 12), it would seem that the offering is already in his hands and he would, therefore, be the one who slaughtered the male lamb in this instance rather than the offerer. Smr and LXX make the second verb &#8220;to slaughter&#8221; plural rather than singular, which suggests that it is to be taken as an impersonal passive (see J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:852). </p>
