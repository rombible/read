<A NAME="142"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=607><b>tn</b> The alternative rendering, &#8220;when it is reported to the priest&#8221; may be better in light of the fact that the priest had to go outside the camp. Since he or she had been declared &#8220;unclean&#8221; by a priest (Lev 13:3) and was, therefore, required to remain outside the camp (13:46), the formerly diseased person could not reenter the camp until he or she had been declared &#8220;clean&#8221; by a priest (cf. Lev 13:6 for &#8220;declaring clean.&#8221;). See especially J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>(AB), 1:831, who supports this rendering both here and in Lev 13:2 and 9. B. A. Levine, however, prefers the rendering in the text (<i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 76 and 85). It is the most natural meaning of the verb (i.e., &#8220;to be brought&#8221; from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;</font> [<font face="Scholar">bo</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to come&#8221;] in the Hophal stem, which means &#8220;to be brought&#8221; in all other occurrences in Leviticus other than 13:2, 9, and 14:2; see only 6:30; 10:18; 11:32; and 16:27), it suits the context well in 13:2, and the rendering &#8220;to be brought&#8221; is supported by 13:7b, &#8220;he shall show himself to the priest a second time.&#8221; Although it is true that the priest needed to go outside the camp to examine such a person, the person still needed to &#8220;be brought&#8221; to the priest there. The translation of vv. 2-3 employed here suggests that v. 2 introduces the proceeding and then v. 3 goes on to describe the specific details of the examination and purification.</p>
