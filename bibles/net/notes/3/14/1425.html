<A NAME="1425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=630><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;wave them [as] a wave offering before the <sc>Lord&#8221; (NAB similar). See the note on Lev 7:30 and the literature cited there. Other possible translations include &#8220;elevate them [as] an elevation offering before the <sc>Lord&#8221; (cf. NRSV) or &#8220;present them [as] a presentation offering before the <sc>Lord.&#8221; To be sure, the actual physical &#8220;waving&#8221; of a male lamb seems unlikely, but some waving gesture may have been performed in the presentation of the offering (cf. also the &#8220;waving&#8221; of the Levites as a &#8220;wave offering&#8221; in Num 8:11, etc.). </p>
