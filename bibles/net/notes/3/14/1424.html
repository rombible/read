<A NAME="1424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=629><b>tn</b> See the note on Lev 5:15 above. The primary purpose of the &#8220;guilt offering&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">asham</font>) was to &#8220;atone&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kipper</font>, &#8220;to make atonement,&#8221; see v. 18 below and the note on Lev 1:4) for &#8220;trespassing&#8221; on the <sc>Lord&#8217;s &#8220;holy things,&#8221; whether sacred objects or sacred people. It is, therefore, closely associated with the reconsecration of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s holy people as, for example, here and in the case of the corpse contaminated Nazirite (Num 6:11b-12). Since the nation of Israel was &#8220;a kingdom of priests and a <i>holy</i> nation&#8221; to the <sc>Lord (Exod 19:6; cf. the blood splashed on all the people in Exod 24:8), the skin diseased person was essentially a member of the &#8220;holy nation&#8221; who had been expelled from the community. Therefore, he or she had been desecrated and the guilt offering was essential to restoring him or her to the community. In fact, the manipulation of blood and oil in the guilt offering ritual procedure for the healed person (see vv. 14-18 below) is reminiscent of that employed for the ordination offering in the consecration of the holy Aaronic priests of the nation (Exod 29:19-21; Lev 8:22-30). </p>
