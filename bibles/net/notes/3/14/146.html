<A NAME="146"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=611><b>sn</b> <i>Twigs of hyssop</i> (probably one or several species of <i>marjoram thymus</i>), a spice and herb plant that grows out of walls in Palestine (see 1 Kgs 4:33 [5:13 HT], <i>HALOT</i> 27 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1494;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;</font>, and J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 195), were particularly leafy and therefore especially useful for sprinkling the purifying liquid (cf. vv. 5-7). Many of the details of the ritual procedure are obscure. It has been proposed, for example, that the &#8220;cedar wood&#8221; was a stick to which the hyssop was bound with the crimson material to make a sort of sprinkling instrument (Hartley, 195). In light of the burning of these three materials as part of the preparation of the ashes of the red heifer in Num 19:5-6, however, this seems unlikely.</p>
