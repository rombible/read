<A NAME="1434"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=639><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And the priest&#8230;shall pour on the left hand of the priest.&#8221; As the Rabbis observe, the repetition of &#8220;priest&#8221; as the expressed subject of both verbs in this verse may suggest that two priests were involved in this ritual (see <i>m.</i> <i>Nega&#8217;im</i> 14:8, referred to by J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:852), but the seemingly unnecessary repetition of &#8220;priest&#8221; in several verses throughout the chapter argues against this (see esp. vv. 3, 14, 18, 20, 24, and 26). Moreover, in this case, &#8220;priest&#8221; may be repeated to avoid confusing the priest&#8217;s hand with that of the one being cleansed (cf. v. 14). </p>
