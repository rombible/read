<A NAME="1492"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">92</span><note=697><b>tn</b> Regarding the Piel of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1496;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khata</font>&#8217;, cf. v. 52) meaning to &#8220;decontaminate&#8221; or &#8220;perform a decontamination,&#8221; see the notes on Lev 8:15 and 9:15. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In Lev 8:15, for example, the &#8220;sin offering&#8221; is used to &#8220;decontaminate&#8221; the burnt offering altar. As argued above (see the note on v. 7 above), these ritual materials and the procedures performed with them do not constitute a &#8220;sin offering&#8221; (contrast vv. 19 and 31 above). In fact, no sin offering was required for the purification of a house.</p>
