<A NAME="145"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=610><b>tn</b> The term rendered here &#8220;crimson fabric&#8221; consists of two Hebrew words and means literally, &#8220;crimson of worm&#8221; (in this order only in Lev 14:4, 6, 49, 51, 52 and Num 19:6; for the more common reverse order, &#8220;worm of crimson,&#8221; see, e.g., the colored fabrics used in making the tabernacle, Exod 25:4, etc.). This particular &#8220;worm&#8221; is an insect that lives on the leaves of palm trees, the eggs of which are the source for a &#8220;crimson&#8221; dye used to color various kinds of cloth (B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 86). That a kind of dyed &#8220;fabric&#8221; is intended, not just the dye substance itself, is made certain by the dipping of it along with the other ritual materials listed here into the blood and water mixture for sprinkling on the person being cleansed (Lev 14:6; cf. also the burning of it in the fire of the red heifer in Num 19:6). Both the reddish color of cedar wood and the crimson colored fabric seem to correspond to the color of blood and may, therefore, symbolize either &#8220;life,&#8221; which is in the blood, or the use of blood to &#8220;make atonement&#8221; (see, e.g., Gen 9:4 and Lev 17:11). See further the note on v. 7 below. </p>
