Lev 14:50; 15:13; Num 19:17) refers to water that flows. It includes such water sources as artesian wells (Gen 26:19; Song of Songs 4:15), springs (Jer 2:13, as opposed to cisterns; cf. 17:13), and flowing streams (Zech 14:8). In other words, this is water that has not stood stagnant as, for example, in a sealed-off cistern. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Although there are those who argue that the water and the blood rites are separate (e.g., E. S. Gerstenberger, <i>Leviticus</i> [OTL], 175-76), it is usually agreed that v. 5b refers to the slaughtering of the bird in such a way that its blood runs into the bowl, which contained fresh water (see, e.g., N. H. Snaith, <i>Leviticus and Numbers</i> [NCBC], 74; G. J. Wenham, <i>Leviticus</i> [NICOT], 208; J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:836-38; cf. esp. Lev 14:51b, &#8220;and dip them in the blood of the slaughtered bird <i>and in</i> the fresh water&#8221;). This mixture of blood and water was then to be sprinkled on the person being cleansed from the disease.</p>
