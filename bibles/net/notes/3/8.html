<A NAME="81"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=302><b>sn</b> Lev 8 is the fulfillment account of the ordination legislation recorded in Exod 29, and is directly connected to the command to ordain the tabernacle and priesthood in Exod 40:1-16 as well as the partial record of its fulfillment in Exod 40:17-38. </p>
<A NAME="82"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=303><b>sn</b> For &#8220;tent of meeting&#8221; see the note on Lev 1:1 above.</p>
<A NAME="83"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=304><b>sn</b> Here Moses actually clothes Aaron (cf. v. 13 below for Aaron&#8217;s sons). Regarding the various articles of clothing see J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> (WBC), 111-12 and esp. J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>(AB), 1:501-13.</p>
<A NAME="84"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=305><b>sn</b> The term &#8220;tunic&#8221; refers to a shirt-like garment worn next to the skin and, therefore, put on first (cf. Exod 28:4, 39-40; 29:5, 8; 39:27). Traditionally this has been translated &#8220;coat&#8221; (so KJV, ASV), but that English word designates an outer garment.</p>
<A NAME="85"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=306><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;on him&#8221;; the referent (Aaron) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="86"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=307><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;girded him with the sash&#8221; (so NASB); NCV &#8220;tied the cloth belt around him.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The <i>sash</i> fastened the tunic around the waist (Exod 28:4, 39; 29:9; 39:29).</p>
<A NAME="87"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=308><b>sn</b> The <i>robe</i> was a long shirt-like over-garment that reached down below the knees. Its hem was embroidered with pomegranates and golden bells around the bottom (Exod 28:4, 31-35; 29:5; 39:22-26).</p>
<A NAME="88"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=309><b>sn</b> The <i>ephod</i> was an apron like garment suspended from shoulder straps. It draped over the robe and extended from the chest down to the thighs (Exod 28:4, 6-14, 25-28; 29:5; 39:2-7).</p>
<A NAME="89"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=310><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;girded him with.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=311><b>sn</b> The <i>decorated band of the ephod</i> served as a sort of belt around Aaron&#8217;s body that would hold the ephod<i> </i>closely to him rather than allowing it to hang loosely across his front (Exod 28:8, 27; 29:5; 39:5, 20).</p>
<A NAME="811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=312><b>sn</b> The <i>breastpiece</i> was made of the same material as the ephod and was attached to it by means of gold rings and chains on its four corners (Exod 28:15-30; 29:5; 39:8-21). It had twelve stones attached to it (representing the twelve tribes of Israel), and a pocket in which the Urim and Thummim were kept (see following).</p>
<A NAME="812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=313><b>sn</b> The <i>Urim and Thummim</i> were two small objects used in the casting of lots to discern the will of God (see Exod 28:30; Num 27:21; Deut 33:8; 1 Sam 14:41 in the LXX and 28:6; Ezra 2:63 and Neh 7:65). It appears that by casting them one could obtain a yes or no answer, or no answer at all (1 Sam 28:6; J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 111-12). See the extensive discussion in J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>(AB), 1:507-11.</p>
<A NAME="813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=314><b>tn</b> Although usually thought to be a &#8220;turban&#8221; (and so translated by the majority of English versions) this object might be only a &#8220;turban-like headband&#8221; wound around the forehead area (<i>HALOT</i> 624 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1514;</font>).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The <i>turban</i> consisted of wound-up linen (cf. Exod 28:4, 37, 39; 29:6; 39:31; Lev 16:4). </p>
<A NAME="814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=315><b>sn</b> The <i>gold plate</i> was attached as a <i>holy diadem</i> to the front of the turban by means of a blue cord, and had written on it &#8220;Holy to the <sc>Lord&#8221; (Exod 28:36-37; 39:30-31). This was a particularly important article of high priestly clothing in that it served as the main emblem indicating Aaron&#8217;s acceptable representation of Israel before the <sc>Lord (Exod 28:38).</p>
<A NAME="815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=316><b>sn</b> The expression &#8220;and consecrated it&#8221; refers to the effect of the anointing earlier in the verse (cf. &#8220;to consecrate them/him&#8221; in vv. 11 and 12). &#8220;To consecrate&#8221; means &#8220;to make holy&#8221; or &#8220;make sacred&#8221;; i.e., put something into the category of holy/sacred as opposed to common/profane (see Lev 10:10 below). Thus, the person or thing consecrated is put into the realm of God&#8217;s holy things. </p>
<A NAME="816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=317><b>tc</b> The MT has here &#8220;sash&#8221; (singular), but the context is clearly plural and Smr has it in the plural.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;girded them with sashes&#8221; (so NAB, NASB); NRSV &#8220;fastened sashes around them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=318><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;wrapped headdresses to them&#8221;; cf. KJV &#8220;bonnets&#8221;; NASB, TEV &#8220;caps&#8221;; NIV, NCV &#8220;headbands&#8221;; NAB, NLT &#8220;turbans.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Notice that the priestly garments of Aaron&#8217;s sons are quite limited compared to those of Aaron himself, the high priest (cf. vv. 7-9 above). The terms for &#8220;tunic&#8221; and &#8220;sash&#8221; are the same but not the headgear (cf. Exod 28:40; 29:8-9; 39:27-29).</p>
<A NAME="818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=319><b>sn</b> See Lev 4:3-12 above for the sin offering of the priests. In this case, however, the blood manipulation is different because Moses, not Aaron (and his sons), is functioning as the priest. On the one hand, Aaron and his sons are, in a sense, treated as if they were commoners so that the blood manipulation took place at the burnt offering altar in the court of the tabernacle (see v. 15 below), not at the incense altar inside the tabernacle tent itself (contrast Lev 4:5-7 and compare 4:30). On the other hand, since it was a sin offering for the priests, therefore, the priests themselves could not eat its flesh (Lev 4:11-12; 6:30 [23 HT]), which was the normal priestly practice for sin offerings of commoners (Lev 6:26[19], 29[22]).</p>
<A NAME="819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=320><b>sn</b> Contrary to some English versions (e.g., NAB, NASB, NIV, NLT), Aaron (<i>not</i> Moses) most likely slaughtered the bull, possibly with the help of his sons, although the verb is singular, not plural. Moses then performed the ritual procedures that involved direct contact with the altar. Compare the pattern in Lev 1:5-9, where the offerer does the slaughtering and the priests perform the procedures that involve direct contact with the altar. In Lev 8 Moses is functioning as the priest in order to consecrate the priesthood. The explicit reintroduction of the name of Moses as the subject of the next verb seems to reinforce this understanding of the passage (cf. also vv. 19 and 23 below).</p>
<A NAME="820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=321><b>tn</b> The verb is the Piel of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1496;&#1464;&#1488;</font><font face="Hebrewtl"> </font>(<font face="Scholar">khata</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to sin&#8221;) and means &#8220;to de-sin&#8221; the altar. This verse is important for confirming the main purpose of the sin offering, which was to decontaminate the tabernacle and its furniture from any impurities. See the note on Lev 4:3.</p>
<A NAME="821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=322><b>tn</b> Similar to v. 10 above, &#8220;and consecrated it&#8221; refers to the effect of the blood manipulation earlier in the verse. The goal here was to consecrate the altar in order that it might become a place on which it would be appropriate &#8220;to make atonement&#8221; before the <sc>Lord.</p>
<A NAME="822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=323><b>tn</b> Again, Aaron probably performed the slaughter and collected the fat parts (v. 16a), but Moses presented it all on the altar (v. 16b; cf. the note on v. 15 above).</p>
<A NAME="823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=324><b>sn</b> See Lev 3:3-4 for the terminology of fat and kidneys here. </p>
<A NAME="824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=325><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;toward the altar&#8221; (see the note on Lev 1:9). </p>
<A NAME="825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=326><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he burned with fire,&#8221; an expression which is sometimes redundant in English, but here means &#8220;burned up,&#8221; &#8220;burned up entirely.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=327><b>sn</b> See Lev 4:11-12, 21; 6:30 [23 HT].</p>
<A NAME="827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=328><b>tn</b> Aaron probably did the slaughtering (cf. the notes on Lev 8:15-16 above). </p>
<A NAME="828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=329><b>tn</b> Again, Aaron probably cut the ram up into parts (v. 20a), but Moses presented them on the altar (v. 20b; cf. the note on v. 15 above).</p>
<A NAME="829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=330><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;cut it into its parts.&#8221; One could translate here, &#8220;quartered it&#8221; (J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:133; cf. Lev 1:6, 12 above).</p>
<A NAME="830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=331><b>tn</b> Again, Aaron probably did the washing (v. 21a), but Moses presented the portions on the altar (v. 21b; cf. the note on v. 15 above).</p>
<A NAME="831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=332><b>tn</b> See Lev 1:9, 13.</p>
<A NAME="832"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=333><b>tn</b> For &#8220;ordination offering&#8221; see Lev 7:37</p>
<A NAME="833"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=334><b>tn</b> Again, Aaron probably did the slaughtering (cf. the notes on Lev 8:15-16 above). </p>
<A NAME="834"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=335><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;on the lobe of the ear of Aaron, the right one.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="835"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=336><b>tn</b> The term for &#8220;big toe&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1462;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bohen</font>) is the same as that for &#8220;thumb.&#8221; It refers to the larger appendage on either the hand or the foot.</p>
<A NAME="836"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=337><b>tn</b> See Lev 3:9.</p>
<A NAME="837"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=338><b>tn</b> See Lev 8:16.</p>
<A NAME="838"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=339><b>tn</b> See Lev 7:32-34.</p>
<A NAME="839"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=340><b>tn</b> See Lev 2:4.</p>
<A NAME="840"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=341><b>sn</b> The &#8220;palms&#8221; refer to the up-turned hands, positioned in such a way that the articles of the offering could be placed on them.</p>
<A NAME="841"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=342><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and he waved.&#8221; The subject of the verb &#8220;he waved&#8221; is Aaron, but Aaron&#8217;s sons also performed the action (see &#8220;Aaron and his sons&#8221; just previously). See the similar shifts from Moses to Aaron as the subject of the action above (vv. 15, 16, 19, 20, 23), and esp. the note on Lev 8:15. In the present translation this is rendered as an adjectival clause (&#8220;who waved&#8221;) to indicate that the referent is not Moses but Aaron and his sons. Cf. CEV &#8220;who lifted it up&#8221;; NAB &#8220;whom he had wave&#8221; (with &#8220;he&#8221; referring to Moses here).</p>
<A NAME="842"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=343><b>sn</b> See Lev 7:30-31, 34.</p>
<A NAME="843"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=344><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;toward the altar&#8221; (see the note on Lev 1:9). </p>
<A NAME="844"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=345><b>tn</b> Several major ancient versions have the passive form of the verb (see <i>BHS</i> v. 31 note c; cf. Lev 8:35; 10:13). In that case we would translate, &#8220;just as I was commanded.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="845"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=346><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;but the remainder in the flesh and in the bread&#8221;; NAB, CEV &#8220;what is left over&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;what remains.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="846"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=347><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;because seven days he shall fill your hands&#8221;; KJV &#8220;for seven days shall he consecrate you&#8221;; CEV &#8220;ends seven days from now.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> It is apparent that the term for &#8220;ordination offering&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1467;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">millu</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>; cf. Lev 7:37 and the note there) is closely related to the expression &#8220;he shall fill (Piel <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mille</font>&#8217;) your hands&#8221; in this verse. Some derive the terminology from the procedure in Lev 8:27-28, but the term for &#8220;hands&#8221; there is actually &#8220;palms.&#8221; It seems more likely that it derives from the notion of putting the priestly responsibilities (or possibly its associated prebends) under their control (i.e., &#8220;filling their hands&#8221; with authority; see J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:538-39). The command &#8220;to keep the charge of the <sc>Lord&#8221; in v. 35 and the expression &#8220;by the hand of Moses&#8221; (i.e., under the authoritative hand of Moses, v. 36) may also support this interpretation.</p>
<A NAME="847"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=348><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;just as he has done&#8221; (cf. the note on v. 33).</p>

<A NAME="849"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=350><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;by the hand of&#8221; (so KJV).</p>
