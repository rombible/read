<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=55><b>tc</b> A few Hebrew <sc>mss, Smr, LXX, and <i>Tg. Ps.-J.</i> have the verb &#8220;present&#8221; rather than &#8220;offer up in smoke,&#8221; but the MT is clearly correct. One could indeed present leavened and honey sweetened offerings as first fruit offerings, which were not burned on the altar (see v. 12 and the note there), but they could not be offered up in fire on the altar. Cf. the TEV&#8217;s ambiguous &#8220;you must never use yeast or honey in food offered to the Lord.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for all leaven and all honey you must not offer up in smoke from it a gift to the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
