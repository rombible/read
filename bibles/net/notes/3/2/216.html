<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=49><b>sn</b> Lev 7:9 makes it clear that one cooked &#8220;on&#8221; a griddle but &#8220;in&#8221; a pan. This suggests that the oil in the pan served for deep fat frying, hence the translation &#8220;deep fried in olive oil&#8221; (see, e.g., J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:185); cf. also NAB.</p>
