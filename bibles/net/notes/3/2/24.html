<A NAME="24"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=37><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he&#8221;; the referent has been specified in the translation for clarity. The syntax is strange here and might suggest that it was the offerer who scooped out a handful of the grain offering for the memorial portion (G. J. Wenham, <i>Leviticus</i> [NICOT], 66), but based on v. 9 below it should be understood that it was the priest who performed this act (see, e.g., NRSV &#8220;After taking from it a handful of the choice flour and oil&#8230;the priest shall&#8230;&#8221;; see also J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:177, 181 and J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 30).</p>
