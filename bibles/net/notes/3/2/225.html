<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=58><b>tn</b> The translation of this whole section of the clause is difficult. Theoretically, it could describe one, two, or three different ways of preparing first ripe grain offerings (J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 27). The translation here takes it as a description of only one kind of prepared grain. This is suggested by the fact that v. 16 uses only one term &#8220;crushed bits&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1513;&#1474;</font>, <font face="Scholar">geres</font>) to refer back to the grain as it is prepared in v. 14 (a more technical translation is &#8220;groats&#8221;; see J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:178, 194). Cf. NAB &#8220;fresh grits of new ears of grain&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;coarse new grain from fresh ears.&#8221;</p>
