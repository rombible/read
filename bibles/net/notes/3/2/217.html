<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=50><b>tc</b> There are several person, gender, and voice verb problems in this verse. First, the MT has &#8220;And you shall bring the grain offering,&#8221; but the LXX and Qumran have &#8220;he&#8221; rather than &#8220;you&#8221; (J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:185). Second, the MT has &#8220;which shall be made&#8221; (i.e., the 3rd person masculine Niphal passive verb which, in fact, does not agree with its feminine subject, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">minkhah</font>, &#8220;grain offering&#8221;), while the LXX has &#8220;which he shall make&#8221; (3rd person Qal), thus agreeing with the LXX 3rd person verb at the beginning of the verse (see above). Third, the MT has a 3rd person <i>vav</i> consecutive verb &#8220;and he shall present it to the priest,&#8221; which agrees with the LXX but is not internally consistent with the 2nd person verb at the beginning of the verse in the MT. The <i>BHS</i> editors conjecture that the latter might be repointed to an imperative verb yielding &#8220;present it to the priest.&#8221; This would require no change of consonants and corresponds to the person of the first verb in the MT. This solution has been tentatively accepted here (cf. also J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 26-27), even though it neither resolves the gender problem of the second verb nor fits the general grammatical pattern of the chapter in the MT.</p>
