<A NAME="22"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=35><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term for &#8220;choice wheat flour&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1465;&#1500;&#1462;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">selet</font>) is often translated &#8220;fine flour&#8221; (cf. KJV, NAB, NIV, NCV), but it refers specifically to wheat as opposed to barley (B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 10). Moreover, the translation &#8220;flour&#8221; might be problematic, since the Hebrew term may designate the &#8220;grits&#8221; rather than the more finely ground &#8220;flour&#8221; (see J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:179 as opposed to Levine, 10, and J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 30).</p>
