<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=47><b>tn</b> There is no <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>, &#8220;and&#8221;) in the MT at the beginning of v. 6 and the verb is pointed as an infinite absolute. The present translation has rendered it as an imperative (see GKC 346 §113.<i>bb</i>) and, therefore, the same for the following <i>vav</i> consecutive perfect verb (cf. NIV &#8220;Crumble it and pour oil on it&#8221;; cf. also NRSV, NEB, NLT, and J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:185, but note the objections to this rendering in J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 26). The LXX seems to suggest adding a <i>vav</i> (&#8220;and&#8221;) and pointing the verb as a consecutive perfect, which yields &#8220;and you shall break it in pieces&#8221; (cf. the <i>BHS</i> textual note; Hartley, 26, prefers the LXX rendering).</p>
