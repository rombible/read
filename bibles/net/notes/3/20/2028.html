<A NAME="2028"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=993><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in fire they shall burn him and them.&#8221; The active plural verb sometimes requires a passive translation (GKC 460 §144.<i>f</i>, <i>g</i>), esp. when no active plural subject has been expressed in the context. The present translation specifies &#8220;burned to death&#8221; because the traditional rendering &#8220;burnt with fire&#8221; (KJV, ASV; NASB &#8220;burned with fire&#8221;) could be understood to mean &#8220;branded&#8221; or otherwise burned, but not fatally.</p>
