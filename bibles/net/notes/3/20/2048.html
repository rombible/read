<A NAME="2048"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1013><b>tn</b> This is not the most frequently-used Hebrew verb for stoning, but a word that refers to the action of throwing, slinging, or pelting someone with stones (see the note on v. 2 above). Smr and LXX have &#8220;you [plural] shall pelt them with stones.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> At first glance Lev 20:27 appears to be out of place but, on closer examination, one could argue that it constitutes the back side of an envelope around the case laws in 20:9-21, with Lev 20:6 forming the front of the envelope (note also that execution of mediums and spiritists by stoning in v. 27 is not explicitly stated in v. 6). This creates a chiastic structure: prohibition against mediums and spiritists (vv. 6 and 27), variations of the holiness formula (vv. 7 and 25-26), and exhortations to obey the <sc>Lord&#8217;s statutes (and judgments; vv. 8 and 22-24). Again, in the middle are the case laws (vv. 9-21).</p>
