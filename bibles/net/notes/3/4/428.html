<A NAME="428"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=104><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he shall slaughter.&#8221; The singular verb seems to refer to an individual who represents the whole congregation, perhaps one of the elders referred to at the beginning of the verse, or the officiating priest (cf. v. 21). The LXX and Syriac make the verb plural, referring to &#8220;the elders of the congregation.&#8221;</p>
