<A NAME="448"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=124><b>tn</b> Lev 4:22b-23a is difficult. The present translation suggests that there are two possible legal situations envisioned, separated by the Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">o</font>, &#8220;or&#8221;) at the beginning of v. 23. Lev 4:22b refers to any case in which the leader readily admits his guilt (i.e., &#8220;pleads guilty&#8221;), whereas v. 23a refers to cases where the leader is convicted of his guilt by legal action (&#8220;his sin&#8230;is made known to him&#8221;). See R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 2:95-96; Lev 4:27-28; and esp. the notes on Lev 5:1 below.</p>
