<A NAME="432"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=108><b>tc</b> The MT reads literally, &#8220;and the priest shall dip his finger from the blood and sprinkle seven times.&#8221; This is awkward. Compare v. 6, which has literally, &#8220;and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle from the blood seven times.&#8221; The MT appears to be corrupt by haplography (i.e., assuming v. 6 to be the correct form, in v. 17 the scribe skipped from &#8220;his finger&#8221; to &#8220;from the blood,&#8221; thus missing &#8220;in the blood&#8221;) and metathesis (i.e., this also resulted in a text where &#8220;from the blood&#8221; stands before &#8220;sprinkle&#8221; rather than after it; J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 47).</p>
