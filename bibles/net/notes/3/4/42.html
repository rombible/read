<A NAME="42"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=78><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And a person, when he sins in straying.&#8221; The English translation of &#8220;by straying&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1490;&#1464;&#1490;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">bishgagah</font>] literally, &#8220;in going astray; in making an error&#8221;) varies greatly, but almost all suggest that this term refers to sins that were committed by mistake or done not knowing that the particular act was sinful (J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:228-29). See, e.g., LXX &#8220;involuntarily&#8221;; <i>Tg. Onq. </i>&#8220;by neglect&#8221;; KJV &#8220;through ignorance&#8221;; ASV, RSV, NJPS &#8220;unwittingly&#8221;; NASB, NIV, NRSV, NLT &#8220;unintentionally&#8221;; NAB, NEB &#8220;inadvertently&#8221;; NCV &#8220;by accident.&#8221; However, we know from Num 15:27-31 that committing a sin &#8220;by straying&#8221; is the opposite of committing a sin &#8220;defiantly&#8221; (i.e., <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1497;&#1463;&#1491; &#1512;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">bÿyad ramah</font>] &#8220;with a raised hand,&#8221; v. 30). In the latter case the person, as it were, raises his fist in presumptuous defiance against the <sc>Lord. Thus, he &#8220;blasphemes&#8221; the <sc>Lord and has &#8220;despised&#8221; his word, for which he should be &#8220;cut off from among his people&#8221; (Num 15:30-31). One could not bring an offering for such a sin. The expression here in Lev 4:2 combines &#8220;by straying&#8221; with the preposition &#8220;from&#8221; which fits naturally with &#8220;straying&#8221; (i.e., &#8220;straying from&#8221; the <sc>Lord&#8217;s commandments). For sins committed &#8220;by straying&#8221; from the commandments (Lev 4 throughout) or other types of transgressions (Lev 5:1-6) there was indeed forgiveness available through the sin offering. See R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 2:94-95.</p>
