<A NAME="1726"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=841><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will give my faces against [literally &#8220;in&#8221;] the soul/person/life [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>, feminine] who eats the blood and I will cut it [i.e., that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>] off from the midst of its people.&#8221; The uses of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> in this and the following verse are most significant for the use of animal blood in Israel&#8217;s sacrificial system. Unfortunately, it is a most difficult word to translate accurately and consistently, and this presents a major problem for the rendering of these verses (see, e.g., G. J. Wenham, <i>Leviticus</i> [NICOT], 244-45). No matter which translation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> one uses here, it is important to see that both man and animal have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> and that this <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> is identified with the blood. See the further remarks on v. 11 below. On the &#8220;cutting off&#8221; penalty see the note on v. 4 above. In this instance, God takes it on himself to &#8220;cut off&#8221; the person (i.e., extirpation). </p>
