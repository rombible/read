<A NAME="1730"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=845><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for the blood, it by (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bet</font> preposition, &#8220;in&#8221;] the life makes atonement.&#8221; The interpretation of the preposition is pivotal here. Some scholars have argued that it is a <i>bet</i> of exchange; that is, &#8220;the blood makes atonement in exchange for the life [of the slaughtered animal]&#8221; (see R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 2:694-95, 697 for analysis and criticism of this view). It is more likely that, as in the previous clause (&#8220;your lives&#8221;), &#8220;life/soul&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>) here refers to the person who makes the offering, not the animal offered. The blood of the animal makes atonement for the person who offers it either &#8220;by means of&#8221; (instrumental <i>bet</i>) the &#8220;life/soul&#8221; of the animal, which it symbolizes or embodies (the meaning of the translation given here); or perhaps the blood of the animal functions as &#8220;the price&#8221; (<i>bet </i>of price) for ransoming the &#8220;life/soul&#8221; of the person.</p>
