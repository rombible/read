<A NAME="171"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=816><b>tn</b> The complex wording of vv. 3-4 requires stating &#8220;blood guilt&#8221; at the beginning of v. 3 even though it is not mentioned until the middle of v. 4. The Hebrew text has simply &#8220;blood,&#8221; but in this case it refers to the illegitimate shedding of animal blood, similar to the shedding of the blood of an innocent human being (Deut 19:10, etc.). In order for it to be legitimate the animal must be slaughtered at the tabernacle and its blood handled by the priests in the prescribed way (see, e.g., Lev 1:5; 3:2, 17; 4:5-7; 7:26-27, etc.; cf. vv. 10-16 below for more details).</p>
