<A NAME="141"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=606><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and.&#8221; Here KJV, ASV use a semicolon; NASB begins a new sentence with &#8220;Now.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="142"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=607><b>tn</b> The alternative rendering, &#8220;when it is reported to the priest&#8221; may be better in light of the fact that the priest had to go outside the camp. Since he or she had been declared &#8220;unclean&#8221; by a priest (Lev 13:3) and was, therefore, required to remain outside the camp (13:46), the formerly diseased person could not reenter the camp until he or she had been declared &#8220;clean&#8221; by a priest (cf. Lev 13:6 for &#8220;declaring clean.&#8221;). See especially J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>(AB), 1:831, who supports this rendering both here and in Lev 13:2 and 9. B. A. Levine, however, prefers the rendering in the text (<i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 76 and 85). It is the most natural meaning of the verb (i.e., &#8220;to be brought&#8221; from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;</font> [<font face="Scholar">bo</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to come&#8221;] in the Hophal stem, which means &#8220;to be brought&#8221; in all other occurrences in Leviticus other than 13:2, 9, and 14:2; see only 6:30; 10:18; 11:32; and 16:27), it suits the context well in 13:2, and the rendering &#8220;to be brought&#8221; is supported by 13:7b, &#8220;he shall show himself to the priest a second time.&#8221; Although it is true that the priest needed to go outside the camp to examine such a person, the person still needed to &#8220;be brought&#8221; to the priest there. The translation of vv. 2-3 employed here suggests that v. 2 introduces the proceeding and then v. 3 goes on to describe the specific details of the examination and purification.</p>
<A NAME="143"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=608><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he shall be brought to the priest and the priest shall go out to from outside to the camp and the priest shall see [it].&#8221; The understood &#8220;it&#8221; refers to the skin infection itself (see the note on 13:3 above). The referent has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=609><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And behold, the diseased infection has been healed from the diseased person.&#8221; The expression &#8220;diseased infection&#8221; has been translated as simply &#8220;infection&#8221; to avoid redundancy here in terms of English style.</p>
<A NAME="145"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=610><b>tn</b> The term rendered here &#8220;crimson fabric&#8221; consists of two Hebrew words and means literally, &#8220;crimson of worm&#8221; (in this order only in Lev 14:4, 6, 49, 51, 52 and Num 19:6; for the more common reverse order, &#8220;worm of crimson,&#8221; see, e.g., the colored fabrics used in making the tabernacle, Exod 25:4, etc.). This particular &#8220;worm&#8221; is an insect that lives on the leaves of palm trees, the eggs of which are the source for a &#8220;crimson&#8221; dye used to color various kinds of cloth (B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 86). That a kind of dyed &#8220;fabric&#8221; is intended, not just the dye substance itself, is made certain by the dipping of it along with the other ritual materials listed here into the blood and water mixture for sprinkling on the person being cleansed (Lev 14:6; cf. also the burning of it in the fire of the red heifer in Num 19:6). Both the reddish color of cedar wood and the crimson colored fabric seem to correspond to the color of blood and may, therefore, symbolize either &#8220;life,&#8221; which is in the blood, or the use of blood to &#8220;make atonement&#8221; (see, e.g., Gen 9:4 and Lev 17:11). See further the note on v. 7 below. </p>
<A NAME="146"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=611><b>sn</b> <i>Twigs of hyssop</i> (probably one or several species of <i>marjoram thymus</i>), a spice and herb plant that grows out of walls in Palestine (see 1 Kgs 4:33 [5:13 HT], <i>HALOT</i> 27 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1494;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;</font>, and J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 195), were particularly leafy and therefore especially useful for sprinkling the purifying liquid (cf. vv. 5-7). Many of the details of the ritual procedure are obscure. It has been proposed, for example, that the &#8220;cedar wood&#8221; was a stick to which the hyssop was bound with the crimson material to make a sort of sprinkling instrument (Hartley, 195). In light of the burning of these three materials as part of the preparation of the ashes of the red heifer in Num 19:5-6, however, this seems unlikely.</p>
<A NAME="147"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=612><b>tn</b> The MT reads literally, &#8220;And the priest shall command and he shall take.&#8221; Clearly, the second verb (&#8220;and he shall take&#8221;) contains the thrust of the priest&#8217;s command, which suggests the translation &#8220;that he take&#8221; (cf. also v. 5a). Since the priest issues the command here, he cannot be the subject of the second verb because he cannot be commanding himself to &#8220;take&#8221; up these ritual materials. Moreover, since the ritual is being performed &#8220;for the one being cleansed,&#8221; the antecedent of the pronoun &#8220;he&#8221; cannot refer to him. The LXX, Smr, and Syriac versions have the third person plural here and in v. 5a, which corresponds to other combinations with the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1510;&#1460;&#1493;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿtsivvah</font>) &#8220;and he (the priest) shall command&#8221; in this context (see Lev 13:54; 14:36, 40). This suggests an impersonal (i.e., &#8220;someone shall take&#8221; and &#8220;someone shall slaughter,&#8221; respectively) or perhaps even passive rendering of the verbs in 14:4, 5 (i.e., &#8220;there shall be taken&#8221; and &#8220;there shall be slaughtered,&#8221; respectively). The latter option has been chosen here. </p>
<A NAME="148"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=613><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the one cleansing himself&#8221; (i.e., Hitpael participle of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;&#1461;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">taher</font>, &#8220;to be clean&#8221;). </p>
<A NAME="149"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=614><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And the priest shall command and he shall slaughter.&#8221; See the note on &#8220;be taken up&#8221; (v. 4). </p>
<A NAME="1410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=615><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;into a vessel of clay over living water.&#8221; The expression &#8220;living [i.e., &#8216;fresh&#8217;] water&#8221; (cf. Lev 14:50; 15:13; Num 19:17) refers to water that flows. It includes such water sources as artesian wells (Gen 26:19; Song of Songs 4:15), springs (Jer 2:13, as opposed to cisterns; cf. 17:13), and flowing streams (Zech 14:8). In other words, this is water that has not stood stagnant as, for example, in a sealed-off cistern. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Although there are those who argue that the water and the blood rites are separate (e.g., E. S. Gerstenberger, <i>Leviticus</i> [OTL], 175-76), it is usually agreed that v. 5b refers to the slaughtering of the bird in such a way that its blood runs into the bowl, which contained fresh water (see, e.g., N. H. Snaith, <i>Leviticus and Numbers</i> [NCBC], 74; G. J. Wenham, <i>Leviticus</i> [NICOT], 208; J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:836-38; cf. esp. Lev 14:51b, &#8220;and dip them in the blood of the slaughtered bird <i>and in</i> the fresh water&#8221;). This mixture of blood and water was then to be sprinkled on the person being cleansed from the disease.</p>
<A NAME="1411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=616><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the live bird he [i.e., the priest] shall take it.&#8221; Although the MT has no <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vav</font>, &#8220;and&#8221;) at the beginning of this clause, a few medieval Hebrew <sc>mss and Smr have one and the LXX, Syriac, and Vulgate translate as if it is there. The &#8220;but&#8221; in the present translation reflects this text critical background, the object-first word order in the clause with the resumptive pronoun at the end, and the obvious contrast between the slaughtered bird in v. 5 and the live bird in v. 6.</p>
<A NAME="1412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=617><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the one cleansing himself&#8221; (i.e., Hitpael participle of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;&#1461;&#1512;</font> [<font face="Scholar">taher</font>, &#8220;to be clean&#8221;]).</p>
<A NAME="1413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=618><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he shall make him clean.&#8221; The verb is the Piel of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">taher</font>, &#8220;to be clean&#8221;), here used as a so-called &#8220;declarative&#8221; Piel (i.e., &#8220;to declare clean&#8221;; cf. 13:6, etc.).</p>
<A NAME="1414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=619><b>sn</b> The reddish color of cedar wood and the crimson colored fabric called for in v. 4 (see the note there, esp. the association with the color of blood) as well as the priestly commands to bring &#8220;two live&#8221; birds (v. 4a), to slaughter one of them &#8220;over fresh water&#8221; (literally &#8220;<i>living </i>water,&#8221; v. 5b), and the subsequent ritual with the (second) &#8220;live&#8221; bird (vv. 6-7) combine to communicate the concept of &#8220;life&#8221; and &#8220;being alive&#8221; in this passage. This contrasts with the fear of death associated with the serious skin diseases in view here (see, e.g., Aaron&#8217;s description of Miriam&#8217;s skin disease in Num 12:12, &#8220;Do not let her be like the dead one when it goes out from its mother&#8217;s womb and its flesh half eaten away&#8221;). Since the slaughtered bird here is not sacrificed at the altar and is not designated as an expiatory &#8220;sin offering,&#8221; this ritual procedure probably symbolizes the renewed life of the diseased person and displays it publicly for all to see. It is preparatory to the expiatory rituals that will follow (vv. 10-20, esp. vv. 18-20), but is not itself expiatory. Thus, although there are important similarities between the bird ritual here, the scapegoat on the Day of Atonement (Lev 16:20-22), and the red heifer for cleansing from corpse contamination (Num 19), this bird ritual is different in that the latter two constitute &#8220;sin offerings&#8221; (Lev 16:5, 8-10; Num 19:9, 17). Neither of the birds in Lev 14:4-7 is designated or treated as a &#8220;sin offering.&#8221; Nevertheless, the very nature of the live bird ritual itself and its obvious similarity to the scapegoat ritual suggests that the patient&#8217;s disease has been removed far away so that he or she is free from its effects both personally and communally. </p>
<A NAME="1415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=620><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the one cleansing himself&#8221; (i.e., Hitpael participle of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;&#1461;&#1512;</font> [<font face="Scholar">taher</font>, &#8220;to be clean&#8221;]). </p>
<A NAME="1416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=621><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he shall be clean&#8221; (so ASV). The end result of the ritual procedures in vv. 4-7 and the washing and shaving in v. 8a is that the formerly diseased person has now officially become clean in the sense that he can reenter the community (see v. 8b; contrast living outside the community as an unclean diseased person, Lev 13:46). There are, however, further cleansing rituals and pronouncements for him to undergo in the tabernacle as outlined in vv. 10-20 (see Qal &#8220;be[come] clean&#8221; in vv. 9 and 20, Piel &#8220;pronounce clean&#8221; in v. 11, and Hitpael &#8220;the one being cleansed&#8221; in vv. 11, 14, 17, 18, and 19). Obviously, in order to enter the tabernacle he must already &#8220;be clean&#8221; in the sense of having access to the community.</p>
<A NAME="1417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=622><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And it shall be on the seventh day.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=623><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he shall be clean&#8221; (see the note on v. 8).</p>
<A NAME="1419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=624><b>tn</b> The subject &#8220;he&#8221; probably refers to the formerly diseased person in this case (see the notes on Lev 1:5a, 6a, and 9a). </p>
<A NAME="1420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=625><b>tn</b> This term is often rendered &#8220;fine flour,&#8221; but it refers specifically to wheat as opposed to barley (B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 10) and, although the translation &#8220;flour&#8221; is used here, it may indicate &#8220;grits&#8221; rather than finely ground flour (J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:179; see the note on Lev 2:1). The unit of measure is most certainly an &#8220;ephah&#8221; even though it is not stated explicitly (see, e.g., Num 28:5; cf. 15:4, 6, 8), and three-tenths of an ephah would amount to about a gallon, or perhaps one-third of a bushel (J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 196; Milgrom, 845). Since the normal amount of flour for a lamb is one-tenth of an ephah (Num 28:4-5; cf. 15:4), three-tenths is about right for the three lambs offered in Lev 14:10-20. </p>
<A NAME="1421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=626><b>tn</b> A &#8220;log&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1490;</font>, <font face="Scholar">log</font>) of oil is about one-sixth of a liter, or one-third of a pint, or two-thirds of a cup. </p>
<A NAME="1422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=627><b>tn</b> The MT here is awkward to translate into English. It reads literally, &#8220;and the priest who pronounces clean (Piel participle of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;&#1461;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">taher</font>) shall cause to stand (Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1491;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">amad</font>) the man who is cleansing himself (Hitpael participle of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;&#1461;&#1512;</font>) and them&#8221; (i.e., the offerings listed in v. 10; the referent has been specified in the translation for clarity). Alternatively, the Piel of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;&#1461;&#1512;</font> could be rendered &#8220;who performs the cleansing/purification&#8221; (J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:827), perhaps even as a technical term for one who holds the office of &#8220;purification priest&#8221; (B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 87). It is probably better, however, to retain the same meaning here as in v. 7 above (see the note there regarding the declarative Piel use of this verb). </p>
<A NAME="1423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=628><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And the priest shall take the one lamb.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=629><b>tn</b> See the note on Lev 5:15 above. The primary purpose of the &#8220;guilt offering&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">asham</font>) was to &#8220;atone&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kipper</font>, &#8220;to make atonement,&#8221; see v. 18 below and the note on Lev 1:4) for &#8220;trespassing&#8221; on the <sc>Lord&#8217;s &#8220;holy things,&#8221; whether sacred objects or sacred people. It is, therefore, closely associated with the reconsecration of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s holy people as, for example, here and in the case of the corpse contaminated Nazirite (Num 6:11b-12). Since the nation of Israel was &#8220;a kingdom of priests and a <i>holy</i> nation&#8221; to the <sc>Lord (Exod 19:6; cf. the blood splashed on all the people in Exod 24:8), the skin diseased person was essentially a member of the &#8220;holy nation&#8221; who had been expelled from the community. Therefore, he or she had been desecrated and the guilt offering was essential to restoring him or her to the community. In fact, the manipulation of blood and oil in the guilt offering ritual procedure for the healed person (see vv. 14-18 below) is reminiscent of that employed for the ordination offering in the consecration of the holy Aaronic priests of the nation (Exod 29:19-21; Lev 8:22-30). </p>

See the note on Lev 7:30 and the literature cited there. Other possible translations include &#8220;elevate them [as] an elevation offering before the <sc>Lord&#8221; (cf. NRSV) or &#8220;present them [as] a presentation offering before the <sc>Lord.&#8221; To be sure, the actual physical &#8220;waving&#8221; of a male lamb seems unlikely, but some waving gesture may have been performed in the presentation of the offering (cf. also the &#8220;waving&#8221; of the Levites as a &#8220;wave offering&#8221; in Num 8:11, etc.). </p>

<A NAME="1430"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=635><b>tn</b> Since the priest himself presents this offering as a wave offering (v. 12), it would seem that the offering is already in his hands and he would, therefore, be the one who slaughtered the male lamb in this instance rather than the offerer. Smr and LXX make the second verb &#8220;to slaughter&#8221; plural rather than singular, which suggests that it is to be taken as an impersonal passive (see J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:852). </p>

Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:852), but the seemingly unnecessary repetition of &#8220;priest&#8221; in several verses throughout the chapter argues against this (see esp. vv. 3, 14, 18, 20, 24, and 26). Moreover, in this case, &#8220;priest&#8221; may be repeated to avoid confusing the priest&#8217;s hand with that of the one being cleansed (cf. v. 14). </p>
