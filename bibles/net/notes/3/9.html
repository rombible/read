<A NAME="91"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=351><b>sn</b> This <i>eighth day</i> is the one after the seven days of ordination referred to in Lev 8:33-35.</p>
<A NAME="92"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=352><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;called to&#8221;; CEV, NLT &#8220;called together.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="93"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=353><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a he-goat of goats.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="94"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=354><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and a calf and a lamb, sons of a year, flawless&#8221;; KJV, ASV, NRSV &#8220;without blemish&#8221;; NASB, NIV &#8220;without defect&#8221;; NLT &#8220;with no physical defects.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="95"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=355><b>tn</b> The verb is either a prophetic perfect (&#8220;will appear to you&#8221;) as in the MT (cf. <i>IBHS</i> §30.5.1.e; so many English versions), or a <i>futurum instans</i> participle (&#8220;is going to appear to you&#8221;) as in the LXX and several other versions (see the <i>BHS</i> footnote; cf. <i>IBHS</i> 627 §37.6f). In either case, the point is that Moses was anticipating that the <sc>Lord would indeed appear to them on this day (cf. vv. 6, 22-24).</p>
<A NAME="96"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=356><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to the faces of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="97"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=357><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;which the <sc>Lord commanded you shall/should do.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="98"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=358><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the glory of the <sc>Lord will appear,&#8221; but the construction with the simple <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) plus the imperfect/jussive (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1461;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">vÿyera</font>&#8217;; literally, &#8220;and he will appear&#8221;) suggests purpose in this context, not just succession of events (i.e., &#8220;so that he might appear&#8221;). </p>
<A NAME="99"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=359><b>tn</b> Instead of &#8220;on behalf of the people,&#8221; the LXX has &#8220;on behalf of your house&#8221; as in the Hebrew text of Lev 16:6, 11, 17. Many commentaries follow the LXX here (e.g., J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:578; J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 118) as do a few English versions (e.g., NAB), but others argue that, as on the Day of Atonement (Lev 16), the offerings of the priests also effected the people, even though there was still the need to have special offerings made on behalf of the people as reflected in the second half of the verse (e.g., B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 56).</p>
<A NAME="910"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=360><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=361><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he burned with fire,&#8221; an expression which is sometimes redundant in English, but here means &#8220;burned up,&#8221; &#8220;burned up entirely.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=362><b>sn</b> See Lev 4:5-12 and the notes there regarding the sin offering for priest(s). The distinction here is that the blood of the sin offering for the priests was applied to the horns of the burnt offering altar in the court of the tabernacle, not the incense altar inside the tabernacle tent itself. See the notes on Lev 8:14-15.</p>
<A NAME="913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=363><b>tn</b> For smoothness in the English translation, &#8220;his&#8221; was used in place of &#8220;Aaron&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=364><b>tn</b> The verb is a Hiphil form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">matsa</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to find&#8221; (i.e., causative, literally &#8220;to cause to find,&#8221; but here the meaning is &#8220;to hand to&#8221; or &#8220;pass to&#8221;; see J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 117-18, and J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:581-82). The distinction between this verb and &#8220;presented&#8221; in v. 9 above (see the note there) is that in v. 9 Aaron&#8217;s sons held the bowl while Aaron manipulated some of the blood at the altar, while here in v. 12 they simply handed the bowl to him so he could splash all the blood around on the altar (Milgrom, 581).</p>
<A NAME="915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=365><b>tn</b> For &#8220;splashed&#8221; (also in v. 18) see the note on Lev 1:5.</p>
<A NAME="916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=366><b>tn</b> See the note on v. 12.</p>
<A NAME="917"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=367><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the burnt offering they handed to him to its parts and the head.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=368><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;and performed a decontamination rite [with] it&#8221; reads literally in the MT, &#8220;and decontaminated [with] it.&#8221; The verb is the Piel of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1496;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kht</font>&#8217;, Qal = &#8220;to sin&#8221;), which means &#8220;to decontaminate, purify&#8221; (i.e., &#8220;to de-sin&#8221;; see the note on Lev 8:15). </p>
<A NAME="919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=369><b>sn</b> The phrase &#8220;like the first one&#8221; at the end of the verse refers back to the sin offering for the priests described in vv. 8-11 above. The blood of the sin offering of the common people was applied to the burnt offering altar just like that of the priests.</p>
<A NAME="920"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=370><b>tn</b> The term &#8220;standard regulation&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1496;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mishpat</font>) here refers to the set of regulations for burnt offering goats in Lev 1:10-13. Cf. KJV &#8220;according to the manner&#8221;; ASV, NASB &#8220;according to the ordinance&#8221;; NIV, NLT &#8220;in the prescribed way&#8221;; CEV &#8220;in the proper way.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="921"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=371><b>sn</b> The latter part of the verse (&#8220;in addition to the morning burnt offering&#8221;) refers to the complex of morning (and evening) burnt and grain offerings that was the daily regulation for the tabernacle from the time of its erection (Exod 40:29). The regulations for it were appended to the end of the section of priestly consecration regulations in Exod 29 (see Exod 29:38-40) precisely because they were to be maintained throughout the priestly consecration period and beyond (Lev 8:33-36). Thus, the morning burnt and grain offerings would already have been placed on the altar before the inaugural burnt and grain offerings referred to here.</p>
<A NAME="922"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=372><b>tn</b> See the note on Lev 9:12.</p>
<A NAME="923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=373><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And the fat from the ox and from the ram.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="924"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=374><b>tn</b> The text here has only the participle &#8220;the cover&#8221; or &#8220;that which covers,&#8221; which is elliptical for &#8220;the fat which covers the entrails&#8221; (see Lev 3:3, 9, 14; 7:3).</p>
<A NAME="925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=375><b>tn</b> The plural &#8220;they&#8221; refers to the sons of Aaron (cf. v. 18). The LXX, Smr, and Syriac have singular &#8220;he,&#8221; referring to Aaron alone as in the latter half of the verse (the singular is followed here by NLT). Cf. NCV &#8220;Aaron&#8217;s sons put them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=376><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from to the faces of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The rendering here is based on the use of &#8220;my faces&#8221; and &#8220;your faces&#8221; referring to the very &#8220;presence&#8221; of the <sc>Lord in Exod 33:14-15. </p>
<A NAME="927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=377><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fell on their faces.&#8221; Many English versions and commentaries render here &#8220;shouted for joy&#8221; (e.g., NIV; cf. NCV, NLT) or &#8220;shouted joyfully,&#8221; but the fact the people &#8220;fell on their faces&#8221; immediately afterward suggests that they were frightened as, for example, in Exod 19:16b; 20:18-21.</p>
