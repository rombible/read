<a name="112"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=12><b>tn</b> &#8220;To make atonement&#8221; is the standard translation of the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;</font>, (<font face="Scholar">kipper</font>); cf. however TEV &#8220;as a sacrifice to take away his sins&#8221; (CEV similar). The English word derives from a combination of &#8220;at&#8221; plus Middle English &#8220;one[ment],&#8221; referring primarily to reconciliation or reparation that is made in order to accomplish reconciliation. The primary meaning of the Hebrew verb, however, is &#8220;to wipe [something off (or on)]&#8221; (see esp. the goal of the sin offering, Lev 4, &#8220;to purge&#8221; the tabernacle from impurities), but in some cases it refers metaphorically to &#8220;wiping away&#8221; anything that might stand in the way of good relations by bringing a gift (see, e.g., Gen 32:20 [21 HT], &#8220;to appease; to pacify&#8221; as an illustration of this). The translation &#8220;make atonement&#8221; has been retained here because, ultimately, the goal of either purging or appeasing was to maintain a proper relationship between the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> (who dwelt in the tabernacle) and Israelites in whose midst the tabernacle was pitched (see R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 2:689-710 for a full discussion of the Hebrew word meaning &#8220;to make atonement&#8221; and its theological significance).</p>
