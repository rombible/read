<a name="117"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=17><b>tc</b> A few medieval Hebrew <span class="smallcaps">mss</span>, Smr, LXX, Syriac, and <i>Tg. Onq. </i>have plural &#8220;priests&#8221; here (cf. 1:5, 8) rather than the MT singular &#8220;priest&#8221; (cf. NAB). The singular &#8220;priest&#8221; would mean (1) Aaron, the (high) priest, or (2) the officiating priest, as in Lev 1:9 (cf. 6:10 [3 HT], etc.). &#8220;The sons of Aaron&#8221; is probably a textual corruption caused by conflation with Lev 1:5, 8 (cf. the remarks in J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 13).</p>
