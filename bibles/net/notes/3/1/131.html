<a name="131"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=31><b>tn</b> This translation (&#8220;remove its entrails by [cutting off] its tail feathers&#8221;) is based on the discussion in J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>(AB), 1:169-71, although he translates, &#8220;remove its crissum by its feathers.&#8221; Others possibilities include &#8220;its crop with its contents&#8221; (<i>Tg. Onq.</i>, cf. NIV, NRSV; J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 23) or &#8220;its crop with its feathers&#8221; (LXX, NASB, RSV; &#8220;crop&#8221; refers to the enlarged part of a bird&#8217;s gullet that serves a pouch for the preliminary maceration of food).</p>
