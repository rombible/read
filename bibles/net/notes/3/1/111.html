<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>tn</b> The NIV correctly has &#8220;it&#8221; in the text, referring to the acceptance of the animal (cf., e.g., RSV, NEB, NLT), but &#8220;he&#8221; in the margin, referring to the acceptance of the offerer (cf. ASV, NASB, JB). The reference to a &#8220;flawless male&#8221; in the first half of this verse suggests that the issue here is the acceptability of the animal to make atonement <i>on behalf of </i>the offerer (Lev 1:4; cf. NRSV &#8220;for acceptance in your behalf&#8221;).</p>
