<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2><b>sn</b> The second clause of v. 1, &#8220;and the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> spoke to him from the tent of meeting, saying,&#8221; introduces the following discourse. This is a standard introductory formula (see, e.g., Exod 20:1; 25:1; 31:1; etc.). The combination of the first and second clauses is, therefore, &#8220;bulky&#8221; because of the way they happen to be juxtaposed in this transitional verse (J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 8). The first clause of v. 1 connects the book back to the end of the Book of Exodus while the second looks forward the ritual legislation that follows in Lev 1:2ff. There are two &#8220;Tents of Meeting&#8221;: the one that stood outside the camp (see, e.g., Exod 33:7) and the one that stood in the midst of the camp (Exod 40:2; Num 2:2ff) and served as the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s residence until the construction of the temple in the days of Solomon (Exod 27:21; 29:4; 1 Kgs 8:4; 2 Chr 5:5, etc.; cf. 2 Sam 7:6). Exod 40:35 uses both &#8220;tabernacle&#8221; and &#8220;tent of meeting&#8221; to refer to the same tent: &#8220;Moses could not enter the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and the glory of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> filled the tabernacle.&#8221; It is clear that &#8220;tent of meeting&#8221; in Lev 1:1 refers to the &#8220;tabernacle.&#8221; The latter term refers to the tent as a &#8220;residence,&#8221; while the former refers to it as a divinely appointed place of &#8220;meeting&#8221; between God and man (see R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 2:873-77 and 2:1130-34). This corresponds to the change in terms in Exod 40:35, where &#8220;tent of meeting&#8221; is used when referring to Moses&#8217; inability to enter the tent, but &#8220;tabernacle&#8221; when referring to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> taking up residence there in the form of the glory cloud. The quotation introduced here extends from Lev 1:2 through 3:17, and encompasses the burnt, grain, and peace offering regulations. Compare the notes on Lev 4:1; 5:14; and 6:1 [5:20 HT] below.</p>
