This is somewhat awkward, especially in terms of English style; most English versions reverse this and place &#8220;<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221; in the first clause (right after &#8220;called&#8221;). The Syriac version does the same.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The best explanation for the MT of Lev 1:1 arises from its function as a transition from Exod 40 to Lev 1. The first clause, &#8220;And he (the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>) called to Moses,&#8221; links v. 1 back to Exod 40:35, &#8220;But Moses was not able to enter into the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled on it and the glory of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> had filled the tabernacle&#8221; (cf. J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:134). Exod 40:36-38 is a parenthetical explanation of the ongoing function of the cloud in leading the people through the wilderness. Since Moses could not enter the tent of meeting, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> &#8220;called&#8221; to him &#8220;from&#8221; the tent of meeting.</p>
