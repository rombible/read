<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>tn</b> The verb &#8220;presents&#8221; is cognate to the noun &#8220;offering&#8221; in v. 2 and throughout the book of Leviticus (both from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;</font> [<font face="Scholar">qrb</font>]). One could translate the verb &#8220;offers,&#8221; but this becomes awkward and, in fact, inaccurate in some passages. For example, in Lev 9:9 this verb is used for the presenting or giving of the blood to Aaron so that he could offer it to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. The blood is certainly not being &#8220;offered&#8221; as an offering to Aaron there.</p>
