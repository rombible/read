<A NAME="927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=377><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fell on their faces.&#8221; Many English versions and commentaries render here &#8220;shouted for joy&#8221; (e.g., NIV; cf. NCV, NLT) or &#8220;shouted joyfully,&#8221; but the fact the people &#8220;fell on their faces&#8221; immediately afterward suggests that they were frightened as, for example, in Exod 19:16b; 20:18-21.</p>
