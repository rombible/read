<A NAME="925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=375><b>tn</b> The plural &#8220;they&#8221; refers to the sons of Aaron (cf. v. 18). The LXX, Smr, and Syriac have singular &#8220;he,&#8221; referring to Aaron alone as in the latter half of the verse (the singular is followed here by NLT). Cf. NCV &#8220;Aaron&#8217;s sons put them.&#8221;</p>
