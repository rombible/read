<A NAME="914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=364><b>tn</b> The verb is a Hiphil form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">matsa</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to find&#8221; (i.e., causative, literally &#8220;to cause to find,&#8221; but here the meaning is &#8220;to hand to&#8221; or &#8220;pass to&#8221;; see J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 117-18, and J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:581-82). The distinction between this verb and &#8220;presented&#8221; in v. 9 above (see the note there) is that in v. 9 Aaron&#8217;s sons held the bowl while Aaron manipulated some of the blood at the altar, while here in v. 12 they simply handed the bowl to him so he could splash all the blood around on the altar (Milgrom, 581).</p>
