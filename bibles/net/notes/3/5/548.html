<A NAME="548"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=191><b>tn</b> The word for &#8220;guilt offering&#8221; (sometimes translated &#8220;reparation offering&#8221;) is the same as &#8220;guilt&#8221; earlier in the verse (rendered there &#8220;[penalty for] guilt&#8221;). One can tell which is intended only by the context.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The primary purpose of the <i>guilt offering</i> was to &#8220;atone&#8221; (see the note on Lev 1:4 above) for &#8220;trespassing&#8221; on the <sc>Lord&#8217;s &#8220;holy things&#8221; (see later in this verse) or the property of others in the community (Lev 6:1-7 [5:20-26 HT]; 19:20-22; Num 5:5-10). It was closely associated with reconsecration of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s sacred things or his sacred people (see, e.g., Lev 14:12-18; Num 6:11b-12). Moreover, there was usually an associated reparation made for the trespass, including restitution of that which was violated plus one fifth of its value as a fine (Lev 5:16; 6:5 [5:24 HT]). See R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 1:557-66. </p>
