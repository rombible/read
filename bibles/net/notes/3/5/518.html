The term translated &#8220;animal from the flock&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">seh</font>) is often translated &#8220;lamb&#8221; (e.g., KJV, NASB, NIV, NCV) or &#8220;sheep&#8221; (e.g., NRSV, TEV, NLT), but it clearly includes either a sheep or a goat here (cf. v. 6), referring to the smaller pasture animals as opposed to the larger ones (i.e., cattle; cf. 4:3). Some English versions use the more generic &#8220;animal&#8221; (e.g., NAB, CEV).</p>
