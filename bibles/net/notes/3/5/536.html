<A NAME="536"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=179><b>sn</b> The &#8220;memorial portion&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1494;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">azkkarah</font>) was the part of the grain offering that was burnt on the altar (Lev 2:2), as opposed to the remainder, which was normally consumed by the priests (Lev 2:3; see the full regulations in Lev 6:14-23 [6:7-16 HT]). It was probably intended to call to mind (i.e., memorialize) before the <sc>Lord the reason for the presentation of the particular offering (see the remarks in R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 1:335-39).</p>
