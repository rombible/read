<A NAME="554"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=197><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he did not know, and he shall be guilty and he shall bear his iniquity&#8221; (for the rendering &#8220;bear his punishment [for iniquity]&#8221;) see the note on Lev 5:1.) This portion of v. 17 is especially difficult. The translation offered here suggests (as in many other English versions) that the offender did not originally know that he had violated the <sc>Lord&#8217;s commandments, but then came to know it and dealt with it accordingly (cf. the corresponding sin offering section in Lev 5:1-4). Another possibility is that it refers to a situation where a person suspects that he violated something although he does not recollect it. Thus, he brings a guilt offering for his suspected violation (J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:331-34, 361-63). See also R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 1:561-62. </p>
