<A NAME="545"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=188><b>sn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from the holy things of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The Hebrew expression here has the same structure as Lev 4:2, &#8220;from any of the commandments of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The latter introduces the sin offering regulations and the former the guilt offering regulations. The sin offering deals with violations of &#8220;any of the commandments,&#8221; whereas the guilt offering focuses specifically on violations of regulations regarding &#8220;holy things&#8221; (i.e., things that have been consecrated to the <sc>Lord; see the full discussion in J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:320-27). </p>
