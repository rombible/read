<A NAME="512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=155><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and is guilty to one from these,&#8221; probably referring here to any of &#8220;these&#8221; things about which one might swear a thoughtless oath (J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 45), with the word &#8220;oath&#8221; supplied in the translation for clarity. Another possibility is that &#8220;to one from these&#8221; is a dittography from v. 5 (cf. the note on v. 5a), and that v. 4 ends with &#8220;and is guilty&#8221; like vv. 2 and 3 (J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:300).</p>
