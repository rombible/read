<A NAME="51"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=144><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And a person when he sins.&#8221; Most English versions translate this as the protasis of a conditional clause: &#8220;if a person sins&#8221; (NASB, NIV).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The same expression occurs in Lev 4:2 where it introduces sins done &#8220;by straying unintentionally from any of the commandments of the <sc>Lord which must not be done&#8221; (see the notes there). Lev 5:1-13 is an additional section of sin offering regulations directed at violations other than those referred to by this expression in Lev 4:2 (see esp. 5:1-6), and expanding on the offering regulations for the common person in Lev 4:27-35 with concessions to the poor common person (5:7-13). </p>
