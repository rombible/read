<A NAME="812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=313><b>sn</b> The <i>Urim and Thummim</i> were two small objects used in the casting of lots to discern the will of God (see Exod 28:30; Num 27:21; Deut 33:8; 1 Sam 14:41 in the LXX and 28:6; Ezra 2:63 and Neh 7:65). It appears that by casting them one could obtain a yes or no answer, or no answer at all (1 Sam 28:6; J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 111-12). See the extensive discussion in J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>(AB), 1:507-11.</p>
