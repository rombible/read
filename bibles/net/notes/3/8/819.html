<A NAME="819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=320><b>sn</b> Contrary to some English versions (e.g., NAB, NASB, NIV, NLT), Aaron (<i>not</i> Moses) most likely slaughtered the bull, possibly with the help of his sons, although the verb is singular, not plural. Moses then performed the ritual procedures that involved direct contact with the altar. Compare the pattern in Lev 1:5-9, where the offerer does the slaughtering and the priests perform the procedures that involve direct contact with the altar.
