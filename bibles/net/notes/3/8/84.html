<A NAME="84"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=305><b>sn</b> The term &#8220;tunic&#8221; refers to a shirt-like garment worn next to the skin and, therefore, put on first (cf. Exod 28:4, 39-40; 29:5, 8; 39:27). Traditionally this has been translated &#8220;coat&#8221; (so KJV, ASV), but that English word designates an outer garment.</p>
