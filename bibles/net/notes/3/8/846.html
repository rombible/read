<A NAME="846"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=347><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;because seven days he shall fill your hands&#8221;; KJV &#8220;for seven days shall he consecrate you&#8221;; CEV &#8220;ends seven days from now.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> It is apparent that the term for &#8220;ordination offering&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1467;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">millu</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>; cf. Lev 7:37 and the note there) is closely related to the expression &#8220;he shall fill (Piel <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mille</font>&#8217;) your hands&#8221; in this verse. Some derive the terminology from the procedure in Lev 8:27-28, but the term for &#8220;hands&#8221; there is actually &#8220;palms.&#8221; It seems more likely that it derives from the notion of putting the priestly responsibilities (or possibly its associated prebends) under their control (i.e., &#8220;filling their hands&#8221; with authority; see J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:538-39). The command &#8220;to keep the charge of the <sc>Lord&#8221; in v. 35 and the expression &#8220;by the hand of Moses&#8221; (i.e., under the authoritative hand of Moses, v. 36) may also support this interpretation.</p>
