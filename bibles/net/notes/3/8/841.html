<A NAME="841"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=342><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and he waved.&#8221; The subject of the verb &#8220;he waved&#8221; is Aaron, but Aaron&#8217;s sons also performed the action (see &#8220;Aaron and his sons&#8221; just previously). See the similar shifts from Moses to Aaron as the subject of the action above (vv. 15, 16, 19, 20, 23), and esp. the note on Lev 8:15. In the present translation this is rendered as an adjectival clause (&#8220;who waved&#8221;) to indicate that the referent is not Moses but Aaron and his sons. Cf. CEV &#8220;who lifted it up&#8221;; NAB &#8220;whom he had wave&#8221; (with &#8220;he&#8221; referring to Moses here).</p>
