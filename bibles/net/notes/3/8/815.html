<A NAME="815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=316><b>sn</b> The expression &#8220;and consecrated it&#8221; refers to the effect of the anointing earlier in the verse (cf. &#8220;to consecrate them/him&#8221; in vv. 11 and 12). &#8220;To consecrate&#8221; means &#8220;to make holy&#8221; or &#8220;make sacred&#8221;; i.e., put something into the category of holy/sacred as opposed to common/profane (see Lev 10:10 below). Thus, the person or thing consecrated is put into the realm of God&#8217;s holy things. </p>
