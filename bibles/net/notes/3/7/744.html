<A NAME="744"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=295><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the day of he presented them to serve as priests to the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The grammar here is relatively unusual. First, the verb &#8220;presented&#8221; appears to be in the perfect rather than the infinitive (but see GKC 531), the latter being normal in such temporal expressions. Second, the active verb form appears to be used as a passive plural (&#8220;they were presented&#8221;). However, if it is translated active and singular then Moses would be the subject: &#8220;on the day he [Moses] offered them [Aaron and his sons].&#8221;</p>
