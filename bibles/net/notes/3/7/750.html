<A NAME="750"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=301><b>sn</b> The inclusion of the &#8220;ordination offering&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">milu</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>; the term apparently comes from the notion of &#8220;filling [of the hand],&#8221; cf. Lev 8:33) here anticipates Lev 8. It is a kind of peace offering, as the regulations in Lev 8:22-32 will show (cf. Exod 29:19-34). In the context of the ordination ritual for the priests it fits into the sequence of offerings as a peace offering would: sin offering (Lev 8:14-17), burnt and grain offering (Lev 8:18-21), and finally peace (i.e., ordination) offering (Lev 8:22-32). Moreover, in this case, Moses received the breast of the ordination offering as his due since he was the presiding priest over the sacrificial procedures (Lev 8:29; cf. Lev 7:30-31), while Aaron and his sons ate the portions that would have been consumed by the common worshipers in a regular peace offering procedure (Exod 29:31-34; cf. Lev 7:15-18). For a general introduction to the peace offering see the note on Lev 3:1.</p>
