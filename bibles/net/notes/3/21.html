<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1014><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>, &#8220;soul, person, life&#8221;) can sometimes refer to a &#8220;dead person&#8221; (cf. Lev 19:28 above and the literature cited there).</p>
<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1015><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;no one,&#8221; but &#8220;priest&#8221; has been used in the translation to clarify that these restrictions are limited to the priests, not to the Israelites in general (note the introductory formula, &#8220;say to the priests, the sons of Aaron&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1016><b>tc</b> The MT has &#8220;in his peoples,&#8221; but Smr, LXX, Syriac, Targum, and <i>Tg. Ps.-J.</i> have &#8220;in his people,&#8221; referring to the Israelites as a whole.</p>
<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1017><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;except for his flesh, the one near to him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1018><b>tn</b> Cf. v. 2a. </p>
<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1019><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;He shall not defile himself a husband in his peoples, to profane himself.&#8221; The meaning of the line is disputed, but it appears to prohibit a priest from burying any relative by marriage (as opposed to the blood relatives of vv. 2-3), including his wife (compare B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 142-43 with J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 343, 348). </p>
<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1020><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;they&#8221;; the referent (priests, see the beginning of v. 1) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1021><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and in their body they shall not [cut] slash[es]&#8221; (cf. Lev 19:28). The context connects these sorts of mutilations with mourning rites (cf. Lev 19:27-28 above). </p>
<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1022><b>sn</b> Regarding &#8220;profane,&#8221; see the note on Lev 10:10 above. </p>
<A NAME="2110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1023><b>sn</b> Regarding the Hebrew term for &#8220;gifts,&#8221; see the note on Lev 1:9 above (cf. also 3:11 and 16 in combination with the word for &#8220;food&#8221; that follows in the next phrase here).</p>
<A NAME="2111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1024><b>tc</b> Smr and all early versions have the plural adjective &#8220;holy&#8221; rather than the MT singular noun &#8220;holiness.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1025><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;A wife harlot and profaned they shall not take.&#8221; The structure of the verse (e.g., &#8220;wife&#8221; at the beginning of the two main clauses) suggests that &#8220;harlot and profaned&#8221; constitutes a hendiadys, meaning &#8220;a wife defiled by harlotry&#8221; (see the explanation in B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 143, as opposed to that in J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 343, 348; cf. v. 14 below). Cf. NASB &#8220;a woman who is profaned by harlotry.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1026><b>sn</b> For a helpful discussion of divorce in general and as it relates to this passage see B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> (JPSTC), 143-44. </p>
<A NAME="2114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1027><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (the priest) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1028><b>tn</b> The pronoun &#8220;he&#8221; in this clause refers to the priest, not the former husband of the divorced woman. </p>
<A NAME="2116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1029><b>tn</b> The three previous second person references in this verse are all singular, but this reference is plural. By adding &#8220;all&#8221; this grammatical distinction is preserved in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="2117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1030><b>tn</b> See the note on &#8220;burned to death&#8221; in 20:14.</p>
<A NAME="2118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1031><b>tn</b> The adjective &#8220;high&#8221; has been supplied in the translation for clarity, as in many English versions.</p>
<A NAME="2119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1032><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he has filled his hand.&#8221; For this expression see the note on Lev 8:33. </p>
<A NAME="2120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1033><b>tn</b> Regarding these signs of mourning see the note on Lev 10:6. His head had been anointed (v. 10a) so it must not be unkempt (v. 10b), and his garments were special priestly garments (v. 10a) so he must not tear them (v. 10b). In the translation &#8220;garments&#8221; has been employed rather than &#8220;clothes&#8221; to suggest that the special priestly garments are referred to here; cf. NRSV &#8220;nor tear his vestments.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1034><b>tc</b> Although the MT has &#8220;persons&#8221; (plural), the LXX and Syriac have the singular &#8220;person&#8221; corresponding to the singular adjectival participle &#8220;dead&#8221; (cf. also Num 6:6).</p>
<A NAME="2122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1035><b>sn</b> Regarding &#8220;profane,&#8221; see the note on Lev 10:10 above. </p>
<A NAME="2123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1036><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And he, a wife in her virginity he shall take.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1037><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;take.&#8221; In context this means &#8220;take as wife,&#8221; i.e., &#8220;marry.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1038><b>tc</b> The MT has literally, &#8220;from his peoples,&#8221; but Smr, LXX, Syriac, Targum, and <i>Tg. Ps.-J.</i> have &#8220;from his people,&#8221; referring to the Israelites as a whole.</p>
<A NAME="2126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1039><b>tc</b> The MT has literally, &#8220;in his peoples,&#8221; but Smr, LXX, Syriac, Targum, and <i>Tg. Ps.-J.</i> have &#8220;in his people,&#8221; referring to the Israelites as a whole. </p>
<A NAME="2127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1040><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to their generations.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1041><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;who in him is a flaw&#8221;; cf. KJV, ASV &#8220;any blemish&#8221;; NASB, NIV &#8220;a defect.&#8221; The rendering &#8220;physical flaw&#8221; is used to refer to any birth defect or physical injury of the kind described in the following verses (cf. the same Hebrew word also in Lev 24:19-20). The same term is used for &#8220;flawed&#8221; animals, which must not be offered to the <sc>Lord in Lev 22:20-25. </p>
<A NAME="2129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1042><b>tn</b> The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) in this context is asseverative, indicating absolutely certainty (GKC 498 §159.<i>ee</i>). </p>
<A NAME="2130"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1043><b>tn</b> Lexically, the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1467;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kharum</font>) seems to refer to a split nose or perhaps any number of other facial defects (<i>HALOT</i> 354 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1512;&#1501;</font> qal; cf. G. J. Wenham, <i>Leviticus</i> [NICOT], 292, n. 7); cf. KJV, ASV &#8220;a flat nose&#8221;; NASB &#8220;a disfigured face.&#8221; The NJPS translation is &#8220;a limb too short&#8221; as a balance to the following term which means &#8220;extended, raised,&#8221; and apparently refers to &#8220;a limb too long&#8221; (see the explanation in B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 146).</p>
<A NAME="2131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1044><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;who there is in him a broken leg or a broken arm,&#8221; or perhaps &#8220;broken foot or broken hand.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1462;&#1490;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">regel</font>) is commonly rendered &#8220;foot,&#8221; but it can also refer to the &#8220;leg,&#8221; and the Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yad</font>) is most often translated &#8220;hand,&#8221; but can also refer to the &#8220;[fore]arm&#8221; (as opposed to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1507;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kaf</font>, &#8220;palm of the hand&#8221; or &#8220;hand&#8221;). See <i>HALOT</i> 386 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;</font> and 1184 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1462;&#1490;&#1462;&#1500;</font> respectively (cf. the NJPS translation). In this context, these terms probably apply to any part of the limb that was broken, including hand and the foot. B. A. Levine (<i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 146) points out that such injuries often did not heal properly in antiquity because they were not properly set and, therefore, remained a &#8220;physical flaw&#8221; permanently. </p>
<A NAME="2132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1045><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;thin&#8221;; cf. NAB &#8220;weakly.&#8221; This could refer to either an exceptionally small (i.e., dwarfed) man (B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 146) or perhaps one with a &#8220;withered limb&#8221; (J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 342, 344). </p>
<A NAME="2133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1046><b>tn</b> The term rendered &#8220;spot&#8221; derives from a root meaning &#8220;mixed&#8221; or &#8220;confused&#8221; (cf. NAB &#8220;walleyed&#8221;). It apparently refers to any kind of marked flaw in the eye that can be seen by others. Smr, Syriac, <i>Tg. Onq.</i>, and <i>Tg. Ps.-J.</i> have plural &#8220;his eyes.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1047><b>tn</b> The exact meaning and medical reference of the terms rendered &#8220;festering eruption&#8221; and &#8220;feverish rash&#8221; is unknown, but see the translations and remarks in B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> (JPSTC), 146; J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> (WBC), 342, 344, 349-50; and R. K. Harrison, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 1:890 and 2:461.</p>
<A NAME="2135"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1048><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;shall approach&#8221; (see <i>HALOT</i> 670 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473;</font>).</p>
<A NAME="2136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1049><b>sn</b> See the note on Lev 16:2 for the rendering &#8220;veil-canopy.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1050><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And.&#8221; The Hebrew conjunction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vav</font>, &#8220;and&#8221;) can be considered to have resultative force here.</p>
<A NAME="2138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1051><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And.&#8221; The Hebrew conjunction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vav</font>, &#8220;and&#8221;) introduces a concluding statement for all the preceding material.</p>
<A NAME="2139"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1052><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;these things&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text, but have been supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
