<A NAME="183"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=863><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and you shall not walk.&#8221; </p>

Lev 19:37; 20:22; 25:18; 26:46). Note especially the thematic and formulaic relationships between the introduction here in Lev 18:1-5 and the paraenesis in Lev 20:22-26, both of which refer explicitly to the corrupt nations and the need to separate from them by keeping the <sc>Lord&#8217;s regulations.</p>
<A NAME="185"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=865><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and my statutes you shall keep [or &#8220;watch; guard&#8221;] to walk in them.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="186"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=866><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And you shall keep.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="187"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=867><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;which the man shall do them and shall live in them.&#8221; The term for &#8220;a man, human being; mankind&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">adam</font>; see the note on Lev 1:2) in this case refers to any person among &#8220;mankind,&#8221; male or female. The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vakhay</font>, &#8220;and shall live&#8221;) looks like the adjective &#8220;living&#8221; so it is written <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿkhayah</font>) in Smr, but the MT form is simply the same verb written as a double <i>ayin</i> verb (see <i>HALOT</i> 309 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1497;&#1492;</font> qal and GKC 218 §76.<i>i</i>; cf. Lev 25:35).</p>
<A NAME="188"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=868><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Man, man shall not draw near to any flesh (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">er</font>) of his body/flesh (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">basar</font>).&#8221; The repetition of the word &#8220;man&#8221; is distributive, meaning &#8220;any (or &#8220;every&#8221;) man&#8221; (GKC 395-96 §123.<i>c</i>; cf. Lev 15:2). The two words for &#8220;flesh&#8221; are combined to refer to emphasize the physical familial relatedness (see J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 282, and B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 119). </p>
<A NAME="189"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=869><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to uncover [her] nakedness&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV, NASB, NRSV), which is clearly euphemistic for sexual intercourse (see J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 282, and B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 119). This expression occurs a number of times in the following context and is generally translated &#8220;have sexual intercourse with [someone],&#8221; although in the case of the father mentioned in the following verse the expression may be connected to the shame or disgrace that would belong to the father whose wife&#8217;s sexuality is violated by his son. See the note on the word &#8220;mother&#8221; in v. 7.</p>
<A NAME="1810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=870><b>sn</b> The general statement prohibiting sexual intercourse between close relatives serves as an opening summary statement for the following section, which gives details concerning which degrees of relationship are specifically forbidden. </p>
<A NAME="1811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=871><b>tn</b> The verbal negative here is the same as that used in the Ten Commandments (Exod 20:4-5, 7, 13-17). It suggests permanent prohibition rather than a simple negative command and could, therefore, be rendered &#8220;must not&#8221; here and throughout the following section as it is in vv. 3-4 above. </p>
<A NAME="1812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=872><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The nakedness of your father and [i.e., even] the nakedness of your mother you shall not uncover.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Commentators suggest that the point of referring to the father&#8217;s nakedness is that the mother&#8217;s sexuality belongs to the father and is forbidden to the son on that account (see B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 120, and J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 294). The expression may, however, derive from the shame of nakedness when exposed. If one exposes his mother&#8217;s nakedness to himself it is like openly exposing the father&#8217;s nakedness (cf. Gen 9:22-23 with the background of Gen 2:25 and 3:7, 21). The same essential construction is used in v. 10 where the latter explanation makes more sense than the former. </p>
<A NAME="1813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=873><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the nakedness of your father she is.&#8221; See the note on v. 7 above. This law refers to another wife of the man&#8217;s father, who is not that man&#8217;s mother. The laws in the Pentateuch sometimes assume the possibility that a man may have more than one wife (cf., e.g., Deut 21:15-17). </p>
<A NAME="1814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=874><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the daughter of your father or the daughter of your mother.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=875><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;born of house or born of outside.&#8221; CEV interprets as &#8220;whether you grew up together or not&#8221; (cf. also TEV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="1816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=876><b>tc</b> Several medieval Hebrew <sc>mss, Smr, LXX, and Syriac have &#8220;her nakedness&#8221; rather than &#8220;their nakedness,&#8221; thus agreeing with singular &#8220;sister&#8221; at the beginning of the verse.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> For a smooth English translation &#8220;either of&#8221; was added.</p>
<A NAME="1817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=877><b>sn</b> That is, to have sexual intercourse with one&#8217;s granddaughter would be like openly exposing one&#8217;s own shameful nakedness (see the note on v. 7 above).</p>
<A NAME="1818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=878><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The nakedness of the daughter of your father&#8217;s wife born of your father, she is your sister; you must not uncover her nakedness.&#8221; That is, a half sister, the daughter of the man&#8217;s father by another wife, who is not the man&#8217;s mother, is to be considered a true sister. Therefore, the man must not have sexual intercourse with her.</p>
<A NAME="1819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=879><b>tc</b> A few medieval Hebrew <sc>mss, the LXX, Syriac, and Vulgate all read &#8220;because she is the flesh of your father,&#8221; like the MT of v. 13. </p>
<A NAME="1820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=880><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you must not draw near to his wife.&#8221; In the context this refers to approaching one&#8217;s aunt to have sexual intercourse with her, so this has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=881><b>tn</b> As in v. 12 (see the note there), some <sc>mss and versions have &#8220;because she is your aunt.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=882><b>sn</b> Regarding the last clause, see the notes on vv. 7 and 10 above.</p>
<A NAME="1823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=883><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;You must not uncover the nakedness of both a woman and her daughter; the daughter of her son and the daughter of her daughter you must not take to uncover her nakedness.&#8221; Translating &#8220;her&#8221; as &#8220;them&#8221; provides consistency in the English. In this kind of context, &#8220;take&#8221; means to &#8220;take in marriage&#8221; (cf. also v. 18). The LXX and Syriac have &#8220;their nakedness,&#8221; referring to the nakedness of the woman&#8217;s granddaughters, rather than the nakedness of the woman herself. </p>
<A NAME="1824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=884><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they are her flesh.&#8221; The LXX reads &#8220;your&#8221; here (followed by NRSV). If the LXX reading were followed by the present translation, the result would be &#8220;They are closely related to you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=885><b>tn</b> The term rendered &#8220;lewdness&#8221; almost always carries a connotation of cunning, evil device, and divisiveness (cf. <i>HALOT</i> 272 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> 2, &#8220;infamy&#8221;), and is closely associated with sexual and religious infidelity (cf., e.g., Lev 19:29; 20:14; Job 31:11; Jer 13:27; Ezek 16:27; 22:9). Recent English versions differ on how they handle this: NAB &#8220;would be shameful&#8221;; CEV &#8220;would make you unclean&#8221;; NIV &#8220;wickedness&#8221;; NLT &#8220;horrible wickedness&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;depravity&#8221;; TEV &#8220;incest.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=886><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;as a concubine&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And a woman to her sister you shall not take to be a second wife [or &#8220;to be a concubine&#8221;].&#8221; According to <i>HALOT</i> 1059 s.v. III <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1512;&#1512;</font>, the infinitive &#8220;to be a second wife&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1512;&#1465;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">litsror</font>) is a denominative verb from II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> A (&#8220;concubine; second wife&#8221;), which, in turn, derives from II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1512;</font> &#8220;to treat with hostility&#8221; (cf. J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 283, and B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 122).</p>
<A NAME="1827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=887><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;on her in her life.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=888><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the menstruation of her impurity&#8221;; NIV &#8220;during the uncleanness of her monthly period.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=889><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And to the wife of your fellow citizen you shall not give your layer for seed.&#8221; The meaning of &#8220;your layer&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1489;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shÿkhavtÿkha</font>) is uncertain (see B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 122, &#8220;you shall not place your layer of semen&#8221;; but cf. also J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 283, and the literature cited there for the rendering, &#8220;you shall not give your penis for seed&#8221;). </p>
<A NAME="1830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=890><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And from your seed you shall not give to cause to pass over to Molech.&#8221; Smr (cf. also the LXX) has &#8220;to cause to serve&#8221; rather than &#8220;to cause to pass over.&#8221; For detailed remarks on Molech and Molech worship see N. H. Snaith, <i>Leviticus and Numbers</i> (NCBC), 87-88; P. J. Budd, <i>Leviticus</i> (NCBC), 259-60; and J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> (WBC), 333-37, and the literature cited there. It could refer to either human sacrifice or a devotion of children to some sort of service of Molech, perhaps of a sexual sort (cf. Lev 20:2-5; 2 Kgs 23:10, etc.). The inclusion of this prohibition against Molech worship here may be due to some sexual connection of this kind, or perhaps simply to the lexical link between <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1462;&#1512;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zera</font>&#8217;) meaning &#8220;seed, semen&#8221; in v. 20 but &#8220;offspring&#8221; in v. 21.</p>
<A NAME="1831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=891><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and you shall not profane.&#8221; Regarding &#8220;profane,&#8221; see the note on Lev 10:10 above. </p>
<A NAME="1832"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=892><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And with a male you shall not lay [as the] lyings of a woman&#8221; (see B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 123). The specific reference here is to homosexual intercourse between males.</p>
<A NAME="1833"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=893><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1506;&#1461;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">to</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">evah</font>, rendered &#8220;detestable act&#8221;) refers to the repugnant practices of foreigners, whether from the viewpoint of other peoples toward the Hebrews (e.g., Gen 43:32; 46:34; Exod 8:26) or of the <sc>Lord toward other peoples (see esp. Lev 18:26-27, 29-30). It can also designate, as here, detestable acts that might be perpetrated by the native peoples (it is used again in reference to homosexuality in Lev 20:13; cf. also its use for unclean food, Deut 14:3; idol worship, Isa 41:24; remarriage to a former wife who has been married to someone else in between, Deut 24:4).</p>

<A NAME="1836"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=896><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tevel</font>, &#8220;perversion&#8221;) derives from the verb &#8220;to mix; to confuse&#8221; and therefore refers to illegitimate mixtures of species or violation of the natural order of things.</p>
<A NAME="1837"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=897><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;which I am sending away (Piel participle of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;</font> [<font face="Scholar">shalakh</font>, &#8220;to send&#8221;]) from your faces.&#8221; The rendering here takes the participle as anticipatory of the coming conquest events. </p>
