<A NAME="136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=474><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a mark [or stroke; or plague] of disease.&#8221; In some places in this context (vv. 2, 3) it could be translated &#8220;a contagious skin disease.&#8221; Although the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsara</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">at</font>) rendered here &#8220;diseased&#8221; is translated in many English versions as &#8220;leprosy,&#8221; it does not refer to Hanson&#8217;s disease, which is the modern technical understanding of the term &#8220;leprosy&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 1057 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;</font> a). There has been much discussion of the proper meaning of the term and the disease(s) to which it may refer (see, e.g., J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:774-76, 816-26; J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 187-89; and the literature cited by them). The further description of the actual condition in the text suggests that the regulations are concerned with any kind of infectious diseases that are observable on the surface of the skin and, in addition to that, penetrate below the surface of the skin (vv. 3-4) or spread further across the surface of the skin (vv. 5-8). It is true that, in the OT, the term &#8220;disease&#8221; is often associated specifically with white &#8220;scaly&#8221; skin diseases that resemble the wasting away of the skin after death (see Milgrom who, in fact, translates &#8220;scale disease&#8221;; cf., e.g., Exod 4:6-7 and Num 12:9-12, esp. v. 12), but here it appears to be a broader term for any skin disease that penetrates deep or spreads far on the body. Scaly skin diseases would be included in this category, but also other types. Thus, a &#8220;swelling,&#8221; &#8220;scab,&#8221; or &#8220;bright spot&#8221; on the skin might be a symptom of disease, but not necessarily so. In this sense, &#8220;diseased&#8221; is a technical term. The term &#8220;infection&#8221; can apply to any &#8220;mark&#8221; on the skin whether it belongs to the category of &#8220;disease&#8221; or not (compare and contrast v. 3, where the &#8220;infection&#8221; is not &#8220;diseased,&#8221; with v. 4, where the &#8220;infection&#8221; is found to be &#8220;diseased&#8221;). </p>
