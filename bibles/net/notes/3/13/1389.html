<A NAME="1389"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">89</span><note=557><b>tn</b> The exact identification of this disease is unknown. Cf. KJV &#8220;dry scall&#8221;; NASB &#8220;a scale&#8221;; NIV, NCV, NRSV &#8220;an itch&#8221;; NLT &#8220;a contagious skin disease.&#8221; For a discussion of &#8220;scall&#8221; disease in the hair, which is a crusty scabby disease of the skin under the hair that also affects the hair itself, see J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> (WBC), 192-93, and J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>(AB), 1:793-94. The Hebrew word rendered &#8220;scall&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1511;</font>, <font face="Scholar">neteq</font>) is related to a verb meaning &#8220;to tear; to tear out; to tear apart.&#8221; It may derive from the scratching and/or the tearing out of the hair or the scales of the skin in response to the itching sensation caused by the disease.</p>
