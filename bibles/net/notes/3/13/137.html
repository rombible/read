<A NAME="137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=475><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;it shall be reported to Aaron the priest.&#8221; This alternative rendering may be better in light of the parallel use of the same expression in Lev 14:2, where the priest had to go outside the camp in order to inspect the person who had been diseased. Since the rendering &#8220;he shall be brought to Aaron the priest&#8221; might confuse matters there, this expression should be rendered &#8220;it shall be reported&#8221; both here in 13:2 (cf. also v. 9) and in 14:2. See, however, the further note on 14:2 below, where it is argued that the diseased person would still need to &#8220;be brought&#8221; to the priest even if this happened outside the camp. Most English versions retain the idea of the afflicted person being &#8220;brought&#8221; to the priest for inspection.</p>
