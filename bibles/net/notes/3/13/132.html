<A NAME="132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=470><b>tn</b> Some of the terms for disease or symptoms of disease in this chapter present difficulties for the translator. Most modern English versions render the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et</font>) as &#8220;swelling,&#8221; which has been retained here (see the explanation in J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 189). Some have argued that &#8220;<i>deeper</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1502;&#1465;&#1511;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">amoq</font>) than the skin of his body&#8221; in v. 3 means that &#8220;this sore was lower than the surrounding skin&#8221; (J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:773), in which case &#8220;swelling&#8221; would be an inappropriate translation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1514;</font> in v. 2. Similarly, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1514;</font> also occurs in v. 19, and then v. 20 raises the issue of whether or not it appears to be &#8220;lower (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1508;&#1464;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shafal</font>) than the skin&#8221; (cf. also 14:37 for a mark on the wall of a house), which may mean that the sore sinks below the surface of the skin rather than protruding above it as a swelling would (B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 76-77). Thus, one could translate here, for example, &#8220;discoloration&#8221; (so Milgrom and II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1514;</font> &#8220;spot, blemish on the skin&#8221; in <i>HALOT</i> 1301 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1514;</font>) or &#8220;local inflammation, boil, mole&#8221; (so Levine). However, one could interpret &#8220;lower&#8221; as &#8220;deeper,&#8221; i.e., visibly extending below the surface of the skin into the deeper layers as suggested by J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> (WBC), 188, 192. &#8220;Swelling&#8221; often extends deeply below the surface of the skin, it is certainly a common symptom of skin diseases, and the alternation of these two terms (i.e., &#8220;deeper&#8221; and &#8220;lower&#8221;) in vv. 25-26 below shows that they both refer to the same phenomenon (see also the note on v. 20 below), so it is retained in the present translation.</p>
