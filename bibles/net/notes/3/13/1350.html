<A NAME="1350"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=518><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the living flesh returns and is turned/changed to white.&#8221; The Hebrew verb &#8220;returns&#8221; is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shuv</font>), which often functions adverbially when combined with a second verb as it is here (cf. &#8220;and is turned&#8221;) and, in such cases, is usually rendered &#8220;again&#8221; (see, e.g., GKC 386-87 §120.<i>g</i>). Another suggestion is that here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font> means &#8220;to recede&#8221; (cf., e.g., 2 Kgs 20:9), so one could translate &#8220;the raw flesh recedes and turns white.&#8221; This would mean that the new &#8220;white&#8221; skin &#8220;has grown over&#8221; the raw flesh (B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 79). </p>
