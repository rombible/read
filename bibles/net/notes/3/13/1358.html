<A NAME="1358"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=526><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and behold its appearance is low (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1508;&#1464;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shafal</font>) &#8216;from&#8217; (comparative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">min</font>, &#8220;lower than&#8221;) the skin.&#8221; Compare &#8220;deeper&#8221; in v. 3 above where, however, a different word is used (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1502;&#1465;&#1511;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">amoq</font>), and see the note on &#8220;swelling&#8221; in v. 1 above (cf. J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 192; note that, contrary to the MT, <i>Tg. Onq. </i>has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1502;&#1465;&#1511;</font> in this verse as well as v. 4). The alternation of these two terms (i.e., &#8220;deeper&#8221; and &#8220;lower&#8221;) in vv. 25-26 below shows that they both refer to the same phenomenon. Some have argued that &#8220;this sore was lower than the surrounding skin&#8221; (J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:773, 788), in which case &#8220;swelling&#8221; would be an inappropriate translation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et</font>) in v. 19. It seems unlikely, however, that the surface of a &#8220;boil&#8221; would sink below the surface of the surrounding skin. The infectious pus etc. that makes up a boil normally causes swelling.</p>
