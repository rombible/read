<A NAME="13131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">131</span><note=599><b>tn</b> The terms &#8220;back side&#8221; and &#8220;front side&#8221; are the same as those used in v. 42 for the &#8220;back or front bald area&#8221; of a man&#8217;s head. The exact meaning of these terms when applied to articles of cloth or leather is uncertain. It could refer, for example, to the inside versus the outside of a garment, or the back versus the front side of an article of cloth or leather. See J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>(AB), 1:814, for various possibilities.</p>
