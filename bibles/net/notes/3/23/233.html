Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> (JPSTC), 156, for a full discussion of the issues raised in this verse. The rabbinic tradition places the slaughter of Passover offerings between approximately 3:00 <sc>p.m. and 6:00 <sc>p.m., not precisely at twilight. Moreover, the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1505;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pesakh</font>) may mean &#8220;protective offering&#8221; rather than &#8220;Passover offering,&#8221; although they amount to about the same thing in the historical context of the exodus from Egypt (see Exod 11-12). </p>
