<A NAME="2318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1132><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;seven Sabbaths, they shall be complete.&#8221; The disjunctive accent under &#8220;Sabbaths&#8221; precludes the translation &#8220;seven complete Sabbaths&#8221; (as NASB, NIV; cf. NAB, NRSV, NLT). The text is somewhat awkward, which may explain why the LXX tradition is confused here, either adding &#8220;you shall count&#8221; again at the end of the verse, or leaving out &#8220;they shall be,&#8221; or keeping &#8220;they shall be&#8221; and adding &#8220;to you.&#8221; </p>
