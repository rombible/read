<A NAME="2330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1144><b>tn</b> Smr and LXX have the Hebrew article on &#8220;lambs.&#8221; The syntax of this verse is difficult. The object of the verb (two lambs) is far removed from the verb itself (shall wave) in the MT, and the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>, &#8220;upon&#8221;), rendered &#8220;along with&#8221; in this verse, is also added to the far removed subject (literally, &#8220;upon [the] two lambs&#8221;; see B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 159). It is clear, however, that the two lambs and the loaves (along with their associated grain and drink offerings) constituted the &#8220;wave offering,&#8221; which served as the prebend &#8220;for the priest.&#8221; Burnt and sin offerings (vv. 18-19a) were not included in this (see Lev 7:11-14, 28-36).</p>
