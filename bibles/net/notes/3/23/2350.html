<A NAME="2350"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1164><b>tn</b> The rendering &#8220;booths&#8221; (cf. NAB, NASB, NRSV) is probably better than the traditional &#8220;tabernacles&#8221; in light of the meaning of the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1467;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sukkah</font>, &#8220;hut, booth&#8221;), but &#8220;booths&#8221; are frequently associated with trade shows and craft fairs in contemporary American English. The nature of the celebration during this feast (see the following verses) as a commemoration of the wanderings of the Israelites after they left Egypt suggests that a translation like &#8220;temporary shelters&#8221; is more appropriate.</p>
