<A NAME="2336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1150><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a memorial of loud blasts.&#8221; Although the term for &#8220;horn&#8221; does not occur here, allowing for the possibility that vocal &#8220;shouts&#8221; of acclamation are envisioned (see P. J. Budd, <i>Leviticus</i> [NCBC], 325), the &#8220;blast&#8221; of the <i>shofar</i> (a trumpet made from a ram&#8217;s &#8220;horn&#8221;) is most likely what is intended. On this occasion, the loud blasts on the horn announced the coming of the new year on the first day of the seventh month (see the explanations in J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 387, and B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 160). </p>
