<A NAME="161"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=754><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in their drawing near to the faces of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The rendering here relies on the use of this expression for the very &#8220;presence&#8221; of God in Exod 33:14-15 and in the Lev 9:24-10:2 passage, where the Nadab and Abihu catastrophe referred to here is narrated.</p>
<A NAME="162"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=755><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;into the holy place from house to the veil-canopy.&#8221; In this instance, the Hebrew term &#8220;the holy place&#8221; refers to &#8220;the most holy place&#8221; (lit. &#8220;holy of holies&#8221;), since it is the area &#8220;inside the veil-canopy&#8221; (cf. Exod 26:33-34). The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1465;&#1499;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">parokhet</font>) is usually translated &#8220;veil&#8221; or &#8220;curtain,&#8221; but it seems to have stretched not only in front of but also over the top of the ark of the covenant which stood behind and under it inside the most holy place, and thus formed more of a canopy than simply a curtain (see R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 3:687-89). </p>
<A NAME="163"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=756><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to the faces of the atonement plate.&#8221; The exact meaning of the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kapporet</font>) here rendered &#8220;atonement plate&#8221; is much debated. The traditional &#8220;<i>mercy</i> seat&#8221; (KJV, ASV, NASB, NRSV) does not suit the cognate relationship between this term and the Piel verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kipper</font>, &#8220;to make atonement, to make expiation&#8221;). The translation of the word should also reflect the fact that the most important atonement procedures on the Day of Atonement were performed in relation to it. Since the <sc>Lord would &#8220;appear in the cloud over the atonement plate,&#8221; and since it was so closely associated with the ark of the covenant (the ark being his &#8220;footstool&#8221;; cf. 1 Chr 28:2 and Ps 132:7-8), one could take it to be the place of his throne at which he accepts atonement. See J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>(AB), 1:1014; J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> (WBC), 234-35; and R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 2:691, 699. Cf. NIV &#8220;the atonement cover&#8221;; NCV &#8220;the lid on the Ark&#8221;; NLT &#8220;the Ark&#8217;s cover &#8211; the place of atonement.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="167"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=760><b>sn</b> The term &#8220;tunic&#8221; refers to a shirt-like garment worn next to the skin and, therefore, put on first (cf. Exod 28:4, 39-40; 29:5, 8; 39:27). It covered the upper body only. For detailed remarks on the terminology for the priestly clothing in this verse (except the &#8220;linen leggings&#8221;) see the notes on Lev 8:7-9 and the literature cited there.</p>
<A NAME="168"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=761><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;shall be on his flesh.&#8221; As in many instances in Lev 15, the term &#8220;flesh&#8221; or &#8220;body&#8221; here is euphemistic for the male genitals (J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:1017, and J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 222; cf. the note on Lev 15:2), which the priest must be careful not to expose during such ritual procedures (see Exod 20:26 with 28:42-43). </p>

It is usually thought to be a &#8220;turban,&#8221; but it might be only a &#8220;turban-like headband&#8221; wound around the forehead area (<i>HALOT</i> 624 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1514;</font>). </p>

A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> (JPSTC), 102, on Lev 16:8-9. J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>(AB), 1:1019-20, suggests, however, that the expression here signifies that, the lots having been cast, the priest was to literally &#8220;place&#8221; (<i>Heb </i>&#8220;give&#8221;) the one marked &#8220;for the <sc>Lord&#8221; on the head of the goat to be sacrificed and the one marked &#8220;for Azazel&#8221; on the head of the one to be released in the wilderness in order to avoid confusing them later in the ritual sequence. </p>
<A NAME="1616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=769><b>tn</b> The meaning of the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1494;&#1464;&#1488;&#1494;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aza</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">zel</font>, four times in the OT, all of them in this chapter; vv. 8, 10 [2 times], and 26) is much debated. There are three or perhaps four major views (see the summaries and literature cited in J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:1020-21; B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 102; J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 237-38; D. P. Wright, <i>The Disposal of Impurity</i> [SBLDS], 21-25; M. V. Van Pelt and W. C. Kaiser, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 3:362-63; and M. S. Moore, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 4:421-22). (1) Some derive the term from a combination of the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1494;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ez</font>, &#8220;goat&#8221;; i.e., the word for &#8220;goats&#8221; in v. 5) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">azal</font>, &#8220;to go away&#8221;), meaning &#8220;the goat that departs&#8221; or &#8220;scapegoat&#8221; (cf., e.g., the LXX and KJV, NASB, NIV, NLT). This meaning suits the ritual practice of sending the so-called &#8220;scapegoat&#8221; away into the wilderness (vv. 10, 21-22, 26). Similarly, some derive the term from Arabic &#8217;<font face="Scholar">azala</font> (&#8220;to banish, remove&#8221;), meaning &#8220;entire removal&#8221; as an abstract concept (see BDB 736 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1494;&#1464;&#1488;&#1494;&#1461;&#1500;</font>). (2) Some see the term as a description of the wilderness area to which the goat was dispatched, deriving it somehow from Arabic &#8217;<font face="Scholar">azazu</font> (&#8220;rough ground&#8221;) or perhaps <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1494;&#1464;&#1494;</font>, (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">azaz,</font> &#8220;to be strong, fierce&#8221;). (3) The most common view among scholars today is that it is the proper name of a particular demon (perhaps even the Devil himself) associated with the wilderness desert regions. Levine has proposed that it may perhaps derive from a reduplication of the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;</font> (<i>zayin</i>) in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1494;</font> combined with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>, &#8220;mighty&#8221;), meaning &#8220;mighty goat.&#8221; The final consonantal form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1494;&#1464;&#1488;&#1494;&#1461;&#1500;</font> would have resulted from the inversion of the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> (<i>aleph</i>) with the second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;</font>. He makes the point that the close association between <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1494;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">irim</font>), which seems to refer to &#8220;goat-demons&#8221; of the desert in Lev 17:7 (cf. Isa 13:21, etc.), should not be ignored in the derivation of Azazel, although the term ultimately became the name of &#8220;the demonic ruler of the wilderness.&#8221; The latter view is supported by the parallel between the one goat &#8220;for (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font>, <i>lamed</i> preposition) the <sc>Lord&#8221; and the one &#8220;for (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font>) Azazel&#8221; here in v. 8. The rendering as a proper name has been tentatively accepted here (cf. ASV, NAB, NRSV, TEV, CEV). Perhaps a play on words between the proper name and the term for &#8220;goat&#8221; has occurred so that the etymology has become obscure. Even if a demon or the demonic realm is the source for the name, however, there is no intention here of appeasing the demons. The goal is to remove the impurity and iniquity from the community in order to avoid offending the <sc>Lord and the repercussions of such (see esp. vv. 21-22 and cf. Lev 15:31). </p>

<A NAME="1623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=776><b>tn</b> The text here has only &#8220;above the testimony,&#8221; but this is surely a shortened form of &#8220;above <i>the ark of</i> the testimony&#8221; (see Exod 25:22 etc.; cf. Lev 16:2). The term &#8220;testimony&#8221; in this expression refers to the ark as the container of the two stone tablets with the Ten Commandments written on them (see Exod 25:16 with Deut 10:1, 5, etc.). </p>
<A NAME="1624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=777><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he will not die,&#8221; but it is clear that the purpose for the incense cloud was to protect the priest from death in the presence of the <sc>Lord (cf. vv. 1-2 above). </p>
<A NAME="1625"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=778><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;on the faces of the atonement plate toward the east.&#8221; Some have taken this to mean that the ark was stationed just behind the veil-canopy on the eastern side of the most holy place. Thus, the high priest would need to enter and walk toward the west end of the most holy place and then turn eastward in order to face the ark and sprinkle the blood in an eastward direction. The rendering here, however, requires that the ark was stationed on the western end, or perhaps in the middle of the area, so that as the priest entered he was already facing the ark and would sprinkle the blood on the eastern face of the atonement plate, in a westward direction (see, e.g., J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 239 versus J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:1032).</p>
<A NAME="1626"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=779><b>sn</b> Presumably in this case the blood was sprinkled seven times on the ground in front of the ark on which the atonement plate was mounted. </p>

In this case, therefore, the basic meaning of the verb (i.e., &#8220;to purge&#8221; or &#8220;wipe clean&#8221;) comes to the forefront. When the prepositions <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1458;&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ad</font>) occur with the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kipper</font>) the purging is almost always being done &#8220;for&#8221; or &#8220;on behalf of&#8221; priests or people (see the note on Lev 1:4 as well as R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE </i>2:698, the literature cited there, and B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 110, for more details). </p>

Of course, the purging of &#8220;the Most Holy Place&#8221; has been the main emphasis of this chapter from the start (see vv. 2-3 and 11-17). </p>

<A NAME="1662"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=815><b>tn</b> The MT of Lev 16:34b reads literally, &#8220;and he did just as the <sc>Lord had commanded Moses.&#8221; This has been retained here in spite of the fact that it suggests that Aaron immediately performed the rituals outlined in Lev 16 (see, e.g., J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 224 and 243; J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus </i>[AB], 1:1059; note that Aaron was the one to whom Moses was to speak the regulations in this chapter, v. 2). The problem is that the chapter presents these procedures as regulations for &#8220;the tenth day of the seventh month&#8221; and calls for their fulfillment at that time (Lev 16:29; cf. Lev 23:26-32 and the remarks in P. J. Budd, <i>Leviticus</i> [NCBC], 237), not during the current (first) month (Exod 40:2; note also that they left Sinai in the second month, long before the next seventh month, Num 10:11). The LXX translates, &#8220;once in the year it shall be done as the <sc>Lord commanded Moses,&#8221; attaching &#8220;once in the year&#8221; to this clause rather than the former one, and rendering the verb as passive, &#8220;it shall be done&#8221; (cf. NAB, NIV, etc.). We have already observed the passive use of active verbs in this context (see the note on v. 32 above). The RSV (cf. also the NRSV, TEV, CEV, NLT) translates, &#8220;And Moses did as the <sc>Lord commanded him,&#8221; ignoring the fact that the name Moses in the Hebrew text has the direct object indicator. Passive verbs, however, regularly take subjects with direct object indicators (see, e.g., v. 27 above). The NIV renders it &#8220;And it was done, as the <sc>Lord commanded Moses,&#8221; following the LXX passive translation. The NASB translates, &#8220;And just as the <sc>Lord had commanded Moses, <i>so</i> he did,&#8221; transposing the introductory verb to the end of the sentence and supplying &#8220;so&#8221; in order to make it fit the context.</p>
