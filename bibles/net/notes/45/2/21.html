<A NAME="21"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=66><b>sn</b> <i>Rom 2:1-29</i> presents unusual difficulties for the interpreter. There have been several major approaches to the chapter and the group(s) it refers to: (1) Rom 2:14 refers to Gentile Christians, not Gentiles who obey the Jewish law. (2) Paul in Rom 2 is presenting a hypothetical viewpoint: If anyone could obey the law, that person would be justified, but no one can. (3) The reference to &#8220;the ones who do the law&#8221; in 2:13 are those who &#8220;do&#8221; the law in the right way, on the basis of faith, not according to Jewish legalism. (4) Rom 2:13 only speaks about Christians being judged in the future, along with such texts as Rom 14:10 and 2 Cor 5:10. (5) Paul&#8217;s material in Rom 2 is drawn heavily from Diaspora Judaism, so that the treatment of the law presented here cannot be harmonized with other things Paul says about the law elsewhere (E. P. Sanders, <i>Paul, the Law, and the Jewish People</i>, 123); another who sees Rom 2 as an example of Paul&#8217;s inconsistency in his treatment of the law is H. Räisänen, <i>Paul and the Law</i> [WUNT], 101-9. (6) The list of blessings and curses in Deut 27&#8211;30 provide the background for Rom 2; the Gentiles of 2:14 are Gentile Christians, but the condemnation of Jews in 2:17-24 addresses the failure of Jews as a nation to keep the law as a whole (A. Ito, &#8220;Romans 2: A Deuteronomistic Reading,&#8221; <i>JSNT</i> 59 [1995]: 21-37).</p>
