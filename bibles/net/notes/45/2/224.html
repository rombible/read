<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=89><b>sn</b> This is the first occurrence of <i>law</i> (<font face="Greektl">nomos</font>) in Romans. Exactly what Paul means by the term has been the subject of much scholarly debate. According to J. A. Fitzmyer (<i>Romans</i> [AB], 131-35; 305-6) there are at least four different senses: (1) figurative, as a &#8220;principle&#8221;; (2) generic, meaning &#8220;a law&#8221;; (3) as a reference to the OT or some part of the OT; and (4) as a reference to the Mosaic law. This last usage constitutes the majority of Paul&#8217;s references to &#8220;law&#8221; in Romans.</p>
