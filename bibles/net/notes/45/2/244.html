<A NAME="244"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=109><b>sn</b> <i>Circumcision</i> refers to male circumcision as prescribed in the OT, which was given as a covenant to Abraham in Gen 17:10-14. Its importance for Judaism can hardly be overstated: According to J. D. G. Dunn (<i>Romans</i> [WBC], 1:120) it was the &#8220;single clearest distinguishing feature of the covenant people.&#8221; J. Marcus has suggested that the terms used for circumcision (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#964;&#959;&#956;&#8053;</font>, <font face="Greektl">peritomh</font>) and uncircumcision (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#954;&#961;&#959;&#946;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#943;&#945;</font>, <font face="Greektl">akrobustia</font>) were probably derogatory slogans used by Jews and Gentiles to describe their opponents (&#8220;The Circumcision and the Uncircumcision in Rome,&#8221; <i>NTS</i> 35 [1989]: 77-80).</p>
