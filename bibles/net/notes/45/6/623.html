<A NAME="623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=274><b>tn</b> A figurative extension of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8000;&#968;&#8061;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">oywnion</font>), which refers to a soldier&#8217;s pay or wages. Here it refers to the end result of an activity, seen as something one receives back in return. In this case the activity is sin, and the translation &#8220;payoff&#8221; captures this thought. See also L&amp;N 89.42.</p>
