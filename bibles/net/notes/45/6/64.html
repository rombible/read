<A NAME="64"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=255><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;may be rendered ineffective, inoperative,&#8221; or possibly &#8220;may be destroyed.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#961;&#947;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">katargew</font>) has various nuances. In Rom 7:2 the wife whose husband has died is <i>freed</i> from the law (i.e., the law of marriage no longer has any power over her, in spite of what she may feel). A similar point seems to be made here (note v. 7).</p>
