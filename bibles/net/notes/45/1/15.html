<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>tn</b> The genitive in the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8016;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#941;&#955;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">euangelion qeou</font>, &#8220;the gospel of God&#8221;) could be translated as (1) a subjective genitive (&#8220;the gospel which God brings&#8221;) or (2) an objective genitive (&#8220;the gospel about God&#8221;). Either is grammatically possible. This is possibly an instance of a plenary genitive (see <i>ExSyn</i> 119-21; M. Zerwick, <i>Biblical Greek</i>, §§36-39). If so, an interplay between the two concepts is intended: The gospel which God brings is in fact the gospel about himself. However, in view of God&#8217;s action in v. 2 concerning this gospel, a subjective genitive notion (&#8220;the gospel which God brings&#8221;) is slightly preferred.</p>
