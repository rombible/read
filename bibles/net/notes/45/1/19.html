<a name="19"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=9><b>sn</b> <i>Appointed the Son-of-God-in-power. </i>Most translations render the Greek participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jorisqentos</font>, from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001;&#961;&#943;&#950;&#969;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jorizw</font>) &#8220;declared&#8221; or &#8220;designated&#8221; in order to avoid the possible interpretation that Jesus was appointed the Son of God by the resurrection. However, the Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001;&#961;&#943;&#950;&#969;</font> is used eight times in the NT, and it always has the meaning &#8220;to determine, appoint.&#8221; Paul is not saying that Jesus was appointed the &#8220;Son of God by the resurrection&#8221; but &#8220;Son-of-God-in-power by the resurrection,&#8221; as indicated by the hyphenation. He was born in weakness in human flesh (<i>with respect to the flesh</i>, v. 3) and he was raised with power. This is similar to Matt 28:18 where Jesus told his disciples after the resurrection, &#8220;All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.&#8221;</p>
