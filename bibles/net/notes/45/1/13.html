The meaning is not affected in either case, but the reading &#8220;Christ Jesus&#8221; is preferred as slightly more difficult and thus more likely the original (a scribe who found it would be prone to change it to the more common expression). At the same time, Paul is fond of the order &#8220;Christ Jesus,&#8221; especially in certain letters such as Romans, Galatians, and Philippians. As well, the later Pauline letters almost uniformly use this order in the salutations. A decision is difficult, but &#8220;Christ Jesus&#8221; is slightly preferred.</p>
