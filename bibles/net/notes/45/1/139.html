<a name="139"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=39><b>tn</b> The genitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#8061;&#960;&#969;&#957;</font> could be taken as an attributed genitive, in which case the phase should be translated &#8220;against all ungodly and unrighteous people&#8221; (cf. &#8220;the truth of God&#8221; in v. 25 which is also probably an attributed genitive). C. E. B. Cranfield takes the section 1:18-32 to refer to <i>all</i> people (not just Gentiles), while 2:1-3:20 points out that the Jew is no exception (<i>Romans</i> [ICC], 1:104-6; 1:137-38).</p>
