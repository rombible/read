<a name="135"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=35><b>tn</b> The nature of the &#8220;righteousness&#8221; described here and the force of the genitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> (&#8220;of God&#8221;) which follows have been much debated. (1) Some (e.g. C. E. B. Cranfield, <i>Romans </i>[ICC], 1:98) understand &#8220;righteousness&#8221; to refer to the righteous status given to believers as a result of God&#8217;s justifying activity, and see the genitive &#8220;of God&#8221; as a genitive of source (= &#8220;from God&#8221;). (2) Others see the &#8220;righteousness&#8221; as God&#8217;s act or declaration that makes righteous (i.e., justifies) those who turn to him in faith, taking the genitive &#8220;of God&#8221; as a subjective genitive (see E. Käsemann, <i>Romans</i>, 25-30). (3) Still others see the &#8220;righteousness of God&#8221; mentioned here as the attribute of God himself, understanding the genitive &#8220;of God&#8221; as a possessive genitive (&#8220;God&#8217;s righteousness&#8221;).</p>
