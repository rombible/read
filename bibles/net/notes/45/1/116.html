<a name="116"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=16><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;among whom you also are called.&#8221; Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started here in the translation. The NIV, with its translation &#8220;And you also are among those who are called,&#8221; takes the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#959;&#7987;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#949;</font> to refer to the following clause rather than the preceding, so that the addressees of the letter (&#8220;you also&#8221;) are not connected with &#8220;all the Gentiles&#8221; mentioned at the end of v. 5. It is more likely, however, that the relative pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#7987;&#962;</font> has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#7956;&#952;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#957;</font> as its antecedent, which would indicate that the church at Rome was predominantly Gentile.</p>
