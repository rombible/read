<A NAME="21"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=66><b>sn</b> <i>Rom 2:1-29</i> presents unusual difficulties for the interpreter. There have been several major approaches to the chapter and the group(s) it refers to: (1) Rom 2:14 refers to Gentile Christians, not Gentiles who obey the Jewish law. (2) Paul in Rom 2 is presenting a hypothetical viewpoint: If anyone could obey the law, that person would be justified, but no one can. (3) The reference to &#8220;the ones who do the law&#8221; in 2:13 are those who &#8220;do&#8221; the law in the right way, on the basis of faith, not according to Jewish legalism. (4) Rom 2:13 only speaks about Christians being judged in the future, along with such texts as Rom 14:10 and 2 Cor 5:10. (5) Paul&#8217;s material in Rom 2 is drawn heavily from Diaspora Judaism, so that the treatment of the law presented here cannot be harmonized with other things Paul says about the law elsewhere (E. P. Sanders, <i>Paul, the Law, and the Jewish People</i>, 123); another who sees Rom 2 as an example of Paul&#8217;s inconsistency in his treatment of the law is H. Räisänen, <i>Paul and the Law</i> [WUNT], 101-9. (6) The list of blessings and curses in Deut 27&#8211;30 provide the background for Rom 2; the Gentiles of 2:14 are Gentile Christians, but the condemnation of Jews in 2:17-24 addresses the failure of Jews as a nation to keep the law as a whole (A. Ito, &#8220;Romans 2: A Deuteronomistic Reading,&#8221; <i>JSNT</i> 59 [1995]: 21-37).</p>
<A NAME="22"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=67><b>tn</b> Some interpreters (e.g., C. K.

<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=81><b>sn</b> A quotation from Ps 62:12; Prov 24:12; a close approximation to Matt 16:27.</p>
<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=82><b>tn</b> This contrast is clearer and stronger in Greek than can be easily expressed in English.</p>

<A NAME="220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=85><b>tn</b> No verb is expressed in this verse, but the verb &#8220;to be&#8221; is implied by the Greek construction. Literally &#8220;suffering and distress on everyone&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=87><b>sn</b> Paul uses the term <i>Greek</i> here and in v. 10 to refer to non-Jews, i.e., Gentiles.</p>
<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=88><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;but even,&#8221; to emphasize the contrast. The second word has been omitted since it is somewhat redundant in English idiom.</p>
<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=89><b>sn</b> This is the first occurrence of <i>law</i> (<font face="Greektl">nomos</font>) in Romans. Exactly what Paul means by the term has been the subject of much scholarly debate. According to J. A. Fitzmyer (<i>Romans</i> [AB], 131-35; 305-6) there are at least four different senses: (1) figurative, as a &#8220;principle&#8221;; (2) generic, meaning &#8220;a law&#8221;; (3) as a reference to the OT or some part of the OT; and (4) as a reference to the Mosaic law. This last usage constitutes the majority of Paul&#8217;s references to &#8220;law&#8221; in Romans.</p>
<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=90><b>tn</b> The Greek sentence expresses this contrast more succinctly than is possible in English. <i>Grk</i> &#8220;For not the hearers of the law are righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be declared righteous.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=91><b>sn</b> <i>Gentile </i>is a NT term for a non-Jew.</p>
<A NAME="227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=92><b>tn</b> Some (e.g. C. E. B. Cranfield, <i>Romans</i> [ICC], 1:135-37) take the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#973;&#963;&#949;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">fusei</font>, &#8220;by nature&#8221;) to go with the preceding &#8220;do not have the law,&#8221; thus: &#8220;the Gentiles who do not have the law by nature,&#8221; that is, by virtue of not being born Jewish.</p>
<A NAME="228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=93><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;do by nature the things of the law.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=94><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;who.&#8221; The relative pronoun was converted to a personal pronoun and, because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started here in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=95><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;show the work of the law [to be] written,&#8221; with the words in brackets implied by the Greek construction.</p>
<A NAME="231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=96><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;excuse.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=97><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;their conscience bearing witness and between the thoughts accusing or also defending one another.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=98><b>tn</b> The form of the Greek word is either present or future, but it is best to translate in future because of the context of future judgment.</p>
<A NAME="234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=99><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;of people.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=100><b>sn</b> On <i>my gospel</i> cf. Rom 16:25; 2 Tim 2:8.</p>
<A NAME="236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=101><b>sn</b> The <i>law</i> refers to the Mosaic law, described mainly in the OT books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.</p>
<A NAME="237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=102><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;boast in God.&#8221; This may be an allusion to Jer 9:24.</p>

<A NAME="239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=104><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;because of being instructed out of the law.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=105><b>tn</b> This verb is parallel to the verbs in vv. 17-18a, so it shares the conditional meaning even though the word &#8220;if&#8221; is not repeated.</p>
<A NAME="241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=106><b>tn</b> The structure of vv. 21-24 is difficult. Some take these verses as the apodosis of the conditional clauses (protases) in vv. 17-20; others see vv. 17-20 as an instance of anacoluthon (a broken off or incomplete construction).</p>
<A NAME="242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=107><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;detest.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=108><b>sn</b> A quotation from Isa 52:5.</p>
<A NAME="244"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=109><b>sn</b> <i>Circumcision</i> refers to male circumcision as prescribed in the OT, which was given as a covenant to Abraham in Gen 17:10-14. Its importance for Judaism can hardly be overstated: According to J. D. G. Dunn (<i>Romans</i> [WBC], 1:120) it was the &#8220;single clearest distinguishing feature of the covenant people.&#8221; J. Marcus has suggested that the terms used for circumcision (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#964;&#959;&#956;&#8053;</font>, <font face="Greektl">peritomh</font>) and uncircumcision (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#954;&#961;&#959;&#946;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#943;&#945;</font>, <font face="Greektl">akrobustia</font>) were probably derogatory slogans used by Jews and Gentiles to describe their opponents (&#8220;The Circumcision and the Uncircumcision in Rome,&#8221; <i>NTS</i> 35 [1989]: 77-80).</p>
<A NAME="245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=110><b>tn</b> This contrast is clearer and stronger in Greek than can be easily expressed in English.</p>
<A NAME="246"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=111><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;if you should be a transgressor of the law.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="247"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=112><b>tn</b> The Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#965;&#955;&#940;&#963;&#963;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">fulassw</font>, traditionally translated &#8220;keep&#8221;) in this context connotes preservation of and devotion to an object as well as obedience.</p>
<A NAME="248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=113><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the uncircumcision by nature.&#8221; The word &#8220;man&#8221; is supplied here to make clear that male circumcision (or uncircumcision) is in view.</p>
<A NAME="249"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=114><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;through,&#8221; but here the preposition seems to mean &#8220;(along) with,&#8221; &#8220;though provided with,&#8221; as BDAG 224 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#940;</font> A.3.c indicates.</p>
<A NAME="250"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=115><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;letter.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="252"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=117><b>tn</b> Some have taken the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#960;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en pneumati</font>, &#8220;by/in [the] S/spirit&#8221;) not as a reference to the Holy Spirit, but referring to circumcision as &#8220;spiritual and not literal&#8221; (RSV).</p>
