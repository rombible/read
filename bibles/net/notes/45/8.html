<A NAME="81"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=303><b>tc</b> The earliest and best witnesses of the Alexandrian and Western texts, as well as a few others (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* B D* F G 6 1506 1739 1881 <i>pc</i> co), have no additional words for v. 1. Later scribes (A D<sup>1</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 81 365 629 <i>pc </i>vg) added the words <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#8052; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#963;&#940;&#961;&#954;&#945; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#960;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#963;&#953;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">mh kata sarka peripatousin</font>, &#8220;who do not walk according to the flesh&#8221;), while even later ones (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2 </sup>D<sup>2 </sup>33<sup>vid</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>) added <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#960;&#957;&#949;&#8166;&#956;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">alla kata pneuma</font>, &#8220;but [who do walk] according to the Spirit&#8221;). Both the external evidence and the internal evidence are compelling for the shortest reading. The scribes were evidently motivated to add such qualifications (interpolated from v. 4) to insulate Paul&#8217;s gospel from charges that it was characterized too much by grace. The KJV follows the longest reading found in <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>.</p>
<A NAME="82"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=304><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;for the law of the Spirit of life.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="83"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=305><b>tc</b> Most <sc>mss read the first person singular pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">me</font>) here (A D 1739<sup>c</sup> 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat sa). The second person singular pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">se</font>) is superior because of external support (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B {F which reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#945;&#953;</font>} G 1506* 1739*) and internal support (it is the harder reading since ch. 7 was narrated in the first person). At the same time, it could have arisen via dittography from the final syllable of the verb preceding it (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7968;&#955;&#949;&#965;&#952;&#941;&#961;&#969;&#963;&#949;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">hleuqerwsen</font>; &#8220;has set free&#8221;). But for this to happen in such early and diverse witnesses is unlikely, especially as it depends on various scribes repeatedly overlooking either the <i>nu</i> or the <i>nu</i>-bar at the end of the verb.</p>
<A NAME="84"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=306><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;in that.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="85"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=307><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;think on&#8221; or &#8220;are intent on&#8221; (twice in this verse). What is in view here is not primarily preoccupation, however, but worldview. Translations like &#8220;set their mind on&#8221; could be misunderstood by the typical English reader to refer exclusively to preoccupation.</p>
<A NAME="86"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=308><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;mindset,&#8221; &#8220;way of thinking&#8221; (twice in this verse and once in v. 7). The Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#961;&#972;&#957;&#951;&#956;&#945;</font> does not refer to one&#8217;s mind, but to one&#8217;s outlook or mindset.</p>
<A NAME="87"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=309><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;are not controlled by the flesh but by the Spirit.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="88"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=310><b>tn</b> Greek emphasizes the contrast between these two clauses more than can be easily expressed in English.</p>
<A NAME="89"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=311><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;life-giving.&#8221; <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the Spirit is life.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=312><b>sn</b> <i>The one who raised Jesus from the dead</i> refers to God (also in the following clause).</p>
<A NAME="811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=313><b>tc</b> Several <sc>mss read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Ihsoun</font>, &#8220;Jesus&#8221;) after <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Criston</font>, &#8220;Christ&#8221;; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* A D* 630 1506 1739 1881 <i>pc</i> bo); C 81 104 lat have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#957; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font>. The shorter reading is more likely to be original, though, both because of external evidence (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> B D<sup>2</sup> F G <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> sa) and internal evidence (scribes were much more likely to add the name &#8220;Jesus&#8221; if it were lacking than to remove it if it were already present in the text, especially to harmonize with the earlier mention of Jesus in the verse).</p>
<A NAME="812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=314><b>tc</b> Most <sc>mss (B D F G <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 33 1739 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat) have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#940;</font> (<font face="Greektl">dia</font>) followed by the accusative: &#8220;because of his Spirit who lives in you.&#8221; The genitive &#8220;through his Spirit&#8221; is supported by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A C<sup>(</sup>*<sup>)</sup> 81 104 1505 1506 <i>al</i>, and is slightly preferred.</p>
<A NAME="813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=315><b>tn</b> There is a double connective here that cannot be easily preserved in English: &#8220;consequently therefore,&#8221; emphasizing the conclusion of what he has been arguing.</p>

<A NAME="817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=319><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;For as many as are being led by the Spirit of God, these are.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=320><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;slavery again to fear.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=321><b>tn</b> The Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#965;&#7985;&#959;&#952;&#949;&#963;&#943;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Juioqesia</font>) was originally a legal technical term for adoption as a son with full rights of inheritance. BDAG 1024 s.v. notes, &#8220;a legal t.t. of &#8216;adoption&#8217; of children, in our lit., i.e. in Paul, only in a transferred sense of a transcendent filial relationship between God and humans (with the legal aspect, not gender specificity, as major semantic component).&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=322><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;in that.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=323><b>tn</b> Or possibly &#8220;with.&#8221; <i>ExSyn</i> 160-61, however, notes the following: &#8220;At issue, grammatically, is whether the Spirit testifies <i>alongside of </i>our spirit (dat. of association), or whether he testifies <i>to our spirit</i> (indirect object) that we are God&#8217;s children. If the former, the one receiving this testimony is unstated (is it God? or believers?). If the latter, the believer receives the testimony and hence is assured of salvation via the inner witness of the Spirit. The first view has the advantage of a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#973;&#957;</font>- (<font face="Greektl">sun</font>-) prefixed verb, which might be expected to take an accompanying dat. of association (and is supported by NEB, JB, etc.). But there are three reasons why <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pneumati</font>) should <i>not</i> be taken as association: (1) Grammatically, a dat. with a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#973;&#957;</font>- prefixed verb does not necessarily indicate association. This, of course, does not preclude such here, but this fact at least opens up the alternatives in this text. (2) Lexically, though <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#965;&#956;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#965;&#961;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">summarturew</font>) originally bore an associative idea, it developed in the direction of merely intensifying <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#965;&#961;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">marturew</font>). This is surely the case in the only other NT text with a dat. (Rom 9:1). (3) Contextually, a dat. of association does not seem to support Paul&#8217;s argument: &#8216;What standing has our spirit in <i>this</i> matter? Of itself it surely has no right at all to testify to our being sons of God&#8217; [C. E. B. Cranfield, <i>Romans </i>[ICC], 1:403]. In sum, Rom 8:16 seems to be secure as a text in which the believer&#8217;s assurance of salvation is based on the inner witness of the Spirit. The implications of this for one&#8217;s soteriology are profound: The objective data, as helpful as they are, cannot by themselves provide <i>assurance</i> of salvation; the believer also needs (and receives) an existential, ongoing encounter with God&#8217;s Spirit in order to gain that familial comfort.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=324><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;on the one hand, heirs of God; on the other hand, fellow heirs with Christ.&#8221; Some prefer to render v. 17 as follows: &#8220;And if children, then heirs &#8211; that is, heirs of God. Also fellow heirs with Christ if indeed we suffer with him so we may also be glorified with him.&#8221; Such a translation suggests two distinct inheritances, one coming to all of God&#8217;s children, the other coming only to those who suffer with Christ. The difficulty of this view, however, is that it ignores the correlative conjunctions <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;</font>&#8230;<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">men</font>&#8230;<font face="Greektl">de</font>, &#8220;on the one hand&#8230;on the other hand&#8221;): The construction strongly suggests that the inheritances cannot be separated since both explain &#8220;then heirs.&#8221; For this reason, the preferred translation puts this explanation in parentheses.</p>
<A NAME="823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=325><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;are not worthy [to be compared].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=326><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;because of the one&#8221;; the referent (God) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=327><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;who have the Spirit as firstfruits.&#8221; The genitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pneumatos</font>) can be understood here as possessive (&#8220;the firstfruits belonging to the Spirit&#8221;) although it is much more likely that this is a genitive of apposition (&#8220;the firstfruits, namely, the Spirit&#8221;); cf. TEV, NLT. </p>
<A NAME="826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=328><b>tn</b> See the note on &#8220;adoption&#8221; in v. 15.</p>
<A NAME="827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=329><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;body.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=331><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;for we do not know what we ought to pray for.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=332><b>sn</b> <i>He</i> refers to God here; Paul has not specifically identified him for the sake of rhetorical power (for by leaving the subject slightly ambiguous, he draws his audience into seeing God&#8217;s hand in places where he is not explicitly mentioned).</p>
<A NAME="831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=333><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;he,&#8221; or &#8220;it&#8221;; the referent (the Spirit) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="832"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=334><b>tc</b> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jo qeos</font>, &#8220;God&#8221;) is found after the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#8150;</font> (<font face="Greektl">sunergei</font>, &#8220;work&#8221;) in v. 28 by <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46 </sup>A B 81 sa; the shorter reading is found in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> C D F G <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 33 1739 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> latt sy bo. Although the inclusion is supported by a significant early papyrus, the alliance of significant Alexandrian and Western witnesses favors the shorter reading. As well, the longer reading is evidently motivated by a need for clarification. Since <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font> is textually suspect, it is better to read the text without it. This leaves two good translational options: either &#8220;he works all things together for good&#8221; or &#8220;all things work together for good.&#8221; In the first instance the subject is embedded in the verb and &#8220;God&#8221; is clearly implied (as in v. 29). In the second instance, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">panta</font>) becomes the subject of an intransitive verb. In either case, &#8220;What is expressed is a truly biblical confidence in the sovereignty of God&#8221; (C. E. B. Cranfield, <i>Romans</i> [ICC], 1:427).</p>
<A NAME="833"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=335><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (God&#8217;s Son) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>

<A NAME="835"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=337><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;[he] who.&#8221; The relative clause continues the question of v. 31 in a way that is awkward in English. The force of v. 32 is thus: &#8220;who indeed did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all &#8211; How will he not also with him give us all things?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="836"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=338><b>sn</b> An allusion to Isa 50:8 where the reference is singular; Paul applies this to all believers (&#8220;God&#8217;s <i>elect</i>&#8221; is plural here).</p>
<A NAME="837"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=339><b>tc</b> &#8225; A number of significant and early witnesses, along with several others (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46vid </sup><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A C F G L <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 6 33 81 104 365 1505 <i>al</i> lat bo), read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Ihsous</font>, &#8220;Jesus&#8221;) after <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Cristos</font>, &#8220;Christ&#8221;) in v. 34. But the shorter reading is not unrepresented (B D 0289 1739 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> sa). Once <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</font> got into the text, what scribe would omit it? Although the external evidence is on the side of the longer reading, internally such an expansion seems suspect. The shorter reading is thus preferred. NA<sup>27 </sup>has the word in brackets, indicating doubt as to its authenticity.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;who also.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="838"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=340><b>tn</b> Here &#8220;sword&#8221; is a metonymy that includes both threats of violence and acts of violence, even including death (although death is not necessarily the only thing in view here).</p>
<A NAME="839"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=341><b>sn</b> A quotation from Ps 44:22.</p>
<A NAME="840"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=342><b>tn</b> BDAG 1034 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#960;&#949;&#961;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#940;&#969;</font> states, &#8220;as a heightened form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#957;&#953;&#954;&#8118;&#957;</font> <i>prevail completely</i> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#960;&#949;&#961;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#8182;&#956;&#949;&#957;</font> <i>we are winning a most glorious victory</i> Ro 8:37.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="841"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=343><b>tn</b> Here the referent could be either God or Christ, but in v. 39 it is God&#8217;s love that is mentioned.</p>
<A NAME="842"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=344><b>tn</b> BDAG 138 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8053;</font> 6 takes this term as a reference to angelic or transcendent powers (as opposed to merely human rulers). To clarify this, the adjective &#8220;heavenly&#8221; has been supplied in the translation. Some interpreters see this as a reference to fallen angels or demonic powers, and this view is reflected in some recent translations (NIV, NLT).</p>
