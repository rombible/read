<A NAME="1112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=447><b>sn</b> Most interpreters see Paul as making use of a long-standing metaphor of the olive tree (<i>the root&#8230;the branches</i>) as a symbol for Israel. See, in this regard, Jer 11:16, 19. A. T. Hanson, <i>Studies in Paul&#8217;s Technique and Theology</i>, 121-24, cites rabbinic use of the figure of the olive tree, and goes so far as to argue that Rom 11:17-24 is a midrash on Jer 11:16-19.</p>
