<A NAME="113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=438><b>tn</b> The Greek term here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#8053;&#961;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anhr</font>), which only exceptionally is used in a generic sense of both males and females. In this context, it appears to be a generic usage (&#8220;people&#8221;) since when Paul speaks of a remnant of faithful Israelites (&#8220;the elect,&#8221; v. 7), he is not referring to males only. It can also be argued, however, that it refers only to adult males here (&#8220;men&#8221;), perhaps as representative of all the faithful left in Israel.</p>
