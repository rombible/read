<A NAME="1515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=525><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;so that the offering of the Gentiles may become acceptable.&#8221; This could be understood to refer to an offering belonging to the Gentiles (a possessive genitive) or made by the Gentiles (subjective genitive), but more likely the phrase should be understood as an appositive genitive, with the Gentiles themselves consisting of the offering (so J. D. G. Dunn, <i>Romans</i> [WBC 38], 2:860). The latter view is reflected in the translation &#8220;so that the Gentiles may become an acceptable offering.&#8221;</p>
