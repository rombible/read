Articles were frequently introduced to clarify the meaning of the text. In this instance, since the word modified (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#973;&#967;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">kauchsin</font>) is third declension, a visual oversight (resulting in omission) is less likely. Hence, the shorter reading is probably original. The difference in translation between these first two options is negligible (&#8220;I have <i>the</i> boast&#8221; or &#8220;I have <i>a </i>boast&#8221;). NA<sup>27</sup> puts the article in brackets, indicating some doubt as to its authenticity.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Therefore I have a boast.&#8221; </p>
