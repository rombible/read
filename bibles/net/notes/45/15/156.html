<A NAME="156"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=516><b>tn</b> There are two major syntactical alternatives which are both awkward: (1) One could make &#8220;glorify&#8221; dependent on &#8220;Christ has become a minister&#8221; and coordinate with &#8220;to confirm&#8221; and the result would be rendered &#8220;Christ has become a minister of circumcision to confirm the promises&#8230;and so that the Gentiles might glorify God.&#8221; (2) One could make &#8220;glorify&#8221; dependent on &#8220;I tell you&#8221; and coordinate with &#8220;Christ has become a minister&#8221; and the result would be rendered &#8220;I tell you that Christ has become a minister of circumcision&#8230;and that the Gentiles glorify God.&#8221; The second rendering is preferred.</p>
