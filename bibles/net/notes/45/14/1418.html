<A NAME="1418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=509><b>tc</b> &#8225; Several important Alexandrian witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A B C 048) have the relative pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7973;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">{hn</font>, &#8220;the faith <i>that</i> you have&#8221;) at this juncture, but D F G <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 1739 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat<i> </i>co lack it. Without the pronoun, the clause is more ambiguous (either &#8220;Keep the faith [that] you have between yourself and God&#8221; or &#8220;Do you have faith? Keep it between yourself and God&#8221;). The pronoun thus looks to be a motivated reading, created to clarify the meaning of the text. Even though it is found in the better witnesses, in this instance internal evidence should be given preference. NA<sup>27</sup> places the word in brackets, indicating some doubt as to its authenticity.</p>
