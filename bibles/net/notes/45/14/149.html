<A NAME="149"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=500><b>tc</b> &#8225; The words &#8220;to God&#8221; are absent from some <sc>mss (B F G 6 630 1739 1881 <i>pc</i>) but are found in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A C D <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 0209 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat sy co. External evidence somewhat favors their inclusion since Alexandrian, Western, and Byzantine <sc>mss are well represented. From an internal standpoint, however, it is easy to see the words as a scribal gloss intended to clarify the referent, especially as a reinforcement to the quotation of Isa 45:23 in v. 11. Not only that, but the abrupt ending of the verse without &#8220;to God&#8221; is harsh, both in Greek and in English. In this instance, the internal considerations seem overwhelming on the side of the omission. At the same time, English stylistic needs require the words and they have been put into the translation, even though they are most likely not original. NA<sup>27 </sup>places the words in brackets, indicating doubt as to their authenticity.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;each of us is accountable to God.&#8221;</p>
