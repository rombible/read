<A NAME="91"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=345><b>sn</b> <i>Rom 9:1&#8211;11:36.</i> These three chapters are among the most difficult and disputed in Paul&#8217;s Letter to the Romans. One area of difficulty is the relationship between Israel and the church, especially concerning the nature and extent of Israel&#8217;s election. Many different models have been constructed to express this relationship. For a representative survey, see M. Barth, <i>The People of God</i> (JSNTSup), 22-27. The literary genre of these three chapters has been frequently identified as a diatribe, a philosophical discussion or conversation evolved by the Cynic and Stoic schools of philosophy as a means of popularizing their ideas (E. Käsemann, <i>Romans</i>, 261 and 267). But other recent scholars have challenged the idea that Rom 9&#8211;11 is characterized by diatribe. Scholars like R. Scroggs and E. E. Ellis have instead identified the material in question as midrash. For a summary and discussion of the rabbinic connections, see W. R. Stegner, &#8220;Romans 9.6-29 &#8211; A Midrash,&#8221; <i>JSNT</i> 22 (1984): 37-52.</p>

<A NAME="98"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=352><b>tn</b> The Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#965;&#7985;&#959;&#952;&#949;&#963;&#943;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Juioqesia</font>) was originally a legal technical term for adoption as a son with full rights of inheritance. BDAG 1024 s.v. notes, &#8220;a legal t.t. of &#8216;adoption&#8217; of children, in our lit., i.e. in Paul, only in a transferred sense of a transcendent filial relationship between God and humans (with the legal aspect, not gender specificity, as major semantic component).&#8221; Although some modern translations remove the filial sense completely and render the term merely &#8220;adoption&#8221; (cf. NAB, ESV), the retention of this component of meaning was accomplished in the present translation by the phrase &#8220;as sons.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="99"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=353><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;cultic service.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="910"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=354><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;of whom are the fathers.&#8221; Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started here in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=355><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;from whom.&#8221; Here the relative pronoun has been replaced by a personal pronoun.</p>

<A NAME="913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=357><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Messiah.&#8221; (Both Greek &#8220;Christ&#8221; and Hebrew and Aramaic &#8220;Messiah&#8221; mean &#8220;one who has been anointed.&#8221;)</p>
<A NAME="914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=358><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the Christ, who is over all, God blessed forever,&#8221; or &#8220;the Messiah. God who is over all be blessed forever!&#8221; or &#8220;the Messiah who is over all. God be blessed forever!&#8221; The translational difficulty here is not text-critical in nature, but is a problem of punctuation. Since the genre of these opening verses of Romans 9 is a lament, it is probably best to take this as an affirmation of Christ&#8217;s deity (as the text renders it). Although the other renderings are possible, to see a note of praise to God at the end of this section seems strangely out of place. But for Paul to bring his lament to a crescendo (that is to say, his kinsmen had rejected <i>God </i>come in the flesh), thereby deepening his anguish, is wholly appropriate. This is also supported grammatically and stylistically: The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#8034;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jo wn</font>, &#8220;the one who is&#8221;) is most naturally taken as a phrase which modifies something in the preceding context, and Paul&#8217;s doxologies are always closely tied to the preceding context. For a detailed examination of this verse, see B. M. Metzger, &#8220;The Punctuation of Rom. 9:5,&#8221; <i>Christ and the Spirit in the New Testament</i>, 95-112; and M. J. Harris, <i>Jesus as God</i>, 144-72.</p>

<A NAME="926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=370><b>sn</b> Many translations place this verse division before the phrase &#8220;not by works but by his calling&#8221; (NA<sup>27</sup>/UBS<sup>4</sup>, NIV, NRSV, NLT, NAB). Other translations place this verse division in the same place that the translation above does (NASB, KJV, NKJV, ASV, RSV). The translation has followed the latter to avoid breaking the parenthetical statement.</p>

<A NAME="941"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=385><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;one vessel for honor and another for dishonor.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="942"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=386><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;vessels.&#8221; This is the same Greek word used in v. 21.</p>
<A NAME="943"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=387><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;vessels destined for wrath.&#8221; The genitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8000;&#961;&#947;&#8134;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">orghs</font>) could be taken as a genitive of destination.</p>
<A NAME="944"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=388><b>tn</b> Or possibly &#8220;objects of wrath that have fit themselves for destruction.&#8221; The form of the participle could be taken either as a passive or middle (reflexive). <i>ExSyn </i>417-18 argues strongly for the passive sense (which is followed in the translation), stating that &#8220;the middle view has little to commend it.&#8221; First, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#943;&#950;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">katartizw</font>) is nowhere else used in the NT as a direct or reflexive middle (a usage which, in any event, is quite rare in the NT). Second, the lexical force of this verb, coupled with the perfect tense, suggests something of a &#8220;done deal&#8221; (against some commentaries that see these vessels as <i>ready</i> for destruction yet still able to avert disaster). Third, the potter-clay motif seems to have one point: The potter prepares the clay.</p>
<A NAME="945"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=389><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;vessels.&#8221; This is the same Greek word used in v. 21.</p>

<A NAME="951"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=395><b>tc</b> In light of the interpretive difficulty of this verse, a longer reading seems to have been added to clarify the meaning. The addition, in the middle of the sentence, makes the whole verse read as follows: &#8220;For he will execute his sentence completely and quickly in righteousness, because the Lord will do it quickly on the earth.&#8221; The shorter reading is found largely in Alexandrian <sc>mss (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* A B 6 1506 1739 1881 <i>pc</i> co), while the longer reading is found principally in Western and Byzantine <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> D F G <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat). The longer reading follows Isa 10:22-23 (LXX) verbatim, while Paul in the previous verse quoted the LXX loosely. This suggests the addition was made by a copyist trying to make sense out of a difficult passage rather than by the author himself. </p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> There is a wordplay in Greek (in both the LXX and here) on the phrase translated &#8220;completely and quickly&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#8182;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#964;&#941;&#956;&#957;&#969;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">suntelwn kai suntemnwn</font>). These participles are translated as adverbs for smoothness; a more literal (and more cumbersome) rendering would be: &#8220;The Lord will act by closing the account [or completing the sentence], and by cutting short the time.&#8221; The interpretation of this text is notoriously difficult. Cf. BDAG 975 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#964;&#941;&#956;&#957;&#969;</font>.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> A modified quotation from Isa 10:22-23.

Because not by faith but as though by works.&#8221; The verb (&#8220;they pursued [it]&#8221;) is to be supplied from the preceding verse for the sake of English style; yet a certain literary power is seen in Paul&#8217;s laconic style.</p>
