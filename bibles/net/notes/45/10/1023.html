<A NAME="1023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=429><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;they have not &#8216;not heard,&#8217; have they?&#8221; This question is difficult to render in English. The basic question is a negative sentence (&#8220;Have they not heard?&#8221;), but it is preceded by the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#8053;</font> (<font face="Greektl">mh</font>) which expects a negative response. The end result in English is a double negative (&#8220;They have not &#8216;not heard,&#8217; have they?&#8221;). This has been changed to a positive question in the translation for clarity. See BDAG 646 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#8053;</font> 3.a.; D. Moo, <i>Romans </i>(NICNT), 666, fn. 32; and C. E. B. Cranfield, <i>Romans </i>(ICC), 537, for discussion.</p>
