<A NAME="123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=466><b>tn</b> Although <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#965;&#963;&#967;&#951;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#943;&#950;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">suschmatizesqe</font>) could be either a passive or middle, the passive is more likely since it would otherwise have to be a <i>direct</i> middle (&#8220;conform yourselves&#8221;) and, as such, would be quite rare for NT Greek. It is very telling that being<i> </i>&#8220;conformed&#8221; to the present world is viewed as a passive notion, for it may suggest that it happens, in part, subconsciously. At the same time, the passive could well be a &#8220;permissive passive,&#8221; suggesting that there may be some consciousness of the conformity taking place. Most likely, it is a combination of both.</p>
