<A NAME="151"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=511><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;and not please ourselves.&#8221; NT Greek negatives used in contrast like this are often not absolute, but relative: &#8220;not so much one as the other.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="152"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=512><b>sn</b> A quotation from Ps 69:9.</p>
<A NAME="153"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=513><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;grant you to think the same among one another.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="154"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=514><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;of the circumcision&#8221;; that is, the Jews.</p>
<A NAME="155"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=515><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;to the patriarchs.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="156"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=516><b>tn</b> There are two major syntactical alternatives which are both awkward: (1) One could make &#8220;glorify&#8221; dependent on &#8220;Christ has become a minister&#8221; and coordinate with &#8220;to confirm&#8221; and the result would be rendered &#8220;Christ has become a minister of circumcision to confirm the promises&#8230;and so that the Gentiles might glorify God.&#8221; (2) One could make &#8220;glorify&#8221; dependent on &#8220;I tell you&#8221; and coordinate with &#8220;Christ has become a minister&#8221; and the result would be rendered &#8220;I tell you that Christ has become a minister of circumcision&#8230;and that the Gentiles glorify God.&#8221; The second rendering is preferred.</p>
<A NAME="157"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=517><b>sn</b> A quotation from Ps 18:49.</p>
<A NAME="158"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=518><b>sn</b> A quotation from Deut 32:43.</p>
<A NAME="159"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=519><b>sn</b> A quotation from Ps 117:1.</p>
<A NAME="1510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=520><b>sn</b> A quotation from Isa 11:10.</p>
<A NAME="1511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=521><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;in the believing&#8221; or &#8220;as [you] believe,&#8221; with the object &#8220;him&#8221; supplied from the context. The referent could be God (15:13a) or Christ (15:12).</p>
<A NAME="1512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=522><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;brothers.&#8221; See note on the phrase &#8220;brothers and sisters&#8221; in 1:13.</p>
<A NAME="1513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=523><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;serving.&#8221; This is a continuation of the previous sentence in the Greek text, but in keeping with contemporary English style, a new sentence was started here in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="1514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=524><b>tn</b> The genitive in the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8056; &#949;&#8016;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#941;&#955;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">to euangelion tou qeou</font>, &#8220;the gospel of God&#8221;) could be translated as either a subjective genitive (&#8220;the gospel which God brings&#8221;) or an objective genitive (&#8220;the gospel about God&#8221;). Either is grammatically possible. This is possibly an instance of a plenary genitive (see <i>ExSyn</i> 119-21; M. Zerwick, <i>Biblical Greek</i>, §§36-39). If so, an interplay between the two concepts is intended: The gospel which God brings is in fact the gospel about himself.</p>
<A NAME="1515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=525><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;so that the offering of the Gentiles may become acceptable.&#8221; This could be understood to refer to an offering belonging to the Gentiles (a possessive genitive) or made by the Gentiles (subjective genitive), but more likely the phrase should be understood as an appositive genitive, with the Gentiles themselves consisting of the offering (so J. D. G. Dunn, <i>Romans</i> [WBC 38], 2:860). The latter view is reflected in the translation &#8220;so that the Gentiles may become an acceptable offering.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=526><b>tc</b> &#8225; After <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">oun</font>), several important Alexandrian and Western <sc>mss (B C D F G 81 365 <i>pc</i>) have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8053;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">thn</font>). The article is lacking in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 33 1739 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> however. <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup> supplies a relative pronoun and has a different reading entirely (&#8220;which I have [as a] boast&#8221;). Articles were frequently introduced to clarify the meaning of the text. In this instance, since the word modified (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#973;&#967;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">kauchsin</font>) is third declension, a visual oversight (resulting in omission) is less likely. Hence, the shorter reading is probably original. The difference in translation between these first two options is negligible (&#8220;I have <i>the</i> boast&#8221; or &#8220;I have <i>a </i>boast&#8221;). NA<sup>27</sup> puts the article in brackets, indicating some doubt as to its authenticity.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Therefore I have a boast.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=527><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;unto obedience.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=528><b>sn</b> A quotation from Isa 52:15.</p>
<A NAME="1519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=529><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;now no longer having a place&#8230;I have.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=530><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;but having a desire&#8230;for many years.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=531><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;and to be helped by you.&#8221; The passive construction was changed to an active one in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="1522"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=532><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;to them&#8221;; the referent (the Jerusalem saints) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=533><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;have sealed this fruit to them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=534><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;brothers.&#8221; See note on the phrase &#8220;brothers and sisters&#8221; in 1:13.</p>
<A NAME="1525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=535><b>tn</b> Verses 30-31 form one long sentence in the Greek but have been divided into two distinct sentences for clarity in English. </p>
<A NAME="1526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=536><b>tc</b> Some <sc>mss lack the word &#8220;Amen&#8221; here, one of them (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup>) also inserting 16:25-27 at this point. See the <b>tc</b> note at 16:25 for more information. </p>
