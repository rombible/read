<A NAME="121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=464><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;brothers.&#8221; See note on the phrase &#8220;brothers and sisters&#8221; in 1:13.</p>
<A NAME="122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=465><b>tn</b> The participle and two adjectives &#8220;alive, holy, and pleasing to God&#8221; are taken as predicates in relation to &#8220;sacrifice,&#8221; making the exhortation more emphatic. See <i>ExSyn</i> 618-19.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Taken as predicate adjectives, the terms <i>alive, holy, and pleasing</i> are showing how unusual is the sacrifice that believers can now offer, for OT sacrifices were dead. As has often been quipped about this text, &#8220;The problem with living sacrifices is that they keep crawling off the altar.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=466><b>tn</b> Although <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#965;&#963;&#967;&#951;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#943;&#950;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">suschmatizesqe</font>) could be either a passive or middle, the passive is more likely since it would otherwise have to be a <i>direct</i> middle (&#8220;conform yourselves&#8221;) and, as such, would be quite rare for NT Greek. It is very telling that being<i> </i>&#8220;conformed&#8221; to the present world is viewed as a passive notion, for it may suggest that it happens, in part, subconsciously. At the same time, the passive could well be a &#8220;permissive passive,&#8221; suggesting that there may be some consciousness of the conformity taking place. Most likely, it is a combination of both.</p>
<A NAME="124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=467><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;to this age.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=468><b>sn</b> The verb translated <i>test and approve </i>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#954;&#953;&#956;&#940;&#950;&#969;</font>, <font face="Greektl">dokimazw</font>) carries the sense of &#8220;test with a positive outcome,&#8221; &#8220;test so as to approve.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=469><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;of you&#8221; have been supplied for clarity. </p>
<A NAME="127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=470><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;to each as God has distributed a measure of faith.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=471><b>tn</b> This word comes from the same root as &#8220;grace&#8221; in the following clause; it means &#8220;things graciously given,&#8221; &#8220;grace-gifts.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=472><b>tn</b> The verb &#8220;must be&#8221; is understood in the Greek text. </p>
<A NAME="1210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=473><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;but give yourselves to menial tasks.&#8221; The translation depends on whether one takes the adjective &#8220;lowly&#8221; as masculine or neuter.</p>
<A NAME="1211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=474><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Do not be wise in your thinking.&#8221;</p>
