<A NAME="514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=227><b>tn</b> The translation of the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#966;&#8127; &#8103;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ef Jw</font>) has been heavily debated. For a discussion of all the possibilities, see C. E. B. Cranfield, &#8220;On Some of the Problems in the Interpretation of Romans 5.12,&#8221; <i>SJT</i> 22 (1969): 324-41. Only a few of the major options can be mentioned here: (1) the phrase can be taken as a relative clause in which the pronoun refers to Adam, &#8220;death spread to all people <i>in whom</i> [Adam] all sinned.&#8221; (2) The phrase can be taken with consecutive (resultative) force, meaning &#8220;death spread to all people <i>with the result that</i> all sinned.&#8221; (3) Others take the phrase as causal in force: &#8220;death spread to all people <i>because </i>all sinned.&#8221;</p>
