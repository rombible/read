<A NAME="55"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=218><b>tn</b> The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969; &#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jh agaph tou qeou</font>, &#8220;the love of God&#8221;) could be interpreted as either an objective genitive (&#8220;our love for God&#8221;), subjective genitive (&#8220;God&#8217;s love for us&#8221;), or both (M. Zerwick&#8217;s &#8220;general&#8221; genitive [<i>Biblical Greek</i>,<i> </i>§§36-39]; D. B. Wallace&#8217;s &#8220;plenary&#8221; genitive [<i>ExSyn</i> 119-21]). The immediate context, which discusses what God has done for believers, favors a subjective genitive, but the fact that this love is poured out within the hearts of believers implies that it may be the source for believers&#8217; love for God; consequently an objective genitive cannot be ruled out. It is possible that both these ideas are meant in the text and that this is a plenary genitive: &#8220;The love that comes from God and that produces our love for God has been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us&#8221; (<i>ExSyn</i> 121).</p>
