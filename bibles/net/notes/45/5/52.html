<A NAME="52"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=215><b>tc</b> A number of important witnesses have the subjunctive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#967;&#969;&#956;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ecwmen</font>, &#8220;let us have&#8221;) instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#967;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ecomen</font>, &#8220;we have&#8221;) in v. 1. Included in the subjunctive&#8217;s support are <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* A B* C D K L 33 81 630 1175 1739* <i>pm </i>lat bo. But the indicative is not without its supporters: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>1 </sup>B<sup>2</sup> F G P <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 0220<sup>vid<i> </i></sup>104 365 1241 1505 1506 1739<sup>c </sup>1881 2464 <i>pm</i>. If the problem were to be solved on an external basis only, the subjunctive would be preferred. Because of this, the &#8220;A&#8221; rating on behalf of the indicative in the UBS<sup>4</sup> appears overly confident. Nevertheless, the indicative is probably correct. First, the earliest witness to Rom 5:1 has the indicative (0220<sup>vid</sup>, third century). Second, the first set of correctors is sometimes, if not often, of equal importance with the original hand. Hence, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>1 </sup>might be given equal value with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>*. Third, there is a good cross-section of witnesses for the indicative: Alexandrian (in 0220<sup>vid</sup>, probably <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>1 </sup>1241 1506 1881 <i>al</i>), Western (in F G), and Byzantine (noted in NA<sup>27</sup> as <i>pm</i>). Thus, although the external evidence is strongly in favor of the subjunctive, the indicative is represented well enough that its ancestry could easily go back to the original. Turning to the internal evidence, the indicative gains much ground. (1) The variant may have been produced via an error of hearing (since <i>omicron</i> and <i>omega</i> were pronounced alike in ancient Greek). This, of course, does not indicate which reading was original &#8211; just that an error of hearing may have produced one of them. In light of the indecisiveness of the transcriptional evidence, intrinsic evidence could play a much larger role. This is indeed the case here. (2) The indicative fits well with the overall argument of the book to this point. Up until now, Paul has been establishing the &#8220;indicatives of the faith.&#8221; There is only one imperative (used rhetorically) and only one hortatory subjunctive (and this in a quotation within a diatribe) up till this point, while from ch. 6 on there are sixty-one imperatives and seven hortatory subjunctives. Clearly, an exhortation would be out of place in ch. 5. (3) Paul presupposes that the audience has peace with God (via reconciliation) in 5:10. This seems to assume the indicative in v. 1. (4) As C. E. B. Cranfield notes, &#8220;it would surely be strange for Paul, in such a carefully argued writing as this, to exhort his readers to enjoy or to guard a peace which he has not yet explicitly shown to be possessed by them&#8221; (<i>Romans</i> [ICC], 1:257). (5) The notion that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#961;&#8053;&#957;&#951;&#957; &#7956;&#967;&#969;&#956;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">eirhnhn ecwmen</font>) can even naturally mean &#8220;enjoy peace&#8221; is problematic (<i>ExSyn</i> 464), yet those who embrace the subjunctive have to give the verb some such force. Thus, although the external evidence is stronger in support of the subjunctive, the internal evidence points to the indicative. Although a decision is difficult, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#967;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;</font> appears to be the authentic reading.</p>
