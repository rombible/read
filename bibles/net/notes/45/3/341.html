<A NAME="341"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=160><b>tn</b> Although a number of interpreters understand the &#8220;boasting&#8221; here to refer to Jewish boasting, others (e.g. C. E. B. Cranfield, &#8220;&#8216;The Works of the Law&#8217; in the Epistle to the Romans,&#8221; <i>JSNT</i> 43 [1991]: 96) take the phrase to refer to all human boasting before God.</p>
