<A NAME="333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=152><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7985;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#8053;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jilasthrion</font>) may carry the general sense &#8220;place of satisfaction,&#8221; referring to the place where God&#8217;s wrath toward sin is satisfied. More likely, though, it refers specifically to the &#8220;mercy seat,&#8221; i.e., the covering of the ark where the blood was sprinkled in the OT ritual on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur). This term is used only one other time in the NT: Heb 9:5, where it is rendered &#8220;mercy seat.&#8221; There it describes the altar in the most holy place (holy of holies). Thus Paul is saying that God displayed Jesus as the &#8220;mercy seat,&#8221; the place where propitiation was accomplished. See N. S. L. Fryer, &#8220;The Meaning and Translation of <i>Hilasterion</i> in Romans 3:25,&#8221; <i>EvQ </i>59 (1987): 99-116, who concludes the term is a neuter accusative substantive best translated &#8220;mercy seat&#8221; or &#8220;propitiatory covering,&#8221; and D. P. Bailey, &#8220;Jesus As the Mercy Seat: The Semantics and Theology of Paul&#8217;s Use of <i>Hilasterion</i> in Romans 3:25&#8221; (Ph.D. diss., University of Cambridge, 1999), who argues that this is a direct reference to the mercy seat which covered the ark of the covenant.</p>
