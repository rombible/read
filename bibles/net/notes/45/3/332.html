<A NAME="332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=151><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;in his blood.&#8221; The prepositional phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#945;&#7989;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ejn tw aujtou {aimati</font>) is difficult to interpret. It is traditionally understood to refer to the atoning sacrifice Jesus made when he shed his blood on the cross, and as a modifier of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7985;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#8053;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jilasthrion</font>). This interpretation fits if <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7985;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#8053;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> is taken to refer to a sacrifice. But if <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7985;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#8053;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> is taken to refer to the place where atonement is made as this translation has done (see note on the phrase &#8220;mercy seat&#8221;), this interpretation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#945;&#7989;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font> creates a violent mixed metaphor. Within a few words Paul would switch from referring to Jesus as the place where atonement was made to referring to Jesus as the atoning sacrifice itself. A viable option which resolves this problem is to see <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#945;&#7989;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font> as modifying the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#941;&#952;&#949;&#964;&#959;</font> (<font face="Greektl">proeqeto</font>). If it modifies the verb, it would explain the time or place in which God publicly displayed Jesus as the mercy seat; the reference to blood would be a metaphorical way of speaking of Jesus&#8217; death. This is supported by the placement of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#945;&#7989;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font> in the Greek text (it follows the noun, separated from it by another prepositional phrase) and by stylistic parallels with Rom 1:4. This is the interpretation the translation has followed, although it is recognized that many interpreters favor different options and translations. The prepositional phrase has been moved forward in the sentence to emphasize its connection with the verb, and the referent of the metaphorical language has been specified in the translation. For a detailed discussion of this interpretation, see D. P. Bailey, &#8220;Jesus As the Mercy Seat: The Semantics and Theology of Paul&#8217;s Use of <i>Hilasterion</i> in Romans 3:25&#8221; (Ph.D. diss., University of Cambridge, 1999).</p>
