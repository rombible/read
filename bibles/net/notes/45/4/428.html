<A NAME="428"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=194><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;He is our father&#8221; are not in the Greek text but are supplied to show that they resume Paul&#8217;s argument from 16b. (It is also possible to supply &#8220;Abraham had faith&#8221; here [so REB], taking the relative clause [&#8220;who is the father of us all&#8221;] as part of the parenthesis, and making the connection back to &#8220;the faith of Abraham,&#8221; but such an option is not as likely [C. E. B. Cranfield, <i>Romans</i> [ICC], 1:243].)</p>
