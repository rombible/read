<A NAME="436"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=202><b>tc</b> Most <sc>mss (D F G <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 33 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> it) read &#8220;he did not consider&#8221; by including the negative particle (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016;</font>, <font face="Greektl">ou</font>), but others (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A B C 6 81 365 1506 1739 <i>pc</i> co) lack <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016;</font>. The reading which includes the negative particle probably represents a scribal attempt to exalt the faith of Abraham by making it appear that his faith was so strong that he did not even consider the physical facts. But &#8220;here Paul does not wish to imply that faith means closing one&#8217;s eyes to reality, but that Abraham was so strong in faith as to be undaunted by every consideration&#8221; (<i>TCGNT</i> 451). Both on external and internal grounds, the reading without the negative particle is preferred.</p>
