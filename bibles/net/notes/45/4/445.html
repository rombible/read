<A NAME="445"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=211><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;handed over.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The verb translated <i>given over</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#948;&#943;&#948;&#969;&#956;&#953;</font>, <font face="Greektl">paradidwmi</font>) is also used in Rom 1:24, 26, 28 to describe <i>God </i>giving people over to sin. But it is also used frequently in the gospels to describe Jesus being handed over (or delivered up, betrayed) by sinful men for crucifixion (cf., e.g., Matt 26:21; 27:4; Mark 8:31; 9:31; 10:33; 15:15; Luke 20:20; 22:24; 24:7). It is probable that Paul has both ideas in mind: Jesus was handed over by sinners, but even this betrayal was directed by the Father for our sake (<i>because of our transgressions</i>).</p>
