<A NAME="410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=176><b>tn</b> The verb translated &#8220;count&#8221; here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#959;&#947;&#943;&#950;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">logizomai</font>). It occurs eight times in Rom 4:1-12, including here, each time with the sense of &#8220;place on someone&#8217;s account.&#8221; By itself the word is neutral, but in particular contexts it can take on a positive or negative connotation. The other occurrences of the verb have been translated using a form of the English verb &#8220;credit&#8221; because they refer to a positive event: the application of righteousness to the individual believer. The use here in v. 8 is negative: the application of sin. A form of the verb &#8220;credit&#8221; was not used here because of the positive connotations associated with that English word, but it is important to recognize that the same concept is used here as in the other occurrences.</p>
