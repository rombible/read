<A NAME="430"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=196><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;calls into existence the things that do not exist.&#8221; The translation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8033;&#962; &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jw&quot; onta</font>) allows for two different interpretations. If it has the force of result, then <i>creatio ex nihilo</i> is in view and the variant rendering is to be accepted (so C. E. B. Cranfield, <i>Romans</i> [ICC], 1:244). A problem with this view is the scarcity of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8033;&#962;</font> plus participle to indicate result (though for the telic idea with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8033;&#962;</font> plus participle, cf. Rom 15:15; 1 Thess 2:4). If it has a comparative force, then the translation given in the text is to be accepted: &#8220;this interpretation fits the <i>immediate</i> context better than a reference to God&#8217;s creative power, for it explains the assurance with which God can speak of the &#8216;many nations&#8217; that will be descended from Abraham&#8221; (D. Moo, <i>Romans</i> [NICNT], 282; so also W. Sanday and A. C. Headlam, <i>Romans</i> [ICC], 113). Further, this view is in line with a Pauline idiom, viz., verb followed by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8033;&#962;</font> plus participle (of the same verb or, in certain contexts, its antonym) to compare present reality with what is not a present reality (cf. 1 Cor 4:7; 5:3; 7:29, 30 (three times), 31; Col 2:20 [similarly, 2 Cor 6:9, 10]).</p>
