<A NAME="166"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=542><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Junias.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The feminine name <i>Junia</i>, though common in Latin, is quite rare in Greek (apparently only three instances of it occur in Greek literature outside Rom 16:7, according to the data in the <i>TLG </i>[D. Moo, <i>Romans </i>[NICNT], 922]). The masculine <i>Junias </i>(as a contraction for <i>Junianas</i>), however, is rarer still: Only one instance of the masculine name is known in extant Greek literature (Epiphanius mentions Junias in his <i>Index discipulorum </i>125). Further, since there are apparently other husband-wife teams mentioned in this salutation (Prisca and Aquila [v. 3], Philologus and Julia [v. 15]), it might be natural to think of Junia as a feminine name. (This ought not be pressed too far, however, for in v. 12 <i>all </i>three individuals are women [though the first two are linked together], and in vv. 9-11 all the individuals are men.) In Greek only a difference of accent distinguishes between Junias (male) and Junia (female). If it refers to a woman, it is possible (1) that she had the gift of apostleship (not the office), or (2) that she was not an apostle but along with Andronicus was esteemed by (or among) the apostles. As well, the term &#8220;prominent&#8221; probably means &#8220;well known,&#8221; suggesting that Andronicus and Junia(s) were well known to the apostles (see note on the phrase &#8220;well known&#8221; which follows).</p>
