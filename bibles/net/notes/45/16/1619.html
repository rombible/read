<A NAME="1619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=555><b>tc</b> Most <sc>mss (D [F G 629 without &#8220;Jesus Christ&#8221;] <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> [630] 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> <i>al</i>) include here <b>16:24</b> &#8220;The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you. Amen.&#8221; Other <sc>mss (P 33 104 365 <i>pc</i>) include the verse after <b>16:27</b>.

The strength of the external evidence, combined with uncertainty in other <sc>mss over where the verse should be located and the fact that it is a repetition of v. 20b, strongly favors omission of the verse. The present translation follows NA<sup>27</sup> in omitting the verse number, a procedure also followed by a number of other modern translations.</p>
