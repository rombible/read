<A NAME="161"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=537><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;deaconess.&#8221; It is debated whether <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#940;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">diakonos</font>) here refers to a specific office within the church. One contextual argument used to support this view is that Phoebe is associated with a particular church, Cenchrea, and as such would therefore be a deacon of that church. In the NT some who are called <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#940;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> are related to a particular church, yet the scholarly consensus is that such individuals are not deacons, but &#8220;servants&#8221; or &#8220;ministers&#8221; (other viable translations for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#940;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font>). For example, Epaphras is associated with the church in Colossians and is called a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#940;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> in Col 1:7, but no contemporary translation regards him as a deacon. In 1 Tim 4:6 Paul calls Timothy a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#940;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font>; Timothy was associated with the church in Ephesus, but he obviously was not a deacon. In addition, the lexical evidence leans away from this view: Within the NT, the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#957;</font>- word group rarely functions with a technical nuance. In any case, the evidence is not compelling either way. The view accepted in the translation above is that Phoebe was a servant of the church, not a deaconess, although this conclusion should be regarded as tentative.</p>
