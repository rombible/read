<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2><b>tn</b> Traditionally, &#8220;servant.&#8221; Though <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">doulos</font>) is normally translated &#8220;servant,&#8221; the word does not bear the connotation of a free individual serving another. BDAG notes that &#8220;&#8216;servant&#8217; for &#8216;slave&#8217; is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times&#8230;in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished&#8221; (BDAG 260 s.v.). The most accurate translation is &#8220;bondservant&#8221; (sometimes found in the ASV for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font>), in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another. But as this is archaic, few today understand its force.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Undoubtedly the background for the concept of being the Lord&#8217;s &#8220;slave&#8221; or &#8220;servant&#8221; is to be found in the Old Testament scriptures. For someone who was Jewish this concept did not connote drudgery, but honor and privilege. It was used of national Israel at times (Isa 43:10), but was especially associated with famous OT personalities, including such great men as Moses (Josh 14:7), David (Ps 89:3; cf. 2 Sam 7:5, 8) and Elijah (2 Kgs 10:10); all these men were &#8220;servants (or slaves) of the Lord.&#8221;</p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3><b>tc</b> Many important <span class="smallcaps">mss</span>, as well as several others (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>26</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A G <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 33 1739 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>), have a reversed order of these words and read &#8220;Jesus Christ&#8221; rather than &#8220;Christ Jesus&#8221; (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>10</sup> B 81 <i>pc</i>). The meaning is not affected in either case, but the reading &#8220;Christ Jesus&#8221; is preferred as slightly more difficult and thus more likely the original (a scribe who found it would be prone to change it to the more common expression). At the same time, Paul is fond of the order &#8220;Christ Jesus,&#8221; especially in certain letters such as Romans, Galatians, and Philippians. As well, the later Pauline letters almost uniformly use this order in the salutations. A decision is difficult, but &#8220;Christ Jesus&#8221; is slightly preferred.</p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;a called apostle.&#8221;</p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>tn</b> The genitive in the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8016;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#941;&#955;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">euangelion qeou</font>, &#8220;the gospel of God&#8221;) could be translated as (1) a subjective genitive (&#8220;the gospel which God brings&#8221;) or (2) an objective genitive (&#8220;the gospel about God&#8221;). Either is grammatically possible. This is possibly an instance of a plenary genitive (see <i>ExSyn</i> 119-21; M. Zerwick, <i>Biblical Greek</i>, §§36-39). If so, an interplay between the two concepts is intended: The gospel which God brings is in fact the gospel about himself. However, in view of God&#8217;s action in v. 2 concerning this gospel, a subjective genitive notion (&#8220;the gospel which God brings&#8221;) is slightly preferred.</p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=6><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the gospel of God, which he promised.&#8221; Because of the length and complexity of this sentence in Greek, it was divided into shorter English sentences in keeping with contemporary English style. To indicate the referent of the relative pronoun (&#8220;which&#8221;), the word &#8220;gospel&#8221; was repeated at the beginning of v. 2.</p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=7><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;born of the seed&#8221; (an idiom).</p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=8><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;according to the flesh,&#8221; indicating Jesus&#8217; earthly life, a reference to its weakness. This phrase implies that Jesus was more than human; otherwise it would have been sufficient to say that he was a descendant of David, cf. L. Morris, <i>Romans</i>, 44.</p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=9><b>sn</b> <i>Appointed the Son-of-God-in-power. </i>Most translations render the Greek participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jorisqentos</font>, from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001;&#961;&#943;&#950;&#969;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jorizw</font>) &#8220;declared&#8221; or &#8220;designated&#8221; in order to avoid the possible interpretation that Jesus was appointed the Son of God by the resurrection. However, the Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001;&#961;&#943;&#950;&#969;</font> is used eight times in the NT, and it always has the meaning &#8220;to determine, appoint.&#8221; Paul is not saying that Jesus was appointed the &#8220;Son of God by the resurrection&#8221; but &#8220;Son-of-God-in-power by the resurrection,&#8221; as indicated by the hyphenation. He was born in weakness in human flesh (<i>with respect to the flesh</i>, v. 3) and he was raised with power. This is similar to Matt 28:18 where Jesus told his disciples after the resurrection, &#8220;All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.&#8221;</p>
<a name="110"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=10><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;spirit of holiness.&#8221; Some interpreters take the phrase to refer to Christ&#8217;s own inner spirit, which was characterized by holiness.</p>
<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;by his resurrection.&#8221; Most interpreters see this as a reference to Jesus&#8217; own resurrection, although some take it to refer to the general resurrection at the end of the age, of which Jesus&#8217; resurrection is the first installment (cf. 1 Cor 15:23).</p>
<a name="112"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=12><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;through whom.&#8221;</p>
<a name="113"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=13><b>tn</b> Some interpreters understand the phrase &#8220;grace and apostleship&#8221; as a hendiadys, translating &#8220;grace [i.e., gift] of apostleship.&#8221; The pronoun &#8220;our&#8221; is supplied in the translation to clarify the sense of the statement.</p>
<a name="114"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=14><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;and apostleship for obedience.&#8221;</p>
<a name="115"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=15><b>tn</b> The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#960;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#8052;&#957; &#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#969;&#962;</font> has been variously understood as (1) an objective genitive (a reference to the Christian faith, &#8220;obedience to [the] faith&#8221;); (2) a subjective genitive (&#8220;the obedience faith produces [or requires]&#8221;); (3) an attributive genitive (&#8220;believing obedience&#8221;); or (4) as a genitive of apposition (&#8220;obedience, [namely] faith&#8221;) in which &#8220;faith&#8221; further defines &#8220;obedience.&#8221; These options are discussed by C. E. B. Cranfield, <i>Romans</i> (ICC), 1:66. Others take the phrase as deliberately ambiguous; see D. B. Garlington, &#8220;The Obedience of Faith in the Letter to the Romans: Part I: The Meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#960;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#8052; &#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#969;&#962;</font> (Rom 1:5; 16:26),&#8221; <i>WTJ</i> 52 (1990): 201-24.</p>
<a name="116"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=16><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;among whom you also are called.&#8221; Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started here in the translation. The NIV, with its translation &#8220;And you also are among those who are called,&#8221; takes the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#959;&#7987;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#949;</font> to refer to the following clause rather than the preceding, so that the addressees of the letter (&#8220;you also&#8221;) are not connected with &#8220;all the Gentiles&#8221; mentioned at the end of v. 5. It is more likely, however, that the relative pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#7987;&#962;</font> has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#7956;&#952;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#957;</font> as its antecedent, which would indicate that the church at Rome was predominantly Gentile.</p>

<a name="119"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=19><b>tn</b> Although the first part of v. 7 is not a complete English sentence, it maintains the &#8220;From&#8230;to&#8221; pattern used in all the Pauline letters to indicate the sender and the recipients. Here, however, there are several intervening verses (vv. 2-6), which makes the first half of v. 7 appear as an isolated sentence fragment.</p>

<a name="126"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=26><b>sn</b> Paul does not mean here that he is going to bestow upon the Roman believers what is commonly known as a &#8220;spiritual gift,&#8221; that is, a special enabling for service given to believers by the Holy Spirit. Instead, this is either a metonymy of cause for effect (Paul will use his own spiritual gifts to edify the Romans), or it simply means something akin to a blessing or benefit in the spiritual realm. It is possible that Paul uses this phrase to connote specifically the broader purpose of his letter, which is for the Romans to understand his gospel, but this seems less likely.</p>

<a name="135"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=35><b>tn</b> The nature of the &#8220;righteousness&#8221; described here and the force of the genitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> (&#8220;of God&#8221;) which follows have been much debated. (1) Some (e.g. C. E. B. Cranfield, <i>Romans </i>[ICC], 1:98) understand &#8220;righteousness&#8221; to refer to the righteous status given to believers as a result of God&#8217;s justifying activity, and see the genitive &#8220;of God&#8221; as a genitive of source (= &#8220;from God&#8221;). (2) Others see the &#8220;righteousness&#8221; as God&#8217;s act or declaration that makes righteous (i.e., justifies) those who turn to him in faith, taking the genitive &#8220;of God&#8221; as a subjective genitive (see E. Käsemann, <i>Romans</i>, 25-30). (3) Still others see the &#8220;righteousness of God&#8221; mentioned here as the attribute of God himself, understanding the genitive &#8220;of God&#8221; as a possessive genitive (&#8220;God&#8217;s righteousness&#8221;).</p>
<a name="136"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=36><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;in it&#8221;; the referent (the gospel) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>

It may have the idea that this righteousness is obtained by faith (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954; &#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#969;&#962;</font>) because it was designed for faith (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</font>). For a summary see J. Murray, <i>Romans</i> (NICNT), 1:363-74.</p>

C. E. B. Cranfield takes the section 1:18-32 to refer to <i>all</i> people (not just Gentiles), while 2:1-3:20 points out that the Jew is no exception (<i>Romans</i> [ICC], 1:104-6; 1:137-38).</p>
