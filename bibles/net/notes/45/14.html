<A NAME="141"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=492><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;over opinions.&#8221; The qualifier &#8220;differing&#8221; has been supplied to clarify the meaning.</p>
<A NAME="142"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=493><b>tc</b> Most <sc>mss, especially Western and Byzantine (D F G 048 33 1739 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> latt), read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">qeos</font>, &#8220;God&#8221;) in place of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kurios</font>, &#8220;Lord&#8221;) here. However, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962;</font> is found in many of the most important <sc>mss (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A B C P <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> <i>pc </i>co), and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font> looks to be an assimilation to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font> in v. 3.</p>
<A NAME="143"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=494><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;For one judges day from day, and one judges all days.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=495><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has not been translated because of differences between Greek and English style.</p>
<A NAME="145"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=496><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;But why do you judge your brother?&#8221; The introductory phrase has been supplied in the translation to clarify whom Paul is addressing, i.e., the &#8220;weak&#8221; Christian who eats only vegetables (see vv. 2-3). The author uses the singular pronoun here to rhetorically address one person, but the plural has been used in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="146"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=497><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Or again, why do you despise your brother?&#8221; The introductory phrase has been supplied in the translation to clarify whom Paul is addressing, i.e., the &#8220;strong&#8221; Christian who eats everything (see vv. 2-3). The author uses the singular pronoun here to rhetorically address one person, but the plural has been used in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="147"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=498><b>sn</b> The<i> judgment seat</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#946;&#8134;&#956;&#945;</font>, <font face="Greektl">bhma</font>) was a raised platform mounted by steps and sometimes furnished with a seat, used by officials in addressing an assembly or making pronouncements, often on judicial matters. The judgment seat was a familiar item in Greco-Roman culture, often located in the <i>agora</i>, the public square or marketplace in the center of a city.</p>
<A NAME="148"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=499><b>sn</b> A quotation from Isa 45:23.</p>
<A NAME="149"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=500><b>tc</b> &#8225; The words &#8220;to God&#8221; are absent from some <sc>mss (B F G 6 630 1739 1881 <i>pc</i>) but are found in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A C D <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 0209 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat sy co. External evidence somewhat favors their inclusion since Alexandrian, Western, and Byzantine <sc>mss are well represented. From an internal standpoint, however, it is easy to see the words as a scribal gloss intended to clarify the referent, especially as a reinforcement to the quotation of Isa 45:23 in v. 11. Not only that, but the abrupt ending of the verse without &#8220;to God&#8221; is harsh, both in Greek and in English. In this instance, the internal considerations seem overwhelming on the side of the omission. At the same time, English stylistic needs require the words and they have been put into the translation, even though they are most likely not original. NA<sup>27 </sup>places the words in brackets, indicating doubt as to their authenticity.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;each of us is accountable to God.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=501><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;brother.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=502><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;brother.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=503><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;on account of food.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=504><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;according to love.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=505><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;do not let your good.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=506><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;by men&#8221;; but <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anqrwpo&quot;</font>) is generic here (&#8220;people&#8221;) since the contrast in context is between God and humanity.</p>
<A NAME="1416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=507><b>sn</b> Here <i>clean</i> refers to food being ceremonially clean.</p>
<A NAME="1417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=508><b>tc</b> A large number of <sc>mss, some of them quite important (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46vid</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> B D F G <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 0209 33 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat sa), read &#8220;or to be offended or to be made weak&#8221; after &#8220;to stumble.&#8221; The shorter reading &#8220;to stumble&#8221; is found only in Alexandrian <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* A C 048 81 945 1506 1739 <i>pc</i> bo). Although external evidence favors inclusion, internal evidence points to a scribal expansion, perhaps reminiscent of 1 Cor 8:11-13. The shorter reading is therefore preferred.</p>
<A NAME="1418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=509><b>tc</b> &#8225; Several important Alexandrian witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A B C 048) have the relative pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7973;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">{hn</font>, &#8220;the faith <i>that</i> you have&#8221;) at this juncture, but D F G <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 1739 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat<i> </i>co lack it. Without the pronoun, the clause is more ambiguous (either &#8220;Keep the faith [that] you have between yourself and God&#8221; or &#8220;Do you have faith? Keep it between yourself and God&#8221;). The pronoun thus looks to be a motivated reading, created to clarify the meaning of the text. Even though it is found in the better witnesses, in this instance internal evidence should be given preference. NA<sup>27</sup> places the word in brackets, indicating some doubt as to its authenticity.</p>
<A NAME="1419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=510><b>tc</b> Some <sc>mss insert 16:25-27 at this point. See the <b>tc</b> note at 16:25 for more information.</p>
