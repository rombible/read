Thus, in spiritual terms, a person who has <i>died to what controlled us</i> (v. 6) has been released from the law to serve God in the new life produced by the Spirit.</p>

<A NAME="712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=286><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;having died.&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#952;&#945;&#957;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">apoqanonte&quot;</font>) has been translated as a causal adverbial participle.</p>
<A NAME="713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=287><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;in the newness of the Spirit and not in the oldness of the letter.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=288><b>sn</b> <i>Romans 7:7-25.</i> There has been an enormous debate over the significance of the first person singular pronouns (&#8220;I&#8221;) in this passage and how to understand their referent. Did Paul intend (1) a reference to himself and other Christians too; (2) a reference to his own pre-Christian experience as a Jew, struggling with the law and sin (and thus addressing his fellow countrymen as Jews); or (3) a reference to himself as a child of Adam, reflecting the experience of Adam that is shared by both Jews and Gentiles alike (i.e., all people everywhere)? Good arguments can be assembled for each of these views, and each has problems dealing with specific statements in the passage. The classic argument against an autobiographical interpretation was made by W. G. Kümmel, <i>Römer 7 und die Bekehrung des Paulus</i>. A good case for seeing at least an autobiographical element in the chapter has been made by G. Theissen, <i>Psychologische Aspekte paulinischer Theologie</i> [FRLANT], 181-268. One major point that seems to favor some sort of an autobiographical reading of these verses is the lack of any mention of the Holy Spirit for empowerment in the struggle described in Rom 7:7-25. The Spirit is mentioned beginning in 8:1 as the solution to the problem of the struggle with sin (8:4-6, 9).</p>
<A NAME="715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=289><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;I would not have known covetousness.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=290><b>sn</b> A quotation from Exod 20:17 and Deut 5:21.</p>
<A NAME="717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=291><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;covetousness.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=292><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;So&#8221; to indicate the result of the statement in the previous verse. Greek style often begins sentences or clauses with &#8220;and,&#8221; but English style generally does not.</p>
<A NAME="719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=293><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;and there was found in/for me the commandment which was for life &#8211; this was for death.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=294><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;and through it killed me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="721"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=295><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;under sin.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="722"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=296><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;but what I hate, this I do.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=297><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;I agree with the law that it is good.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=298><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;For to wish is present in/with me, but not to do it.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=299><b>tc</b> &#8225; Most <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* A 1739 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> sy) read &#8220;I give thanks to God&#8221; rather than &#8220;Now thanks be to God&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>1</sup> [B] <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 33 81 104 365 1506 <i>pc</i>), the reading of NA<sup>27</sup>. The reading with the verb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8016;&#967;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8182; &#964;&#8183; &#952;&#949;&#8183;</font>, <font face="Greektl">eucaristw tw qew</font>) possibly arose from a transcriptional error in which several letters were doubled (<i>TCGNT</i> 455). The conjunction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>, &#8220;now&#8221;) is included in some <sc>mss as well (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>1</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936; </font>33 81 104 365 1506 <i>pc</i>), but it should probably not be considered original. The ms support for the omission of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> is both excellent and widespread (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* A B D 1739 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat sy), and its addition can be explained as an insertion to smooth out the transition between v. 24 and 25.</p>
<A NAME="726"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=300><b>tn</b> There is a double connective here that cannot be easily preserved in English: &#8220;consequently therefore,&#8221; emphasizing the conclusion of what he has been arguing.</p>
<A NAME="727"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=301><b>tn</b> Greek emphasizes the contrast between these two clauses more than can be easily expressed in English.</p>
<A NAME="728"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=302><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;I serve&#8221; have been repeated here for clarity. </p>
