<A NAME="51"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=214><b>sn</b> Many interpreters see Rom 5:1 as beginning the second major division of the letter.</p>
<A NAME="52"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=215><b>tc</b> A number of important witnesses have the subjunctive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#967;&#969;&#956;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ecwmen</font>, &#8220;let us have&#8221;) instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#967;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ecomen</font>, &#8220;we have&#8221;) in v. 1. Included in the subjunctive&#8217;s support are <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* A B* C D K L 33 81 630 1175 1739* <i>pm </i>lat bo. But the indicative is not without its supporters: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>1 </sup>B<sup>2</sup> F G P <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 0220<sup>vid<i> </i></sup>104 365 1241 1505 1506 1739<sup>c </sup>1881 2464 <i>pm</i>. If the problem were to be solved on an external basis only, the subjunctive would be preferred. Because of this, the &#8220;A&#8221; rating on behalf of the indicative in the UBS<sup>4</sup> appears overly confident. Nevertheless, the indicative is probably correct. First, the earliest witness to Rom 5:1 has the indicative (0220<sup>vid</sup>, third century). Second, the first set of correctors is sometimes, if not often, of equal importance with the original hand. Hence, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>1 </sup>might be given equal value with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>*. Third, there is a good cross-section of witnesses for the indicative: Alexandrian (in 0220<sup>vid</sup>, probably <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>1 </sup>1241 1506 1881 <i>al</i>), Western (in F G), and Byzantine (noted in NA<sup>27</sup> as <i>pm</i>). Thus, although the external evidence is strongly in favor of the subjunctive, the indicative is represented well enough that its ancestry could easily go back to the original. Turning to the internal evidence, the indicative gains much ground. (1) The variant may have been produced via an error of hearing (since <i>omicron</i> and <i>omega</i> were pronounced alike in ancient Greek). This, of course, does not indicate which reading was original &#8211; just that an error of hearing may have produced one of them. In light of the indecisiveness of the transcriptional evidence, intrinsic evidence could play a much larger role. This is indeed the case here. (2) The indicative fits well with the overall argument of the book to this point. Up until now, Paul has been establishing the &#8220;indicatives of the faith.&#8221; There is only one imperative (used rhetorically) and only one hortatory subjunctive (and this in a quotation within a diatribe) up till this point, while from ch. 6 on there are sixty-one imperatives and seven hortatory subjunctives. Clearly, an exhortation would be out of place in ch. 5. (3) Paul presupposes that the audience has peace with God (via reconciliation) in 5:10. This seems to assume the indicative in v. 1. (4) As C. E. B. Cranfield notes, &#8220;it would surely be strange for Paul, in such a carefully argued writing as this, to exhort his readers to enjoy or to guard a peace which he has not yet explicitly shown to be possessed by them&#8221; (<i>Romans</i> [ICC], 1:257). (5) The notion that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#961;&#8053;&#957;&#951;&#957; &#7956;&#967;&#969;&#956;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">eirhnhn ecwmen</font>) can even naturally mean &#8220;enjoy peace&#8221; is problematic (<i>ExSyn</i> 464), yet those who embrace the subjunctive have to give the verb some such force. Thus, although the external evidence is stronger in support of the subjunctive, the internal evidence points to the indicative. Although a decision is difficult, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#967;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;</font> appears to be the authentic reading.</p>

<A NAME="54"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=217><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has not been translated because of differences between Greek and English style.</p>
<A NAME="55"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=218><b>tn</b> The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969; &#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jh agaph tou qeou</font>, &#8220;the love of God&#8221;) could be interpreted as either an objective genitive (&#8220;our love for God&#8221;), subjective genitive (&#8220;God&#8217;s love for us&#8221;), or both (M. Zerwick&#8217;s &#8220;general&#8221; genitive [<i>Biblical Greek</i>,<i> </i>§§36-39]; D. B. Wallace&#8217;s &#8220;plenary&#8221; genitive [<i>ExSyn</i> 119-21]). The immediate context, which discusses what God has done for believers, favors a subjective genitive, but the fact that this love is poured out within the hearts of believers implies that it may be the source for believers&#8217; love for God; consequently an objective genitive cannot be ruled out. It is possible that both these ideas are meant in the text and that this is a plenary genitive: &#8220;The love that comes from God and that produces our love for God has been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us&#8221; (<i>ExSyn</i> 121).</p>
<A NAME="56"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=219><b>sn</b> On the OT background of the Spirit being <i>poured out</i>, see Isa 32:15; Joel 2:28-29.</p>
<A NAME="57"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=220><b>sn</b> Verse 7 forms something of a parenthetical comment in Paul&#8217;s argument.</p>
<A NAME="58"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=221><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;having now been declared righteous.&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#969;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">dikaiwqente&quot;</font>) has been translated as a causal adverbial participle.</p>
<A NAME="59"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=222><b>tn</b> Or, according to BDF §219.3, &#8220;at the price of his blood.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=227><b>tn</b> The translation of the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#966;&#8127; &#8103;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ef Jw</font>) has been heavily debated. For a discussion of all the possibilities, see C. E. B. Cranfield, &#8220;On Some of the Problems in the Interpretation of Romans 5.12,&#8221; <i>SJT</i> 22 (1969): 324-41. Only a few of the major options can be mentioned here: (1) the phrase can be taken as a relative clause in which the pronoun refers to Adam, &#8220;death spread to all people <i>in whom</i> [Adam] all sinned.&#8221; (2) The phrase can be taken with consecutive (resultative) force, meaning &#8220;death spread to all people <i>with the result that</i> all sinned.&#8221; (3) Others take the phrase as causal in force: &#8220;death spread to all people <i>because </i>all sinned.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=239><b>tn</b> There is a double connective here that cannot be easily preserved in English: &#8220;consequently therefore,&#8221; emphasizing the conclusion of what he has been arguing.</p>
<A NAME="527"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=240><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;[it is] unto condemnation for all people.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="529"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=242><b>tn</b> There are no verbs in the Greek text of v. 18, forcing translators to supply phrases like &#8220;<i>came through</i> one transgression,&#8221; &#8220;<i>resulted from</i> one transgression,&#8221; etc.</p>
<A NAME="530"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=243><b>sn</b> <i>One transgression</i> refers to the sin of Adam in Gen 3:1-24.</p>
