<A NAME="161"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=537><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;deaconess.&#8221; It is debated whether <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#940;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">diakonos</font>) here refers to a specific office within the church. One contextual argument used to support this view is that Phoebe is associated with a particular church, Cenchrea, and as such would therefore be a deacon of that church. In the NT some who are called <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#940;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> are related to a particular church, yet the scholarly consensus is that such individuals are not deacons, but &#8220;servants&#8221; or &#8220;ministers&#8221; (other viable translations for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#940;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font>). For example, Epaphras is associated with the church in Colossians and is called a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#940;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> in Col 1:7, but no contemporary translation regards him as a deacon. In 1 Tim 4:6 Paul calls Timothy a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#940;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font>; Timothy was associated with the church in Ephesus, but he obviously was not a deacon. In addition, the lexical evidence leans away from this view: Within the NT, the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#957;</font>- word group rarely functions with a technical nuance. In any case, the evidence is not compelling either way. The view accepted in the translation above is that Phoebe was a servant of the church, not a deaconess, although this conclusion should be regarded as tentative.</p>
<A NAME="162"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=538><b>sn</b> On <i>Prisca and Aquila</i> see also Acts 18:2, 18, 26; 1 Cor 16:19; 2 Tim 4:19. In the NT &#8220;Priscilla&#8221; and &#8220;Prisca&#8221; are the same person. The author of Acts uses the full name Priscilla, while Paul uses the diminutive form <i>Prisca</i>.</p>
<A NAME="163"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=539><b>sn</b> The spelling <i>Epenetus</i> is also used by NIV, NLT; the name is alternately spelled <i>Epaenetus</i> (NASB, NKJV, NRSV).</p>

<A NAME="165"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=541><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;Asia&#8221;; in the NT this always refers to the Roman province of Asia, made up of about one-third of the west and southwest end of modern Asia Minor. Asia lay to the west of the region of Phrygia and Galatia. The words &#8220;the province of&#8221; are supplied to indicate to the modern reader that this does not refer to the continent of Asia.</p>
<A NAME="166"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=542><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Junias.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The feminine name <i>Junia</i>, though common in Latin, is quite rare in Greek (apparently only three instances of it occur in Greek literature outside Rom 16:7, according to the data in the <i>TLG </i>[D. Moo, <i>Romans </i>[NICNT], 922]). The masculine <i>Junias </i>(as a contraction for <i>Junianas</i>), however, is rarer still: Only one instance of the masculine name is known in extant Greek literature (Epiphanius mentions Junias in his <i>Index discipulorum </i>125). Further, since there are apparently other husband-wife teams mentioned in this salutation (Prisca and Aquila [v. 3], Philologus and Julia [v. 15]), it might be natural to think of Junia as a feminine name. (This ought not be pressed too far, however, for in v. 12 <i>all </i>three individuals are women [though the first two are linked together], and in vv. 9-11 all the individuals are men.) In Greek only a difference of accent distinguishes between Junias (male) and Junia (female). If it refers to a woman, it is possible (1) that she had the gift of apostleship (not the office), or (2) that she was not an apostle but along with Andronicus was esteemed by (or among) the apostles. As well, the term &#8220;prominent&#8221; probably means &#8220;well known,&#8221; suggesting that Andronicus and Junia(s) were well known to the apostles (see note on the phrase &#8220;well known&#8221; which follows).</p>
<A NAME="167"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=543><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;kinsmen,&#8221; &#8220;relatives,&#8221; &#8220;fellow countrymen.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="168"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=544><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;prominent, outstanding, famous.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#943;&#963;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">epishmo&quot;</font>) is used either in an implied comparative sense (&#8220;prominent, outstanding&#8221;) or in an elative sense (&#8220;famous, well known&#8221;). The key to determining the meaning of the term in any given passage is both the general context and the specific collocation of this word with its adjuncts. When a comparative notion is seen, that to which <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#943;&#963;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#962;</font> is compared is frequently, if not usually, put in the genitive case (cf., e.g., 3 Macc 6:1 [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#917;&#955;&#949;&#945;&#950;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#962; &#948;&#941; &#964;&#953;&#962; &#7936;&#957;&#8052;&#961; <i>&#7952;&#960;&#943;&#963;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#8182;&#957; </i>&#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#8053;&#962; &#967;&#8061;&#961;&#945;&#962; <i>&#7985;&#949;&#961;&#941;&#969;&#957;</i></font> &#8220;Eleazar, a man <i>prominent among</i> <i>the priests</i> of the country&#8221;]; cf. also <i>Pss. Sol.</i> 17:30). When, however, an elative notion is found, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en</font>) plus a personal plural dative is not uncommon (cf. <i>Pss. Sol.</i> 2:6). Although <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;</font> plus a personal dative does not indicate agency, in collocation with words of perception, (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;</font> plus) dative personal nouns are often used to show the recipients. In this instance, the idea would then be &#8220;well known <i>to</i> the apostles.&#8221; See M. H. Burer and D. B. Wallace, &#8220;Was Junia Really an Apostle? A Re-examination of Rom 16.7,&#8221; <i>NTS </i>47 (2001): 76-91, who argue for the elative notion here.</p>

Amen.&#8221; Other <sc>mss (P 33 104 365 <i>pc</i>) include the verse after <b>16:27</b>. The verse is entirely lacking in <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46,61</sup> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A) B C 81 1739 2464 <i>pc</i> co. The strength of the external evidence, combined with uncertainty in other <sc>mss over where the verse should be located and the fact that it is a repetition of v. 20b, strongly favors omission of the verse. The present translation follows NA<sup>27</sup> in omitting the verse number, a procedure also followed by a number of other modern translations.</p>
<A NAME="1620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=556><b>tc</b> There is a considerable degree of difference among the <sc>mss regarding the presence and position of the doxology of 16:25-27. Five situations present themselves from the ms tradition. The doxology is found in the ancient witnesses in three separate locations: (1) here after 16:23 (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>61</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B C D 81 365 630 1739 2464 <i>al</i> co), (2) after 14:23 (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">0</font>209<sup>vid</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>), or (3) after 15:33 (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup>). The situation is further complicated in that some of the <sc>mss have these verses in two places: (4) after 14:23 <i>and </i>after 16:23 (A P 33 104 2805 <i>pc</i>); or (5) after 14:23 <i>and </i>after 15:33 (1506). The uncertain position of the doxology might suggest that it was added by later scribes. But since the <sc>mss containing the doxology are so early and widespread, it almost certainly belongs in Romans; it is only a question of where. Further, the witnesses that omit the doxology are few: F G 629 Hier<sup>mss</sup>. (And of these, G has a blank space of several lines large enough for the doxology to belong there.) Only two positions (after chapter 14 only and at the end of the letter only) deserve particular notice because the situation of the <sc>mss showing the doxology in two places dates back to the 5th century. Later copyists, faced with the doxology in two different places in the <sc>mss they knew, may have decided to copy the doxology in both places, since they were unwilling to consciously omit any text. Because the textual disruption of the doxology is so early, <i>TCGNT</i> 472 suggests two possibilities: either (1) that Paul may have sent two different copies of Romans &#8211; a copy lacking chapter 16 and a copy with the full text of the epistle as we now have it, or (2) Marcion or some of his followers circulated a shortened form of the epistle that lacked chapters 15 and 16. Those <sc>mss that lacked chapters 15-16 would naturally conclude with some kind of doxology after chapter 14. On the other hand, H. Gamble (<i>The Textual History of the Letter to the Romans</i> [SD], 123-32) argues for the position of the doxology at 14:23, since to put the doxology at 16:25 would violate Paul&#8217;s normal pattern of a grace-benediction at the close of the letter. Gamble further argues for the inclusion of 16:24, since the <sc>mss that put the doxology after chapter 14 almost always present 16:24 as the letter&#8217;s closing, whereas most of the <sc>mss that put the doxology at its traditional position drop 16:24, perhaps because it would be redundant before 16:25-27. A decision is difficult, but the weight of external evidence, since it is both early and geographically widespread, suggests that the doxology belongs here after 16:23. For a full discussion, see <i>TCGNT</i> 470-73.</p>
