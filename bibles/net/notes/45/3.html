D. G. Dunn, <i>Romans</i> [WBC], 1:155). Other interpreters, like C. E. B. Cranfield (&#8220;&#8216;The Works of the Law&#8217; in the Epistle to the Romans,&#8221; <i>JSNT</i> 43 [1991]: 89-101) reject this narrow interpretation for a number of reasons, among which the most important are: (1) The second half of v. 20, &#8220;for through the law comes the knowledge of sin,&#8221; is hard to explain if the phrase &#8220;works of the law&#8221; is understood in a restricted sense; (2) the plural phrase &#8220;works of the law&#8221; would have to be understood in a different sense from the singular phrase &#8220;the work of the law&#8221; in 2:15; (3) similar phrases involving the law in Romans (2:13, 14; 2:25, 26, 27; 7:25; 8:4; and 13:8) which are naturally related to the phrase &#8220;works of the law&#8221; cannot be taken to refer to circumcision (in fact, in 2:25 circumcision is explicitly contrasted with keeping the law). Those interpreters who reject the &#8220;narrow&#8221; interpretation of &#8220;works of the law&#8221; understand the phrase to refer to obedience to the Mosaic law in general.</p>
<A NAME="325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=144><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;is.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=146><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;being witnessed by the law and the prophets,&#8221; a remark which is virtually parenthetical to Paul&#8217;s argument.</p>
<A NAME="328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=147><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;faith in Christ.&#8221; A decision is difficult here. Though traditionally translated &#8220;faith in Jesus Christ,&#8221; an increasing number of NT scholars are arguing that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#962; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pisti&quot; Cristou</font>) and similar phrases in Paul (here and in v. 26; Gal 2:16, 20; 3:22; Eph 3:12; Phil 3:9) involve a <i>subjective</i> genitive and mean &#8220;Christ&#8217;s faith&#8221; or &#8220;Christ&#8217;s faithfulness&#8221; (cf., e.g., G. Howard, &#8220;The &#8216;Faith of Christ&#8217;,&#8221; <i>ExpTim</i> 85 [1974]: 212-15; R. B. Hays, <i>The Faith of Jesus Christ</i> [SBLDS]; Morna D. Hooker, &#8220;<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#928;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#962; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font>,&#8221; <i>NTS</i> 35 [1989]: 321-42). Noteworthy among the arguments for the subjective genitive view is that when <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#962;</font> takes a personal genitive it is almost never an objective genitive (cf. Matt 9:2, 22, 29; Mark 2:5; 5:34; 10:52; Luke 5:20; 7:50; 8:25, 48; 17:19; 18:42; 22:32; Rom 1:8; 12; 3:3; 4:5, 12, 16; 1 Cor 2:5; 15:14, 17; 2 Cor 10:15; Phil 2:17; Col 1:4; 2:5; 1 Thess 1:8; 3:2, 5, 10; 2 Thess 1:3; Titus 1:1; Phlm 6; 1 Pet 1:9, 21; 2 Pet 1:5). On the other hand, the <i>objective</i> genitive view has its adherents: A. Hultgren, &#8220;The <i>Pistis Christou</i> Formulations in Paul,&#8221; <i>NovT</i> 22 (1980): 248-63; J. D. G. Dunn, &#8220;Once More, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#928;&#921;&#931;&#932;&#921;&#931; &#935;&#929;&#921;&#931;&#932;&#927;&#933;</font>,&#8221; <i>SBL Seminar Papers</i>, <i>1991,</i> 730-44. Most commentaries on Romans and Galatians usually side with the objective view.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>ExSyn</i> 116, which notes that the grammar is not decisive, nevertheless suggests that &#8220;the faith/faithfulness of Christ is not a denial of faith <i>in </i>Christ as a Pauline concept (for the idea is expressed in many of the same contexts, only with the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#969;</font> rather than the noun), but implies that the object of faith is a worthy object, for he himself is faithful.&#8221; Though Paul elsewhere teaches justification by faith, this presupposes that the object of our faith is reliable and worthy of such faith.</p>
<A NAME="329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=148><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;declared righteous.&#8221; <i>Grk</i> &#8220;being justified,&#8221; as a continuation of the preceding clause.

<A NAME="330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=149><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;purposed, intended.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=150><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;whom God publicly displayed.&#8221; Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started here in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=151><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;in his blood.&#8221; The prepositional phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#945;&#7989;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ejn tw aujtou {aimati</font>) is difficult to interpret. It is traditionally understood to refer to the atoning sacrifice Jesus made when he shed his blood on the cross, and as a modifier of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7985;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#8053;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jilasthrion</font>). This interpretation fits if <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7985;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#8053;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> is taken to refer to a sacrifice. But if <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7985;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#8053;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> is taken to refer to the place where atonement is made as this translation has done (see note on the phrase &#8220;mercy seat&#8221;), this interpretation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#945;&#7989;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font> creates a violent mixed metaphor. Within a few words Paul would switch from referring to Jesus as the place where atonement was made to referring to Jesus as the atoning sacrifice itself. A viable option which resolves this problem is to see <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#945;&#7989;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font> as modifying the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#941;&#952;&#949;&#964;&#959;</font> (<font face="Greektl">proeqeto</font>). If it modifies the verb, it would explain the time or place in which God publicly displayed Jesus as the mercy seat; the reference to blood would be a metaphorical way of speaking of Jesus&#8217; death. This is supported by the placement of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#945;&#7989;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font> in the Greek text (it follows the noun, separated from it by another prepositional phrase) and by stylistic parallels with Rom 1:4. This is the interpretation the translation has followed, although it is recognized that many interpreters favor different options and translations. The prepositional phrase has been moved forward in the sentence to emphasize its connection with the verb, and the referent of the metaphorical language has been specified in the translation. For a detailed discussion of this interpretation, see D. P. Bailey, &#8220;Jesus As the Mercy Seat: The Semantics and Theology of Paul&#8217;s Use of <i>Hilasterion</i> in Romans 3:25&#8221; (Ph.D. diss., University of Cambridge, 1999).</p>
<A NAME="333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=152><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7985;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#8053;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jilasthrion</font>) may carry the general sense &#8220;place of satisfaction,&#8221; referring to the place where God&#8217;s wrath toward sin is satisfied. More likely, though, it refers specifically to the &#8220;mercy seat,&#8221; i.e., the covering of the ark where the blood was sprinkled in the OT ritual on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur). This term is used only one other time in the NT: Heb 9:5, where it is rendered &#8220;mercy seat.&#8221; There it describes the altar in the most holy place (holy of holies). Thus Paul is saying that God displayed Jesus as the &#8220;mercy seat,&#8221; the place where propitiation was accomplished. See N. S. L. Fryer, &#8220;The Meaning and Translation of <i>Hilasterion</i> in Romans 3:25,&#8221; <i>EvQ </i>59 (1987): 99-116, who concludes the term is a neuter accusative substantive best translated &#8220;mercy seat&#8221; or &#8220;propitiatory covering,&#8221; and D. P. Bailey, &#8220;Jesus As the Mercy Seat: The Semantics and Theology of Paul&#8217;s Use of <i>Hilasterion</i> in Romans 3:25&#8221; (Ph.D. diss., University of Cambridge, 1999), who argues that this is a direct reference to the mercy seat which covered the ark of the covenant.</p>
<A NAME="334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=153><b>tn</b> The prepositional phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#8048; &#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#969;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">dia pistew&quot;</font>) here modifies the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7985;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#8053;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jilasthrion</font>). As such it forms a complete noun phrase and could be written as &#8220;mercy-seat-accessible-through-faith&#8221; to emphasize the singular idea. See Rom 1:4 for a similar construction. The word &#8220;accessible&#8221; is not in the Greek text but has been supplied to clarify the idea expressed by the prepositional phrase (cf. NRSV: &#8220;effective through faith&#8221;). </p>
