<A NAME="951"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=395><b>tc</b> In light of the interpretive difficulty of this verse, a longer reading seems to have been added to clarify the meaning. The addition, in the middle of the sentence, makes the whole verse read as follows: &#8220;For he will execute his sentence completely and quickly in righteousness, because the Lord will do it quickly on the earth.&#8221; The shorter reading is found largely in Alexandrian <sc>mss (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* A B 6 1506 1739 1881 <i>pc</i> co), while the longer reading is found principally in Western and Byzantine <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> D F G <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat). The longer reading follows Isa 10:22-23 (LXX) verbatim, while Paul in the previous verse quoted the LXX loosely. This suggests the addition was made by a copyist trying to make sense out of a difficult passage rather than by the author himself. </p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> There is a wordplay in Greek (in both the LXX and here) on the phrase translated &#8220;completely and quickly&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#8182;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#964;&#941;&#956;&#957;&#969;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">suntelwn kai suntemnwn</font>). These participles are translated as adverbs for smoothness; a more literal (and more cumbersome) rendering would be: &#8220;The Lord will act by closing the account [or completing the sentence], and by cutting short the time.&#8221; The interpretation of this text is notoriously difficult. Cf. BDAG 975 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#964;&#941;&#956;&#957;&#969;</font>.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> A modified quotation from Isa 10:22-23. Since it is not exact, it has been printed as italics only.</p>
