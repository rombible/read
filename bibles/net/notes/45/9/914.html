<A NAME="914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=358><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the Christ, who is over all, God blessed forever,&#8221; or &#8220;the Messiah. God who is over all be blessed forever!&#8221; or &#8220;the Messiah who is over all. God be blessed forever!&#8221; The translational difficulty here is not text-critical in nature, but is a problem of punctuation. Since the genre of these opening verses of Romans 9 is a lament, it is probably best to take this as an affirmation of Christ&#8217;s deity (as the text renders it). Although the other renderings are possible, to see a note of praise to God at the end of this section seems strangely out of place. But for Paul to bring his lament to a crescendo (that is to say, his kinsmen had rejected <i>God </i>come in the flesh), thereby deepening his anguish, is wholly appropriate. This is also supported grammatically and stylistically: The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#8034;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jo wn</font>, &#8220;the one who is&#8221;) is most naturally taken as a phrase which modifies something in the preceding context, and Paul&#8217;s doxologies are always closely tied to the preceding context. For a detailed examination of this verse, see B. M. Metzger, &#8220;The Punctuation of Rom. 9:5,&#8221; <i>Christ and the Spirit in the New Testament</i>, 95-112; and M. J. Harris, <i>Jesus as God</i>, 144-72.</p>
