<A NAME="944"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=388><b>tn</b> Or possibly &#8220;objects of wrath that have fit themselves for destruction.&#8221; The form of the participle could be taken either as a passive or middle (reflexive). <i>ExSyn </i>417-18 argues strongly for the passive sense (which is followed in the translation), stating that &#8220;the middle view has little to commend it.&#8221; First, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#943;&#950;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">katartizw</font>) is nowhere else used in the NT as a direct or reflexive middle (a usage which, in any event, is quite rare in the NT). Second, the lexical force of this verb, coupled with the perfect tense, suggests something of a &#8220;done deal&#8221; (against some commentaries that see these vessels as <i>ready</i> for destruction yet still able to avert disaster). Third, the potter-clay motif seems to have one point: The potter prepares the clay.</p>
