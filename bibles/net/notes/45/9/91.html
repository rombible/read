<A NAME="91"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=345><b>sn</b> <i>Rom 9:1&#8211;11:36.</i> These three chapters are among the most difficult and disputed in Paul&#8217;s Letter to the Romans. One area of difficulty is the relationship between Israel and the church, especially concerning the nature and extent of Israel&#8217;s election. Many different models have been constructed to express this relationship. For a representative survey, see M. Barth, <i>The People of God</i> (JSNTSup), 22-27. The literary genre of these three chapters has been frequently identified as a diatribe, a philosophical discussion or conversation evolved by the Cynic and Stoic schools of philosophy as a means of popularizing their ideas (E. Käsemann, <i>Romans</i>, 261 and 267). But other recent scholars have challenged the idea that Rom 9&#8211;11 is characterized by diatribe. Scholars like R. Scroggs and E. E. Ellis have instead identified the material in question as midrash. For a summary and discussion of the rabbinic connections, see W. R. Stegner, &#8220;Romans 9.6-29 &#8211; A Midrash,&#8221; <i>JSNT</i> 22 (1984): 37-52.</p>
