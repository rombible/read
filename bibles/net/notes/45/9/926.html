<A NAME="926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=370><b>sn</b> Many translations place this verse division before the phrase &#8220;not by works but by his calling&#8221; (NA<sup>27</sup>/UBS<sup>4</sup>, NIV, NRSV, NLT, NAB). Other translations place this verse division in the same place that the translation above does (NASB, KJV, NKJV, ASV, RSV). The translation has followed the latter to avoid breaking the parenthetical statement.</p>
