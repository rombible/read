<A NAME="822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=324><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;on the one hand, heirs of God; on the other hand, fellow heirs with Christ.&#8221; Some prefer to render v. 17 as follows: &#8220;And if children, then heirs &#8211; that is, heirs of God. Also fellow heirs with Christ if indeed we suffer with him so we may also be glorified with him.&#8221; Such a translation suggests two distinct inheritances, one coming to all of God&#8217;s children, the other coming only to those who suffer with Christ. The difficulty of this view, however, is that it ignores the correlative conjunctions <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;</font>&#8230;<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">men</font>&#8230;<font face="Greektl">de</font>, &#8220;on the one hand&#8230;on the other hand&#8221;): The construction strongly suggests that the inheritances cannot be separated since both explain &#8220;then heirs.&#8221; For this reason, the preferred translation puts this explanation in parentheses.</p>
