Although the inclusion is supported by a significant early papyrus, the alliance of significant Alexandrian and Western witnesses favors the shorter reading. As well, the longer reading is evidently motivated by a need for clarification. Since <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font> is textually suspect, it is better to read the text without it. This leaves two good translational options: either &#8220;he works all things together for good&#8221; or &#8220;all things work together for good.&#8221; In the first instance the subject is embedded in the verb and &#8220;God&#8221; is clearly implied (as in v. 29). In the second instance, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">panta</font>) becomes the subject of an intransitive verb. In either case, &#8220;What is expressed is a truly biblical confidence in the sovereignty of God&#8221; (C. E. B. Cranfield, <i>Romans</i> [ICC], 1:427).</p>
