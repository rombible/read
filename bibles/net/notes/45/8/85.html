<A NAME="85"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=307><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;think on&#8221; or &#8220;are intent on&#8221; (twice in this verse). What is in view here is not primarily preoccupation, however, but worldview. Translations like &#8220;set their mind on&#8221; could be misunderstood by the typical English reader to refer exclusively to preoccupation.</p>
