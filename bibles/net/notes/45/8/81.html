<A NAME="81"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=303><b>tc</b> The earliest and best witnesses of the Alexandrian and Western texts, as well as a few others (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* B D* F G 6 1506 1739 1881 <i>pc</i> co), have no additional words for v. 1. Later scribes (A D<sup>1</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 81 365 629 <i>pc </i>vg) added the words <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#8052; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#963;&#940;&#961;&#954;&#945; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#960;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#963;&#953;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">mh kata sarka peripatousin</font>, &#8220;who do not walk according to the flesh&#8221;), while even later ones (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2 </sup>D<sup>2 </sup>33<sup>vid</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>) added <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#960;&#957;&#949;&#8166;&#956;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">alla kata pneuma</font>, &#8220;but [who do walk] according to the Spirit&#8221;). Both the external evidence and the internal evidence are compelling for the shortest reading. The scribes were evidently motivated to add such qualifications (interpolated from v. 4) to insulate Paul&#8217;s gospel from charges that it was characterized too much by grace. The KJV follows the longest reading found in <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>.</p>
