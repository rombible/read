<A NAME="842"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=344><b>tn</b> BDAG 138 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8053;</font> 6 takes this term as a reference to angelic or transcendent powers (as opposed to merely human rulers). To clarify this, the adjective &#8220;heavenly&#8221; has been supplied in the translation. Some interpreters see this as a reference to fallen angels or demonic powers, and this view is reflected in some recent translations (NIV, NLT).</p>
