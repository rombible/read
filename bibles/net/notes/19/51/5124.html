<A NAME="5124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1891><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;cause me to hear happiness and joy.&#8221; The language is metonymic: the effect of forgiveness (joy) has been substituted for its cause. The psalmist probably alludes here to an assuring word from God announcing that his sins are forgiven (a so-called oracle of forgiveness). The imperfect verbal form is used here to express the psalmist&#8217;s wish or request. The synonyms &#8220;happiness&#8221; and &#8220;joy&#8221; are joined together as a hendiadys to emphasize the degree of joy he anticipates.</p>
