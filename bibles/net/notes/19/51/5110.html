<A NAME="5110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1877><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;only you,&#8221; as if the psalmist had sinned exclusively against God and no other. Since the Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1496;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hata</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to sin&#8221;) is used elsewhere of sinful acts against people (see BDB 306 s.v. 2.a) and David (the presumed author) certainly sinned when he murdered Uriah (2 Sam 12:9), it is likely that the psalmist is overstating the case to suggest that the attack on Uriah was ultimately an attack on God himself. To clarify the point of the hyperbole, the translation uses &#8220;especially,&#8221; rather than the potentially confusing &#8220;only.&#8221;</p>
