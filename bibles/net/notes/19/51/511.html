<A NAME="511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1868><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 51</i>. The psalmist confesses his sinfulness to God and begs for forgiveness and a transformation of his inner character. According to the psalm superscription, David offered this prayer when Nathan confronted him with his sin following the king&#8217;s affair with Bathsheba (see 2 Sam 11-12). However, the final two verses of the psalm hardly fit this situation, for they assume the walls of Jerusalem have been destroyed and that the sacrificial system has been temporarily suspended. These verses are probably an addition to the psalm made during the period of exile following the fall of Jerusalem in 586 <span class="smallcaps">b.c</span>. The exiles could relate to David&#8217;s experience, for they, like him, and had been forced to confront their sin. They appropriated David&#8217;s ancient prayer and applied it to their own circumstances.</p>
