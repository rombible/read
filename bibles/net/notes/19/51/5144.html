<A NAME="5144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1911><b>sn</b> <i>You do not desire a burnt sacrifice</i>. The terminology used in v. 16 does not refer to expiatory sacrifices, but to dedication and communion offerings. This is not a categorical denial of the sacrificial system in general or of the importance of such offerings. The psalmist is talking about his specific situation. Dedication and communion offerings have their proper place in worship (see v. 19), but God requires something more fundamental, a repentant and humble attitude (see v. 17), before these offerings can have real meaning.</p>
