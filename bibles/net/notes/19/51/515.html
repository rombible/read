<A NAME="515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1872><b>tn</b> Traditionally &#8220;blot out my transgressions.&#8221; Because of the reference to washing and cleansing in the following verse, it is likely that the psalmist is comparing forgiveness to wiping an object clean (note the use of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">makhah</font>) in the sense of &#8220;wipe clean; dry&#8221; in 2 Kgs 21:13; Prov 30:20; Isa 25:8). Another option is that the psalmist is comparing forgiveness to erasing or blotting out names from a register (see Exod 32:32-33). In this case one might translate, &#8220;erase all record of my rebellious acts.&#8221;</p>
