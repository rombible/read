<A NAME="5136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1903><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your ways.&#8221; The word &#8220;merciful&#8221; is added for clarification. God&#8217;s &#8220;ways&#8221; are sometimes his commands, but in this context, where the teaching of God&#8217;s ways motivates repentance (see the next line), it is more likely that God&#8217;s merciful and compassionate way of dealing with sinners is in view. Thanksgiving songs praising God for his deliverance typically focus on these divine attributes (see Pss 34, 41, 116, 138).</p>
