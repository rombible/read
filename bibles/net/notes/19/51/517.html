<A NAME="517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1874><b>sn</b> In vv. 1b-2 the psalmist uses three different words to emphasize the multifaceted character and degree of his sin. Whatever one wants to call it (&#8220;rebellious acts,&#8221; &#8220;wrongdoing,&#8221; &#8220;sin&#8221;), he has done it and stands morally polluted in God&#8217;s sight. The same three words appear in Exod 34:7, which emphasizes that God is willing to forgive sin in all of its many dimensions. In v. 2 the psalmist compares forgiveness and restoration to physical cleansing. Perhaps he likens spiritual cleansing to the purification rites of priestly law.</p>
