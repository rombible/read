<A NAME="5143"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1910><b>tn</b> The translation assumes that the cohortative is used in a hypothetical manner in a formally unmarked conditional sentence, &#8220;You do not want a sacrifice, should I offer [it]&#8221; (cf. NEB). For other examples of cohortatives in the protasis (&#8220;if&#8221; clause) of a conditional sentence, see GKC 320 §108.<i>e</i>. (It should be noted, however, that <i>GKC</i> understands this particular verse in a different manner. See GKC 320 §108.<i>f</i>, where it is suggested that the cohortative is part of an apodosis with the protasis being suppressed.)</p>
