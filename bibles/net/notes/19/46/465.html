<A NAME="465"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1694><b>tn</b> The imperfect is taken in a generalizing sense (cf. NEB) because the situation described in vv. 2-3 is understood as symbolizing typical world conditions. In this case the imperfect draws attention to the typical nature of the response. The covenant community characteristically responds with confidence, not fear. Another option is to take the situation described as purely hypothetical. In this case one might translate, &#8220;We will not fear, even though the earth should shake&#8221; (cf. NIV, NRSV).</p>
