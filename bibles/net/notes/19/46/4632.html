<A NAME="4632"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1721><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;wagons he burns with fire.&#8221; Some read &#8220;chariots&#8221; here (cf. NASB), but the Hebrew word refers to wagons or carts, not chariots, elsewhere in the OT. In this context, where military weapons are mentioned, it is better to revocalize the form as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1490;&#1460;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">agilot</font>, &#8220;round shields&#8221;), a word which occurs only here in the OT, but is attested in later Hebrew and Aramaic.</p>
