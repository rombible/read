<A NAME="4612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1701><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;A river, its channels cause the city of God to be glad.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The city of God</i> is Jerusalem (see Pss 48:1-2; 87:2-3). The river&#8217;s &#8220;channels&#8221; are probably <i>irrigation ditches</i> vital to growing crops. Some relate the imagery to the &#8220;waters of Shiloah&#8221; (see Isa 8:6), which flowed from the Gihon spring to the pool of Siloam. In Isa 8:6-8 these waters are contrasted with the flood waters symbolizing Assyria. Even if this is the reality behind the imagery, the picture of a river flowing through Jerusalem is idealized and exaggerated. The river and irrigation ditches symbolize the peace and prosperity that the Lord provides for Jerusalem, in contrast to the havoc produced by the turbulent waters (symbolic of the nations) outside the city. Some see here an adaptation of Canaanite (or, more specifically, Jebusite) mythical traditions of rivers/springs flowing from the high god El&#8217;s dwelling place. The Songs of Zion do utilize such imagery at times (see Ps 48:2). The image of a river flowing through Zion may have inspired prophetic visions of an eschatological river flowing from the temple (see Ezek 47:1-12; Joel 3:18).</p>
