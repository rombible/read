<A NAME="4634"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1723><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;do nothing/be quiet (see 1 Sam 15:16) and know.&#8221; This statement may be addressed to the hostile nations, indicating they should cease their efforts to destroy God&#8217;s people, or to Judah, indicating they should rest secure in God&#8217;s protection. Since the psalm is an expression of Judah&#8217;s trust and confidence, it is more likely that the words are directed to the nations, who are actively promoting chaos and are in need of a rebuke.</p>
