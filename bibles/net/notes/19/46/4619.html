<A NAME="4619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1708><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;nations roar, kingdoms shake.&#8221; The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hamah</font>, &#8220;roar, be in uproar&#8221;) is used in v. 3 of the waves crashing, while the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mot</font>, &#8220;overthrown&#8221;) is used in v. 2 of mountains tumbling into the sea (see also v. 5, where the psalm affirms that Jerusalem &#8220;cannot be moved&#8221;). The repetition of the verbs suggests that the language of vv. 2-3 is symbolic and depicts the upheaval that characterizes relationships between the nations of the earth. As some nations (symbolized by the surging, chaotic waters) show hostility, others (symbolized by the mountains) come crashing down to destruction. The surging waters are symbolic of chaotic forces in other poetic texts (see, for example, Isa 17:12; Jer 51:42) and mountains can symbolize strong kingdoms (see, for example, Jer 51:25).</p>
