<A NAME="3812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1393><b>tn</b> The verb&#8217;s precise shade of meaning in this context is not entirely clear. The verb, which literally means &#8220;to bend,&#8221; may refer to the psalmist&#8217;s posture. In Isa 21:3 it seems to mean &#8220;be confused, dazed.&#8221;</p>
