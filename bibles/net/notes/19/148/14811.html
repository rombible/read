<A NAME="14811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=4730><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he lifted up a horn for his people.&#8221; The horn of an ox underlies the metaphor (see Deut 33:17; 1 Kgs 22:11; Ps 92:10). The horn of the wild ox is frequently a metaphor for military strength; the idiom &#8220;exalt/lift up the horn&#8221; signifies military victory (see 1 Sam 2:10; Pss 75:10; 89:17, 24; 92:10; Lam 2:17). Another option is to take the &#8220;horn&#8221; as a symbol for the Davidic king, through whom the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> gives his people military victory.</p>
