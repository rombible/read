<A NAME="1281"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=4345><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 128</i>. The psalmist observes that the godly individual has genuine happiness because the Lord rewards such a person with prosperity and numerous children.</p>
<A NAME="1282"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=4346><b>sn</b> The precise significance of this title, which appears in Pss 120-134, is unclear. Perhaps worshipers recited these psalms when they ascended the road to Jerusalem to celebrate annual religious festivals. For a discussion of their background see L. C. Allen, <i>Psalms 101-150 </i>(WBC), 219-21.</p>
<A NAME="1283"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=4347><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;every fearer of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1284"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4348><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the one who walks in his ways.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1285"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=4349><b>tn</b> The psalmist addresses the representative God-fearing man, as indicated by the references to &#8220;your wife&#8221; (v. 3) and &#8220;the man&#8221; (v. 4), as well as the second masculine singular pronominal and verbal forms in vv. 2-6.</p>
<A NAME="1286"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=4350><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the work of your hands, indeed you will eat.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1287"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=4351><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;how blessed you [will be] and it will be good for you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1288"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=4352><b>sn</b> The metaphor of the <i>fruitful vine</i> pictures the wife as fertile; she will give her husband numerous children (see the next line).</p>
<A NAME="1289"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=4353><b>tn</b> One could translate &#8220;sons&#8221; (see Ps 127:3 and the note on the word &#8220;sons&#8221; there), but here the term seems to refer more generally to children of both genders.</p>
<A NAME="12810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=4354><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;look, indeed thus will the man, the fearer of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, be blessed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="12811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=4355><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal form is understood as a jussive of prayer (note the imperatives that are subordinated to this clause in vv. 5b-6a). Having described the blessings that typically come to the godly, the psalmist concludes by praying that this ideal may become reality for the representative godly man being addressed.</p>
<A NAME="12812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=4356><b>tn</b> The imperative with prefixed <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) conjunctive indicates purpose/result after the preceding jussive.</p>
<A NAME="12813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=4357><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="12814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=4358><b>tn</b> The imperative with prefixed <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) conjunctive indicates purpose/result after the jussive in v. 5a.</p>
<A NAME="12815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=4359><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sons to your sons.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="12816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=4360><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;peace [be] upon Israel.&#8221; The statement is understood as a prayer (see Ps 125:5).</p>
