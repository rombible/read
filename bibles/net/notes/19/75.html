<A NAME="751"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2740><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 75</i>. The psalmist celebrates God&#8217;s just rule, which guarantees that the godly will be vindicated and the wicked destroyed.</p>
<A NAME="752"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2741><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;do not destroy.&#8221; Perhaps this refers to a particular style of music, a tune title, or a musical instrument. These words also appear in the superscription to Pss 57-59.</p>
<A NAME="753"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2742><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and near [is] your name.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="754"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2743><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;God says&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text, but are supplied in the translation to clarify that God speaks in vv. 2-3.</p>
<A NAME="755"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2744><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;when I take an appointed time.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="756"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2745><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I, [in] fairness, I judge.&#8221; The statement is understood in a generalizing sense; God typically executes fair judgment as he governs the world. One could take this as referring to an anticipated (future) judgment, &#8220;I will judge.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="757"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2746><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;melt.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="758"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2747><b>tn</b> The statement is understood in a generalizing sense; God typically prevents the world from being overrun by chaos. One could take this as referring to an anticipated event, &#8220;I will make its pillars secure.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="759"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2748><b>tn</b> The identity of the speaker in vv. 4-6 is unclear. The present translation assumes that the psalmist, who also speaks in vv. 7-9 (where God/the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is spoken of in the third person) here addresses the proud and warns them of God&#8217;s judgment. The presence of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>, &#8220;for&#8221;) at the beginning of both vv. 6-7 seems to indicate that vv. 4-9 are a unit. However, there is no formal indication of a new speaker in v. 4 (or in v. 10, where God appears to speak). Another option is to see God speaking in vv. 2-6 and v. 10 and to take only vv. 7-9 as the words of the psalmist. In this case one must interpret <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> at the beginning of v. 7 in an asseverative or emphatic sense (&#8220;surely; indeed&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="7510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2749><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;do not lift up a horn.&#8221; The horn of an ox underlies the metaphor (see Deut 33:17; 1 Kgs 22:11; Ps 92:10). The horn of the wild ox is frequently a metaphor for military strength; the idiom &#8220;exalt/lift up the horn&#8221; signifies military victory (see 1 Sam 2:10; Pss 89:17, 24; 92:10; Lam 2:17). Here the idiom seems to refer to an arrogant attitude that assumes victory has been achieved.</p>
<A NAME="7511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2750><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;do not lift up on high your horn.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2751><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[do not] speak with unrestrained neck.&#8221; The negative particle is understood in this line by ellipsis (note the preceding line).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The image behind the language of vv. 4-5 is that of a powerful wild ox that confidently raises its head before its enemies.</p>
<A NAME="7513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2752><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for not from the east or from the west, and not from the wilderness of the mountains.&#8221; If one follows this reading the sentence is elliptical. One must supply &#8220;does help come,&#8221; or some comparable statement. However, it is possible to take <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">harim</font>) as a Hiphil infinitive from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rum</font>), the same verb used in vv. 4-5 of &#8220;lifting up&#8221; a horn. In this case one may translate the form as &#8220;victory.&#8221; In this case the point is that victory does not come from alliances with other nations.</p>
<A NAME="7514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2753><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;judges.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2754><b>tn</b> The imperfects here emphasize the generalizing nature of the statement.</p>
<A NAME="7516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2755><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for a cup [is] in the hand of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and wine foams, it is full of a spiced drink.&#8221; The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mesekh</font>) refers to a &#8220;mixture&#8221; of wine and spices.</p>
<A NAME="7517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2756><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he pours out from this.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2757><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;surely its dregs they slurp up and drink, all the wicked of the earth.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The psalmist pictures God as forcing the wicked to gulp down an intoxicating drink that will leave them stunned and vulnerable. Divine judgment is also depicted this way in Ps 60:3; Isa 51:17-23; and Hab 2:16.</p>
<A NAME="7519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2758><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will declare forever.&#8221; The object needs to be supplied; God&#8217;s just judgment is in view.</p>
<A NAME="7520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2759><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;God says&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text. They are supplied in the translation to clarify that God speaks in v. 10.</p>
<A NAME="7521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2760><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and all the horns of the wicked I will cut off, the horns of the godly will be lifted up.&#8221; The imagery of the wild ox&#8217;s horn is once more utilized (see vv. 4-5).</p>
