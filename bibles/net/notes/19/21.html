<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=757><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 21</i>. The psalmist praises the Lord for the way he protects and blesses the Davidic king.</p>
<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=758><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in your strength.&#8221; The translation interprets the pronominal suffix as subjective, rather than merely descriptive (or attributive).</p>
<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=759><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and in your deliverance, how greatly he rejoices.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=760><b>tn</b> The translation assumes the perfect verbal forms in v. 2 are generalizing, stating factually what God typically does for the king. Another option is to take them as present perfects, &#8220;you have granted&#8230;you have not refused.&#8221; See v. 4, which mentions a specific request for a long reign.</p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=761><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the request of his lips you do not refuse.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=762><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;meet him [with].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=763><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;good.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=764><b>sn</b> <i>You bring him rich blessings</i>. The following context indicates that God&#8217;s &#8220;blessings&#8221; include deliverance/protection, vindication, sustained life, and a long, stable reign (see also Pss 3:8; 24:5).</p>
<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=765><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;life he asked from you.&#8221; Another option is to translate the perfect verbal forms in v. 4 with the present tense, &#8220;he asks&#8230;you grant.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=766><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you have granted him length of days forever and ever.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;length of days,&#8221; when used of human beings, usually refers to a lengthy period of time (such as one&#8217;s lifetime). See, for example, Deut 30:20; Job 12:12; Ps 91:16; Prov 3:2, 16; Lam 5:20. The additional phrase &#8220;forever and ever&#8221; is hyperbolic. While it seems to attribute eternal life to the king (see Pss 61:6-7; 72:5 as well), the underlying reality is the king&#8217;s enduring dynasty. He will live on, as it were, through his descendants, who will continue to rule over his kingdom long after he has passed off the scene.</p>
<A NAME="2111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=767><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;great glory.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=768><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;majesty and splendor you place upon him.&#8221; For other uses of the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491; &#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hod vÿhadar</font>, &#8220;majesty and splendor&#8221;) see 1 Chr 16:27; Job 40:10; Pss 96:6; 104:1; 111:3.</p>
<A NAME="2113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=769><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you make him happy with joy with [i.e., &#8220;close by&#8221; or &#8220;in&#8221;] your face.&#8221; On the idiom &#8220;with your face&#8221; (i.e., &#8220;in your presence&#8221;) see Ps 16:11 and BDB 816 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1467;&#1492;</font> II.2.a.</p>
<A NAME="2114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=770><b>tn</b> The active participle draws attention to the ongoing nature of the action.</p>
<A NAME="2115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=771><b>tn</b> Traditionally &#8220;the Most High&#8217;s.&#8221; The divine title &#8220;Most High&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1500;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">elyon</font>) pictures God as the exalted ruler of the universe who vindicates the innocent and judges the wicked. Note the focus of vv. 8-12 and see Ps 47:2.</p>
<A NAME="2116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=772><b>tn</b> Another option is to translate the imperfect verbal form as future, &#8220;he will not be upended&#8221; (cf. NRSV &#8220;he shall not be moved&#8221;). Even if one chooses this option, the future tense must be understood in a generalizing sense.</p>
<A NAME="2117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=773><b>tn</b> The king is now addressed. One could argue that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is still being addressed, but v. 9 militates against this proposal, for there the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is mentioned in the third person and appears to be distinct from the addressee (unless, of course, one takes &#8220;<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221; in v. 9 as vocative; see the note on &#8220;them&#8221; in v. 9b). Verse 7 begins this transition to a new addressee by referring to both the king and the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> in the third person (in vv. 1-6 the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is addressed and only the king referred to in the third person).</p>
<A NAME="2118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=774><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your hand finds.&#8221; The idiom pictures the king grabbing hold of his enemies and defeating them (see 1 Sam 23:17). The imperfect verbal forms in vv. 8-12 may be translated with the future tense, as long as the future is understood as generalizing.</p>
<A NAME="2119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=775><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your right hand finds those who hate you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=776><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you make them like a furnace of fire.&#8221; Although many modern translations retain the literal Hebrew, the statement is elliptical. The point is not that he makes them like a furnace, but like an object burned in a furnace (cf. NEB, &#8220;at your coming you shall plunge them into a fiery furnace&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="2121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=777><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;at the time of your face.&#8221; The &#8220;face&#8221; of the king here refers to his angry presence. See Lam 4:16.</p>
<A NAME="2122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=778><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, in his anger he swallows them, and fire devours them.&#8221; Some take &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221; as a vocative, in which case he is addressed in vv. 8-9a. But this makes the use of the third person in v. 9b rather awkward, though the king could be the subject (see vv. 1-7).</p>
<A NAME="2123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=779><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fruit.&#8221; The next line makes it clear that offspring is in view.</p>
<A NAME="2124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=780><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;seed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=781><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sons of man.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=782><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;for.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=783><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they extend against you harm.&#8221; The perfect verbal forms in v. 11 are taken as generalizing, stating factually what the king&#8217;s enemies typically do. Another option is to translate with the past tense (&#8220;they intended&#8230;planned&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="2128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=784><b>sn</b> See Ps 10:2.</p>
<A NAME="2129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=785><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they lack ability.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2130"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=786><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you make them a shoulder,&#8221; i.e., &#8220;you make them turn and run, showing the back of their neck and shoulders.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=787><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;with your bowstrings you fix against their faces,&#8221; i.e., &#8220;you fix your arrows on the bowstrings to shoot at them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=788><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in your strength,&#8221; but English idiom does not require the pronoun.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The psalm concludes with a petition to the Lord, asking him to continue to intervene in strength for the king and nation.</p>
<A NAME="2133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=789><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sing praise.&#8221;</p>
