<A NAME="11020"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=3883><b>tn</b> As pointed in the Hebrew text, this title refers to God (many medieval Hebrew <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yehveh</font>, &#8220;<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221; here). The present translation assumes that the psalmist here addresses the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> as he celebrates what the king is able to accomplish while positioned at God&#8217;s &#8220;right hand.&#8221; According to this view the king is the subject of the third person verb forms in vv. 5b-7. (2) Another option is to understand the king as the addressee (as in vv. 2-3). In this case &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221; is the subject of the third person verbs throughout vv. 5-7 and is depicted as a warrior in a very anthropomorphic manner. In this case the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is pictured as being at the psalmist&#8217;s right hand (just the opposite of v. 1). See Pss 16:8; 121:5. (3) A third option is to revocalize <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adonay</font>, &#8220;<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221;) as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adoniy</font>, &#8220;my lord&#8221;; see v. 1). In this case one may translate, &#8220;My lord, at his [God&#8217;s] right hand, strikes down.&#8221; In this case the king is the subject of the third person verbs in vv. 5b-7.</p>
