<A NAME="1103"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3866><b>sn</b> <i>My lord</i>. In the psalm&#8217;s original context the speaker is an unidentified prophetic voice in the royal court. In the course of time the psalm is applied to each successive king in the dynasty and ultimately to the ideal Davidic king. NT references to the psalm understand David to be speaking about his &#8220;lord,&#8221; the Messiah. (See Matt 22:43-45; Mark 12:36-37; Luke 20:42-44; Acts 2:34-35).</p>
