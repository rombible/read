<A NAME="11019"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=3882><b>sn</b> The Davidic king&#8217;s priestly role is analogous to that of <i>Melchizedek</i>, who was both &#8220;king of Salem&#8221; (i.e., Jerusalem) and a &#8220;priest of God Most High&#8221; in the time of Abraham (Gen 14:18-20). Like Melchizedek, the Davidic king was a royal priest, distinct from the Aaronic line (see Heb 7). The analogy focuses on the king&#8217;s priestly role; the language need not imply that Melchizedek himself was &#8220;an eternal priest.&#8221;</p>
