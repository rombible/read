<A NAME="823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3007><b>tn</b> The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1491;&#1463;&#1514; &#1488;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adat </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>, &#8220;assembly of El&#8221;) appears only here in the OT. (1) Some understand &#8220;El&#8221; to refer to God himself. In this case he is pictured presiding over his own heavenly assembly. (2) Others take <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;</font> as a superlative here (&#8220;God stands in the <i>great</i> assembly&#8221;), as in Pss 36:6 and 80:10. (3) The present translation assumes this is a reference to the Canaanite high god El, who presided over the Canaanite divine assembly. (See Isa 14:13, where El&#8217;s assembly is called &#8220;the stars of El.&#8221;) In the Ugaritic myths the phrase &#8217;<font face="Scholar">dt </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ilm</font> refers to the &#8220;assembly of the gods,&#8221; who congregate in King Kirtu&#8217;s house, where Baal asks El to bless Kirtu&#8217;s house (see G. R. Driver, <i>Canaanite Myths and Legends</i>, 91). If the Canaanite divine assembly is referred to here in Ps 82:1, then the psalm must be understood as a bold polemic against Canaanite religion. Israel&#8217;s God invades El&#8217;s assembly, denounces its gods as failing to uphold justice, and announces their coming demise. For an interpretation of the psalm along these lines, see W. VanGemeren, &#8220;Psalms,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 5:533-36.</p>
