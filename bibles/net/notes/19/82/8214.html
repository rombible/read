<A NAME="8214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=3018><b>sn</b> Normally in the OT the title <i>Most High</i> belongs to the God of Israel, but in this context, where the mythological overtones are so strong, it probably refers to the Canaanite high god El (see v. 1, as well as Isa 14:13).</p>
