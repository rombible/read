<A NAME="2019"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=748><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;these in chariots and these in horses.&#8221; No verb appears; perhaps the verb &#8220;invoke&#8221; is to be supplied from the following line. In this case the idea would be that some &#8220;invoke&#8221; (i.e., trust in) their military might for victory (cf. NEB &#8220;boast&#8221;; NIV &#8220;trust&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;take pride&#8221;). Verse 8 suggests that the &#8220;some/others&#8221; mentioned here are the nation&#8217;s enemies.</p>
