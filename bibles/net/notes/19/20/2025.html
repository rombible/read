<A NAME="2025"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=754><b>tc</b> This translation assumes an emendation of the verbal form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hoshi</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>). As it stands, the form is an imperative. In this case the people return to the petitionary mood with which the psalm begins (&#8220;O <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, deliver&#8221;). But the immediate context is one of confidence (vv. 6-8), not petition (vv. 1-5). If one takes the final <i>he</i> on the verb &#8220;deliver&#8221; as dittographic (note the initial <i>he</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;</font>) on the following phrase, &#8220;the king&#8221;), one can repoint the verbal form as a perfect and understand it as expressing the people&#8217;s confidence, &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will deliver the king&#8221; (see v. 6). The Hebrew scribal tradition takes &#8220;the king&#8221; with the following line, in which case it would be best interpreted as a divine title, &#8220;may the King answer us&#8221; or &#8220;the king will answer us&#8221; (see Pss 98:6; 145:1). However, the poetic parallelism is better balanced if &#8220;the king&#8221; is taken with the first line. In this case the referent is the Davidic king, who is earlier called the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s &#8220;anointed one&#8221; (cf. note on &#8220;chosen king&#8221; in v. 6; see Pss 21:7; 45:5, 11; 63:11).</p>
