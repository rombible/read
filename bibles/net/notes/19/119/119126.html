<A NAME="119126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">126</span><note=4159><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Forever, O <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, your word stands firm in heaven,&#8221; or &#8220;Forever, O <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, [is] your word; it stands firm in heaven.&#8221; The translation assumes that &#8220;your word&#8221; refers here to the body of divine instructions contained in the law (note the frequent references to the law in vv. 92-96). See vv. 9, 16-17, 57, 101, 105, 130, 139 and 160-61. The reference in v. 86 to God&#8217;s law being faithful favors this interpretation. Another option is that &#8220;your word&#8221; refers to God&#8217;s assuring word of promise, mentioned in vv. 25, 28, 42, 65, 74, 81, 107, 114, 147 and 169. In this case one might translate, &#8220;O <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, your promise is reliable, it stands firm in heaven.&#8221;</p>
