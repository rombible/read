<A NAME="11977"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=4110><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I remember your regulations from of old.&#8221; The prepositional phrase &#8220;from of old&#8221; apparently modifies &#8220;your regulations,&#8221; alluding to the fact that God revealed them to Israel in the distant past. Another option is to understand the prepositional phrase as modifying the verb, in which case one might translate, &#8220;I have long remembered your regulations.&#8221;</p>
