<A NAME="119144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">144</span><note=4177><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;divided ones.&#8221; The word occurs only here; it appears to be derived from a verbal root, attested in Arabic, meaning &#8220;to split&#8221; (see <i>HALOT</i> 762 s.v. *<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1461;&#1506;&#1461;&#1507;</font>). Since the psalmist is emphasizing his unswerving allegiance to God and his law, the term probably refers to those who lack such loyalty. The translation is similar to that suggested by L. C. Allen, <i>Psalms 101-150 </i>(WBC), 131.</p>
