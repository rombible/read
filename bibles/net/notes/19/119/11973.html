<A NAME="11973"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=4106><b>tn</b> Lifting the hands is often associated with prayer (Pss 28:2; 63:4; Lam 2:19). (1) Because praying to God&#8217;s law borders on the extreme, some prefer to emend the text to &#8220;I lift up my hands to you,&#8221; eliminating &#8220;your commands, which I love&#8221; as dittographic. In this view these words were accidentally repeated from the previous verse. (2) However, it is possible that the psalmist closely associates the law with God himself because he views the law as the expression of the divine will. (3) Another option is that &#8220;lifting the hands&#8221; does not refer to prayer here, but to the psalmist&#8217;s desire to receive and appropriate the law. (4) Still others understand this to be an action praising God&#8217;s commands (so NCV; cf. TEV, CEV, NLT).</p>
