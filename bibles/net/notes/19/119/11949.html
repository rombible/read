<A NAME="11949"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=4082><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for you make wide my heart.&#8221; The &#8220;heart&#8221; is viewed here as the seat of the psalmist&#8217;s volition and understanding. The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> gives the psalmist the desire and moral understanding that are foundational to the willing obedience depicted metaphorically in the preceding line. In Isa 60:5 the expression &#8220;your heart will be wide&#8221; means &#8220;your heart will swell with pride,&#8221; but here the nuance appears to be different.</p>
