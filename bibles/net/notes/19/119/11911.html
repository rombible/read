<A NAME="11911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=4044><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;young man.&#8221; Hebrew wisdom literature often assumes and reflects the male-oriented perspective of ancient Israelite society. The principle of the psalm is certainly applicable to all people, regardless of their gender or age. To facilitate modern application, the gender specific &#8220;young man&#8221; has been translated with the more neutral &#8220;young person.&#8221;</p>
