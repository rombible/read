<A NAME="11947"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=4080><b>tn</b> BDB 1000-1001 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> derives the verb from the first homonym listed, meaning &#8220;to agree with; to be like; to resemble.&#8221; It here means (in the Piel stem) &#8220;to be accounted suitable,&#8221; which in turn would mean by metonymy &#8220;to accept; to be committed to.&#8221; Some prefer to derive the verb from a homonym meaning &#8220;to place; to set,&#8221; but in this case an elliptical prepositional phrase must be understood, &#8220;I place your regulations [before me]&#8221; (see Ps 16:8).</p>
