<A NAME="1191"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=4034><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 119</i>. The psalmist celebrates God&#8217;s law and the guidance it provides his people. He expresses his desire to know God&#8217;s law thoroughly so that he might experience the blessings that come to those who obey it. This lengthy psalm exhibits an elaborate acrostic pattern. The psalm is divided into twenty-two sections (corresponding to the letters of the Hebrew alphabet), each of which is comprised of eight verses. Each of the verses in the first section (vv. 1-8) begins with the letter <i>alef</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>), the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet. This pattern continues throughout the psalm as each new section highlights a successive letter of the alphabet. Each verse in section two (vv. 9-16) begins with the second letter of the alphabet, each verse in section three (vv. 17-24) with the third letter, etc. This rigid pattern creates a sense of order and completeness and may have facilitated memorization. </p>
