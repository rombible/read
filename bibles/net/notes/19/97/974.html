<A NAME="974"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=3431><b>tn</b> The translation assumes that the prefixed verbal form in the first line is an imperfect (&#8220;are ashamed&#8221;) and that the ambiguous form in the third line is a perfect (&#8220;bow down&#8221;) because the psalmist appears to be describing the effect of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s mighty theophany on those who witness it (see vv. 5, 8). Another option is to take the prefixed form in the first line as a jussive (&#8220;let all who worship idols be ashamed&#8221;) and the ambiguous form in the third line as an imperative (&#8220;All you gods, bow down before him!&#8221;; cf. NIV).</p>
