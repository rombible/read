NEB). See GKC 335 §112.<i>cc</i>.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Lord <i>was silent</i> in the sense that he delayed punishment. Of course, God&#8217;s patience toward sinners eventually runs out. The divine &#8220;silence&#8221; is only temporary (see v. 3, where the psalmist, having described God&#8217;s arrival, observes that &#8220;he is not silent&#8221;).</p>
