<A NAME="5010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1835><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Gather to me my covenant people.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1505;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khasid</font>, &#8220;covenant people&#8221;) elsewhere in the psalms is used in a positive sense of God&#8217;s loyal followers (see the note at Ps 4:3), but here, as the following line makes clear, the term has a neutral sense and simply refers to those who have outwardly sworn allegiance to God, not necessarily to those whose loyalty is genuine.</p>
