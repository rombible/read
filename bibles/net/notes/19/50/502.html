<A NAME="502"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1827><b>sn</b> Israel&#8217;s God is here identified with three names: El (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>], or &#8220;God&#8221;), Elohim (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohim</font>], or &#8220;God&#8221;), and Yahweh (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">yÿhvah</font>] or &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221;). There is an obvious allusion here to Josh 22:22, the only other passage where these three names appear in succession. In that passage the Reubenites, Gadites, and half-tribe of Manasseh declare, &#8220;El, God, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>! El, God, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>! He knows the truth! Israel must also know! If we have rebelled or disobeyed the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, don&#8217;t spare us today!&#8221; In that context the other tribes had accused the trans-Jordanian tribes of breaking God&#8217;s covenant by worshiping idols. The trans-Jordanian tribes appealed to &#8220;El, God, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221; as their witness that they were innocent of the charges brought against them. Ironically here in Ps 50 &#8220;<i>El, God, the </i><span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221; accuses his sinful covenant people of violating the covenant and warns that he will not spare them if they persist in their rebellion.</p>
