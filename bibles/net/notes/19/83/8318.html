<A NAME="8318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=3039><b>sn</b> <i>Endor </i>is not mentioned in the accounts of Gideon&#8217;s or Barak&#8217;s victories, but both battles took place in the general vicinity of the town. (See Y. Aharoni and M. Avi-Yonah, <i>The Macmillan Bible Atlas</i>, 46, 54.) Because Sisera and Jabin are mentioned in v. 9b, many understand them to be the subject of the verbs in v. 10, though they relate v. 10 to Gideon&#8217;s victory, which is referred to in v. 9a, 11. (See, for example, Y. Aharoni, <i>The Land of the Bible</i>, 263.) </p>
