<A NAME="951"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=3398><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 95</i>. The psalmist summons Israel to praise God as the creator of the world and the nation&#8217;s protector, but he also reminds the people not to rebel against God.</p>
<A NAME="952"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=3399><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to the rocky summit of our deliverance.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="953"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3400><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;meet his face.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="954"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=3401><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;with songs of joy.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="955"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=3402><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;above.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="956"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=3403><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;in his hand&#8221; means within the sphere of his authority.</p>
<A NAME="957"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=3404><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;kneel down.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="958"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=3405><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;of his hand.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="959"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=3406><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;if only you would listen to his voice.&#8221; The Hebrew particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>, &#8220;if&#8221;) and following prefixed verbal form here express a wish (cf. Ps 81:8). Note that the apodosis (the &#8220;then&#8221; clause of the conditional sentence) is suppressed.</p>
<A NAME="9510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=3407><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;he says&#8221; are supplied in the translation to clarify that the following words are spoken by the Lord (see vv. 9-11).</p>
<A NAME="9511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=3408><b>sn</b> The name <i>Meribah</i> means &#8220;strife.&#8221; Two separate but similar incidents at Meribah are recorded in the Pentateuch (Exod 17:1-7; Num 20:1-13, see also Pss 81:7; 106:32). In both cases the Israelites complained about lack of water and the Lord miraculously provided for them.</p>
<A NAME="9512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=3409><b>sn</b> The name <i>Massah</i> means &#8220;testing.&#8221; This was another name (along with Meribah) given to the place where Israel complained following the Red Sea Crossing (see Exod 17:1-7, as well as Deut 6:16; 9:22; 33:8).</p>
<A NAME="9513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=3410><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;do not harden your heart[s] as [at] Meribah, as [in] the day of Massah in the wilderness.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="9514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=3411><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;where your fathers tested me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="9515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=3412><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal form is either a preterite or an imperfect. If the latter, it emphasizes the ongoing nature of the condition in the past. The translation reflects this interpretation of the verbal form.</p>
<A NAME="9516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=3413><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a people, wanderers of heart [are] they.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="9517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=3414><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they do not know my ways.&#8221; In this context the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s &#8220;ways&#8221; are his commands, viewed as a pathway from which his people, likened to wayward sheep (see v. 7), wander.</p>
<A NAME="9518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=3415><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my resting place.&#8221; The promised land of Canaan is here viewed metaphorically as a place of rest for God&#8217;s people, who are compared to sheep (see v. 7).</p>
