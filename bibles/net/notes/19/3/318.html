<A NAME="318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=86><b>tn</b> Elsewhere in the psalms the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>), when collocated with a perfect verbal form and subordinated to a preceding imperative directed to God, almost always has an explanatory or causal force (&#8220;for, because&#8221;) and introduces a motivating argument for why God should respond positively to the request (see Pss 5:10; 6:2; 12:1; 16:1; 41:4; 55:9; 56:1; 57:1; 60:2; 69:1; 74:20; 119:94; 123:3; 142:6; 143:8). (On three occasions the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> is recitative after a verb of perception [&#8220;see/know that,&#8221; see Pss 4:3; 25:19; 119:159]). If <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> is taken as explanatory here, then the psalmist is arguing that God should deliver him now because that is what God characteristically does. However, such a motivating argument is not used in the passages cited above. The motivating argument usually focuses on the nature of the psalmist&#8217;s dilemma or the fact that he trusts in the Lord. For this reason it is unlikely that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> has its normal force here. Most scholars understand the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> as having an asseverative (emphasizing) function here (&#8220;indeed, yes&#8221;; NEB leaves the particle untranslated).</p>
