<A NAME="38"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=76><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my glory,&#8221; or &#8220;my honor.&#8221; The psalmist affirms that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is his source of honor, i.e., the one who gives him honor in the sight of others. According to BDB 459 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</font> 7, the phrase refers to God as the one to whom the psalmist gives honor. But the immediate context focuses on what God does for the psalmist, not vice-versa.</p>
