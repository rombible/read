<A NAME="39"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=77><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[the one who] lifts my head.&#8221; This phrase could be understood to refer to a general strengthening of the psalmist by God during difficult circumstances. However, if one takes the suggestion of the superscription that this is a Davidic psalm written during the revolt of Absalom, the phrase &#8220;lift the head&#8221; could refer to the psalmist&#8217;s desire for restoration to his former position (cf. Gen 40:13 where the same phrase is used). Like the Hebrew text, the present translation (&#8220;who restores me&#8221;) can be understood in either sense.</p>
