<A NAME="310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=78><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal form could be an imperfect, yielding the translation &#8220;I cry out,&#8221; but the verb form in the next line (a <i>vav</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>] consecutive with the preterite) suggests this is a brief narrative of what has already happened. Consequently the verb form in v. 4a is better understood as a preterite, &#8220;I cried out.&#8221; (For another example of the preterite of this same verb form, see Ps 30:8.) Sometime after the crisis arose, the psalmist prayed to the Lord and received an assuring answer. Now he confidently awaits the fulfillment of the divine promise.</p>
