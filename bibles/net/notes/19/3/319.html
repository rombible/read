<A NAME="319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=87><b>tn</b> If the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) is taken as explanatory, then the perfect verbal forms in v. 7b would describe God&#8217;s characteristic behavior. However, as pointed out in the preceding note on the word &#8220;yes,&#8221; the particle probably has an asseverative force here. If so, the perfects may be taken as indicating rhetorically the psalmist&#8217;s certitude and confidence that God will intervene. The psalmist is so confident of God&#8217;s positive response to his prayer, he can describe God&#8217;s assault on his enemies as if it had already happened. Such confidence is consistent with the mood of the psalm, as expressed before (vv. 3-6) and after this (v. 8). Another option is to take the perfects as precative, expressing a wish or request (&#8220;Strike all my enemies on the jaw, break the teeth of the wicked&#8221;). See <i>IBHS</i> 494-95 §30.5.4c, d. However, not all grammarians are convinced that the perfect is used as a precative in biblical Hebrew.</p>
