<A NAME="141"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=429><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 14</i>. The psalmist observes that the human race is morally corrupt. Evildoers oppress God&#8217;s people, but the psalmist is confident of God&#8217;s protection and anticipates a day when God will vindicate Israel.</p>
<A NAME="142"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=430><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a fool says in his heart.&#8221; The singular is used here in a collective or representative sense; the typical fool is envisioned.</p>
<A NAME="143"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=431><b>sn</b> <i>&#8220;There is no God.&#8221;</i> The statement is probably not a philosophical assertion that God does not exist, but rather a confident affirmation that God is unconcerned about how men live morally and ethically (see Ps 10:4, 11).</p>
<A NAME="144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=432><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they act corruptly, they make a deed evil.&#8221; The verbs describe the typical behavior of the wicked. The subject of the plural verbs is &#8220;sons of man&#8221; (v. 2). The entire human race is characterized by sinful behavior. This practical atheism &#8211; living as if there is no God who will hold them accountable for their actions &#8211; makes them fools, for one of the earmarks of folly is to fail to anticipate the long range consequences of one&#8217;s behavior.</p>
<A NAME="145"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=433><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;there is none that does good.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="146"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=434><b>sn</b> The picture of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> looking <i>down from heaven</i> draws attention to his sovereignty over the world.</p>
<A NAME="147"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=435><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;upon the sons of man.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="148"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=436><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;acts wisely.&#8221; The Hiphil is exhibitive.</p>
<A NAME="149"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=437><b>sn</b> <i>Anyone who is wise and seeks God</i> refers to the person who seeks to have a relationship with God by obeying and worshiping him.</p>
<A NAME="1410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=438><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;everyone turns aside.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=439><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;together they are corrupt.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=440><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;there is none that does good.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=441><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all the workers of wickedness.&#8221; See Pss 5:5; 6:8.</p>
<A NAME="1414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=442><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Do they not understand?&#8221; The rhetorical question (rendered in the translation as a positive affirmation) expresses the psalmist&#8217;s amazement at their apparent lack of understanding. This may refer to their lack of moral understanding, but it more likely refers to their failure to anticipate God&#8217;s defense of his people (see vv. 5-7).</p>
<A NAME="1415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=443><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;there they are afraid [with] fear.&#8221; The perfect verbal form is probably used in a rhetorical manner; the psalmist describes the future demise of the oppressors as if it were already occurring. The adverb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sham</font>, &#8220;there&#8221;) is also used here for dramatic effect, as the psalmist envisions the wicked standing in fear at a spot that is this vivid in his imagination (BDB 1027 s.v.). The cognate accusative following the verb emphasizes the degree of their terror.</p>
<A NAME="1416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=444><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for God is with a godly generation.&#8221; The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dor</font>, &#8220;generation&#8221;) refers here to the general class of people who are characterized by godliness. See BDB 190 s.v. for other examples where &#8220;generation&#8221; refers to a class of people.</p>
<A NAME="1417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=445><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the counsel of the oppressed you put to shame.&#8221; Using a second person plural verb form, the psalmist addresses the wicked. Since the context indicates their attempt to harm the godly will be thwarted, the imperfect should be taken in a subjunctive (cf. NASB, NRSV) rather than an indicative manner (cf. NIV). Here it probably expresses their desire or intent (&#8220;want to humiliate&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=446><b>tn</b> It is unlikely that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) has a causal force here. The translation assumes a concessive force; another option is to understand an asseverative use (&#8220;certainly, indeed&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=447><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his.&#8221; The antecedent of the singular pronoun is the singular form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ani</font>, &#8220;oppressed&#8221;) in the preceding line. The singular is collective or representative here (and thus translated as plural, &#8220;they&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=448><b>sn</b> <i>The deliverance of Israel</i>. This refers metonymically to God, the one who lives in Zion and provides deliverance for Israel.</p>
<A NAME="1421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=449><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;turns with a turning [toward] his people.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿvut</font>) is apparently a cognate accusative of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shuv</font>).</p>
<A NAME="1422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=450><b>tn</b> The verb form is jussive.</p>
<A NAME="1423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=451><b>tn</b> Because the parallel verb is jussive, this verb, which is ambiguous in form, should be taken as a jussive as well.</p>
