<A NAME="6227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2247><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;one God spoke, two which I heard.&#8221; This is a numerical saying utilizing the &#8220;x&#8221; followed by &#8220;x + 1&#8221; pattern to facilitate poetic parallelism. (See W. M. W. Roth, <i>Numerical Sayings in the Old Testament </i>[VTSup], 55-56.) As is typical in such sayings, a list corresponding to the second number (in this case &#8220;two&#8221;) follows. Another option is to translate, &#8220;God has spoken once, twice [he has spoken] that which I have heard.&#8221; The terms <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akhat</font>, &#8220;one; once&#8221;) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿtayim</font>, &#8220;two; twice&#8221;) are also juxtaposed in 2 Kgs 6:10 (where they refer to an action that was done more than &#8220;once or twice&#8221;) and in Job 33:14 (where they refer to God speaking &#8220;one way&#8221; and then in &#8220;another manner&#8221;).</p>
