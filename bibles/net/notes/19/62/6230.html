In this case one might translate, &#8220;God has declared one principle, two principles I have heard, namely, that God is strong, and you, O Lord, demonstrate loyal love, and that you repay men for what they do.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>You repay men for what they do</i>. The psalmist views God&#8217;s justice as a demonstration of both his power (see v. 11c) and his loyal love (see v. 12a). When God judges evildoers, he demonstrates loyal love to his people.</p>
