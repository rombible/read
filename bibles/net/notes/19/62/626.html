<A NAME="626"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2226><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text adds <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rabbah</font>, &#8220;greatly&#8221;) at the end of the line. It is unusual for this adverb to follow a negated verb. Some see this as qualifying the assertion to some degree, but this would water down the affirmation too much (see v. 6b, where the adverb is omitted). If the adverb has a qualifying function, it would suggest that the psalmist might be upended, though not severely. This is inconsistent with the confident mood of the psalm. The adverb probably has an emphatic force here, &#8220;I will not be greatly upended&#8221; meaning &#8220;I will not be annihilated.&#8221;</p>
