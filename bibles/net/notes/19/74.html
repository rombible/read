<A NAME="741"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2688><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 74</i>. The psalmist, who has just experienced the devastation of the Babylonian invasion of Jerusalem in 586 <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span>, asks God to consider Israel&#8217;s sufferings and intervene on behalf of his people. He describes the ruined temple, recalls God&#8217;s mighty deeds in the past, begs for mercy, and calls for judgment upon God&#8217;s enemies.</p>
<A NAME="742"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2689><b>tn</b> The meaning of the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">maskil</font>) is uncertain. The word is derived from a verb meaning &#8220;to be prudent; to be wise.&#8221; Various options are: &#8220;a contemplative song,&#8221; &#8220;a song imparting moral wisdom,&#8221; or &#8220;a skillful [i.e., well-written] song.&#8221; The term occurs in the superscriptions of Pss 32, 42, 44, 45, 52-55, 74, 78, 88, 89, and 142, as well as in Ps 47:7.</p>
<A NAME="743"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2690><b>sn</b> The psalmist does not really believe God has <i>permanently rejected</i> his people or he would not pray as he does in this psalm. But this initial question reflects his emotional response to what he sees and is overstated for the sake of emphasis. The severity of divine judgment gives the appearance that God has permanently abandoned his people.</p>
<A NAME="744"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2691><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;smoke.&#8221; The picture is that of a fire that continues to smolder.</p>
<A NAME="745"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2692><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your assembly,&#8221; which pictures God&#8217;s people as an assembled community.</p>
<A NAME="746"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2693><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;redeemed.&#8221; The verb &#8220;redeem&#8221; casts God in the role of a leader who protects members of his extended family in times of need and crisis (see Ps 19:14).</p>
<A NAME="747"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2694><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the tribe of your inheritance&#8221; (see Jer 10:16; 51:19).</p>
<A NAME="748"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2695><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lift up your steps to,&#8221; which may mean &#8220;run, hurry.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="749"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2696><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;everything [the] enemy has damaged in the holy place.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2697><b>tn</b> This verb is often used of a lion&#8217;s roar, so the psalmist may be comparing the enemy to a raging, devouring lion.</p>
<A NAME="7411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2698><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your meeting place.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2699><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they set up their banners [as] banners.&#8221; The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ot</font>, &#8220;sign&#8221;) here refers to the enemy army&#8217;s battle flags and banners (see Num 2:12).</p>
<A NAME="7413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2700><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;it is known like one bringing upwards, in a thicket of wood, axes.&#8221; The Babylonian invaders destroyed the woodwork in the temple.</p>
<A NAME="7414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2701><b>tn</b> This is the reading of the <i>Qere</i> (marginal reading). The <i>Kethib</i> (consonantal text) has &#8220;and a time.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2702><b>tn</b> The imperfect verbal form vividly describes the act as underway.</p>
<A NAME="7416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2703><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;its engravings together.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2704><b>tn</b> This Hebrew noun occurs only here in the OT (see H. R. Cohen, <i>Biblical Hapax Legomena </i>[SBLDS], 49-50).</p>
<A NAME="7418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2705><b>tn</b> This Hebrew noun occurs only here in the OT. An Akkadian cognate refers to a &#8220;pickaxe&#8221; (cf. NEB &#8220;hatchet and pick&#8221;; NIV &#8220;axes and hatchets&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;hatchets and hammers&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="7419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2706><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to the ground they desecrate the dwelling place of your name.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2707><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in their heart.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2708><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[?] altogether.&#8221; The Hebrew form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1504;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ninam</font>) is problematic. It could be understood as the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nin</font>, &#8220;offspring&#8221;) but the statement &#8220;their offspring altogether&#8221; would make no sense here. C. A. Briggs and E. G. Briggs (<i>Psalms </i>[ICC], 2:159) emends <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yakhad</font>, &#8220;altogether&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yakhid</font>, &#8220;alone&#8221;) and translate &#8220;let their offspring be solitary&#8221; (i.e., exiled). Another option is to understand the form as a Qal imperfect first common plural from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yanah</font>, &#8220;to oppress&#8221;) with a third masculine plural pronominal suffix, &#8220;we will oppress them.&#8221; However, this verb, when used in the finite form, always appears in the Hiphil. Therefore, it is preferable to emend the form to the Hiphil <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1461;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nonem</font>, &#8220;we will oppress them&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="7422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2709><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they burn down all the meeting places of God in the land.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2710><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;our signs we do not see.&#8221; Because of the reference to a prophet in the next line, it is likely that the &#8220;signs&#8221; in view here include the evidence of God&#8217;s presence as typically revealed through the prophets. These could include miraculous acts performed by the prophets (see, for example, Isa 38:7-8) or object lessons which they acted out (see, for example, Isa 20:3).</p>
<A NAME="7424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2711><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;there is not still a prophet.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2712><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and [there is] not with us one who knows how long.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7426"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2713><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Why do you draw back your hand, even your right hand? From the midst of your chest, destroy!&#8221; The psalmist pictures God as having placed his right hand (symbolic of activity and strength) inside his robe against his chest. He prays that God would pull his hand out from under his robe and use it to destroy the enemy.</p>
<A NAME="7427"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2714><b>tn</b> The psalmist speaks as Israel&#8217;s representative here.</p>
<A NAME="7428"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2715><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the midst of the earth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7429"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2716><b>tn</b> The derivation and meaning of the Polel verb form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">porarta</font>) are uncertain. The form may be related to an Akkadian cognate meaning &#8220;break, shatter,&#8221; though the biblical Hebrew cognate of this verb always appears in the Hiphil or Hophal stem. BDB 830 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1512;</font> suggests a homonym here, meaning &#8220;to split; to divide.&#8221; A Hitpolel form of a root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">parar</font>) appears in Isa 24:19 with the meaning &#8220;to shake violently.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7430"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2717><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has the plural form, &#8220;sea monsters&#8221; (cf. NRSV &#8220;dragons&#8221;), but it is likely that an original enclitic <i>mem</i> has been misunderstood as a plural ending. The imagery of the mythological sea monster is utilized here. See the note on &#8220;Leviathan&#8221; in v. 14.</p>
<A NAME="7431"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2718><b>sn</b> <i>You crushed the heads of Leviathan</i>. The imagery of vv. 13-14 originates in West Semitic mythology. The description of Leviathan should be compared with the following excerpts from Ugaritic mythological texts: (1) &#8220;Was not the dragon [Ugaritic <font face="Scholar">tnn</font>, cognate with Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tanin</font>), translated &#8220;sea monster&#8221; in v. 13] vanquished and captured? I did destroy the wriggling [Ugaritic &#8217;<font face="Scholar">qltn</font>, cognate to Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1511;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aqallaton</font>), translated &#8220;squirming&#8221; in Isa 27:1] serpent, the tyrant with seven heads&#8221; (note the use of the plural &#8220;heads&#8221; here and in v. 13). (See <i>CTA</i> 3.iii.38-39 in G. R. Driver, <i>Canaanite Myths and Legends</i>, 50.) (2) &#8220;For all that you smote Leviathan the slippery [Ugaritic<i> </i><font face="Scholar">brh</font>, cognate to Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bariakh</font>), translated &#8220;fast moving&#8221; in Isa 27:1] serpent, [and] made an end of the wriggling serpent, the tyrant with seven heads&#8221; (See <i>CTA</i> 5.i.1-3 in G. R. Driver, <i>Canaanite Myths and Legends</i>, 68.) In the myths Leviathan is a sea creature that symbolizes the destructive water of the sea and, in turn, the forces of chaos that threaten the established order. In the OT, the battle with the sea motif is applied to Yahweh&#8217;s victories over the forces of chaos at creation and in history (see Pss 74:13-14; 77:16-20; 89:9-10; Isa 51:9-10). Yahweh&#8217;s subjugation of the waters of chaos is related to his kingship (see Pss 29:3, 10; 93:3-4). Isa 27:1 applies imagery from Canaanite mythology to Yahweh&#8217;s eschatological victory over his enemies. Apocalyptic literature employs the imagery as well. The beasts of Dan 7 emerge from the sea, while Rev 13 speaks of a seven-headed beast coming from the sea. Here in Ps 74:13-14 the primary referent is unclear. The psalmist may be describing God&#8217;s creation of the world (note vv. 16-17 and see Ps 89:9-12), when he brought order out of a watery mass, or the exodus (see Isa 51:9-10), when he created Israel by destroying the Egyptians in the waters of the sea.</p>
<A NAME="7432"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2719><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal form is understood as a preterite in this narrational context.</p>
<A NAME="7433"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2720><b>sn</b> <i>You fed him to the people</i>. This pictures the fragments of Leviathan&#8217;s dead corpse washing up on shore and being devoured by those who find them. If the exodus is in view, then it may allude to the bodies of the dead Egyptians which washed up on the shore of the Red Sea (see Exod 14:30).</p>
<A NAME="7434"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2721><b>sn</b> <i>You broke open the spring and the stream</i>. Perhaps this alludes to the way in which God provided water for the Israelites as they traveled in the wilderness following the exodus (see Ps 78:15-16, 20; 105:41).</p>
<A NAME="7435"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2722><b>sn</b> <i>Perpetually flowing rivers</i> are rivers that contain water year round, unlike the seasonal streams that flow only during the rainy season. Perhaps the psalmist here alludes to the drying up of the Jordan River when the Israelites entered the land of Canaan under Joshua (see Josh 3-4).</p>
<A NAME="7436"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2723><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;To you [is] day, also to you [is] night.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7437"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2724><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[the] light.&#8221; Following the reference to &#8220;day and night&#8221; and in combination with &#8220;sun,&#8221; it is likely that the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ma</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">or</font>, &#8220;light&#8221;) refers here to the moon.</p>
<A NAME="7438"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2725><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you established [the] light and [the] sun.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7439"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2726><b>tn</b> This would appear to refer to geographical boundaries, such as mountains, rivers, and seacoasts. However, since the day-night cycle has just been mentioned (v. 16) and the next line speaks of the seasons, it is possible that &#8220;boundaries&#8221; here refers to the divisions of the seasons. See C. A. Briggs and E. G. Briggs, <i>Psalms </i>(ICC), 2:156.</p>
<A NAME="7440"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=2727><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;summer and winter, you, you formed them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7441"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=2728><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;remember this.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7442"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=2729><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;[how] the enemy insults the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="7443"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2730><b>sn</b> <i>Your dove</i>. The psalmist compares weak and vulnerable Israel to a helpless dove.</p>
<A NAME="7444"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=2731><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;do not forget forever.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7445"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=2732><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;look at the covenant.&#8221; The LXX reads &#8220;your covenant,&#8221; which seems to assume a second person pronominal suffix. The suffix may have been accidentally omitted by haplography. Note that the following word (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font>) begins with <i>kaf</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;</font>).</p>
<A NAME="7446"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=2733><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for the dark places of the earth are full of dwelling places of violence.&#8221; The &#8220;dark regions&#8221; are probably the lands where the people have been exiled (see C. A. Briggs and E. G. Briggs, <i>Psalms </i>[ICC], 2:157). In some contexts &#8220;dark regions&#8221; refers to Sheol (Ps 88:6) or to hiding places likened to Sheol (Ps 143:3; Lam 3:6).</p>
<A NAME="7447"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=2734><b>sn</b> <i>Let the oppressed and poor praise your name!</i> The statement is metonymic. The point is this: May the oppressed be delivered from their enemies! Then they will have ample reason to praise God&#8217;s name.</p>
<A NAME="7448"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=2735><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;defend your cause.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7449"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=2736><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;remember your reproach from a fool all the day.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="7452"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=2739><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the roar of those who rise up against you, which ascends continually.&#8221;</p>
