<A NAME="871"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=3134><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 87</i>. The psalmist celebrates the Lord&#8217;s presence in Zion and the special status of its citizens.</p>
<A NAME="872"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=3135><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his foundation [is] in the hills of holiness.&#8221; The expression &#8220;his foundation&#8221; refers here by metonymy to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s dwelling place in Zion. The &#8220;hills&#8221; are the ones surrounding Zion (see Pss 125:2; 133:3).</p>
<A NAME="873"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3136><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;glorious things are spoken about you.&#8221; The translation assumes this is a general reference to compliments paid to Zion by those who live within her walls and by those who live in the surrounding areas and lands. Another option is that this refers to a prophetic oracle about the city&#8217;s glorious future. In this case one could translate, &#8220;wonderful things are announced concerning you.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="874"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=3137><b>sn</b> &#8220;<i>Rahab</i>,&#8221; which means &#8220;proud one,&#8221; is used here as a title for Egypt (see Isa 30:7).</p>
<A NAME="875"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=3138><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to those who know me&#8221; (see Ps 36:10). Apparently the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> speaks here. The verbal construction (the Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">zakhar</font>, &#8220;remember&#8221; followed by the preposition -<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font> [<font face="Scholar">le</font>] with a substantive) is rare, but the prepositional phrase is best understood as indicating the recipient of the announcement (see Jer 4:16). Some take the preposition in the sense of &#8220;among&#8221; and translate, &#8220;among those who know me&#8221; (cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV). In this case these foreigners are viewed as the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s people and the psalm is interpreted as anticipating a time when all nations will worship the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> (see Ps 86:9) and be considered citizens of Zion.</p>
<A NAME="876"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=3139><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Look.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="877"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=3140><b>map</b> For location see Map1-A2; Map2-G2; Map4-A1; JP3-F3; JP4-F3.</p>
<A NAME="878"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=3141><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Cush.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="879"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=3142><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and this one was born there.&#8221; The words &#8220;It is said of them&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text, but are supplied for clarification and stylistic purposes (see v. 5). Those advocating the universalistic interpretation understand &#8220;there&#8221; as referring to Zion, but it seems more likely that the adverb refers to the nations just mentioned. The foreigners are identified by their native lands.</p>
<A NAME="8710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=3143><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and of Zion it is said.&#8221; Another option is to translate, &#8220;and to Zion it is said.&#8221; In collocation with the Niphal of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amar</font>), the preposition <i>lamed</i> (-<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font>) can introduce the recipient of the statement (see Josh 2:2; Jer 4:11; Hos 1:10; Zeph 3:16), carry the nuance &#8220;concerning, of&#8221; (see Num 23:23), or mean &#8220;be named&#8221; (see Isa 4:3; 62:4).</p>
<A NAME="8711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=3144><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a man and a man.&#8221; The idiom also appears in Esth 1:8. The translation assumes that the phrase refers to each of Zion&#8217;s residents, in contrast to the foreigners mentioned in v. 4. Those advocating the universalistic interpretation understand this as a reference to each of the nations, including those mentioned in v. 4.</p>
<A NAME="8712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=3145><b>tn</b> Traditionally &#8220;Most High.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="8713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=3146><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he makes her secure, the Most High.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="8714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=3147><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> records in the writing of the nations.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="8715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=3148><b>tn</b> As noted in v. 4, the translation assumes a contrast between &#8220;there&#8221; (the various foreign lands) and &#8220;in her&#8221; (Zion). In contrast to foreigners, the citizens of Zion have special status because of their birthplace (v. 5). In this case vv. 4 and 6 form a structural frame around v. 5.</p>
<A NAME="8716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=3149><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and singers, like pipers, all my springs [are] in you.&#8221; The participial form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1500;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kholÿlim</font>) appears to be from a denominative verb meaning &#8220;play the pipe,&#8221; though some derive the form from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khul</font>, &#8220;dance&#8221;). In this case the duplicated <i>lamed</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font>) requires an emendation to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1495;&#1465;&#1500;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿkholÿlim</font>, &#8220;a Polel form). The words are addressed to Zion. As it stands, the Hebrew text makes little, if any, sense. &#8220;Springs&#8221; are often taken here as a symbol of divine blessing and life&#8221;), but this reading does not relate to the preceding line in any apparent way. The present translation assumes an emendation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kol-ma</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">yanay</font>, &#8220;all my springs&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1467;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501; &#1506;&#1464;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kullam </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anu</font>, &#8220;all of them sing,&#8221; with the form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</font> being derived from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">anah</font>, &#8220;sing&#8221;).</p>
