<A NAME="43"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=94><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in distress (or &#8220;a narrow place&#8221;) you make (a place) large for me.&#8221; The function of the Hebrew perfect verbal form here is uncertain. The translation above assumes that the psalmist is expressing his certitude and confidence that God will intervene. The psalmist is so confident of God&#8217;s positive response to his prayer, he can describe God&#8217;s deliverance as if it had already happened. Such confidence is consistent with the mood of the psalm (vv. 3, 8). Another option is to take the perfects as precative, expressing a wish or request (&#8220;lead me&#8221;). See <i>IBHS</i> 494-95 §30.5.4c, d. However, not all grammarians are convinced that the perfect is used as a precative in biblical Hebrew.</p>
