<A NAME="410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=101><b>tn</b> Heb &#8220;a lie.&#8221; Some see the metonymic language of v. 2b (&#8220;emptiness, lie&#8221;) as referring to idols or false gods. However, there is no solid immediate contextual evidence for such an interpretation. It is more likely that the psalmist addresses those who threaten him (see v. 1) and refers in a general way to their sinful lifestyle. (See R. Mosis, <i>TDOT</i> 7:121.) The two terms allude to the fact that sinful behavior is ultimately fruitless and self-destructive.</p>
