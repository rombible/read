<A NAME="485"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1753><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Mount Zion, the peaks of Zaphon.&#8221; Like all the preceding phrases in v. 2, both phrases are appositional to &#8220;city of our God, his holy hill&#8221; in v. 1, suggesting an identification in the poet&#8217;s mind between Mount Zion and Zaphon. &#8220;Zaphon&#8221; usually refers to the &#8220;north&#8221; in a general sense (see Pss 89:12; 107:3), but here, where it is collocated with &#8220;peaks,&#8221; it refers specifically to Mount Zaphon, located in the vicinity of ancient Ugarit and viewed as the mountain where the gods assembled (see Isa 14:13). By alluding to West Semitic mythology in this way, the psalm affirms that Mount Zion is the real divine mountain, for it is here that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God of Israel lives and rules over the nations. See P. Craigie, <i>Psalms 1-50</i> (WBC), 353, and T. N. D. Mettinger, <i>In Search of God</i>, 103.</p>
