<A NAME="4814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1762><b>tn</b> The switch to the imperfect, as well as the introduction of the ship metaphor, perhaps signals a change to a generalizing tone; the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> typically shatters these large ships, symbolic of the human strength of hostile armies (see the following note on &#8220;large ships&#8221;). The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shavar</font>, &#8220;break&#8221;) appears in the Piel here (see Pss 29:5; 46:9). In the OT it occurs thirty-six times in the Piel, always with multiple objects (the object is either a collective singular or grammatically plural or dual form). The Piel may highlight the repetition of the pluralative action, or it may suggest an intensification of action, indicating repeated action comprising a whole, perhaps with the nuance &#8220;break again and again, break in pieces.&#8221; Another option is to understand the form as resultative: &#8220;make broken&#8221; (see <i>IBHS</i> 404-7 §24.3).</p>
