<A NAME="488"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1756><b>tn</b> The perfect verbal forms in vv. 4-6 are understood as descriptive. In dramatic style (note <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>, &#8220;look&#8221;) the psalm describes an enemy attack against the city as if it were occurring at this very moment. Another option is to take the perfects as narrational (&#8220;the kings assembled, they advanced&#8221;), referring to a particular historical event, such as Sennacherib&#8217;s siege of the city in 701 <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span> (cf. NIV, NRSV). Even if one translates the verses in a dramatic-descriptive manner (as the present translation does), the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s victory over the Assyrians was probably what served as the inspiration of the description (see v. 8).</p>
