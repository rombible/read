<A NAME="991"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=3446><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 99</i>. The psalmist celebrates the Lord&#8217;s just rule and recalls how he revealed himself to Israel&#8217;s leaders.</p>
<A NAME="992"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=3447><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal forms in v. 1 are understood here as indicating the nations&#8217; characteristic response to the reality of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s kingship. Another option is to take them as jussives: &#8220;let the nations tremble&#8230;let the earth shake!&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="993"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3448><b>sn</b> <i>Winged angels </i>(<i>Heb</i> &#8220;cherubs&#8221;). Cherubs, as depicted in the OT, possess both human and animal (lion, ox, and eagle) characteristics (see Ezek 1:10; 10:14, 21; 41:18). They are pictured as winged creatures (Exod 25:20; 37:9; 1 Kgs 6:24-27; Ezek 10:8, 19) and serve as the very throne of God when the ark of the covenant is in view (Ps 99:1; see Num 7:89; 1 Sam 4:4; 2 Sam 6:2; 2 Kgs 19:15). The picture of the Lord seated on the cherubs suggests they might be used by him as a vehicle, a function they carry out in Ezek 1:22-28 (the &#8220;living creatures&#8221; mentioned here are identified as cherubs in Ezek 10:20). In Ps 18:10 the image of a cherub serves to personify the wind.</p>
<A NAME="994"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=3449><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nut</font>) occurs only here in the OT, but the meaning can be determined on the basis of the parallelism with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1494;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ragaz</font>, &#8220;tremble&#8221;) and evidence from the cognate languages (see H. R. Cohen, <i>Biblical Hapax Legomena </i>[SBLDS], 121).</p>
<A NAME="995"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=3450><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;great.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="996"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=3451><b>tn</b> The pronoun refers to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> himself (see vv. 5, 9).</p>
<A NAME="997"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=3452><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and strength, a king, justice he loves.&#8221; The syntax of the Hebrew text is difficult here. The translation assumes that two affirmations are made about the king, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> (see v. 1, and Ps 98:6). The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1465;&#1494;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">oz</font>, &#8220;strength&#8221;) should probably be revocalized as the adjective <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1494;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">az</font>, &#8220;strong&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="998"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=3453><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you establish fairness.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="999"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=3454><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;exalt.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="9910"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=3455><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;bow down.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="9911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=3456><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;among those who called on his name.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="9912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=3457><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;those who.&#8221; The participle is in apposition to the phrase &#8220;those who called on his name&#8221; in the preceding line.</p>
<A NAME="9913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=3458><b>sn</b> <i>A pillar of cloud</i>. The psalmist refers to the reality described in Exod 33:9-10; Num 12:5; and Deut 31:15.</p>
<A NAME="9914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=3459><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a God of lifting up [i.e., forgiveness] you were to them, and an avenger concerning their deeds.&#8221; The present translation reflects the traditional interpretation, which understands the last line as qualifying the preceding one. God forgave Moses and Aaron, but he also disciplined them when they sinned (cf. NIV, NRSV). Another option is to take &#8220;their deeds&#8221; as referring to harmful deeds directed against Moses and Aaron. In this case the verse may be translated, &#8220;and one who avenged attacks against them.&#8221; Still another option is to emend the participial form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1465;&#1511;&#1461;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">noqem</font>, &#8220;an avenger&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1465;&#1511;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">noqam</font>), a rare Qal participial form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">naqah</font>, &#8220;purify&#8221;) with a suffixed pronoun. In this case one could translate, &#8220;and one who purified them from their [sinful] deeds&#8221; (cf. NEB &#8220;and held them innocent&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="9915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=3460><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;exalt.&#8221;</p>
