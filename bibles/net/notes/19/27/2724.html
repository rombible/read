<A NAME="2724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=972><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;concerning you my heart says, &#8216;Seek my face.&#8217;&#8221; The verb form &#8220;seek&#8221; is plural, but this makes no sense here, for the psalmist is addressed. The verb should be emended to a singular form. The first person pronominal suffix on &#8220;face&#8221; also makes little sense, unless it is the voice of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> he hears. His &#8220;heart&#8221; is viewed as speaking, however, so it is better to emend the form to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">panayv</font>, &#8220;his face&#8221;).</p>
