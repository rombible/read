<A NAME="2734"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=982><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for they have risen up against me, lying witnesses and a testifier of violence.&#8221; The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1508;&#1461;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yafeakh</font>) is traditionally understood as a verb meaning &#8220;snort, breathe out&#8221;: &#8220;for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty&#8221; (KJV; cf. BDB 422 s.v.). A better option is to take the form as a noun meaning &#8220;a witness&#8221; (or &#8220;testifier&#8221;). See Prov 6:19; 12:17; 14:5, 25; 19:5, 9, and Hab 2:3.</p>
