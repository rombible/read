<A NAME="11831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=4025><b>sn</b> A petition for deliverance and <i>success </i>seems odd in a psalm thanking God for deliverance, but it is not unique (see Ps 9:19-20). The people ask God to continue to intervene for them as he has for the psalmist.</p>
