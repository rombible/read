<A NAME="11835"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=4029><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he has given us light.&#8221; This may be an elliptical expression, with &#8220;his face&#8221; being implied as the object (see Num 6:25; Pss 31:16; 67:1; 80:3, 7, 19). In this case, &#8220;his face has given us light&#8221; = &#8220;he has smiled on us,&#8221; or &#8220;he has shown us his favor.&#8221; Another option (the one reflected in the translation) is that &#8220;light&#8221; here symbolizes divine blessing in the form of deliverance. &#8220;Light&#8221; is often used as a metaphor for deliverance and the life/blessings it brings. See Pss 37:6; 97:11; 112:4; Isa 49:6; 51:4; Mic 7:8. Some prefer to repoint the form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">er</font>; <i>vav</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>] conjunctive + jussive) and translate the statement as a prayer, &#8220;may he give us light.&#8221;</p>
