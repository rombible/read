<A NAME="11814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=4008><b>tn</b> Traditionally the verb has been derived from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mul</font>, &#8220;to circumcise&#8221;) and translated &#8220;[I] cut [them] off&#8221; (see BDB 557-58 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</font>). However, it is likely that this is a homonym meaning &#8220;to fend off&#8221; (see <i>HALOT</i> 556 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1500;</font>) or &#8220;to push away.&#8221; In this context, where the psalmist is reporting his past experience, the prefixed verbal form is best understood as a preterite. The phrase also occurs in vv. 11, 12.</p>
