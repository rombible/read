<A NAME="11817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=4011><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;pushing, you pushed me.&#8221; The infinitive absolute emphasizes the following verbal idea. The psalmist appears to address the nations as if they were an individual enemy. Some find this problematic and emend the verb form (which is a Qal perfect second masculine singular with a first person singular suffix) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1495;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nidkheti</font>), a Niphal perfect first common singular, &#8220;I was pushed.&#8221;</p>
