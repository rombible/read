<A NAME="11811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=4005><b>tn</b> &#8220;Taking shelter&#8221; in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is an idiom for seeking his protection. Seeking his protection presupposes and even demonstrates the subject&#8217;s loyalty to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. In the psalms those who &#8220;take shelter&#8221; in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> are contrasted with the wicked and equated with those who love, fear, and serve the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> (Pss 5:11-12; 31:17-20; 34:21-22).</p>
