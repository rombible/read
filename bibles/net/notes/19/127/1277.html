<A NAME="1277"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=4339><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he gives to his beloved, sleep.&#8221; The translation assumes that the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1504;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shena</font>&#8217;, &#8220;sleep,&#8221; an alternate form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shenah</font>) is an adverbial accusative. The point seems to be this: Hard work by itself is not what counts, but one&#8217;s relationship to God, for God is able to bless an individual even while he sleeps. (There may even be a subtle allusion to the miracle of conception following sexual intercourse; see the reference to the gift of sons in the following verse.) The statement is not advocating laziness, but utilizing hyperbole to give perspective and to remind the addressees that God must be one&#8217;s first priority. Another option is to take &#8220;sleep&#8221; as the direct object: &#8220;yes, he gives sleep to his beloved&#8221; (cf. NIV, NRSV). In this case the point is this: Hard work by itself is futile, for only God is able to bless one with sleep, which metonymically refers to having one&#8217;s needs met. He blesses on the basis of one&#8217;s relationship to him, not on the basis of physical energy expended.</p>
