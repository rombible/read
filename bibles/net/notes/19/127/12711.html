<A NAME="12711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=4343><b>tn</b> Being &#8220;put to shame&#8221; is here metonymic for being defeated, probably in a legal context, as the reference to the city gate suggests. One could be humiliated (Ps 69:12) or deprived of justice (Amos 5:12) at the gate, but with strong sons to defend the family interests this was less likely to happen.</p>
