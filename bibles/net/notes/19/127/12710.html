<A NAME="12710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=4342><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;like arrows in the hand of a warrior, so [are] sons of youth.&#8221; Arrows are used in combat to defend oneself against enemies; sons are viewed here as providing social security and protection (see v. 5). The phrase &#8220;sons of youth&#8221; is elliptical, meaning &#8220;sons [born during the father&#8217;s] youth.&#8221; Such sons will have grown up to be mature adults and will have children of their own by the time the father reaches old age and becomes vulnerable to enemies. Contrast the phrase &#8220;son of old age&#8221; in Gen 37:3 (see also 44:20), which refers to Jacob&#8217;s age when Joseph was born.</p>
