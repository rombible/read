<A NAME="1331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=4424><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 133</i>. The psalmist affirms the benefits of family unity.</p>
<A NAME="1332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=4425><b>sn</b> The precise significance of this title, which appears in Pss 120-134, is unclear. Perhaps worshipers recited these psalms when they ascended the road to Jerusalem to celebrate annual religious festivals. For a discussion of their background see L. C. Allen, <i>Psalms 101-150 </i>(WBC), 219-21.</p>
<A NAME="1333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=4426><b>sn</b> This statement refers to the extended family structure of ancient Israel, where <i>brothers</i> would often live in proximity to one another (Deut 25:5), giving the family greater social prominence and security. However, in its later application in the Israelite cult it probably envisions unity within the covenant community. See L. C. Allen, <i>Psalms 101-150 </i>(WBC), 212-15.</p>
<A NAME="1334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4427><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[it is] like the good oil on the head, going down on the beard.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=4428><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;which goes down in accordance with his measured things.&#8221; The Hebrew phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">middotayv</font>, &#8220;his measured things&#8221;) refers here to the robes worn by Aaron. <i>HALOT</i> 546 s.v. *<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1491;</font> derives the form from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">midah</font>, &#8220;robe&#8221;) rather than <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">middah</font>, &#8220;measured thing&#8221;). Ugaritic <font face="Scholar">md</font> means &#8220;robe&#8221; and is pluralized <font face="Scholar">mdt</font>.</p>
<A NAME="1336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=4429><b>sn</b> <i>Hermon</i> refers to Mount Hermon, located north of Israel.</p>
<A NAME="1337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=4430><b>sn</b> The <i>hills of Zion</i> are those surrounding Zion (see Pss 87:1; 125:2). The psalmist does not intend to suggest that the dew from Mt. Hermon in the distant north actually flows down upon Zion. His point is that the same kind of heavy dew that replenishes Hermon may also be seen on Zion&#8217;s hills. See A. Cohen, <i>Psalms</i> (SoBB), 439. &#8220;Dew&#8221; here symbolizes divine blessing, as the next line suggests.</p>
<A NAME="1338"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=4431><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;for.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=4432><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;there the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has commanded the blessing, life forever.&#8221;</p>
