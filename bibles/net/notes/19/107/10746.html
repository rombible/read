<A NAME="10746"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=3776><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;As for his people&#8221; are not included in the Hebrew text, but have been supplied in the translation for the sake of clarity. The psalmist contrasts God&#8217;s judgment on his enemies with his blessing of his people. See the note on the word &#8220;enemies&#8221; in v. 39 for further discussion.</p>
