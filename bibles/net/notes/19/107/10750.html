<A NAME="10750"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=3780><b>tn</b> &#8220;Bless&#8221; here carries the nuance &#8220;endue with sexual potency, make fertile.&#8221; See Gen 1:28, where the statement &#8220;he blessed them&#8221; directly precedes the command &#8220;be fruitful and populate the earth&#8221; (see also 1:22). The verb &#8220;bless&#8221; carries this same nuance in Gen 17:16 (where God&#8217;s blessing of Sarai imparts to her the capacity to bear a child); 48:16 (where God&#8217;s blessing of Joseph&#8217;s sons is closely associated with their having numerous descendants); and Deut 7:13 (where God&#8217;s blessing is associated with fertility in general, including numerous descendants). See also Gen 49:25 (where Jacob uses the noun derivative in referring to &#8220;blessings of the breast and womb,&#8221; an obvious reference to fertility) and Gen 27:27 (where the verb is used of a field to which God has given the capacity to produce vegetation).</p>
