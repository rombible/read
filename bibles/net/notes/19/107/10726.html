<A NAME="10726"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=3756><b>sn</b> Verses 23-30, which depict the Lord rescuing sailors from a storm at sea, do not seem to describe the exiles&#8217; situation, unless the word picture is metaphorical. Perhaps the psalmist here broadens his scope and offers an example of God&#8217;s kindness to the needy beyond the covenant community.</p>
