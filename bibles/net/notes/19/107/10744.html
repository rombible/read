(The use of prefixed forms with <i>vav</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>] consecutive in vv. 36-37 favor this.) The psalmist may return to the theme of God&#8217;s intervention for the exiles (see vv. 4-22, especially vv. 4-9). However, many regard vv. 33-41 as a hymnic description which generalizes about God&#8217;s activities among men. In this case it would be preferable to use the English present tense throughout (cf. NEB, NRSV).</p>
