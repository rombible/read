<A NAME="7134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2569><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;increase my greatness.&#8221; The prefixed verbal form is distinctly jussive, indicating this is a prayer or wish. The psalmist&#8217;s request for &#8220;greatness&#8221; (or &#8220;honor&#8221;) is not a boastful, self-serving prayer for prominence, but, rather, a request that God would vindicate by elevating him over those who are trying to humiliate him.</p>
