<A NAME="7137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2572><b>sn</b> The basic sense of the word &#8220;holy&#8221; is &#8220;set apart from that which is commonplace, special, unique.&#8221; The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s holiness is first and foremost his transcendent sovereignty as the ruler of the world. He is &#8220;set apart&#8221; from the world over which he rules. At the same time his holiness encompasses his moral authority, which derives from his royal position. As king he has the right to dictate to his subjects how they are to live; indeed his very own character sets the standard for proper behavior.</p>
