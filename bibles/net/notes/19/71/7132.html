<A NAME="7132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2567><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you return, you give me life.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shuv</font>, &#8220;return&#8221;) is used here in an adverbial sense, indicating repetition of the action described by the following verb. The imperfects are understood here as expressing the psalmist&#8217;s prayer or wish. (Note the use of a distinctly jussive form at the beginning of v. 21.) Another option is to understand this as a statement of confidence, &#8220;you will revive me once again&#8221; (cf. NIV, NRSV).</p>
