<A NAME="4017"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1458><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sacrifice and offering you do not desire.&#8221; The statement is exaggerated for the sake of emphasis (see Ps 51:16 as well). God is pleased with sacrifices, but his first priority is obedience and loyalty (see 1 Sam 15:22). Sacrifices and offerings apart from genuine allegiance are meaningless (see Isa 1:11-20).</p>
