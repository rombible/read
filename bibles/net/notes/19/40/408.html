<A NAME="408"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1449><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;may many see and fear and trust in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.&#8221; The translation assumes that the initial prefixed verbal form is a jussive (&#8220;may many see&#8221;), rather than an imperfect (&#8220;many will see&#8221;). The following prefixed verbal forms with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) conjunctive are taken as indicating purpose or result (&#8220;so that they might swear allegiance&#8230;and trust&#8221;) after the introductory jussive.</p>
