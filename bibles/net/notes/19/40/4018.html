<A NAME="4018"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1459><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;ears you hollowed out for me.&#8221; The meaning of this odd expression is debated (this is the only collocation of &#8220;hollowed out&#8221; and &#8220;ears&#8221; in the OT). It may have been an idiomatic expression referring to making a point clear to a listener. The LXX has &#8220;but a body you have prepared for me,&#8221; a reading which is followed in Heb 10:5.</p>
