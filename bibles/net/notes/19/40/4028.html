<A NAME="4028"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1469><b>tn</b> In this line the psalmist makes the transition from confidence to petition (see v. 13). Since the prefixed verbal form in the preceding line is imperfect/indicative, one could take the verb in this line as imperfect as well and translate, &#8220;your loyal love and faithfulness continually protect me&#8221; (cf. NEB). However, the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) at the beginning of the next verse, if causal (&#8220;because&#8221;), is best understood as introducing a motivating argument in support of a petition. For this reason v. 11b is best taken as a prayer with the prefixed form being understood as jussive (cf. NIV, NRSV). For parallels to the proposed construction (jussive followed by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> + perfect introducing motivating argument), see Ps 25:21, as well as Pss 10:2-3; 22:8.</p>
