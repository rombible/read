<A NAME="4016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1457><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will declare and I will speak, they are too numerous to recount.&#8221; The present translation assumes that the cohortatives are used in a hypothetical manner in a formally unmarked conditional sentence, &#8220;Should I try to declare [them] and speak [of them]&#8230;&#8221; (cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV). For other examples of cohortatives in the protasis (&#8220;if&#8221; clause) of a conditional sentence, see GKC 320 §108.<i>e</i>. (It should be noted, however, that <i>GKC</i> understands this particular verse in a different manner. See GKC 320 §108.<i>f</i>, where it is suggested that the cohortatives are part of an apodosis with the protasis being suppressed.) Another option is to take the cohortatives as a declaration of the psalmist&#8217;s resolve to announce the truth expressed in the next line. In this case one might translate: &#8220;I will declare and speak [the truth]: They are too numerous to recount.&#8221;</p>
