Peter goes on to argue that David, being a prophet, foresaw future events and spoke of Jesus&#8217; resurrection from the dead (Acts 2:30-33). Paul seems to concur with Peter in this understanding (see Acts 13:35-37). For a discussion of the NT application of these verses to Jesus&#8217; resurrection, see R. B. Chisholm, Jr., &#8220;A Theology of the Psalms,&#8221; <i>A Biblical Theology of the Old Testament</i>, 292-95.</p>
