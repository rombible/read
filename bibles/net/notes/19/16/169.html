<A NAME="169"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=475><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;O <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the portion of my possession and my cup&#8221;; or &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> [is] the portion of my possession and my cup.&#8221; The psalmist compares the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> to landed property, which was foundational to economic stability in ancient Israel, and to a cup of wine, which may symbolize a reward (in Ps 11:6 it symbolizes the judgment one deserves) or divine blessing (see Ps 23:5). The metaphor highlights the fact that God is the psalmist&#8217;s source of security and prosperity.</p>
