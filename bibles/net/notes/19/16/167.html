However, if we emend <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1495;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akher</font>, &#8220;another&#8221;) to the plural <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1495;&#1461;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akherim</font>, &#8220;other [gods]&#8221;) in v. 4, the suffix can be understood as referring to these gods &#8211; &#8220;the drink offerings [made to] them.&#8221; The next line favors this interpretation. Perhaps this refers to some type of pagan cultic ritual. Elsewhere wine is the prescribed content of drink offerings.</p>
