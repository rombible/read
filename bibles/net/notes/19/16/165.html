<A NAME="165"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=471><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;regarding the holy ones who [are] in the land, they; and the mighty [ones] in [whom is/was] all my desire.&#8221; The difficult syntax makes the meaning of the verse uncertain. The phrase &#8220;holy ones&#8221; sometimes refers to God&#8217;s angelic assembly (see Ps 89:5, 7), but the qualifying clause &#8220;who are in the land&#8221; suggests that here it refers to God&#8217;s people (Ps 34:9) or to their priestly leaders (2 Chr 35:3).</p>
