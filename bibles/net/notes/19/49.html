<A NAME="491"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1779><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 49</i>. In this so-called wisdom psalm (see v. 3) the psalmist states that he will not fear the rich enemies who threaten him, for despite their wealth, they are mere men who will die like everyone else. The psalmist is confident the Lord will vindicate the godly and protect them from the attacks of their oppressors.</p>
<A NAME="492"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1780><b>tn</b> The rare noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1500;&#1462;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kheled</font>, &#8220;world&#8221;) occurs in Ps 17:14 and perhaps also in Isa 38:11 (see the note on &#8220;world&#8221; there).</p>
<A NAME="493"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1781><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;even the sons of mankind, even the sons of man.&#8221; Because of the parallel line, where &#8220;rich and poor&#8221; are mentioned, some treat these expressions as polar opposites, with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497; &#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿney </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adam</font>) referring to the lower classes and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497; &#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿney </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ish</font>) to higher classes (cf. NIV, NRSV). But usage does not support such a view. The rare phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497; &#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (&#8220;sons of man&#8221;) appears to refer to human beings in general in its other uses (see Pss 4:2; 62:9; Lam 3:33). It is better to understand &#8220;even the sons of mankind&#8221; and &#8220;even the sons of man&#8221; as synonymous expressions (cf. NEB &#8220;all mankind, every living man&#8221;). The repetition emphasizes the need for all people to pay attention, for the psalmist&#8217;s message is relevant to everyone.</p>
<A NAME="494"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1782><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my mouth will speak wisdom.&#8221; According to BDB 315 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1499;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> the plural <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1499;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khokhmot</font>, &#8220;wisdom&#8221;) indicates degree or emphasis here.</p>
<A NAME="495"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1783><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the meditation of my heart [i.e., mind] is understanding.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hagut</font>, &#8220;meditation&#8221;), derived from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1490;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hagah</font>, &#8220;to recite quietly; to meditate&#8221;), here refers to thoughts that are verbalized (see the preceding line). The plural form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tÿvunot</font>, &#8220;understanding&#8221;) indicates degree or emphasis (see GKC 397-98 §124.<i>e</i>).</p>
<A NAME="496"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1784><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will turn my ear to a wise saying, I will open [i.e., &#8220;reveal; explain&#8221;] my insightful saying with a harp.&#8221; In the first line the psalmist speaks as a pupil who learns a song of wisdom from a sage. This suggests that the resulting insightful song derives from another source, perhaps God himself. Elsewhere the Hebrew word pair <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font>/<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mashal</font>/<font face="Scholar">khidah</font>) refers to a taunt song (Hab 2:6), a parable (Ezek 17:2), lessons from history (Ps 78:2), and proverbial sayings (Prov 1:6). Here it appears to refer to the insightful song that follows, which reflects on the mortality of humankind and the ultimate inability of riches to prevent the inevitable &#8211; death. Another option is that the word pair refers more specifically to the closely related proverbial sayings of vv. 12, 20 (note the use of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mashal</font>, &#8220;to be like&#8221; in both verses). In this case the psalmist first hears the sayings and then explains (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;opens&#8221;) their significance (see vv. 5-11, 13-19).</p>
<A NAME="497"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1785><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;days of trouble.&#8221; The phrase also occurs in Ps 94:13. The question is rhetorical; there is no reason to be afraid when the rich oppressors threaten the weak (see v. 17). The following verses explain why this is so.</p>
<A NAME="498"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1786><b>tc</b> The MT has, &#8220;the iniquity of my heels surrounds me.&#8221; The clause is best understood as temporal and as elaborating on the preceding phrase &#8220;times of trouble.&#8221; If the MT is retained, the genitive &#8220;of my heels&#8221; would probably indicate location (&#8220;the iniquity at my heels&#8221;); the sinful actions of the rich threaten to overtake the psalmist, as it were. It is better, however, to emend <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1511;&#1461;&#1489;&#1463;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aqivay</font>, &#8220;my heels&#8221;) to either (1) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1511;&#1467;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aqubay</font>, &#8220;my deceitful ones,&#8221; i.e., &#8220;those who deceive me&#8221; [from the adjective <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1511;&#1465;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aqov</font>), &#8220;deceitful,&#8221; see Jer 17:9]) or (2) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1465;&#1511;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">oqÿvay</font>, &#8220;those who deceive me&#8221; [a suffixed active participle from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1489;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">aqav</font>, &#8220;betray, deceive&#8221;]). Origen&#8217;s transliteration of the Hebrew text favors the first of these options. Either of the emendations provides a much smoother transition to v. 6, because &#8220;those who trust in their wealth&#8221; would then be appositional to &#8220;those who deceive me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="499"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1787><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the ones who trust.&#8221; The substantival participle stands in apposition to &#8220;those who deceive me&#8221; (v. 5).</p>
<A NAME="4910"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1788><b>tn</b> The imperfect verbal form emphasizes their characteristic behavior.</p>
<A NAME="4911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1789><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a brother, he surely does not ransom, a man.&#8221; The sequence <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;...&#1488;&#1464;&#1495;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akh</font>...&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ish</font>, &#8220;a brother&#8230;a man&#8221;) is problematic, for the usual combination is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1495;...&#1488;&#1464;&#1495;</font> (&#8220;a brother&#8230;a brother&#8221;) or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;...&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (&#8220;a man&#8230;a man&#8221;). When <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1495;</font> are combined, the usual order is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1495;...&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (&#8220;a man&#8230;a brother&#8221;), with &#8220;brother&#8221; having a third masculine singular suffix, &#8220;his brother.&#8221; This suggests that &#8220;brother&#8221; is the object of the verb and &#8220;man&#8221; the subject. (1) Perhaps the altered word order and absence of the suffix can be explained by the text&#8217;s poetic character, for ellipsis is a feature of Hebrew poetic style. (2) Another option, supported by a few medieval Hebrew <span class="smallcaps">mss</span>, is to emend &#8220;brother&#8221; to the similar sounding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akh</font>, &#8220;surely; but&#8221;) which occurs in v. 15 before the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">padah</font>, &#8220;ransom&#8221;). If this reading is accepted the Qal imperfect <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yifddeh</font>, &#8220;he can [not] ransom&#8221;) would need to be emended to a Niphal (passive) form, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yifadeh</font>, &#8220;he can[not] be ransomed&#8221;) unless one understands the subject of the Qal verb to be indefinite (&#8220;one cannot redeem a man&#8221;). (A Niphal imperfect can be collocated with a Qal infinitive absolute. See GKC 344-45 §113.<i>w</i>.) No matter how one decides the textual issues, the imperfect in this case is modal, indicating potential, and the infinitive absolute emphasizes the statement.</p>
<A NAME="4912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1790><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he cannot pay to God his ransom price.&#8221; Num 35:31 may supply the legal background for the metaphorical language used here. The psalmist pictures God as having a claim on the soul of the individual. When God comes to claim the life that ultimately belongs to him, he demands a ransom price that is beyond the capability of anyone to pay. The psalmist&#8217;s point is that God has ultimate authority over life and death; all the money in the world cannot buy anyone a single day of life beyond what God has decreed.</p>
<A NAME="4913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1791><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;their life.&#8221; Some emend the text to &#8220;his life,&#8221; understanding the antecedent of the pronoun as &#8220;brother&#8221; in v. 7. However, the man and brother of v. 7 are representative of the human race in general, perhaps explaining why a plural pronoun appears in v. 8. Of course, the plural pronoun could refer back to &#8220;the rich&#8221; mentioned in v. 6. Another option (the one assumed in the translation) is that the suffixed <i>mem</i> is enclitic. In this case the &#8220;ransom price for human life&#8221; is referred to an abstract, general way.</p>
<A NAME="4914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1792><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and one ceases forever.&#8221; The translation assumes an indefinite subject which in turn is representative of the entire human race (&#8220;one,&#8221; that refers to human beings without exception). The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khadal</font>, &#8220;cease&#8221;) is understood in the sense of &#8220;come to an end; fail&#8221; (i.e., die). Another option is to translate, &#8220;and one ceases/refrains forever.&#8221; In this case the idea is that the living, convinced of the reality of human mortality, give up all hope of &#8220;buying off&#8221; God and refrain from trying to do so.</p>
<A NAME="4915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1793><b>tn</b> The jussive verbal form with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) conjunctive is taken as indicating purpose/result in relation to the statement made in v. 8. (On this use of the jussive after an imperfect, see GKC 322 §109.<i>f</i>.) In this case v. 8 is understood as a parenthetical comment.</p>
<A NAME="4916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1794><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;see the Pit.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shakhat</font>, &#8220;pit&#8221;) is often used as a title for Sheol (see Pss 16:10; 30:9; 55:24; 103:4).</p>
<A NAME="4917"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1795><b>tn</b> The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) is understood here as asseverative (emphatic).</p>
<A NAME="4918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1796><b>tn</b> The subject of the verb is probably the typical &#8220;man&#8221; mentioned in v. 7. The imperfect can be taken here as generalizing or as indicating potential (&#8220;surely he/one can see&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="4919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1797><b>tn</b> The imperfect verbal forms here and in the next line draw attention to what is characteristically true. The <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive with perfect in the third line carries the same force.</p>
<A NAME="4920"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1798><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;together a fool and a brutish [man] perish.&#8221; The adjective <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ar</font>, &#8220;brutish&#8221;) refers to spiritual insensitivity, not mere lack of intelligence or reasoning ability (see Pss 73:22; 92:6; Prov 12:1; 30:2, as well as the use of the related verb in Ps 94:8).</p>
<A NAME="4921"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1799><b>sn</b> Death shows no respect for anyone. No matter how <i>wise</i> or foolish an individual happens to be, <i>all pass away</i>.</p>
<A NAME="4922"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1800><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;their inward part [is] their houses [are] permanent, their dwelling places for a generation and a generation.&#8221; If one follows the MT, then <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qerev</font>, &#8220;inward part&#8221;) must refer to the seat of these people&#8217;s thoughts (for other examples of this use of the term, see BDB 899 s.v., though BDB prefers an emendation in this passage). In this case all three lines of v. 11 expose these people&#8217;s arrogant assumption that they will last forever, which then stands in sharp contrast to reality as summarized in v. 12. In this case one might translate the first two lines, &#8220;they think that their houses are permanent and that their dwelling places will last forever&#8221; (cf. NASB). Following the lead of several ancient versions, the present translation assumes an emendation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qirbam</font>, &#8220;their inward part&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qÿvarim</font>, &#8220;graves&#8221;). This assumes that the letters <i>bet</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;</font>) and <i>resh</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;</font>) were accidentally transposed in the MT. In this case the first two lines support the point made in v. 10, while the third line of v. 11 stands in contrast to v. 12. The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">olam</font>, &#8220;permanent house&#8221;) is used of a tomb in Eccl 12:5 (as well as in Phoenician tomb inscriptions, see <i>DNWSI</i> 1:160 for a list of texts) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mishkan</font>, &#8220;dwelling place&#8221;) refers to a tomb in Isa 22:16. Cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV.</p>
<A NAME="4923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1801><b>sn</b> Naming <i>their lands after themselves</i> is a claim of possession.</p>
<A NAME="4924"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1802><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;but mankind in honor does not remain.&#8221; The construction <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) + noun at the beginning of the verse can be taken as contrastive in relation to what precedes. The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿqar</font>, &#8220;honor&#8221;) probably refers here to the wealth mentioned in the preceding context. The imperfect verbal form draws attention to what is characteristically true. Some scholars emend <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yalin</font>, &#8220;remains&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yavin</font>, &#8220;understands&#8221;) but this is an unnecessary accommodation to the wording of v. 20.</p>
<A NAME="4925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1803><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;cattle.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1804><b>tn</b> The verb is derived from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">damah</font>, &#8220;cease; destroy&#8221;; BDB 198 s.v.). Another option is to derive the verb from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8220;be silent&#8221;; see <i>HALOT</i> 225 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1502;&#1492;</font>, which sees two homonymic roots [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, &#8220;be silent,&#8221; and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, &#8220;destroy&#8221;] rather than a single root) and translate, &#8220;they are like dumb beasts.&#8221; This makes particularly good sense in v. 20, where the preceding line focuses on mankind&#8217;s lack of understanding.</p>
<A NAME="4927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1805><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;this [is] their way, [there is] folly [belonging] to them.&#8221; The Hebrew term translated &#8220;this&#8221; could refer (1) back to the preceding verse[s] or (2) ahead to the subsequent statements. The translation assumes the latter, since v. 12 appears to be a refrain that concludes the psalm&#8217;s first major section and marks a structural boundary. (A similar refrain [see v. 20] concludes the second half of the psalm.) The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">derekh</font>, &#8220;way&#8221;) often refers to one&#8217;s lifestyle, but, if it relates to what follows, then here it likely refers metonymically to one&#8217;s destiny (the natural outcome of one&#8217;s lifestyle [cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV &#8220;fate&#8221;]). (See the discussion in K. Koch, <i>TDOT</i> 3:285.) If one prefers the more common nuance (&#8220;lifestyle&#8221;), then the term would look back to the self-confident attitude described in the earlier verses.</p>
<A NAME="4928"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1806><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and after them, in their mouth they take delight.&#8221; The meaning of the MT is not entirely clear. &#8220;After them&#8221; is understood here as substantival, &#8220;those who come after them&#8221; or &#8220;those who follow them.&#8221; &#8220;Their mouth&#8221; is taken as a metonymy for the arrogant attitude verbalized by the rich. In the expression &#8220;take delight in,&#8221; the preposition -<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet</font>) introduces the object/cause of one&#8217;s delight (see Pss 147:10; 149:4). So the idea here is that those who come after/follow the rich find the philosophy of life they verbalize and promote to be attractive and desirable.</p>

In this context the psalmist confidently anticipates a day of vindication when the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will deliver the oppressed from the rich (see v. 15) and send the oppressors to Sheol.</p>

The preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">min</font>) prefixed to &#8220;lofty residence&#8221; is understood as privative, &#8220;away from; so as not.&#8221; The preposition -<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lamed</font>) is possessive, while the third person pronominal suffix is understood as a representative singular.</p>

The verse would then read: &#8220;But God will rescue my life; / from the power of Sheol he will certainly deliver me&#8221; (cf. NEB).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> According to some, the psalmist here anticipates the resurrection (or at least an afterlife in God&#8217;s presence). But it is more likely that the psalmist here expresses his hope that God <i>will rescue</i> him from premature death at the hands of the rich oppressors denounced in the psalm. The psalmist is well aware that all (the wise and foolish) die (see vv. 7-12), but he is confident God will lead him safely through the present &#8220;times of trouble&#8221; (v. 5) and sweep the wicked away to their final destiny. The theme is a common one in the so-called wisdom psalms (see Pss 1, 34, 37, 112). For a fuller discussion of the psalmists&#8217; view of the afterlife, see R. B. Chisholm, Jr., &#8220;A Theology of the Psalms,&#8221; <i>A Biblical Theology of the Old Testament</i>, 284-88.</p>
