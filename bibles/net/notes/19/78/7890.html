<A NAME="7890"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">90</span><note=2906><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;like a warrior overcome with wine.&#8221; The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">run</font>, &#8220;overcome&#8221;) occurs only here in the OT. The phrase &#8220;overcome with wine&#8221; could picture a drunken warrior controlled by his emotions and passions (as in the present translation), or it could refer to a warrior who awakes from a drunken stupor.</p>
