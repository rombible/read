<A NAME="7846"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=2862><b>tn</b> One could translate v. 38 in the past tense (&#8220;he was compassionate&#8230;forgave sin and did not destroy&#8230;held back his anger, and did not stir up his fury&#8221;), but the imperfect verbal forms are probably best understood as generalizing. Verse 38 steps back briefly from the narrational summary of Israel&#8217;s history and lays the theological basis for v. 39, which focuses on God&#8217;s mercy toward sinful Israel.</p>
