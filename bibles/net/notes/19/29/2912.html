<A NAME="2912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1025><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal forms with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive here and in v. 6a carry on the descriptive function of the preceding participle (see GKC 329 §111.<i>u</i>). The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shavar</font>) appears in the Qal in the first line of the verse, and in the Piel in the second line. The verb, which means &#8220;break&#8221; in the Qal, appears thirty-six times in the Piel, always with multiple objects (the object is either a collective singular or grammatically plural or dual form). The Piel may highlight the repetition of the pluralative action, or it may suggest an intensification of action, indicating repeated action comprising a whole, perhaps with the nuance &#8220;break again and again, break in pieces.&#8221; Another option is to understand the form as resultative: &#8220;make broken&#8221; (see <i>IBHS</i> 404-7 §24.3).</p>
