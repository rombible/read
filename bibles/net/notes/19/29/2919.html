<A NAME="2919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1032><b>sn</b> <i>Kadesh</i>. The references to Lebanon and Sirion in v. 6 suggest this is a reference to the northern Kadesh, located north of Damascus, not the southern Kadesh mentioned so often in the OT. See M. Dahood, <i>Psalms </i>(AB), 1:178.</p>
