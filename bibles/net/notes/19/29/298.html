<A NAME="298"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1021><b>tn</b> Traditionally &#8220;many waters.&#8221; The geographical references in the psalm (Lebanon, Sirion, Kadesh) suggest this is a reference to the Mediterranean Sea (see Ezek 26:19; 27:26). The psalmist describes a powerful storm moving in from the sea and sweeping over the mountainous areas north of Israel. The &#8220;surging waters&#8221; may symbolize the hostile enemies of God who seek to destroy his people (see Pss 18:17; 32:6; 77:20; 93:4; 144:7; Isa 17:13; Jer 51:55; Ezek 26:19; Hab 3:15). In this case the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is depicted as elevated above and sovereign over the raging waters.</p>
