<A NAME="291"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1014><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 29</i>. In this hymn of praise the psalmist calls upon the heavenly assembly to acknowledge the royal splendor of the Lord. He describes the Lord&#8217;s devastating power as revealed in the thunderstorm and affirms that the Lord exerts this awesome might on behalf of his people. In its original context the psalm was a bold polemic against the Canaanite storm god Baal, for it affirms that the Lord is the real king who controls the elements of the storm, contrary to pagan belief. See R. B. Chisholm, Jr., &#8220;The Polemic against Baalism in Israel&#8217;s Early History and Literature,&#8221; <i>BSac</i> 150 (1994): 280-82.</p>
