<A NAME="2925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1038><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mabbul</font>, &#8220;flood&#8221;) appears only here and in Gen 6-11, where it refers to the Noahic flood. Some see a reference to that event here. The presence of the article (perhaps indicating uniqueness) and the switch to the perfect verbal form (which could be taken as describing a past situation) might support this. However, the immediate context indicates that the referent of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</font> is the &#8220;surging waters&#8221; mentioned in v. 3. The article indicates waters that are definite in the mind of the speaker and the perfect is probably descriptive in function, like &#8220;thunders&#8221; in v. 3. However, even though the historical flood is not the primary referent here, there may be a literary allusion involved. The psalmist views the threatening chaotic sea as a contemporary manifestation of the destructive waters of old.</p>
