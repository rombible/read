<A NAME="2916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1029><b>tn</b> The verb normally means &#8220;to hew [stone or wood],&#8221; or &#8220;to hew out.&#8221; In Hos 6:5 it seems to mean &#8220;cut in pieces,&#8221; &#8220;knock down,&#8221; or perhaps &#8220;hack&#8221; (see F. I. Andersen and D. N. Freedman, <i>Hosea </i>[AB], 428). The Ugaritic cognate can mean &#8220;assault.&#8221; In v. 7 the verb seems to have a similar meaning, perhaps &#8220;attack, strike.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;flames of fire&#8221; is an adverbial accusative; the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s shout is accompanied by &#8220;flames of fire,&#8221; that is, lightning bolts.</p>
