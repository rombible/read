<A NAME="292"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1015><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sons of gods,&#8221; or &#8220;sons of God.&#8221; Though <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elim</font>) is vocalized as a plural form (&#8220;gods&#8221;) in the MT, it is likely that the final <i>mem</i> is actually enclitic, rather than a plural marker. In this case one may read &#8220;God.&#8221; Some, following a Qumran text and the LXX, also propose the phrase occurred in the original text of Deut 32:8.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497; &#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿney </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elim</font>, &#8220;sons of gods&#8221; or &#8220;sons of God&#8221;) occurs only here and in Ps 89:6 (89:7 HT). In Ps 89 the &#8220;sons of gods/God&#8221; are also called &#8220;the assembly of the holy ones&#8221; and &#8220;council of the holy ones.&#8221; The heavenly assembly, comprised of so-called &#8220;angels&#8221; and other supernatural<i> </i>beings, appears to be in view. See Job 5:1; 15:15 and Zech 14:5, where these supernatural beings are referred to as &#8220;holy ones.&#8221; In Canaanite mythological texts the divine council of the high god El is referred to as &#8220;the sons of El.&#8221; The OT apparently borrows the Canaanite phrase and applies it to the supernatural beings that surround the heavenly throne.</p>
