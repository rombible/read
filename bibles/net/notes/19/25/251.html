<A NAME="251"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=891><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 25</i>. The psalmist asks for divine protection, guidance and forgiveness as he affirms his loyalty to and trust in the Lord. This psalm is an acrostic; every verse begins with a successive letter of the Hebrew alphabet, except for v. 18, which, like v. 19, begins with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;</font> (<i>resh</i>) instead of the expected <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;</font> (<i>qof</i>). The final verse, which begins with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;</font> (<i>pe</i>), stands outside the acrostic scheme.</p>
