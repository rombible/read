<A NAME="811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2975><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 81</i>. The psalmist calls God&#8217;s people to assemble for a festival and then proclaims God&#8217;s message to them. The divine speech (vv. 6-16) recalls how God delivered the people from Egypt, reminds Israel of their rebellious past, expresses God&#8217;s desire for his people to obey him, and promises divine protection in exchange for obedience.</p>
<A NAME="812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2976><b>tn</b> The precise meaning of the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">haggittit</font>) is uncertain; it probably refers to a musical style or instrument. See the superscription to Ps 8.</p>
<A NAME="813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2977><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lift up.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2978><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;at the new moon.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>New moon</i> festivals were a monthly ritual in Israel (see R. de Vaux, <i>Ancient Israel</i>, 469-70). In this context the New Moon festival of the seventh month, when the Feast of Tabernacles was celebrated (note the reference to a &#8220;festival&#8221; in the next line), may be in view.</p>
<A NAME="815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2979><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;at the full moon on the day of our festival.&#8221; The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">keseh</font>) is an alternate spelling of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kese</font>&#8217;, &#8220;full moon&#8221;).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The <i>festival </i>in view is probably the Feast of Tabernacles (Booths), which began on the fifteenth day of the seventh month when the moon was full. See Lev 23:34; Num 29:12.</p>
<A NAME="816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2980><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;because a statute for Israel [is] it.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2981><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in his going out against the land of Egypt.&#8221; This apparently refers to the general time period of Israel&#8217;s exodus from Egypt. The LXX reads, &#8220;from Egypt,&#8221; in which case &#8220;Joseph&#8221; (see the preceding line) would be the subject of the verb, &#8220;when he [Joseph = Israel] left Egypt.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2982><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a lip I did not know, I heard.&#8221; Here the term &#8220;lip&#8221; probably stands for speech or a voice. Apparently the psalmist speaks here and refers to God&#8217;s voice, whose speech is recorded in the following verses.</p>
<A NAME="819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2983><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;It said&#8221; are not included in the Hebrew text. They are supplied in the translation for clarification.</p>
<A NAME="8110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2984><b>sn</b> <i>I removed the burden</i>. The Lord speaks metaphorically of how he delivered his people from Egyptian bondage. The reference to a basket/burden probably alludes to the hard labor of the Israelites in Egypt, where they had to carry loads of bricks (see Exod 1:14).</p>
<A NAME="8111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2985><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I answered you in the hidden place of thunder.&#8221; This may allude to God&#8217;s self-revelation at Mount Sinai, where he appeared in a dark cloud accompanied by thunder (see Exod 19:16).</p>
<A NAME="8112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2986><b>sn</b> The name <i>Meribah</i> means &#8220;strife.&#8221; Two separate but similar incidents at the place called Meribah are recorded in the Pentateuch (Exod 17:1-7; Num 20:1-13). In both cases the Israelites complained about lack of water and the Lord miraculously provided for them.</p>
<A NAME="8113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2987><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;I said&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarification. Verses 8-10 appear to recall what the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> commanded the generation of Israelites that experienced the events described in v. 7. Note the statement in v. 11, &#8220;my people did not listen to me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="8114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2988><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;command.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="8115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2989><b>tn</b> The Hebrew particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (&#8220;if&#8221;) and following prefixed verbal form here express a wish (GKC 321 §109.<i>b</i>). Note that the apodosis (the &#8220;then&#8221; clause of the conditional sentence) is suppressed.</p>
<A NAME="8116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2990><b>tn</b> The imperfect verbal forms in v. 9 have a modal function, expressing what is obligatory.</p>
<A NAME="8117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2991><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;different&#8221;; &#8220;illicit.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="8118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2992><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;did not listen to my voice.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="8119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2993><b>tn</b> The Hebrew expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492; &#1500;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avah liy</font>) means &#8220;submit to me&#8221; (see Deut 13:8).</p>
<A NAME="8120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2994><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and I sent him away in the stubbornness of their heart.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="8121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2995><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they walked in their counsel.&#8221; The prefixed verbal form is either preterite (&#8220;walked&#8221;) or a customary imperfect (&#8220;were walking&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="8122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2996><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;if only my people were listening to me.&#8221; The Hebrew particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lu</font>, &#8220;if not&#8221;) introduces a purely hypothetical or contrary to fact condition (see 2 Sam 18:12).</p>
<A NAME="8123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2997><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[and if only] Israel would walk in my ways.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="8124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2998><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;turn my hand against.&#8221; The idiom &#8220;turn the hand against&#8221; has the nuance of &#8220;strike with the hand, attack&#8221; (see Isa 1:25; Ezek 38:12; Amos 1:8; Zech 13:7).</p>
<A NAME="8125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2999><b>tn</b> &#8220;Those who hate the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221; are also mentioned in 2 Chr 19:2 and Ps 139:21.</p>
<A NAME="8126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=3000><b>tn</b> See Deut 33:29; Ps 66:3 for other uses of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kakhash</font>) in the sense &#8220;cower in fear.&#8221; In Ps 18:44 the verb seems to carry the nuance &#8220;to be weak; to be powerless&#8221; (see also Ps 109:24). The prefixed verbal form is taken as a jussive, parallel to the jussive form in the next line.</p>
<A NAME="8127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=3001><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and may their time be forever.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ittam</font>, &#8220;their time&#8221;) must refer here to the &#8220;time&#8221; of the demise and humiliation of those who hate the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. Some propose an emendation to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1514;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">atatam</font>) or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1506;&#1467;&#1514;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bi</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">utam</font>; &#8220;their terror&#8221;; i.e., &#8220;may their terror last forever&#8221;), but the omission of <i>bet</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;</font>) in the present Hebrew text is difficult to explain, making the proposed emendation unlikely.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The verb form at the beginning of the line is jussive, indicating that this is a prayer. The translation assumes that v. 15 is a parenthetical &#8220;curse&#8221; offered by the psalmist. Having heard the reference to Israel&#8217;s enemies (v. 14), the psalmist inserts this prayer, reminding the Lord that they are God&#8217;s enemies as well.</p>
<A NAME="8128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=3002><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he fed him from the best of the wheat.&#8221; The Hebrew text has a third person form of the preterite with a <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive attached. However, it is preferable, in light of the use of the first person in v. 14 and in the next line, to emend the verb to a first person form and understand the <i>vav</i> as conjunctive, continuing the apodosis of the conditional sentence of vv. 13-14. The third masculine singular pronominal suffix refers to Israel, as in v. 6.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>I would feed</i>. After the parenthetical &#8220;curse&#8221; in v. 15, the Lord&#8217;s speech continues here.</p>
<A NAME="8129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=3003><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you.&#8221; The second person singular pronominal suffix refers to Israel, as in vv. 7-10.</p>
<A NAME="8130"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=3004><b>sn</b> The language in this verse, particularly the references to <i>wheat</i> and <i>honey</i>, is reminiscent of Deut 32:13-14.</p>
