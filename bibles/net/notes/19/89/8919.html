<A NAME="8919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=3197><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Rahab.&#8221; The name &#8220;Rahab&#8221; means &#8220;proud one.&#8221; Since it is sometimes used of Egypt (see Ps 87:4; Isa 30:7), the passage may allude to the exodus. However, the name is also used of the sea (or the mythological sea creature) which symbolizes the disruptive forces of the world that seek to replace order with chaos (see Job 9:13; 26:12). Isa 51:9 appears to combine the mythological and historical referents. The association of Rahab with the sea in Ps 89 (see v. 9) suggests that the name carries symbolic force in this context. In this case the passage may allude to creation (see vv. 11-12), when God overcame the great deep and brought order out of chaos.</p>
