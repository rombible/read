<A NAME="8945"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=3223><b>tn</b> Some identify &#8220;the sea&#8221; as the Mediterranean and &#8220;the rivers&#8221; as the Euphrates and its tributaries. However, it is more likely that &#8220;the sea&#8221; and &#8220;the rivers&#8221; are symbols for hostile powers that oppose God and the king (see v. 9, as well as Ps 93:3-4).</p>
