<A NAME="8946"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=3224><b>sn</b> <i>You are my father</i>. The Davidic king was viewed as God&#8217;s &#8220;son&#8221; (see 2 Sam 7:14; Ps 2:7). The idiom reflects ancient Near Eastern adoption language associated with covenants of grant, by which a lord would reward a faithful subject by elevating him to special status, referred to as &#8220;sonship.&#8221; Like a son, the faithful subject received an &#8220;inheritance,&#8221; viewed as an unconditional, eternal gift. Such gifts usually took the form of land and/or an enduring dynasty. See M. Weinfeld, &#8220;The Covenant of Grant in the Old Testament and in the Ancient Near East,&#8221; <i>JAOS</i> 90 (1970): 184-203, for general discussion and some striking extra-biblical parallels.</p>
