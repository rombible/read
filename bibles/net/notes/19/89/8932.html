<A NAME="8932"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=3210><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;our shield&#8221; refers metaphorically to the Davidic king, who, as God&#8217;s vice-regent, was the human protector of the people. Note the parallelism with &#8220;our king&quot; here and with &#8220;your anointed one&#8221; in Ps 84:9.</p>
