<A NAME="891"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=3179><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 89</i>. The psalmist praises God as the sovereign creator of the world. He recalls God&#8217;s covenant with David, but then laments that the promises of the covenant remain unrealized. The covenant promised the Davidic king military victories, but the king has now been subjected to humiliating defeat.</p>
