<A NAME="431"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1554><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 43</i>. Many medieval Hebrew <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> combine Psalm 43 and Psalm 42 into one psalm. Psalm 43 is the only psalm in Book 2 of the Psalter (Psalms 42-72) that does not have a heading, suggesting that it was originally the third and concluding section of Psalm 42. Ps 43:5 is identical to the refrain in Ps 42:11 and almost identical to the refrain in Ps 42:5.</p>
