<A NAME="13926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=4516><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Your eyes saw my shapeless form.&#8221; The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1465;&#1500;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">golem</font>) occurs only here in the OT. In later Hebrew the word refers to &#8220;a lump, a shapeless or lifeless substance,&#8221; and to &#8220;unfinished matter, a vessel wanting finishing&#8221; (Jastrow 222 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1462;&#1501;</font>). The translation employs the dynamic rendering &#8220;when I was inside the womb&#8221; to clarify that the speaker was still in his mother&#8217;s womb at the time he was &#8220;seen&#8221; by God.</p>
