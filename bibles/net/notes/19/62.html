<A NAME="621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2221><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 62</i>. The psalmist expresses his unwavering confidence in God&#8217;s justice and in his ability to protect his people.</p>
<A NAME="622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2222><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;only for God [is] there silence [to] my soul.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2223><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from him [is] my deliverance.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2224><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my high rocky summit.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="625"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2225><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;my elevated place&#8221; (see Ps 18:2).</p>
<A NAME="626"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2226><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text adds <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rabbah</font>, &#8220;greatly&#8221;) at the end of the line. It is unusual for this adverb to follow a negated verb. Some see this as qualifying the assertion to some degree, but this would water down the affirmation too much (see v. 6b, where the adverb is omitted). If the adverb has a qualifying function, it would suggest that the psalmist might be upended, though not severely. This is inconsistent with the confident mood of the psalm. The adverb probably has an emphatic force here, &#8220;I will not be greatly upended&#8221; meaning &#8220;I will not be annihilated.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="627"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2227><b>tn</b> The verb form is plural; the psalmist addresses his enemies. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</font> occurs only here in the OT. An Arabic cognate means &#8220;shout at.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="628"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2228><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has a Pual (passive) form, but the verb form should be vocalized as a Piel (active) form. See BDB 953-54 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1495;</font>.</p>
<A NAME="629"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2229><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;like a bent wall and a broken fence.&#8221; The point of the comparison is not entirely clear. Perhaps the enemies are depicted as dangerous, like a leaning wall or broken fence that is in danger of falling on someone (see C. A. Briggs and E. G. Briggs, <i>Psalms </i>[ICC], 2:69).</p>
<A NAME="6210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2230><b>tn</b> That is, the psalmist&#8217;s enemies addressed in the previous verse.</p>
<A NAME="6211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2231><b>tn</b> That is, the generic &#8220;man&#8221; referred to in the previous verse.</p>
<A NAME="6212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2232><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;only from his lofty place [or perhaps, &#8220;dignity&#8221;] they plan to drive [him] away.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="6213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2233><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they delight [in] a lie.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="6214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2234><b>sn</b> The enemies use deceit to bring down their victim. They make him think they are his friends by pronouncing <i>blessings</i> upon him, but inwardly they desire his demise.</p>
<A NAME="6215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2235><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;only for God be silent, my soul.&#8221; The wording is similar to that of v. 1a. Here an imperatival form, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dommiy</font>, &#8220;be silent&#8221;), appears instead of the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dumiyyah</font>, &#8220;silence&#8221;). The psalmist is encouraging himself to maintain his trust in God.</p>
<A NAME="6216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2236><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for from him [is] my hope.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="6217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2237><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my high rocky summit.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="6218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2238><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;my elevated place&#8221; (see Ps 18:2).</p>
<A NAME="6219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2239><b>sn</b> The wording is identical to that of v. 2, except that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rabbah</font>, &#8220;greatly&#8221;) does not appear in v. 6.</p>
<A NAME="6220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2240><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;upon God [is] my deliverance and my glory, the high rocky summit of my strength, my shelter [is] in God.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="6221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2241><b>tn</b> To &#8220;pour out one&#8217;s heart&#8221; means to offer up to God intense, emotional lamentation and petitionary prayers (see Lam 2:19).</p>
<A NAME="6222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2242><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;only a breath [are] the sons of mankind, a lie [are] the sons of man.&#8221; The phrases &#8220;sons of mankind&#8221; and &#8220;sons of man&#8221; also appear together in Ps 49:2. Because of the parallel line there, where &#8220;rich and poor&#8221; are mentioned, a number of interpreters and translators treat these expressions as polar opposites, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497; &#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿney </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adam</font>) referring to the lower classes and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497; &#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿney </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ish</font>) to higher classes. But usage does not support such a view. The rare phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497; &#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (&#8220;sons of man&#8221;) appears to refer to human beings in general in its other uses (see Pss 4:2; Lam 3:33). It is better to understand the phrases as synonymous expressions.</p>
<A NAME="6223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2243><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hevel</font>), translated &#8220;a breath&#8221; earlier in the verse, appears again here.</p>
<A NAME="6224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2244><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;do not trust in oppression.&#8221; Here &#8220;oppression&#8221; stands by metonymy for the riches that can be gained by oppressive measures, as the final line of the verse indicates.</p>
<A NAME="6225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2245><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and in robbery do not place vain hope.&#8221; Here &#8220;robbery&#8221; stands by metonymy for the riches that can be gained by theft, as the next line of the verse indicates.</p>
<A NAME="6226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2246><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[as for] wealth, when it bears fruit, do not set [your] heart [on it].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="6227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2247><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;one God spoke, two which I heard.&#8221; This is a numerical saying utilizing the &#8220;x&#8221; followed by &#8220;x + 1&#8221; pattern to facilitate poetic parallelism. (See W. M. W. Roth, <i>Numerical Sayings in the Old Testament </i>[VTSup], 55-56.) As is typical in such sayings, a list corresponding to the second number (in this case &#8220;two&#8221;) follows. Another option is to translate, &#8220;God has spoken once, twice [he has spoken] that which I have heard.&#8221; The terms <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akhat</font>, &#8220;one; once&#8221;) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿtayim</font>, &#8220;two; twice&#8221;) are also juxtaposed in 2 Kgs 6:10 (where they refer to an action that was done more than &#8220;once or twice&#8221;) and in Job 33:14 (where they refer to God speaking &#8220;one way&#8221; and then in &#8220;another manner&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="6228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2248><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;that strength [belongs] to God.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="6229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2249><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and to you, O Master, [is] loyal love.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="6230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2250><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for you pay back to a man according to his deed.&#8221; Another option is to understand vv. 11b and 12a as the first principle and v. 12b as the second. In this case one might translate, &#8220;God has declared one principle, two principles I have heard, namely, that God is strong, and you, O Lord, demonstrate loyal love, and that you repay men for what they do.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>You repay men for what they do</i>. The psalmist views God&#8217;s justice as a demonstration of both his power (see v. 11c) and his loyal love (see v. 12a). When God judges evildoers, he demonstrates loyal love to his people.</p>
