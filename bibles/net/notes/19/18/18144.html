<A NAME="18144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">144</span><note=676><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lifts me up.&#8221; In light of the preceding and following references to deliverance, the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;</font> probably here refers to being rescued from danger (see Ps 9:13). However, it could mean &#8220;exalt, elevate&#8221; here, indicating that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has given the psalmist victory over his enemies and forced them to acknowledge the psalmist&#8217;s superiority (cf. NIV, NRSV).</p>
