<A NAME="1862"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=594><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;according to my righteousness.&#8221; As vv. 22-24 make clear, the psalmist refers here to his unwavering obedience to God&#8217;s commands. In these verses the psalmist explains that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> was pleased with him and willing to deliver him because he had been loyal to God and obedient to his commandments. Ancient Near Eastern literature contains numerous parallels. A superior (a god or king) would typically reward a subject (a king or the servant of a king, respectively) for loyalty and obedience. See R. B. Chisholm, &#8220;An Exegetical and Theological Study of Psalm 18/2 Samuel 22&#8221; (Th.D. diss., Dallas Theological Seminary, 1983), 211-13.</p>
