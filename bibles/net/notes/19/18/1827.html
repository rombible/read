<A NAME="1827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=559><b>tn</b> 2 Sam 22:8 has &#8220;heavens&#8221; which forms a merism with &#8220;earth&#8221; in the preceding line. The &#8220;foundations of the heavens&#8221; would be the mountains. However, the reading &#8220;foundations of the mountains&#8221; has a parallel in Deut 32:22.</p>
