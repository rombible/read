<A NAME="1835"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=567><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a cherub.&#8221; Because of the typical associations of the word &#8220;cherub&#8221; in English with chubby winged babies, the term has been rendered &#8220;winged angel&#8221; in the translation.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Winged angel</i> (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;cherub&#8221;). Cherubs, as depicted in the OT, possess both human and animal (lion, ox, and eagle) characteristics (see Ezek 1:10; 10:14, 21; 41:18). They are pictured as winged creatures (Exod 25:20; 37:9; 1 Kgs 6:24-27; Ezek 10:8, 19) and serve as the very throne of God when the ark of the covenant is in view (Pss 80:1; 99:1; see Num 7:89; 1 Sam 4:4; 2 Sam 6:2; 2 Kgs 19:15). The picture of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> seated on the cherubs suggests they might be used by him as a vehicle, a function they carry out in Ezek 1:22-28 (the &#8220;living creatures&#8221; mentioned here are identified as cherubs in Ezek 10:20). In Ps 18:10 the image of a cherub serves to personify the wind (see the next line of the psalm).</p>
