<A NAME="1893"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">93</span><note=625><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the word of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is purified.&#8221; The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s &#8220;word&#8221; probably refers here to his oracle(s) of victory delivered to the psalmist before the battle(s) described in the following context. See also Pss 12:5-7 and 138:2-3. David frequently received such oracles before going into battle (see 1 Sam 23:2, 4-5, 10-12; 30:8; 2 Sam 5:19). The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s word of promise is absolutely reliable; it is compared to metal that has been refined in fire and cleansed of impurities. See Ps 12:6.</p>
