<A NAME="18106"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">106</span><note=638><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and a bow of bronze is bent by my arms&#8221;; or &#8220;my arms bend a bow of bronze.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhat</font>) apparently means &#8220;pull back, bend&#8221; here (see <i>HALOT</i> 692 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1495;&#1514;</font>). The third feminine singular verbal form appears to agree with the feminine singular noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qeshet</font>, &#8220;bow&#8221;). In this case the verb must be taken as Niphal (passive). However, it is possible that &#8220;my arms&#8221; is the subject of the verb and &#8220;bow&#8221; the object. In this case the verb is Piel (active). For other examples of a feminine singular verb being construed with a plural noun, see GKC 464 §145.<i>k</i>.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The <i>strongest bow</i> (<i>Heb </i>&#8220;bow of bronze&#8221;) probably refers to a bow laminated with bronze strips, or to a purely ceremonial or decorative bow made entirely from bronze. In the latter case the language is hyperbolic, for such a weapon would not be functional in battle.</p>
