<A NAME="18146"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">146</span><note=678><b>sn</b> <i>I will give you thanks before the nations</i>. This probably alludes to the fact that the psalmist will praise the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> in the presence of the defeated nations when they, as his subjects, bring their tribute payments. Ideally the Davidic king was to testify to the nations of God&#8217;s greatness. See J. H. Eaton, <i>Kingship and the Psalms </i>(SBT), 182-85.</p>
