<A NAME="18153"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">153</span><note=685><b>sn</b> If <i>David</i> is the author of the psalm (see the superscription), then he here anticipates that God will continue to demonstrate loyalty to his descendants who succeed him. If the author is a later Davidic king, then he views the divine favor he has experienced as the outworking of God&#8217;s faithful promises to David his ancestor.</p>
