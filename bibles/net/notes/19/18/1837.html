<A NAME="1837"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=569><b>sn</b> <i>The wings of the wind</i>. Verse 10 may depict (1) the Lord riding a cherub, which is in turn propelled by the wind current. Another option (2) is that two different vehicles (a cherub and the wind) are envisioned. Yet another option (3) is that the wind is personified as a cherub. For a discussion of ancient Near Eastern parallels to the imagery in v. 10, see M. Weinfeld, &#8220;&#8216;Rider of the Clouds&#8217; and &#8216;Gatherer of the Clouds&#8217;,&#8221; <i>JANESCU</i> 5 (1973): 422-24.</p>
