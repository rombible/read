<A NAME="1830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=562><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;in his anger.&#8221; The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">af</font>) can carry the abstract meaning &#8220;anger,&#8221; but the parallelism (note &#8220;from his mouth&#8221;) suggests the more concrete meaning &#8220;nose&#8221; here. See also v. 15, &#8220;the powerful breath of your nose.&#8221;</p>
