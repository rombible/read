<A NAME="1878"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=610><b>tn</b> The adjective <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">iqqesh</font>) has the basic nuance &#8220;twisted, crooked,&#8221; and by extension refers to someone or something that is morally perverse. It appears frequently in Proverbs, where it is used of evil people (22:5), speech (8:8; 19:1), thoughts (11:20; 17:20), and life styles (2:15; 28:6). A righteous king opposes such people (Ps 101:4).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Verses 25-26 affirm God&#8217;s justice. He responds to people in accordance with their moral character. His response mirrors their actions. The faithful and blameless find God to be <i>loyal</i> and <i>reliable</i> in his dealings with them. But deceivers discover he is able and willing to use deceit to destroy them. For a more extensive discussion of the theme of divine deception in the OT, see R. B. Chisholm, &#8220;Does God Deceive?&#8221; <i>BSac</i> 155 (1998): 11-28.</p>
