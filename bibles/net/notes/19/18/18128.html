<A NAME="18128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">128</span><note=660><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a people whom I did not know serve me.&#8221; In this context &#8220;know&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yada</font>&#8217;) probably refers to formal recognition by treaty. People who were once not under the psalmist&#8217;s authority now willingly submit to his rulership to avoid being conquered militarily (see vv. 44-45). The language may recall the events recorded in 2 Sam 8:9-10 and 10:19.</p>
