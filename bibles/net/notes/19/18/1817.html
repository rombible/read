<A NAME="1817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=549><b>tc</b> Ps 18:4 reads &#8220;ropes,&#8221; while 2 Sam 22:5 reads &#8220;waves.&#8221; The reading of the psalm has been influenced by the next verse (note &#8220;ropes of Sheol&#8221;) and perhaps also by Ps 116:3 (where &#8220;ropes of death&#8221; appears, as here, with the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1507;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">afaf</font>). However, the parallelism of v. 4 (note &#8220;currents&#8221; in the next line) favors the reading &#8220;waves.&#8221; While the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1507;</font> is used with &#8220;ropes&#8221; as subject in Ps 116:3, it can also be used with engulfing &#8220;waters&#8221; as subject (see Jonah 2:5). Death is compared to surging waters in v. 4 and to a hunter in v. 5.</p>
