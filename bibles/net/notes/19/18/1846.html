<A NAME="1846"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=578><b>tn</b> The pronominal suffixes on the verbs &#8220;scattered&#8221; and &#8220;routed&#8221; (see the next line) refer to the psalmist&#8217;s enemies. Some argue that the suffixes refer to the arrows, in which case one might translate &#8220;shot them far and wide&#8221; and &#8220;made them move noisily,&#8221; respectively. They argue that the enemies have not been mentioned since v. 4 and are not again mentioned until v. 17. However, usage of the verbs <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">puts</font>, &#8220;scatter&#8221;) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hamam</font>, &#8220;rout&#8221;) elsewhere in Holy War accounts suggests the suffixes refer to enemies. Enemies are frequently pictured in such texts as scattered and/or routed (see Exod 14:24; 23:27; Num 10:35; Josh 10:10; Judg 4:15; 1 Sam 7:10; 11:11; Ps 68:1).</p>
