<A NAME="18122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">122</span><note=654><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.&#8221; The words &#8220;they cry out&#8221; are supplied in the translation because they are understood by ellipsis (see the preceding line).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>They cry out</i>. This reference to the psalmist&#8217;s enemies crying out for help to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> suggests that the psalmist refers here to enemies within the covenant community, rather than foreigners. However, the militaristic context suggests foreign enemies are in view. Ancient Near Eastern literature indicates that defeated enemies would sometimes cry out for mercy to the god(s) of their conqueror. See R. B. Chisholm, &#8220;An Exegetical and Theological Study of Psalm 18/2 Samuel 22&#8221; (Th.D. diss., Dallas Theological Seminary, 1983), 271.</p>
