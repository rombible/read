<A NAME="1826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=558><b>sn</b> <i>The earth heaved and shook</i>. The imagery pictures an earthquake in which the earth&#8217;s surface rises and falls. The earthquake motif is common in OT theophanies of God as warrior and in ancient Near Eastern literary descriptions of warring gods and kings. See R. B. Chisholm, &#8220;An Exegetical and Theological Study of Psalm 18/2 Samuel 22&#8221; (Th.D. diss., Dallas Theological Seminary, 1983), 160-62.</p>
