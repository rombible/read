<A NAME="1819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=551><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿliyya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) is used here as an epithet for death. Elsewhere it is a common noun meaning &#8220;wickedness, uselessness.&#8221; It is often associated with rebellion against authority and other crimes that result in societal disorder and anarchy. The phrase &#8220;man/son of wickedness&#8221; refers to one who opposes God and the order he has established. The term becomes an appropriate title for death, which, through human forces, launches an attack against God&#8217;s chosen servant.</p>
