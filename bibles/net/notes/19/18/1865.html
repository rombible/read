<A NAME="1865"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=597><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for I have kept the ways of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;ways of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221; refers here to the &#8220;conduct required&#8221; by the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. In Ps 25 the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s &#8220;ways&#8221; are associated with his covenantal demands (see vv. 4, 9-10). See also Ps 119:3 (cf. vv. 1, 4), as well as Deut 8:6; 10:12; 11:22; 19:9; 26:17; 28:9; 30:16.</p>
