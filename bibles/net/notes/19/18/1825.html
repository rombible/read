<A NAME="1825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=557><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and my cry for help before him came into his ears.&#8221; 2 Sam 22:7 has a shorter reading, &#8220;my cry for help, in his ears.&#8221; It is likely that Ps 18:6 MT as it now stands represents a conflation of two readings: (1) &#8220;my cry for help came before him,&#8221; (2) &#8220;my cry for help came into his ears.&#8221; See F. M. Cross and D. N. Freedman, <i>Studies in Ancient Yahwistic Poetry </i>(SBLDS), 144, n. 13.</p>
