<A NAME="10210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=3489><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from the sound of my groaning my bone[s] stick to my flesh.&#8221; The preposition at the beginning of the verse is causal; the phrase &#8220;sound of my groaning&#8221; is metonymic for the anxiety that causes the groaning. The point seems to be this: Anxiety (which causes the psalmist to groan) keeps him from eating (v. 4). This physical deprivation in turn makes him emaciated &#8211; he is turned to &#8220;skin and bones,&#8221; so to speak.</p>
