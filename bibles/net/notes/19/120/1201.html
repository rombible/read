<A NAME="1201"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=4249><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 120</i>. The genre and structure of this psalm are uncertain. It begins like a thanksgiving psalm, with a brief notice that God has heard the psalmist&#8217;s prayer for help and has intervened. But v. 2 is a petition for help, followed by a taunt directed toward enemies (vv. 3-4) and a lament (vv. 5-7). Perhaps vv. 2-7 recall the psalmist&#8217;s prayer when he cried out to the Lord.</p>
