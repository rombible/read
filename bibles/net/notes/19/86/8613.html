<A NAME="8613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=3120><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Bind my heart to the fearing of your name.&#8221; The verb translated &#8220;bind&#8221; occurs only here in the Piel stem. It appears twice in the Qal, meaning &#8220;be joined&#8221; in both cases (Gen 49:6; Isa 14:20). To &#8220;fear&#8221; God&#8217;s name means to have a healthy respect for him which in turn motivates one to obey his commands (see Pss 61:5; 102:15).</p>
