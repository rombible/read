<A NAME="233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=62><b>tn</b> Traditionally, &#8220;kiss the son&#8221; (KJV). But <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bar</font>) is the Aramaic word for &#8220;son,&#8221; not the Hebrew. For this reason many regard the reading as suspect. Some propose emendations of vv. 11b-12a. One of the more popular proposals is to read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492; &#1504;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1456;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1490;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bir</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adah nashÿqu lÿraslayv</font>, &#8220;in trembling kiss his feet&#8221;). It makes better sense to understand <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bar</font>) as an adjective meaning &#8220;pure&#8221; (see Pss 24:4; 73:1 and BDB 141 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;</font> 3) functioning here in an adverbial sense. If read this way, then the syntactical structure of exhortation (imperative followed by adverbial modifier) corresponds to the two preceding lines (see v. 11). The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nashaq</font>, &#8220;kiss&#8221;) refers metonymically to showing homage (see 1 Sam 10:1; Hos 13:2). The exhortation in v. 12a advocates a genuine expression of allegiance and warns against insincerity. When swearing allegiance, vassal kings would sometimes do so insincerely, with the intent of rebelling when the time was right. The so-called &#8220;Vassal Treaties of Esarhaddon&#8221; also warn against such an attitude. In this treaty the vassal is told: &#8220;If you, as you stand on the soil where this oath [is sworn], swear the oath with your words and lips [only], do not swear with your entire heart, do not transmit it to your sons who will live after this treaty, if you take this <i>curse</i> upon yourselves but do not plan to keep the treaty of Esarhaddon&#8230;may your sons and grandsons because of this fear in the future&#8221; (see J. B. Pritchard, ed., <i>The Ancient Near East</i>, 2:62).</p>
