<A NAME="1264"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4326><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;we were like dreamers.&#8221; This could mean the speakers were so overcome with ecstatic joy (see v. 3b) that they were like those who fantasize about pleasurable experiences in their sleep (see Isa 29:7-8). Since dreams are more commonly associated in the OT with prophetic visions, the community may be comparing their experience of God&#8217;s renewed favor to a prophet&#8217;s receiving divine visions. Just as a prophetic dream sweeps the individual into a different dimension and sometimes brings one face-to-face with God himself (see Gen 28:11-15; 1 Kgs 3:5-15), so the community was aware of God&#8217;s presence in a special way in the day of Zion&#8217;s restoration. Though the MT as it stands makes good sense, some choose to understand a homonymic root here meaning &#8220;to be healthy; to be strong&#8221; (see BDB 321 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1501;</font>) and translate, &#8220;we were like those restored to health.&#8221; This reading appears to have the support of several ancient translations as well as 11QPs<sup>a</sup>. See L. C. Allen (<i>Psalms 101-150 </i>[WBC], 170-71) for a discussion of the viewpoints.</p>
