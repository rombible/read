<A NAME="1267"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=4329><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;like the streams in the Negev.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The streams in the arid south</i>. Y. Aharoni writes of the streams in the Negev: &#8220;These usually dry wadis collect water on rainy days from vast areas. The situation is also aggravated by floods from the desert mountains and southern Judah. For a day or two or, more frequently, for only a few hours they turn into dangerous torrents&#8221; (Y. Aharoni, <i>The Land of the Bible</i>, 26). God&#8217;s people were experiencing a &#8220;dry season&#8221; after a time of past blessing; they pray here for a &#8220;flash flood&#8221; of his renewed blessing. This does not imply that they are requesting only a brief display of God&#8217;s blessing. Rather the point of comparison is the suddenness with which the wadis swell during a rain, as well as the depth and power of these raging waters. The community desires a sudden display of divine favor in which God overwhelms them with blessings.</p>
