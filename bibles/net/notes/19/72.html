<A NAME="721"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2577><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 72</i>. This royal psalm contains a prayer for the Davidic king (note the imperatival form in v. 1 and the jussive forms in vv. 16-17). It is not entirely clear if vv. 2-15 express a prayer or anticipate a future reign. The translation assumes a blend of petition and vision: (I) opening prayer (v. 1), followed by anticipated results if prayer is answered (vv. 2-7); (II) prayer (v. 8), followed by anticipated results if prayer is answered (vv. 9-14); (III) closing prayer (vv. 15-17). Whether a prayer, vision, or combination of the two, the psalm depicts the king&#8217;s universal rule of peace and prosperity. As such it is indirectly messianic, for the ideal it expresses will only be fully realized during the Messiah&#8217;s earthly reign. Verses 18-19 are a conclusion for Book 2 of the Psalter (Pss 42-72; cf. Ps 41:13, which contains a similar conclusion for Book 1), while v. 20 appears to be a remnant of an earlier collection of psalms or an earlier edition of the Psalter.</p>
<A NAME="722"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2578><b>tn</b> The preposition could be understood as indicating authorship (&#8220;Of Solomon&#8221;), but since the psalm is a prayer for a king, it may be that the superscription reflects a tradition that understood this as a prayer for Solomon.</p>
<A NAME="723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2579><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;O God, your judgments to [the] king give.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2580><b>sn</b> <i>Grant the king&#8230;Grant the king&#8217;s son</i>. It is not entirely clear whether v. 1 envisions one individual or two. The phrase &#8220;the king&#8217;s son&#8221; in the second line may simply refer to &#8220;the king&#8221; of the first line, drawing attention to the fact that he has inherited his dynastic rule. Another option is that v. 1 envisions a co-regency between father and son (a common phenomenon in ancient Israel) or simply expresses a hope for a dynasty that champions justice.</p>
<A NAME="725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2581><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and your justice to [the] son of [the] king.&#8221;</p>

See Isa 52:7 and C. A. Briggs and E. G. Briggs, <i>Psalms </i>(ICC), 2:133.</p>
<A NAME="729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2585><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;judge [for].&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="7212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2588><b>tn</b> In this context &#8220;fear&#8221; probably means &#8220;to demonstrate respect for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s power and authority by worshiping him and obeying his commandments.&#8221; See Ps 33:8. Some interpreters, with the support of the LXX, prefer to read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">a</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arikh</font>, &#8220;and he [the king in this case] will prolong [days]&#8221;), that is, &#8220;will live a long time&#8221; (cf.

<A NAME="7215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2591><b>tn</b> That is, the king (see vv. 2, 4).</p>
<A NAME="7216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2592><b>tn</b> The rare term <i>zg</i> refers to a sheep&#8217;s fleece in Deut 18:4 and Job 31:20, but to &#8220;mown&#8221; grass or crops here and in Amos 7:1.</p>
<A NAME="7217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2593><b>tc</b> The form in the Hebrew text appears to be an otherwise unattested noun. Many prefer to emend the form to a verb from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zaraf</font>). <i>BHS</i> in textual note b on this verse suggests a Hiphil imperfect, third masculine plural <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1494;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yazrifu</font>), while <i>HALOT </i>283 s.v. *<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1512;&#1507;</font> prefers a Pilpel perfect, third masculine plural <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1494;&#1456;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zirzÿfu</font>).

<A NAME="7218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2594><b>sn</b> The imagery of this verse compares the blessings produced by the king&#8217;s reign to fructifying rains that cause the crops to grow.</p>

<A NAME="7221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2597><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal form is a (shortened) jussive form, indicating this is a prayer of blessing.</p>
<A NAME="7222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2598><b>sn</b> <i>From sea to sea</i>. This may mean from the Mediterranean Sea in the west to the Dead Sea in the east. See Amos 8:12. The language of this and the following line also appears in Zech 9:10.</p>

<A NAME="7231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2607><b>tn</b> The prefixed verb form is best understood as a defectively written imperfect (see Deut 7:16).</p>
<A NAME="7232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2608><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;redeem their lives.&#8221; The verb &#8220;redeem&#8221; casts the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> in the role of a leader who protects members of his extended family in times of need and crisis (see Pss 19:14; 69:18).</p>
<A NAME="7233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2609><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;their blood will be precious in his eyes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2610><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal form is jussive, not imperfect. Because the form has the prefixed <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>), some subordinate it to what precedes as a purpose/result clause. In this case the representative poor individual might be the subject of this and the following verb, &#8220;so that he may live and give to him gold of Sheba.&#8221; But the idea of the poor offering gold is incongruous. It is better to take the jussive as a prayer with the king as subject of the verb. (Perhaps the initial <i>vav</i> is dittographic; note the <i>vav</i> at the end of the last form in v. 14.) The statement is probably an abbreviated version of the formula <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497; &#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿkhiy hammelekh</font>, &#8220;may the king live&#8221;; see 1 Sam 10:24; 2 Sam 16:16; 1 Kgs 1:25, 34, 39; 2 Kgs 11:12).</p>
<A NAME="7235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2611><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he will give to him some gold of Sheba.&#8221; The prefixed verbal form is understood as a jussive with a grammatically indefinite subject (&#8220;and may one give&#8221;). Of course, the king&#8217;s subjects, mentioned in the preceding context, are the tribute bearers in view here.</p>
<A NAME="7236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2612><b>tn</b> As in the preceding line, the prefixed verbal forms are understood as jussives with a grammatically indefinite subject (&#8220;and may one pray&#8230;and may one bless&#8221;). Of course, the king&#8217;s subjects, mentioned in the preceding context, are in view here.</p>
<A NAME="7237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2613><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal form is jussive, not imperfect. The translation assumes the subject is impersonal (rather than the king).</p>
<A NAME="7238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2614><b>tn</b> The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1460;&#1505;&#1468;&#1463;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pissah</font>; which appears here in the construct form) occurs only here in the OT. Perhaps the noun is related to the verbal root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pasah</font>, &#8220;to spread,&#8221; see BDB 832 s.v.; the root appears as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1505;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">pasah</font>] in postbiblical Hebrew), which is used in postbiblical Hebrew of the rising sun&#8217;s rays spreading over the horizon and a tree&#8217;s branches spreading out (see Jastrow 1194 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1505;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1505;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1492;</font>). In Ps 72:16 a &#8220;spreading of grain&#8221; would refer to grain fields extending out over the land. C. A. Briggs and E. G. Briggs (<i>Psalms </i>[ICC], 2:139) emend the form to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1456;&#1508;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sÿfiakh</font>, &#8220;second growth&#8221;).</p>

<A NAME="7240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=2616><b>tn</b> That is, the grain.</p>
<A NAME="7241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=2617><b>tn</b> According to the traditional accentuation of the MT, this verb belongs with what follows. See the translator&#8217;s note at the end of the verse for a discussion of the poetic parallelism and interpretation of the verse.</p>
<A NAME="7242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=2618><b>tn</b> The antecedent of the third masculine singular pronominal suffix is unclear. It is unlikely that the antecedent is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">erets</font>, &#8220;earth&#8221;) because this noun is normally grammatically feminine. Perhaps <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1465;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ro</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">sh</font>, &#8220;top [of the mountains]&#8221;) is the antecedent. Another option is to understand the pronoun as referring to the king, who would then be viewed as an instrument of divine agricultural blessing (see v. 6).</p>
<A NAME="7243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2619><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fruit.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7244"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=2620><b>tc</b> According to the traditional accentuation of the MT, this verb belongs with what follows. See the note on the word &#8220;earth&#8221; at the end of the verse for a discussion of the poetic parallelism and interpretation of the verse. The present translation takes it with the preceding words, &#8220;like Lebanon its fruit&#8221; and emends the verb form from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿyatsitsu</font>; Qal imperfect third masculine plural with prefixed <i>vav</i>, [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>]) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatsits</font>; Qal imperfect third masculine singular). The initial <i>vav</i> is eliminated as dittographic (note the <i>vav</i> on the ending of the preceding form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;</font>, <font face="Scholar">piryo</font>, &#8220;its/his fruit&#8221;) and the <i>vav</i> at the end of the form is placed on the following emended form (see the note on the word &#8220;crops&#8221;), yielding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">va</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amir</font>, &#8220;and [its] crops&#8221;). </p>
<A NAME="7245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=2621><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;like Lebanon.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7246"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=2622><b>tc</b> The MT has &#8220;from the city.&#8221; The translation assumes an emendation to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amir</font>, &#8220;crops&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="7247"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=2623><b>tn</b> The translation assumes that the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1493;&#1509;</font> (&#8220;flourish&#8221;) goes with the preceding line. The words &#8220;be as abundant&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarification.</p>
<A NAME="7248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=2624><b>tc</b> The traditional accentuation and vocalization of the MT differ from the text assumed by the present translation. The MT reads as follows: &#8220;May there be an abundance of grain in the earth, / and on the tops of the mountains! / May its [or &#8220;his&#8221;?] fruit [trees?] rustle like [the trees of] Lebanon! / May they flourish from the city, like the grass of the earth!&#8221; If one follows the MT, then it would appear that the &#8220;fruit&#8221; of the third line is a metaphorical reference to the king&#8217;s people, who flow out from the cities to populate the land (see line 4). Elsewhere in the OT people are sometimes compared to grass that sprouts up from the land (see v. 7, as well as Isa 27:6; Pss 92:7; 103:15). The translation understands a different poetic structural arrangement and, assuming the emendations mentioned in earlier notes, interprets each line of the verse to be a prayer for agricultural abundance.</p>
<A NAME="7249"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=2625><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;may his name [be] permanent.&#8221; The prefixed verbal form is jussive, not imperfect.</p>
<A NAME="7250"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=2626><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;before the sun may his name increase.&#8221; The <i>Kethib</i> (consonantal text) assumes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yanin</font>; a Hiphil of the verbal root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nin</font>) or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1497;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿnayen</font>; a Piel form), while the <i>Qere</i> (marginal reading) assumes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yinnon</font>; a Niphal form). The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> occurs only here, though a derived noun, meaning &#8220;offspring,&#8221; appears elsewhere (see Isa 14:22). The verb appears to mean &#8220;propagate, increase&#8221; (BDB 630 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font>) or &#8220;produce shoots, get descendants&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 696 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1497;&#1503;</font>). In this context this appears to be a prayer for a lasting dynasty that will keep the king&#8217;s name and memory alive.</p>
<A NAME="7251"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=2627><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;may they bless one another by him,&#8221; that is, use the king&#8217;s name in their blessing formulae because he is a prime example of one blessed by God (for examples of such blessing formulae, see Gen 48:20 and Ruth 4:11). There is some debate on whether the Hitpael form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">barakh</font>, &#8220;bless&#8221;) is reflexive-reciprocal (as assumed in the present translation) or passive. The Hitpael of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> occurs in five other passages, including the hotly debated Gen 22:18 and 26:4. In these two texts one could understand the verb form as passive and translate, &#8220;all the nations of the earth <i>will be blessed</i> through your offspring,&#8221; or one could take the Hitpael as reflexive or reciprocal and translate, &#8220;all the nations of the earth <i>will pronounce blessings</i> [i.e., on themselves or one another] by your offspring.&#8221; In the first instance Abraham&#8217;s (or Isaac&#8217;s) offspring are viewed as a channel of divine blessing. In the second instance they are viewed as a prime example of blessing that will appear as part of the nations&#8217; blessing formulae, but not necessarily as a channel of blessing to the nations. In Deut 29:18 one reads: &#8220;When one hears the words of this covenant [or &#8220;oath&#8221;] and invokes a blessing on himself (Hitpael of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font>) in his heart, saying: &#8216;I will have peace, even though I walk with a rebellious heart.&#8217;&#8221; In this case the Hitpael is clearly reflexive, as the phrases &#8220;in his heart&#8221; and &#8220;I will have peace&#8221; indicate. The Hitpael of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> appears twice in Isaiah 65:16: &#8220;The one who invokes a blessing on himself (see Deut 9:18) in the land will invoke that blessing by the God of truth; and the one who makes an oath in the land will make that oath by the God of truth.&#8221; A passive nuance does not fit here. The parallel line, which mentions making an oath, suggests that the Hitpael of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> refers here to invoking a blessing. Both pronouncements of blessing and oaths will appeal to God as the one who rewards and judges, respectively. Jer 4:2 states: &#8220;If you swear, &#8216;As surely as the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> lives,&#8217; with truth, integrity, and honesty, then the nations will pronounce blessings by him and boast in him.&#8221; A passive nuance might work (&#8220;the nations will be blessed&#8221;), but the context refers to verbal pronouncements (swearing an oath, boasting), suggesting that the Hitpael of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> refers here to invoking a blessing. The logic of the verse seems to be as follows: If Israel conducts its affairs with integrity, the nation will be favored by the Lord, which will in turn attract the surrounding nations to Israel&#8217;s God. To summarize, while the evidence might leave the door open for a passive interpretation, there is no clear cut passive use. Usage favors a reflexive or reciprocal understanding of the Hitpael of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font>. In Ps 72:17 the Hitpael of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> is followed by the prepositional phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vo</font>, &#8220;by him&#8221;). The verb could theoretically be taken as passive, &#8220;may all the nations <i>be blessed</i> through him&#8221; (cf. NIV, NRSV), because the preceding context describes the positive effects of this king&#8217;s rule on the inhabitants of the earth. But the parallel line, which employs the Piel of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ashar</font>) in a factitive/declarative sense, &#8220;regard as happy, fortunate,&#8221; suggests a reflexive or reciprocal nuance for the Hitpael of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> here. If the nations regard the ideal king as a prime example of one who is fortunate or blessed, it is understandable that they would use his name in their pronouncements of blessing.</p>

In the present arrangement of the Book of Psalms, not all psalms prior to this are attributed to David (see Pss 1-2, 10, 33, 42-50, 66-67, 71-72) and several psalms attributed to David appear after this (see Pss 86, 101, 103, 108-110, 122, 124, 131, 138-145).</p>
