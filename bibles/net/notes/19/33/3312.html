<A NAME="3312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1156><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[he] gathers like a pile the waters of the sea.&#8221; Some prefer to emend <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1461;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ged</font>, &#8220;heap, pile&#8221;; cf. NASB) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1465;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nod</font>, &#8220;bottle&#8221;; cf. NRSV; NIV &#8220;into jars&#8221;), but &#8220;pile&#8221; is used elsewhere to describe water that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> confines to one place (Exod 15:8; Josh 3:13, 16; Ps 78:13). This verse appears to refer to Gen 1:9, where God decrees that the watery deep be gathered to one place so that dry land might appear. If so, the participles in this and the following line depict this action with special vividness, as if the reader were present on the occasion. Another option is that the participles picture the confinement of the sea to one place as an ongoing divine activity.</p>
