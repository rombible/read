<A NAME="481"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1749><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 48</i>. This so-called &#8220;Song of Zion&#8221; celebrates the greatness and glory of the Lord&#8217;s dwelling place, Jerusalem. His presence in the city elevates it above all others and assures its security.</p>
<A NAME="482"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1750><b>sn</b> <i>The city of our God</i> is Jerusalem, which is also referred to here as &#8220;his holy hill,&#8221; that is, Zion (see v. 2, as well as Isa 66:20; Joel 2:1; 3:17; Zech 8:3; Pss 2:6; 15:1; 43:3; 87:1; Dan 9:16).</p>
<A NAME="483"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1751><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;beautiful of height.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nof</font>, &#8220;height&#8221;) is a genitive of specification after the qualitative noun &#8220;beautiful.&#8221; The idea seems to be that Mount Zion, because of its lofty appearance, is pleasing to the sight.</p>
<A NAME="484"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1752><b>sn</b> <i>A source of joy to the whole earth</i>. The language is hyperbolic. Zion, as the dwelling place of the universal king, is pictured as the world&#8217;s capital. The prophets anticipated this idealized picture becoming a reality in the eschaton (see Isa 2:1-4).</p>
<A NAME="485"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1753><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Mount Zion, the peaks of Zaphon.&#8221; Like all the preceding phrases in v. 2, both phrases are appositional to &#8220;city of our God, his holy hill&#8221; in v. 1, suggesting an identification in the poet&#8217;s mind between Mount Zion and Zaphon. &#8220;Zaphon&#8221; usually refers to the &#8220;north&#8221; in a general sense (see Pss 89:12; 107:3), but here, where it is collocated with &#8220;peaks,&#8221; it refers specifically to Mount Zaphon, located in the vicinity of ancient Ugarit and viewed as the mountain where the gods assembled (see Isa 14:13). By alluding to West Semitic mythology in this way, the psalm affirms that Mount Zion is the real divine mountain, for it is here that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God of Israel lives and rules over the nations. See P. Craigie, <i>Psalms 1-50</i> (WBC), 353, and T. N. D. Mettinger, <i>In Search of God</i>, 103.</p>
<A NAME="486"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1754><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he is known for an elevated place.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="487"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1755><b>tn</b> The logical connection between vv. 3-4 seems to be this: God is the protector of Zion and reveals himself as the city&#8217;s defender &#8211; this is necessary because hostile armies threaten the city.</p>
<A NAME="488"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1756><b>tn</b> The perfect verbal forms in vv. 4-6 are understood as descriptive. In dramatic style (note <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>, &#8220;look&#8221;) the psalm describes an enemy attack against the city as if it were occurring at this very moment. Another option is to take the perfects as narrational (&#8220;the kings assembled, they advanced&#8221;), referring to a particular historical event, such as Sennacherib&#8217;s siege of the city in 701 <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span> (cf. NIV, NRSV). Even if one translates the verses in a dramatic-descriptive manner (as the present translation does), the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s victory over the Assyrians was probably what served as the inspiration of the description (see v. 8).</p>
<A NAME="489"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1757><b>tn</b> The object of &#8220;see&#8221; is omitted, but v. 3b suggests that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s self-revelation as the city&#8217;s defender is what they see.</p>
<A NAME="4810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1758><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they look, so they are shocked.&#8221; Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ken</font>, &#8220;so&#8221;) has the force of &#8220;in the same measure.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1759><b>tn</b> The translation attempts to reflect the staccato style of the Hebrew text, where the main clauses of vv. 4-6 are simply juxtaposed without connectives.</p>
<A NAME="4812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1760><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;trembling seizes them there.&#8221; The adverb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sham</font>, &#8220;there&#8221;) is used here, as often in poetic texts, to point &#8220;to a spot in which a scene is localized vividly in the imagination&#8221; (BDB 1027 s.v.).</p>
<A NAME="4813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1761><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[with] writhing like one giving birth.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The language of vv. 5-6 is reminiscent of Exod 15:15.</p>
<A NAME="4814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1762><b>tn</b> The switch to the imperfect, as well as the introduction of the ship metaphor, perhaps signals a change to a generalizing tone; the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> typically shatters these large ships, symbolic of the human strength of hostile armies (see the following note on &#8220;large ships&#8221;). The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shavar</font>, &#8220;break&#8221;) appears in the Piel here (see Pss 29:5; 46:9). In the OT it occurs thirty-six times in the Piel, always with multiple objects (the object is either a collective singular or grammatically plural or dual form). The Piel may highlight the repetition of the pluralative action, or it may suggest an intensification of action, indicating repeated action comprising a whole, perhaps with the nuance &#8220;break again and again, break in pieces.&#8221; Another option is to understand the form as resultative: &#8220;make broken&#8221; (see <i>IBHS</i> 404-7 §24.3).</p>
<A NAME="4815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1763><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the ships of Tarshish.&#8221; This probably refers to large ships either made in or capable of traveling to and from the distant western port of Tarshish. These ships, which were the best of their class, here symbolize the mere human strength of hostile armies, which are incapable of withstanding the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s divine power (see Isa 2:16).</p>
<A NAME="4816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1764><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;As we have heard, so we have seen.&#8221; The community had heard about God&#8217;s mighty deeds in the nation&#8217;s history. Having personally witnessed his saving power with their own eyes, they could now affirm that the tradition was not exaggerated or inaccurate.</p>
<A NAME="4817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1765><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of hosts.&#8221; The title &#8220;<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of hosts&#8221; here pictures the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> as a mighty warrior-king who leads armies into battle (see Pss 24:10; 46:7, 11).</p>
<A NAME="4818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1766><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;God makes it secure forever.&#8221; The imperfect highlights the characteristic nature of the generalizing statement.</p>
<A NAME="4819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1767><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;like your name, O God, so [is] your praise to the ends of the earth.&#8221; Here &#8220;name&#8221; refers to God&#8217;s reputation and revealed character.</p>
<A NAME="4820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1768><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your right hand is full of justice.&#8221; The &#8220;right hand&#8221; suggests activity and power.</p>
<A NAME="4821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1769><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;daughters.&#8221; The reference is to the cities of Judah surrounding Zion (see Ps 97:8 and H. Haag, <i>TDOT</i> 2:336).</p>
<A NAME="4822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1770><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal forms are understood as generalizing imperfects. (For other examples of an imperfect followed by causal <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</font> [<font face="Scholar">lÿma</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">an</font>], see Ps 23:3; Isa 49:7; 55:5.) Another option is to interpret the forms as jussives, &#8220;Let Mount Zion rejoice! Let the towns of Judah be happy!&#8221; (cf. NASB, NRSV; note the imperatives in vv. 12-13.)</p>
<A NAME="4823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1771><b>sn</b> These <i>acts of judgment</i> are described in vv. 4-7.</p>
<A NAME="4824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1772><b>tn</b> The verb forms in vv. 12-13 are plural; the entire Judahite community is addressed.</p>
<A NAME="4825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1773><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;set your heart to its rampart.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1774><b>tn</b> The precise meaning of the Hebrew word translated &#8220;walk through,&#8221; which occurs only here in the OT, is uncertain. Cf. NEB &#8220;pass&#8230;in review&#8221;; NIV &#8220;view.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1775><b>sn</b> The city&#8217;s <i>towers</i>, <i>defenses</i>, and <i>fortresses</i> are outward reminders and tangible symbols of the divine protection the city enjoys.</p>
<A NAME="4828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1776><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for this is God, our God, forever and ever.&#8221; &#8220;This&#8221; might be paraphrased, &#8220;this protector described and praised in the preceding verses.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1777><b>tn</b> The imperfect highlights the characteristic nature of the generalizing statement.</p>
<A NAME="4830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1778><b>tn</b> In the Hebrew text the psalm ends with the words <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al-mut</font>, &#8220;upon [unto?] dying&#8221;), which make little, if any, sense. M. Dahood (<i>Psalms </i>[AB], 1:293) proposes an otherwise unattested plural form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">olamot</font>; from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">olam</font>, &#8220;eternity&#8221;). This would provide a nice parallel to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1501; &#1493;&#1464;&#1506;&#1462;&#1491;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">olam va</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ed</font>, &#8220;forever&#8221;) in the preceding line, but elsewhere the plural of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1501;</font> appears as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">olamim</font>). It is preferable to understand the phrase as a musical direction of some sort (see <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al-mut</font>] in the superscription of Ps 9) or to emend the text to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1464;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al-</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alamot</font>, &#8220;according to the <i>alamoth</i> style&#8221;; see the heading of Ps 46). In either case it should be understood as belonging with the superscription of the following psalm.</p>
