<A NAME="9914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=3459><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a God of lifting up [i.e., forgiveness] you were to them, and an avenger concerning their deeds.&#8221; The present translation reflects the traditional interpretation, which understands the last line as qualifying the preceding one. God forgave Moses and Aaron, but he also disciplined them when they sinned (cf. NIV, NRSV). Another option is to take &#8220;their deeds&#8221; as referring to harmful deeds directed against Moses and Aaron. In this case the verse may be translated, &#8220;and one who avenged attacks against them.&#8221; Still another option is to emend the participial form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1465;&#1511;&#1461;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">noqem</font>, &#8220;an avenger&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1465;&#1511;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">noqam</font>), a rare Qal participial form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">naqah</font>, &#8220;purify&#8221;) with a suffixed pronoun. In this case one could translate, &#8220;and one who purified them from their [sinful] deeds&#8221; (cf. NEB &#8220;and held them innocent&#8221;).</p>
