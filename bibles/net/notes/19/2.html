<A NAME="21"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=30><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 2</i>. In this royal psalm the author asserts the special status of the divinely chosen Davidic king and warns the nations and their rulers to submit to the authority of God and his chosen vice-regent.</p>
<A NAME="22"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=31><b>tn</b> The question is rhetorical. Rather than seeking information, the psalmist expresses his outrage that the nations would have the audacity to rebel against God and his chosen king.</p>
<A NAME="23"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=32><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ragash</font>) occurs only here. In Dan 6:6, 11, 15 the Aramaic cognate verb describes several officials acting as a group. A Hebrew nominal derivative is used in Ps 55:14 of a crowd of people in the temple.</p>
<A NAME="24"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=33><b>tn</b> The interrogative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lamah</font>, &#8220;why?&#8221;) is understood by ellipsis in the second line.</p>
<A NAME="25"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=34><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;peoples&#8221; (so many English versions).</p>
<A NAME="26"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=35><b>tn</b> The Hebrew imperfect form describes the rebellion as underway. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1490;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hagah</font>), which means &#8220;to recite quietly, meditate,&#8221; here has the metonymic nuance &#8220;devise, plan, plot&#8221; (see Ps 38:12; Prov 24:2).</p>
<A NAME="27"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=36><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;devising emptiness.&#8221; The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">riq</font>, &#8220;emptiness&#8221;) may characterize their behavior as &#8220;worthless, morally bankrupt&#8221; but more likely refers to the outcome of their plots (i.e., failure). As the rest of the psalm emphasizes, their rebellion will fail.</p>
<A NAME="28"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=37><b>sn</b> The expression<i> kings of the earth</i> refers somewhat hyperbolically to the kings who had been conquered by and were subject to the Davidic king.</p>
<A NAME="29"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=38><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;take their stand.&#8221; The Hebrew imperfect verbal form describes their action as underway.</p>
<A NAME="210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=39><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;conspire together.&#8221; The verbal form is a Niphal from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yasad</font>). BDB 413-14 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1491;</font> defines the verb as &#8220;establish, found,&#8221; but <i>HALOT</i> 417 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1505;&#1491;</font> proposes a homonym meaning &#8220;get together, conspire&#8221; (an alternate form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">sud</font>).</p>
<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=40><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and against his anointed one.&#8221; The Davidic king is the referent (see vv. 6-7).</p>
<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=41><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;they say&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarification. The quotation represents the words of the rebellious kings.</p>
<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=42><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;their (i.e., the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s and the king&#8217;s) shackles.&#8221; The kings compare the rule of the Lord and his vice-regent to being imprisoned.</p>
<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=43><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;throw off from us.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=44><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sitting.&#8221; The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yashav</font>) is here used metonymically of &#8220;sitting enthroned&#8221; (see Pss 9:7; 29:10; 55:19; 102:12; 123:1).</p>
<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=45><b>tn</b> As the next line indicates, this refers to derisive laughter. The Hebrew imperfect verbal forms in vv. 4-5 describe the action from the perspective of an eyewitness who is watching the divine response as it unfolds before his eyes.</p>
<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=46><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;scoffs at&#8221;; &#8220;derides&#8221;; &#8220;mocks.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=47><b>sn</b> <i>And terrifies them in his rage.</i> This line focuses on the effect that God&#8217;s angry response (see previous line) has on the rebellious kings.</p>
<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=48><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;saying&#8221; is supplied in the translation for clarification to indicate that the speaker is the Lord (cf. RSV, NIV).</p>
<A NAME="220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=49><b>tn</b> The first person pronoun appears before the first person verbal form for emphasis, reflected in the translation by &#8220;myself.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=50><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;consecrated.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=51><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;the king says&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarification. The speaker is the Lord&#8217;s chosen king.</p>
<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=52><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I will relate the decree. The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said to me&#8221; (in accordance with the Masoretic accentuation).</p>
<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=53><b>sn</b> <i>&#8216;You are my son!&#8217;</i> The Davidic king was viewed as God&#8217;s &#8220;son&#8221; (see 2 Sam 7:14; Ps 89:26-27). The idiom reflects ancient Near Eastern adoption language associated with covenants of grant, by which a lord would reward a faithful subject by elevating him to special status, referred to as &#8220;sonship.&#8221; Like a son, the faithful subject received an &#8220;inheritance,&#8221; viewed as an unconditional, eternal gift. Such gifts usually took the form of land and/or an enduring dynasty. See M. Weinfeld, &#8220;The Covenant of Grant in the Old Testament and in the Ancient Near East,&#8221; <i>JAOS</i> 90 (1970): 184-203, for general discussion and some striking extra-biblical parallels.</p>
<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=54><b>sn</b> <i>I will give you the nations.</i> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> promises the Davidic king universal dominion.</p>
<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=55><b>tc</b> The LXX reads &#8220;you will shepherd them.&#8221; This reading, quoted in the Greek text of the NT in Rev 2:27; 12:5; 19:15, assumes a different vocalization of the consonantal Hebrew text and understands the verb as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>, &#8220;to shepherd&#8221;) rather than <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">a</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to break&#8221;). But the presence of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nafats</font>, &#8220;to smash&#8221;) in the next line strongly favors the MT vocalization.</p>
<A NAME="227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=56><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1489;&#1462;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shevet</font>) can refer to a &#8220;staff&#8221; or &#8220;rod,&#8221; but here it probably refers to the Davidic king&#8217;s royal scepter, symbolizing his sovereignty.</p>
<A NAME="228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=57><b>sn</b> <i>Like a potter</i>&#8217;<i>s jar</i>. Before the Davidic king&#8217;s awesome power, the rebellious nations are like fragile pottery.</p>
<A NAME="229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=58><b>sn</b> The speaker here is either the psalmist or the Davidic king, who now addresses the rebellious <i>kings</i>.</p>
<A NAME="230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=59><b>tn</b> The Niphal has here a tolerative nuance; the kings are urged to submit themselves to the advice being offered.</p>
<A NAME="231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=60><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb translated &#8220;serve&#8221; refers here to submitting to the Lord&#8217;s sovereignty as expressed through the rule of the Davidic king. Such &#8220;service&#8221; would involve maintaining allegiance to the Davidic king by paying tribute on a regular basis.</p>
<A NAME="232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=61><b>tn</b> Traditionally, &#8220;rejoice with trembling&#8221; (KJV). The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gil</font>) normally means &#8220;rejoice,&#8221; but this meaning does not fit well here in conjunction with &#8220;in trembling.&#8221; Some try to understand &#8220;trembling&#8221; (and the parallel <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yir</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>, &#8220;fear&#8221;) in the sense of &#8220;reverential awe&#8221; and then take the verbs &#8220;serve&#8221; and &#8220;rejoice&#8221; in the sense of &#8220;worship&#8221; (cf. NASB). But <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adah</font>, &#8220;trembling&#8221;) and its related terms consistently refer to utter terror and fear (see Exod 15:15; Job 4:14; Pss 48:6; 55:5; 104:32; Isa 33:14; Dan 10:11) or at least great emotional distress (Ezra 10:9). It seems more likely here that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;</font> carries its polarized meaning &#8220;mourn, lament,&#8221; as in Hos 10:5. &#8220;Mourn, lament&#8221; would then be metonymic in this context for &#8220;repent&#8221; (referring to one&#8217;s rebellious ways). On the meaning of the verb in Hos 10:5, see F. I. Andersen and D. N. Freedman, <i>Hosea </i>(AB), 556-57.</p>
<A NAME="233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=62><b>tn</b> Traditionally, &#8220;kiss the son&#8221; (KJV). But <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bar</font>) is the Aramaic word for &#8220;son,&#8221; not the Hebrew. For this reason many regard the reading as suspect. Some propose emendations of vv. 11b-12a. One of the more popular proposals is to read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492; &#1504;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1456;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1490;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bir</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adah nashÿqu lÿraslayv</font>, &#8220;in trembling kiss his feet&#8221;). It makes better sense to understand <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bar</font>) as an adjective meaning &#8220;pure&#8221; (see Pss 24:4; 73:1 and BDB 141 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;</font> 3) functioning here in an adverbial sense. If read this way, then the syntactical structure of exhortation (imperative followed by adverbial modifier) corresponds to the two preceding lines (see v. 11). The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nashaq</font>, &#8220;kiss&#8221;) refers metonymically to showing homage (see 1 Sam 10:1; Hos 13:2). The exhortation in v. 12a advocates a genuine expression of allegiance and warns against insincerity. When swearing allegiance, vassal kings would sometimes do so insincerely, with the intent of rebelling when the time was right. The so-called &#8220;Vassal Treaties of Esarhaddon&#8221; also warn against such an attitude. In this treaty the vassal is told: &#8220;If you, as you stand on the soil where this oath [is sworn], swear the oath with your words and lips [only], do not swear with your entire heart, do not transmit it to your sons who will live after this treaty, if you take this <i>curse</i> upon yourselves but do not plan to keep the treaty of Esarhaddon&#8230;may your sons and grandsons because of this fear in the future&#8221; (see J. B. Pritchard, ed., <i>The Ancient Near East</i>, 2:62).</p>
<A NAME="234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=63><b>tn</b> Throughout the translation of this verse the third person masculine pronouns refer to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> (cf. v. 11).</p>
<A NAME="235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=64><b>tn</b> The implied subject of the verb is the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, mentioned in v. 11. Elsewhere the subject of this verb is consistently the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, suggesting it may be a technical term for divine anger. Anger is here used metonymically for judgment, as the following statement makes clear. A Moabite cognate occurs in the Mesha inscription, where it is used of the Moabite god Chemosh&#8217;s anger at his people (see J. B. Pritchard, ed., <i>The Ancient Near East</i>, 1:209).</p>
<A NAME="236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=65><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and you will perish [in the] way.&#8221; The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">derekh</font>, &#8220;way&#8221;) here refers to their rebellious behavior (not to a pathway, as often understood). It functions syntactically as an adverbial accusative in relation to the verb &#8220;perish.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=66><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;burns.&#8221; The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s anger is compared here to fire, the most destructive force known in ancient Israel.</p>
<A NAME="238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=67><b>tn</b> The Hebrew noun is an abstract plural. The word often refers metonymically to the happiness that God-given security and prosperity produce (see Pss 1:1; 34:9; 41:1; 65:4; 84:12; 89:15; 106:3; 112:1; 127:5; 128:1; 144:15).</p>
<A NAME="239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=68><b>sn</b> <i>Who take shelter in him</i>. &#8220;Taking shelter&#8221; in the Lord is an idiom for seeking his protection. Seeking his protection presupposes and even demonstrates the subject&#8217;s loyalty to the Lord. In the psalms those who &#8220;take shelter&#8221; in the Lord are contrasted with the wicked and equated with those who love, fear, and serve the Lord (Pss 5:11-12; 31:17-20; 34:21-22).</p>
