<A NAME="6711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2375><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;will fear him.&#8221; After the jussive of the preceding line, the prefixed verbal form with prefixed <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) conjunctive is understood as indicating purpose/result. (Note how v. 3 anticipates the universal impact of God showing his people blessing.) Another option is to take the verb as a jussive and translate, &#8220;Let all the ends of the earth fear him.&#8221;</p>
