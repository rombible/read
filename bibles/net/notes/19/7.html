<A NAME="71"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=184><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 7</i>. The psalmist asks the Lord to intervene and deliver him from his enemies. He protests his innocence and declares his confidence in God&#8217;s justice.</p>
<A NAME="72"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=185><b>tn</b> The precise meaning of the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shiggayon</font>; translated here &#8220;musical composition&#8221;) is uncertain. Some derive the noun from the verbal root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1490;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shagah</font>, &#8220;swerve, reel&#8221;) and understand it as referring to a &#8220;wild, passionate song, with rapid changes of rhythm&#8221; (see BDB 993 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font>). But this proposal is purely speculative. The only other appearance of the noun is in Hab 3:1, where it occurs in the plural.</p>
<A NAME="73"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=186><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;on account of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="74"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=187><b>sn</b> Apparently this individual named <i>Cush</i> was one of David&#8217;s enemies.</p>
<A NAME="75"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=188><b>tn</b> The Hebrew perfect verbal form probably refers here to a completed action with continuing results.</p>
<A NAME="76"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=189><b>tn</b> The verb is singular in the Hebrew text, even though &#8220;all who chase me&#8221; in v. 1 refers to a whole group of enemies. The singular is also used in vv. 4-5, but the psalmist returns to the plural in v. 6. The singular is probably collective, emphasizing the united front that the psalmist&#8217;s enemies present. This same alternation between a collective singular and a plural referring to enemies appears in Pss 9:3, 6; 13:4; 31:4, 8; 41:6, 10-11; 42:9-10; 55:3; 64:1-2; 74:3-4; 89:22-23; 106:10-11; 143:3, 6, 9.</p>
<A NAME="77"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=190><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my life.&#8221; The pronominal suffix attached to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>) is equivalent to a personal pronoun. See Ps 6:3.</p>
<A NAME="78"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=191><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;tearing and there is no one rescuing.&#8221; The verbal form translated &#8220;tearing&#8221; is a singular active participle.</p>
<A NAME="79"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=192><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;if I have done this.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=193><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;if there is injustice in my hands.&#8221; The &#8220;hands&#8221; figuratively suggest deeds or actions.</p>
<A NAME="711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=194><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;if I have repaid the one at peace with me evil.&#8221; The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sholÿmi</font>, &#8220;the one at peace with me&#8221;) probably refers to a close friend or ally, i.e., one with whom the psalmist has made a formal agreement. See BDB 1023 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> 4.a.</p>
<A NAME="712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=195><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;or rescued my enemy in vain.&#8221; The preterite with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive (the verb form is pseudo-cohortative; see <i>IBHS</i> 576-77 §34.5.3) carries on the hypothetical nuance of the perfect in the preceding line. Some regard the statement as a parenthetical assertion that the psalmist is kind to his enemies. Others define <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khalats</font>) as &#8220;despoil&#8221; (cf. NASB, NRSV &#8220;plundered&#8221;; NIV &#8220;robbed&#8221;), an otherwise unattested nuance for this verb. Still others emend the verb to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lakhats</font>, &#8220;oppress&#8221;). Most construe the adverb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;&#1511;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">reqam</font>, &#8220;emptily, vainly&#8221;) with &#8220;my enemy,&#8221; i.e., the one who is my enemy in vain.&#8221; The present translation (1) assumes an emendation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsorÿriy</font>, &#8220;my enemy&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsorÿro</font>, &#8220;his [i.e., the psalmist&#8217;s ally&#8217;s] enemy&#8221;) following J. Tigay, &#8220;Psalm 7:5 and Ancient Near Eastern Treaties,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 89 (1970): 178-86, (2) understands the final <i>mem</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1501;</font>) on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;&#1511;&#1464;&#1501;</font> as enclitic, and (3) takes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">riq</font>) as an adjective modifying &#8220;his enemy.&#8221; (For other examples of a suffixed noun followed by an attributive adjective without the article, see Pss 18:17 (&#8220;my strong enemy&#8221;), 99:3 (&#8220;your great and awesome name&#8221;) and 143:10 (&#8220;your good spirit&#8221;). The adjective <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1511;</font> occurs with the sense &#8220;lawless&#8221; in Judg 9:4; 11:3; 2 Chr 13:7. In this case the psalmist affirms that he has not wronged his ally, nor has he given aid to his ally&#8217;s enemies. Ancient Near Eastern treaties typically included such clauses, with one or both parties agreeing not to lend aid to the treaty partner&#8217;s enemies.</p>
<A NAME="713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=196><b>tn</b> The vocalization of the verb form seems to be a mixture of Qal and Piel (see GKC 168 §63.<i>n</i>). The translation assumes the Piel, which would emphasize the repetitive nature of the action. The translation assumes the prefixed verbal form is a jussive. The psalmist is so certain that he is innocent of the sins mentioned in vv. 3-4, he pronounces an imprecation on himself for rhetorical effect.</p>
<A NAME="714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=197><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my life.&#8221; The pronominal suffix attached to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>) is equivalent to a personal pronoun. See Ps 6:3.</p>
<A NAME="715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=198><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and may he overtake.&#8221; The prefixed verbal form is distinctly jussive. The object &#8220;me,&#8221; though unexpressed, is understood from the preceding statement.</p>
<A NAME="716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=199><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and may he trample down to the earth my life.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=200><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and my honor in the dust may he cause to dwell.&#8221; The prefixed verbal form is distinctly jussive. Some emend <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khÿvodiy</font>, &#8220;my honor&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1456;&#1489;&#1461;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khÿvediy</font>, &#8220;my liver&#8221; as the seat of life), but the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khÿvodiy</font>) is to be retained since it probably refers to the psalmist&#8217;s dignity or honor.</p>
<A NAME="718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=201><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in your anger.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=202><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Lift yourself up in the angry outbursts of my enemies.&#8221; Many understand the preposition prefixed to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avrot</font>, &#8220;angry outbursts&#8221;) as adversative, &#8220;against,&#8221; and the following genitive &#8220;enemies&#8221; as subjective. In this case one could translate, &#8220;rise up against my furious enemies&#8221; (cf. NIV, NRSV). The present translation, however, takes the preposition as indicating manner (cf. &#8220;in your anger&#8221; in the previous line) and understands the plural form of the noun as indicating an abstract quality (&#8220;fury&#8221;) or excessive degree (&#8220;raging fury&#8221;). Cf. Job 21:30.</p>
<A NAME="720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=203><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Wake up to me [with the] judgment [which] you have commanded.&#8221; The LXX understands <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eliy</font>, &#8220;my God&#8221;) instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1463;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elay</font>, &#8220;to me&#8221;; the LXX reading is followed by NEB, NIV, NRSV.) If the reading of the MT is retained, the preposition probably has the sense of &#8220;on account of, for the sake of.&#8221; The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mishpat</font>, &#8220;judgment&#8221;) is probably an adverbial accusative, modifying the initial imperative, &#8220;wake up.&#8221; In this case <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1493;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsivvita</font>, &#8220;[which] you have commanded&#8221;) is an asyndetic relative clause. Some take the perfect as precative. In this case one could translate the final line, &#8220;Wake up for my sake! Decree judgment!&#8221; (cf. NIV). However, not all grammarians are convinced that the perfect is used as a precative in biblical Hebrew.</p>
<A NAME="721"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=204><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the assembly of the peoples surrounds you.&#8221; Some understand the prefixed verbal form as a jussive, &#8220;may the assembly of the peoples surround you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="722"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=205><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;over it (the feminine suffix refers back to the feminine noun &#8220;assembly&#8221; in the preceding line) on high return.&#8221; Some emend <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shuvah</font>, &#8220;return&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shevah</font>, &#8220;sit [in judgment]&#8221;) because they find the implication of &#8220;return&#8221; problematic. But the psalmist does not mean to imply that God has abandoned his royal throne and needs to regain it. Rather he simply urges God, as sovereign king of the world, to once more occupy his royal seat of judgment and execute judgment, as the OT pictures God doing periodically.</p>
<A NAME="723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=206><b>sn</b> <i>The </i><span class="smallcaps">Lord</span><i> judges the nations</i>. In hyperbolic fashion the psalmist pictures the nations assembled around the divine throne (v. 7a). He urges God to take his rightful place on the throne (v. 7b) and then pictures him making judicial decisions that vindicate the innocent (see vv. 8-16).</p>
<A NAME="724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=207><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;judge me, O <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, according to my innocence.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=208><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;according to my blamelessness.&#8221; The imperative verb translated &#8220;vindicate&#8221; governs the second line as well.</p>
<A NAME="726"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=209><b>tn</b> The Hebrew form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alay</font>) has been traditionally understood as the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>, &#8220;over&#8221;) with a first person suffix. But this is syntactically awkward and meaningless. The form is probably a divine title derived from the verbal root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alah</font>, &#8220;ascend&#8221;). This relatively rare title appears elsewhere in the OT (see <i>HALOT</i> 824-25 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font>, though this text is not listed) and in Ugaritic as an epithet for Baal (see G. R. Driver, <i>Canaanite Myths and Legends</i>, 98). See M. Dahood, <i>Psalms </i>(AB), 1:44-45, and P. C. Craigie, <i>Psalms 1-50</i> (WBC), 98.</p>
<A NAME="727"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=210><b>tn</b> In the psalms the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rÿsha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>, &#8220;wicked&#8221;) describes people who are proud, practical atheists (Ps 10:2, 4, 11) who hate God&#8217;s commands, commit sinful deeds, speak lies and slander (Ps 50:16-20), and cheat others (Ps 37:21). They oppose God and his people.</p>
<A NAME="728"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=211><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal form is a jussive, expressing an imprecation here.</p>
<A NAME="729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=212><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the godly&#8221; (see Ps 5:12). The singular form is collective (see the plural &#8220;upright in heart&#8221; in v. 10), though it may reflect the personal focus of the psalmist in this context.</p>
<A NAME="730"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=213><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal form expresses the psalmist&#8217;s prayer or wish.</p>
<A NAME="731"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=214><b>tn</b> For other uses of the verb in this sense, see Job 7:18; Pss 11:4; 26:2; 139:23.</p>
<A NAME="732"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=215><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and [the one who] tests hearts and kidneys, just God.&#8221; The translation inverts the word order to improve the English style. The heart and kidneys were viewed as the seat of one&#8217;s volition, conscience, and moral character.</p>
<A NAME="733"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=216><b>tn</b> Traditionally, &#8220;my shield is upon God&#8221; (cf. NASB). As in v. 8, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) should be understood as a divine title, here compounded with &#8220;God&#8221; (cf. NIV, &#8220;God Most High&#8221;). See M. Dahood, <i>Psalms </i>(AB), 1:45-46. The shield metaphor pictures God as a protector against deadly attacks.</p>
<A NAME="734"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=217><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;pure of heart.&#8221; The &#8220;heart&#8221; is here viewed as the seat of one&#8217;s moral character and motives. The &#8220;pure of heart&#8221; are God&#8217;s faithful followers who trust in and love the Lord and, as a result, experience his deliverance (see Pss 11:2; 32:11; 36:10; 64:10; 94:15; 97:11).</p>
<A NAME="735"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=218><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;God (the divine name <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>] is used) is angry during all the day.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1465;&#1506;&#1461;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">em</font>) means &#8220;be indignant, be angry, curse.&#8221; Here God&#8217;s angry response to wrongdoing and injustice leads him to prepare to execute judgment as described in the following verses.</p>
<A NAME="736"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=219><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;If he&#8221;; the referent (a person who is a sinner) has been specified in the translation for clarity. The subject of the first verb is understood as the sinner who fails to repent of his ways and becomes the target of God&#8217;s judgment (vv. 9, 14-16).</p>
<A NAME="737"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=220><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;if he does not return, his sword he sharpens.&#8221; The referent (God) of the pronominal subject of the second verb (&#8220;sharpens&#8221;) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="738"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=221><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his bow he treads and prepares it.&#8221; &#8220;Treading the bow&#8221; involved stepping on one end of it in order to string it and thus prepare it for battle.</p>
<A NAME="739"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=222><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and for him he prepares the weapons of death.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="740"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=223><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his arrows into flaming [things] he makes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="741"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=224><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he conceives harm and gives birth to a lie.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Pregnant with wickedness&#8230;gives birth to harmful lies</i>. The psalmist metaphorically pictures the typical sinner as a pregnant woman, who is ready to give birth to wicked, destructive schemes and actions.</p>
<A NAME="742"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=225><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a pit he digs and he excavates it.&#8221; Apparently the imagery of hunting is employed; the wicked sinner digs this pit to entrap and destroy his intended victim. The redundancy in the Hebrew text has been simplified in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="743"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=226><b>tn</b> The verb forms in vv. 15-16 describe the typical behavior and destiny of those who attempt to destroy others. The image of the evildoer falling into the very trap he set for his intended victim emphasizes the appropriate nature of God&#8217;s judgment.</p>
<A NAME="744"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=227><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his harm [i.e., the harm he conceived for others, see v. 14] returns on his head.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="745"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=228><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and on his forehead his violence [i.e., the violence he intended to do to others] comes down.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="746"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=229><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;according to.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="747"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=230><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[to] the name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> Most High.&#8221; God&#8217;s &#8220;name&#8221; refers metonymically to his divine characteristics as suggested by his name, in this case the compound &#8220;<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> Most High.&#8221; The divine title &#8220;Most High&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1500;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">elyon</font>) pictures God as the exalted ruler of the universe who vindicates the innocent and judges the wicked. See especially Ps 47:2.</p>
