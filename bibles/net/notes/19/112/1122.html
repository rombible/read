<A NAME="1122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=3910><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[Oh] the happiness [of] the man.&#8221; Hebrew wisdom literature often assumes and reflects the male-oriented perspective of ancient Israelite society. The individual is representative of a larger group, called the &#8220;godly&#8221; in vv. 3-4. The principle of the psalm is certainly applicable to all people, regardless of their gender. To facilitate modern application, we translate the gender specific &#8220;man&#8221; with the more neutral &#8220;one.&#8221; The generic masculine pronoun is used in the following verses.</p>
