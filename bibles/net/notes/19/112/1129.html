<A NAME="1129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=3917><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;merciful and compassionate and just.&#8221; The Hebrew text has three singular adjectives, which are probably substantival and in apposition to the &#8220;godly&#8221; (which is plural, however). By switching to the singular, the psalmist focuses on each individual member of the group known as the &#8220;godly.&#8221; Note how vv. 5-9, like vv. 1-2a, use the singular to describe the representative godly individual who typifies the whole group.</p>
