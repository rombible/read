<A NAME="14112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=4568><b>tn</b> It is unclear how this statement relates to the preceding sentence. Perhaps the judges are the referent of the pronominal subject (&#8220;they&#8221;) of the verb &#8220;will listen,&#8221; and &#8220;my words&#8221; are the referent of the pronominal subject (&#8220;they&#8221;) of the phrase &#8220;are pleasant.&#8221; The psalmist may be affirming here his confidence that he will be vindicated when he presents his case before the judges, while the wicked will be punished.</p>
