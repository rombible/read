<A NAME="14111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=4567><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they are thrown down by the hands of a cliff, their judges.&#8221; The syntax of the Hebrew text is difficult and the meaning uncertain. The perfect verbal form is understood as rhetorical; the psalmist describes the anticipated downfall of the wicked as if it had already occurred. &#8220;Their judges&#8221; could be taken as the subject of the verb, but this makes little, if any, sense. The translation assumes the judges are the agents and that the wicked, mentioned earlier in the psalm, are the subjects of the verb.</p>
