<A NAME="501"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1826><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 50</i>. This psalm takes the form of a covenant lawsuit in which the Lord comes to confront his people in a formal manner (as in Isa 1:2-20). The Lord emphasizes that he places priority on obedience and genuine worship, not empty ritual.</p>
<A NAME="502"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1827><b>sn</b> Israel&#8217;s God is here identified with three names: El (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>], or &#8220;God&#8221;), Elohim (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohim</font>], or &#8220;God&#8221;), and Yahweh (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">yÿhvah</font>] or &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221;). There is an obvious allusion here to Josh 22:22, the only other passage where these three names appear in succession. In that passage the Reubenites, Gadites, and half-tribe of Manasseh declare, &#8220;El, God, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>! El, God, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>! He knows the truth! Israel must also know! If we have rebelled or disobeyed the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, don&#8217;t spare us today!&#8221; In that context the other tribes had accused the trans-Jordanian tribes of breaking God&#8217;s covenant by worshiping idols. The trans-Jordanian tribes appealed to &#8220;El, God, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221; as their witness that they were innocent of the charges brought against them. Ironically here in Ps 50 &#8220;<i>El, God, the </i><span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221; accuses his sinful covenant people of violating the covenant and warns that he will not spare them if they persist in their rebellion.</p>
<A NAME="503"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1828><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and calls [the] earth from the sunrise to its going.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="504"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1829><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the perfection of beauty.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="505"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1830><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;shines forth.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Comes in splendor</i>. The psalmist may allude ironically to Deut 33:2, where God &#8220;shines forth&#8221; from Sinai and comes to superintend Moses&#8217; blessing of the tribes.</p>
<A NAME="506"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1831><b>tn</b> According to GKC 322 §109.<i>e</i>, the jussive (note the negative particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) is used rhetorically here &#8220;to express the conviction that something cannot or should not happen.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="507"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1832><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fire before him devours, and around him it is very stormy.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="508"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1833><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;to testify against his people.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The personified<i> heavens</i> and <i>earth</i> (see v. 1 as well) are summoned to God&#8217;s courtroom as witnesses against God&#8217;s covenant people (see Isa 1:2). Long before this Moses warned the people that the heavens and earth would be watching their actions (see Deut 4:26; 30:19; 31:28; 32:1).</p>
<A NAME="509"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1834><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;he says&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarification. God&#8217;s summons to the defendant follows.</p>
<A NAME="5010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1835><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Gather to me my covenant people.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1505;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khasid</font>, &#8220;covenant people&#8221;) elsewhere in the psalms is used in a positive sense of God&#8217;s loyal followers (see the note at Ps 4:3), but here, as the following line makes clear, the term has a neutral sense and simply refers to those who have outwardly sworn allegiance to God, not necessarily to those whose loyalty is genuine.</p>
<A NAME="5011"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1836><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the cutters of my covenant according to sacrifice.&#8221; A sacrifice accompanied the covenant-making ceremony and formally ratified the agreement (see Exod 24:3-8).</p>
<A NAME="5012"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1837><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;justice.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5013"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1838><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;for God, he is about to judge.&#8221; The participle may be taken as substantival (as in the translation above) or as a predicate (indicating imminent future action in this context).</p>
<A NAME="5014"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1839><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;he says&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarification. God&#8217;s charges against his people follow.</p>
<A NAME="5015"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1840><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Israel, and I will testify against you.&#8221; The imperative &#8220;listen&#8221; is understood in the second line by ellipsis (note the preceding line).</p>
<A NAME="5016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1841><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;rebuking.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5017"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1842><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and your burnt sacrifices before me continually.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5018"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1843><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I will not take.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5019"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1844><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[the] animals on a thousand hills.&#8221; The words &#8220;that graze&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarification. The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1461;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿhemot</font>, &#8220;animal&#8221;) refers here to cattle (see Ps 104:14).</p>
<A NAME="5020"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1845><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I know.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1846><b>tn</b> The precise referent of the Hebrew word, which occurs only here and in Ps 80:13, is uncertain. Aramaic, Arabic and Akkadian cognates refer to insects, such as locusts or crickets.</p>
<A NAME="5022"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1847><b>tn</b> The rhetorical questions assume an emphatic negative response, &#8220;Of course not!&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1848><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Most High.&#8221; This divine title (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1500;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">elyon</font>) pictures God as the exalted ruler of the universe who vindicates the innocent and judges the wicked. See especially Pss 7:17; 9:2; 18:13; 21:7; 47:2.</p>
<A NAME="5024"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1849><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;call [to] me in a day of trouble.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5025"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1850><b>sn</b> In vv. 7-15 the Lord makes it clear that he was not rebuking Israel because they had failed to offer sacrifices (v. 8a). On the contrary, they had been faithful in doing so (v. 8b). However, their understanding of the essence of their relationship with God was confused. Apparently they believed that he needed/desired such sacrifices and that offering them would ensure their prosperity. But the Lord owns all the animals of the world and did not need Israel&#8217;s meager sacrifices (vv. 9-13). Other aspects of the relationship were more important to the Lord. He desired Israel to be thankful for his blessings (v. 14a), to demonstrate gratitude for his intervention by repaying the vows they made to him (v. 14b), and to acknowledge their absolute dependence on him (v. 15a). Rather than viewing their sacrifices as somehow essential to God&#8217;s well-being, they needed to understand their dependence on him.</p>
<A NAME="5026"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1851><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;evil [one].&#8221; The singular adjective is used here in a representative sense; it refers to those within the larger covenant community who have blatantly violated the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s commandments. In the psalms the &#8220;wicked&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">rÿsha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>) are typically proud, practical atheists (Ps 10:2, 4, 11) who hate God&#8217;s commands, commit sinful deeds, speak lies and slander, and cheat others (Ps 37:21).</p>
<A NAME="5027"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1852><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;What to you to declare my commands and lift up my covenant upon your mouth?&#8221; The rhetorical question expresses sarcastic amazement. The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is shocked that such evildoers would give lip-service to his covenantal demands, for their lifestyle is completely opposed to his standards (see vv. 18-20).</p>
<A NAME="5028"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1853><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and throw my words behind you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5029"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1854><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you run with him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5030"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1855><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and with adulterers [is] your portion.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5031"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1856><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your mouth you send with evil.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5032"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1857><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and your tongue binds together [i.e., &#8220;frames&#8221;] deceit.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5033"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1858><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you sit, against your brother you speak.&#8221; To &#8220;sit&#8221; and &#8220;speak&#8221; against someone implies plotting against that person (see Ps 119:23).</p>
<A NAME="5034"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1859><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;against the son of your mother you give a fault.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5035"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1860><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;these things you did and I was silent.&#8221; Some interpret the second clause (&#8220;and I was silent&#8221;) as a rhetorical question expecting a negative answer, &#8220;[When you do these things], should I keep silent?&#8221; (cf. NEB). See GKC 335 §112.<i>cc</i>.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Lord <i>was silent</i> in the sense that he delayed punishment. Of course, God&#8217;s patience toward sinners eventually runs out. The divine &#8220;silence&#8221; is only temporary (see v. 3, where the psalmist, having described God&#8217;s arrival, observes that &#8220;he is not silent&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="5036"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1861><b>tn</b> The Hebrew infinitive construct (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1457;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">heyot</font>) appears to function like the infinitive absolute here, adding emphasis to the following finite verbal form (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1492;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">ehyeh</font>). See GKC 339-40 §113.<i>a</i>. Some prefer to emend <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1457;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">heyot</font>) to the infinitive absolute form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hayo</font>).</p>
<A NAME="5037"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1862><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;rebuke&#8221; (see v. 8).</p>
<A NAME="5038"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1863><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and I will set in order [my case against you] to your eyes.&#8221; The cohortative form expresses the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s resolve to accuse and judge the wicked.</p>
<A NAME="5039"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1864><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[you who] forget God.&#8221; &#8220;Forgetting God&#8221; here means forgetting about his commandments and not respecting his moral authority.</p>
<A NAME="5040"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1865><b>sn</b> Elsewhere in the psalms this verb is used (within a metaphorical framework) of a lion tearing its prey (see Pss 7:2; 17:12; 22:13).</p>
<A NAME="5041"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1866><b>sn</b> The reference to a <i>thank-offering</i> recalls the earlier statement made in v. 14. Gratitude characterizes genuine worship.</p>
<A NAME="5042"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1867><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and [to one who] sets a way I will show the deliverance of God.&#8221; Elsewhere the phrase &#8220;set a way&#8221; simply means &#8220;to travel&#8221; (see Gen 30:36; cf. NRSV). The present translation assumes an emendation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1501; &#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿsam derekh</font>) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1502;&#1461;&#1512; &#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿshomer dÿrakhay</font>, &#8220;and [the one who] keeps my ways&#8221; [i.e., commands, see Pss 18:21; 37:34). Another option is to read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1502;&#1461;&#1512; &#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿshomer darko</font>, &#8220;and [the one who] guards his way,&#8221; i.e., &#8220;the one who is careful to follow a godly lifestyle&#8221;; see Ps 39:1).</p>
