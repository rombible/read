<A NAME="1461"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=4686><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 146</i>. The psalmist urges his audience not to trust in men, but in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the just king of the world who cares for the needy.</p>
<A NAME="1462"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=4687><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in a son of man, to whom there is no deliverance.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1463"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=4688><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his spirit goes out, it returns to his ground; in that day his plans die.&#8221; The singular refers to the representative man mentioned in v. 3b.</p>
<A NAME="1464"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4689><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the one who guards faithfulness forever.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1465"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=4690><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;executes justice for the oppressed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1466"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=4691><b>tn</b> Perhaps &#8220;discouraged&#8221; (see Ps 57:6).</p>
<A NAME="1467"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=4692><b>sn</b> God is depicted here as a just ruler. In the ancient Near Eastern world a king was responsible for promoting justice, including caring for the weak and vulnerable, epitomized by resident aliens, the fatherless, and widows.</p>
<A NAME="1468"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=4693><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he makes the way of the wicked twisted.&#8221; The &#8220;way of the wicked&#8221; probably refers to their course of life (see Prov 4:19; Jer 12:1). God makes their path tortuous in the sense that he makes them pay the harmful consequences of their actions.</p>
<A NAME="1469"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=4694><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for a generation and a generation.&#8221;</p>
