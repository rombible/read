The prefixed verbal form could be taken as jussive of prayer (&#8220;may the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> deliver,&#8221; see v. 2), but the preceding parallel line is a declaration of fact, not a prayer per se. The imperfect can be taken here as future (&#8220;will deliver,&#8221; cf. NEB, NASB) or as generalizing (&#8220;delivers,&#8221; cf. NIV, NRSV). The parallel line, which has a generalizing tone, favors the latter. At the same time, though the psalmist uses a generalizing style here, he clearly has himself primarily in view.</p>
