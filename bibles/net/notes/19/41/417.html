<A NAME="417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1488><b>tc</b> The translation follows the consonantal Hebrew text (<i>Kethib</i>), which has a Pual (passive) prefixed form, regarded here as a jussive. The Pual of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ashar</font>) also appears in Prov 3:18. The marginal reading (<i>Qere</i>) assumes a <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive and Pual perfect. Some, with the support of the LXX, change the verb to a Piel (active) form with an objective pronominal suffix, &#8220;and may he bless him,&#8221; or &#8220;and he will bless him&#8221; (cf. NIV).</p>
