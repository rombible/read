<A NAME="411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1482><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 41</i>. The psalmist is confident (vv. 11-12) that the Lord has heard his request to be healed (vv. 4-10), and he anticipates the joy he will experience when the Lord intervenes (vv. 1-3). One must assume that the psalmist is responding to a divine oracle of assurance (see P. C. Craigie, <i>Psalms 1-50</i> [WBC], 319-20). The final verse is a fitting conclusion to this psalm, but it is also serves as a fitting conclusion to the first &#8220;book&#8221; (or major editorial division) of the Psalter. Similar statements appear at or near the end of each of the second, third, and fourth &#8220;books&#8221; of the Psalter (see Pss 72:19, 89:52, and 106:48 respectively).</p>
