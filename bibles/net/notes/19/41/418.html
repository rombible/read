<A NAME="418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1489><b>tn</b> The negative particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) before the prefixed verbal form indicates the verb is a jussive and the statement a prayer. Those who want to take v. 2 as a statement of confidence suggest emending the negative particle to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;), which is used with the imperfect. See the earlier note on the verbal forms in line one of this verse. According to GKC 322 §109.<i>e</i>, this is a case where the jussive is used rhetorically to &#8220;express that something cannot or should not happen.&#8221; In this case one might translate, &#8220;you will not turn him over to his enemies,&#8221; and take the preceding verbal forms as indicative in mood.</p>
