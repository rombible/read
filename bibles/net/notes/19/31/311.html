<A NAME="311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1068><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 31</i>. The psalmist confidently asks the Lord to protect him. Enemies threaten him and even his friends have abandoned him, but he looks to the Lord for vindication. In vv. 19-24, which were apparently written after the Lord answered the prayer of vv. 1-18, the psalmist thanks the Lord for delivering him.</p>
