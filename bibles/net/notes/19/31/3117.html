<A NAME="3117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1084><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my breath and my stomach [grow weak].&#8221; Apparently the verb in the previous line (&#8220;grow dim, be weakened&#8221;) is to be understood here. The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;</font> can mean &#8220;life,&#8221; or, more specifically, &#8220;throat, breath.&#8221; The psalmist seems to be lamenting that his breathing is impaired because of the physical and emotional suffering he is forced to endure.</p>
