<A NAME="3111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1078><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;redeem.&#8221; The perfect verbal form is understood here as anticipatory, indicating rhetorically the psalmist&#8217;s certitude and confidence that God will intervene. The psalmist is so confident of God&#8217;s positive response to his prayer that he can describe his deliverance as if it had already happened. Another option is to take the perfect as precative, expressing a wish or request (&#8220;rescue me&#8221;; cf. NIV). See <i>IBHS</i> 494-95 §30.5.4c, d. However, not all grammarians are convinced that the perfect is used as a precative in biblical Hebrew.</p>
