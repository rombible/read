<A NAME="821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=3005><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 82</i>. The psalmist pictures God standing in the &#8220;assembly of El&#8221; where he accuses the &#8220;gods&#8221; of failing to promote justice on earth. God pronounces sentence upon them, announcing that they will die like men. Having witnessed the scene, the psalmist then asks God to establish his just rule over the earth.</p>
<A NAME="822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=3006><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;presides over.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3007><b>tn</b> The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1491;&#1463;&#1514; &#1488;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adat </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>, &#8220;assembly of El&#8221;) appears only here in the OT. (1) Some understand &#8220;El&#8221; to refer to God himself. In this case he is pictured presiding over his own heavenly assembly. (2) Others take <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;</font> as a superlative here (&#8220;God stands in the <i>great</i> assembly&#8221;), as in Pss 36:6 and 80:10. (3) The present translation assumes this is a reference to the Canaanite high god El, who presided over the Canaanite divine assembly. (See Isa 14:13, where El&#8217;s assembly is called &#8220;the stars of El.&#8221;) In the Ugaritic myths the phrase &#8217;<font face="Scholar">dt </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ilm</font> refers to the &#8220;assembly of the gods,&#8221; who congregate in King Kirtu&#8217;s house, where Baal asks El to bless Kirtu&#8217;s house (see G. R. Driver, <i>Canaanite Myths and Legends</i>, 91). If the Canaanite divine assembly is referred to here in Ps 82:1, then the psalm must be understood as a bold polemic against Canaanite religion. Israel&#8217;s God invades El&#8217;s assembly, denounces its gods as failing to uphold justice, and announces their coming demise. For an interpretation of the psalm along these lines, see W. VanGemeren, &#8220;Psalms,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 5:533-36.</p>
<A NAME="824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=3008><b>sn</b> The present translation assumes that the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohim</font>, &#8220;gods&#8221;) here refers to the pagan gods who supposedly comprise El&#8217;s assembly according to Canaanite religion. Those who reject the polemical view of the psalm prefer to see the referent as human judges or rulers (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> sometimes refers to officials appointed by God, see Exod 21:6; 22:8-9; Ps 45:6) or as angelic beings (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> sometimes refers to angelic beings, see Gen 3:5; Ps 8:5).</p>
<A NAME="825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=3009><b>sn</b> The picture of God rendering <i>judgment</i> among the gods clearly depicts his sovereign authority as universal king (see v. 8, where the psalmist boldly affirms this truth).</p>
<A NAME="826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=3010><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;he says&#8221; are supplied in the translation to indicate that the following speech is God&#8217;s judicial decision (see v. 1).</p>
<A NAME="827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=3011><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the face of the wicked lift up.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=3012><b>tn</b> The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatom</font>) refers to one who has lost his father (not necessarily his mother, see Ps 109:9). Because they were so vulnerable and were frequently exploited, fatherless children are often mentioned as epitomizing the oppressed (see Pss 10:14; 68:5; 94:6; 146:9; as well as Job 6:27; 22:9; 24:3, 9; 29:12; 31:17, 21).</p>
<A NAME="829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=3013><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;hand.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="8210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=3014><b>sn</b> Having addressed the defendants, God now speaks to those who are observing the trial, referring to the gods in the third person.</p>
<A NAME="8211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=3015><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;walk.&#8221; The Hitpael stem indicates iterative action, picturing these ignorant &#8220;judges&#8221; as stumbling around in the darkness.</p>
<A NAME="8212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=3016><b>sn</b> These gods, though responsible for justice, neglect their duty. Their self-imposed ignorance (which the psalmist compares to stumbling around in the dark) results in widespread injustice, which threatens the social order of the world (the meaning of the phrase <i>all the foundations of the earth crumble</i>).</p>
<A NAME="8213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=3017><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="8214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=3018><b>sn</b> Normally in the OT the title <i>Most High</i> belongs to the God of Israel, but in this context, where the mythological overtones are so strong, it probably refers to the Canaanite high god El (see v. 1, as well as Isa 14:13).</p>
<A NAME="8215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=3019><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;men.&#8221; The point in the context is mortality, however, not maleness.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>You will die like mortals</i>. For the concept of a god losing immortality and dying, see Isa 14:12-15, which alludes to a pagan myth in which the petty god &#8220;Shining One, son of the Dawn,&#8221; is hurled into Sheol for his hubris.</p>
<A NAME="8216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=3020><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;like one of the rulers.&#8221; The comparison does not necessarily imply that they are not rulers. The expression &#8220;like one of&#8221; can sometimes mean &#8220;as one of&#8221; (Gen 49:16; Obad 11) or &#8220;as any other of&#8221; (Judg 16:7, 11).</p>
<A NAME="8217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=3021><b>tn</b> The translation assumes that the Qal of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhal</font>) here means &#8220;to own; to possess,&#8221; and that the imperfect emphasizes a general truth. Another option is to translate the verb as future, &#8220;for you will take possession of all the nations&#8221; (cf. NIV &#8220;all the nations are your inheritance&#8221;).</p>
