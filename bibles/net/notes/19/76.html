<A NAME="761"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2761><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 76</i>. The psalmist depicts God as a mighty warrior who destroys Israel&#8217;s enemies.</p>
<A NAME="762"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2762><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;God is known in Judah.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="763"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2763><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;name,&#8221; which here stands metonymically for God&#8217;s reputation.</p>
<A NAME="764"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2764><b>sn</b> <i>Salem</i> is a shorter name for Jerusalem (see Gen 14:18).</p>
<A NAME="765"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2765><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and his place of refuge is in Salem, and his lair in Zion.&#8221; God may be likened here to a lion (see v. 4).</p>
<A NAME="766"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2766><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;flames of the bow,&#8221; i.e., arrows.</p>
<A NAME="767"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2767><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;shield and sword and battle.&#8221; &#8220;Battle&#8221; probably here stands by metonymy for the weapons of war in general.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This verse may allude to the miraculous defeat of the Assyrians in 701 <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span> (see Isa 36-37).</p>
<A NAME="768"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2768><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;radiant [are] you, majestic from the hills of prey.&#8221; God is depicted as a victorious king and as a lion that has killed its victims.</p>
<A NAME="769"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2769><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;strong of heart.&#8221; In Isa 46:12, the only other text where this phrase appears, it refers to those who are stubborn, but here it seems to describe brave warriors (see the next line).</p>
<A NAME="7610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2770><b>tn</b> The verb is a rare Aramaized form of the Hitpolel (see GKC 149 §54.<i>a</i>, n. 2); the root is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shalal</font>, &#8220;to plunder&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="7611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2771><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they slept [in] their sleep.&#8221; &#8220;Sleep&#8221; here refers to the &#8220;sleep&#8221; of death. A number of modern translations take the phrase to refer to something less than death, however: NASB &#8220;cast into a deep sleep&#8221;; NEB &#8220;fall senseless&#8221;; NIV &#8220;lie still&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;lay stunned.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2772><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and all the men of strength did not find their hands.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2773><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from your shout.&#8221; The noun is derived from the Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ga</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ar</font>), which is often understood to mean &#8220;rebuke.&#8221; In some cases it is apparent that scolding or threatening is in view (see Gen 37:10; Ruth 2:16; Zech 3:2). However, in militaristic contexts this translation is inadequate, for the verb refers in this setting to the warrior&#8217;s battle cry, which terrifies and paralyzes the enemy. See A. Caquot, <i>TDOT</i> 3:53, and note the use of the verb in Pss 68:30; 106:9; Nah 1:4, as well as the related noun in Job 26:11; Pss 9:5; 18:15; 104:7; Isa 50:2; 51:20; 66:15.</p>
<A NAME="7614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2774><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;chariot,&#8221; but even so the term is metonymic for the charioteer.</p>
<A NAME="7615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2775><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he fell asleep, and [the] chariot and [the] horse.&#8221; Once again (see v. 5) &#8220;sleep&#8221; refers here to the &#8220;sleep&#8221; of death.</p>
<A NAME="7616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2776><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and who can stand before you from the time of your anger?&#8221; The Hebrew expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1464;&#1494;</font> (<font face="Scholar">me</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">az</font>, &#8220;from the time of&#8221;) is better emended to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1465;&#1494;</font> (<font face="Scholar">me</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">oz</font>, &#8220;from [i.e., &#8220;because of&#8221;] the strength of your anger&#8221;; see Ps 90:11).</p>
<A NAME="7617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2777><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a [legal] decision,&#8221; or &#8220;sentence.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2778><b>tn</b> &#8220;The earth&#8221; stands here by metonymy for its inhabitants.</p>
<A NAME="7619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2779><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;for.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2780><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the anger of men will praise you.&#8221; This could mean that men&#8217;s anger (subjective genitive), when punished by God, will bring him praise, but this interpretation does not harmonize well with the next line. The translation assumes that God&#8217;s anger is in view here (see v. 7) and that &#8220;men&#8221; is an objective genitive. God&#8217;s angry judgment against men brings him praise because it reveals his power and majesty (see vv. 1-4).</p>
<A NAME="7621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2781><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the rest of anger you put on.&#8221; The meaning of the statement is not entirely clear. Perhaps the idea is that God, as he prepares for battle, girds himself with every last ounce of his anger, as if it were a weapon.</p>
<A NAME="7622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2782><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;all those who surround him&#8221; may refer to the surrounding nations (v. 12 may favor this), but in Ps 89:7 the phrase refers to God&#8217;s heavenly assembly.</p>
<A NAME="7623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2783><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he reduces the spirit of princes.&#8221; According to <i>HALOT</i> 148 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1510;&#1512;</font>, the Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">batsar</font>) is here a <i>hapax legomenon</i> meaning &#8220;reduce, humble.&#8221; The statement is generalizing, with the imperfect tense highlighting God&#8217;s typical behavior.</p>
<A NAME="7624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2784><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[he is] awesome to the kings of the earth.&#8221;</p>
