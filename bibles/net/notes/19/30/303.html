<A NAME="303"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1045><b>tn</b> Elsewhere the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dalah</font>) is used of drawing water from a well (Exod 2:16, 19; Prov 20:5). The psalmist was trapped in the pit leading to Sheol (see v. 3), but the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> hoisted him up. The Piel stem is used here, perhaps suggesting special exertion on the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s part.</p>
