<A NAME="3010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1052><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for [there is] a moment in his anger, [but] life in his favor.&#8221; Because of the parallelism with &#8220;moment,&#8221; some understand <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khayyim</font>) in a quantitative sense: &#8220;lifetime&#8221; (cf. NIV, NRSV). However, the immediate context, which emphasizes deliverance from death (see v. 3), suggests that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> has a qualitative sense: &#8220;physical life&#8221; or even &#8220;prosperous life&#8221; (cf. NEB &#8220;in his favour there is life&#8221;).</p>
