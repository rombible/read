<A NAME="9413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=3376><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[Oh] the happiness [of] the man.&#8221; Hebrew wisdom literature often assumes and reflects the male-oriented perspective of ancient Israelite society. The principle of the psalm is certainly applicable to all people, regardless of their gender or age. To facilitate modern application, we translate the gender and age specific &#8220;man&#8221; with the more neutral &#8220;one.&#8221; The generic masculine pronoun is used in v. 2. </p>
