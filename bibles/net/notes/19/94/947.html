<A NAME="947"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=3370><b>tn</b> The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatom</font>) refers to one who has lost his father (not necessarily his mother, see Ps 109:9). Because they were so vulnerable and were frequently exploited, fatherless children are often mentioned as epitomizing the oppressed (see Pss 10:14; 68:5; 82:3; 146:9; as well as Job 6:27; 22:9; 24:3, 9; 29:12; 31:17, 21).</p>
