<A NAME="531"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=144><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they make smooth their tongue.&#8221; Flattering, deceitful words are in view. See Ps 12:2. The psalmist&#8217;s deceitful enemies are compared to the realm of death/Sheol in v. 9b. Sheol was envisioned as a dark region within the earth, the entrance to which was the grave with its steep slopes (cf. Ps 88:4-6). The enemies&#8217; victims are pictured here as slipping down a steep slope (the enemies&#8217; tongues) and falling into an open grave (their throat) that terminates in destruction in the inner recesses of Sheol (their stomach). The enemies&#8217; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;</font> (&#8220;inward part&#8221;) refers here to their thoughts and motives, which are destructive in their intent. The throat is where these destructive thoughts are transformed into words, and their tongue is what they use to speak the deceitful words that lead their innocent victims to their demise.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> As the psalmist walks down the path in which God leads him, he asks the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> to guide his steps and remove danger from the path (v. 8), because he knows his enemies have &#8220;dug a grave&#8221; for him and are ready to use their deceitful words to &#8220;swallow him up&#8221; like the realm of death (i.e., Sheol) and bring him to ruin.</p>
