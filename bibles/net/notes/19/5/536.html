<A NAME="536"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=149><b>sn</b> <i>Take shelter</i>. &#8220;Taking shelter&#8221; in the Lord is an idiom for seeking his protection. Seeking his protection presupposes and even demonstrates the subject&#8217;s loyalty to the Lord. In the psalms those who &#8220;take shelter&#8221; in the Lord are contrasted with the wicked and equated with those who love, fear and serve the Lord (Pss 5:11-12; 31:17-20; 34:21-22).</p>
