<A NAME="56"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=119><b>tn</b> The imperfect is here understood in a specific future sense; the psalmist is expressing his confidence that God will be willing to hear his request. Another option is to understand the imperfect as expressing the psalmist&#8217;s wish or request. In this case one could translate, &#8220;<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, in the morning hear me.&#8221;</p>
