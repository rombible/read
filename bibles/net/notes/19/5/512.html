<A NAME="512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=125><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has simply the singular form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1506;</font>, which may be taken as an abstract noun &#8220;evil&#8221; (the reference to &#8220;wickedness&#8221; in the preceding line favors this; cf. NEB, NASB, NRSV) or as a substantival adjective &#8220;evil one&#8221; (the references to evil people in the next two verses favor this; cf. NIV &#8220;with you the wicked cannot dwell&#8221;).</p>
