<A NAME="814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=244><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and you make him lack a little from [the] gods [or &#8220;God&#8221;].&#8221; The Piel form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khasar</font>, &#8220;to decrease, to be devoid&#8221;) is used only here and in Eccl 4:8, where it means &#8220;to deprive, to cause to be lacking.&#8221; The prefixed verbal form with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive either carries on the characteristic nuance of the imperfect in v. 5b or indicates a consequence (&#8220;so that you make him&#8230;&#8221;) of the preceding statement (see GKC 328 §111.<i>m</i>). Some prefer to make this an independent clause and translate it as a new sentence, &#8220;You made him&#8230;.&#8221; In this case the statement might refer specifically to the creation of the first human couple, Adam and Eve (cf. Gen 1:26-27). The psalmist does appear to allude to Gen 1:26-27, where mankind is created in the image of God and his angelic assembly (note &#8220;let <i>us</i> make man in <i>our</i> image&#8221; in Gen 1:26). However, the psalmist&#8217;s statement need not be limited in its focus to that historical event, for all mankind shares the image imparted to the first human couple. Consequently the psalmist can speak in general terms of the exalted nature of mankind. The referent of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohim</font>, &#8220;God&#8221; or &#8220;the heavenly beings&#8221;) is unclear. Some understand this as a reference to God alone, but the allusion to Gen 1:26-27 suggests a broader referent, including God and the other heavenly beings (known in other texts as &#8220;angels&#8221;). The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> is also used in this way in Gen 3:5, where the serpent says to the woman, &#8220;you will be like the heavenly beings who know good and evil.&#8221; (Note Gen 3:22, where God says, &#8220;the man has become like <i>one of us</i><b>.</b>&#8221;) Also <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> may refer to the members of the heavenly assembly in Ps 82:1, 6. The LXX (the ancient Greek translation of the OT) reads &#8220;angels&#8221; in Ps 8:5 (this is the source of the quotation of Ps 8:5 in Heb 2:7).</p>
