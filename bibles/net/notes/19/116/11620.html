<A NAME="11620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=3990><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I am your servant, the son of your female servant.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;son of a female servant&#8221; (see also Ps 86:16) is used of a son born to a secondary wife or concubine (Exod 23:12). In some cases the child&#8217;s father is the master of the house (see Gen 21:10, 13; Judg 9:18). The use of the expression here certainly does not imply that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has such a secondary wife or concubine! It is used metaphorically and idiomatically to emphasize the psalmist&#8217;s humility before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and his status as the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s servant.</p>
