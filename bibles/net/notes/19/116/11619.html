<A NAME="11619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=3989><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;precious in the eyes of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> [is] the death of his godly ones.&#8221; The point is not that God delights in or finds satisfaction in the death of his followers! The psalmist, who has been delivered from death, affirms that the life-threatening experiences of God&#8217;s followers get God&#8217;s attention, just as a precious or rare object would attract someone&#8217;s eye. See Ps 72:14 for a similar expression of this belief.</p>
