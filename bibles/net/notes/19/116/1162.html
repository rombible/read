<A NAME="1162"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=3972><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I love because the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> heard my voice, my pleas.&#8221; It is possible that &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221; originally appeared directly after &#8220;I love&#8221; and was later accidentally misplaced. The translation assumes the prefixed verbal form is a preterite. The psalmist recalls that God heard his cry for help (note the perfect in v. 2a and the narrative in vv. 3-4).</p>
