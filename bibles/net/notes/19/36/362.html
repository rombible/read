<A NAME="362"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1284><b>tn</b> In the Hebrew text the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1488;&#1501;</font> (&#8220;oracle&#8221;) appears at the beginning of the next verse (v. 2 in the Hebrew text because the superscription is considered v. 1). The resulting reading, &#8220;an oracle of rebellion for the wicked [is] in the midst of my heart&#8221; (cf. NIV) apparently means that the psalm, which foresees the downfall of the wicked, is a prophetic oracle about the rebellion of the wicked which emerges from the soul of the psalmist. One could translate, &#8220;Here is a poem written as I reflected on the rebellious character of evil men.&#8221; Another option, followed in the translation above, is to attach <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1488;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">um</font>, &#8220;oracle&#8221;) with the superscription. For another example of a Davidic poem being labeled an &#8220;oracle,&#8221; see 2 Sam 23:1.</p>
