<A NAME="3613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1295><b>sn</b> God&#8217;s <i>justice/fairness</i> is firm and reliable like the highest mountains and as abundant as the water in the deepest sea. The psalmist uses a legal metaphor to describe God&#8217;s preservation of his creation. Like a just judge who vindicates the innocent, God protects his creation from destructive forces.</p>
