<A NAME="353"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1225><b>tn</b> Two different types of shields are mentioned here. See also Ezek 38:4. Many modern translations render the first term (translated here &#8220;small shield&#8221;) as &#8220;buckler&#8221; (cf. NASB &#8220;buckler and shield&#8221;; the order is often reversed in the translation, apparently for stylistic reasons: cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV &#8220;shield and buckler&#8221;). The English term &#8220;buckler,&#8221; referring to a small round shield held on the arm to protect the upper body, is unfamiliar to many modern readers, so the term &#8220;small shield&#8221; was used in the present translation for clarity.</p>
