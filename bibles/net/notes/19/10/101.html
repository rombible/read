<A NAME="101"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=304><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 10</i>. Many Hebrew <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> and the ancient Greek version (LXX) combine Psalms 9 and 10 into a single psalm. Taken in isolation, Psalm 10 is a petition for help in which the psalmist urges the Lord to deliver him from his dangerous enemies, whom he describes in vivid and terrifying detail. The psalmist concludes with confidence; he is certain that God&#8217;s justice will prevail.</p>
