<A NAME="105"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=308><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they are trapped in the schemes which they have thought up.&#8221; The referents of the two pronominal suffixes on the verbs have been specified in the translation for clarity. The referent of the first suffix (&#8220;they&#8221;) is taken as the oppressed, while the referent of the second (&#8220;they&#8221;) is taken to be the wicked (cf. NIV, which renders &#8220;wicked&#8221; in the previous line as a collective singular). Others take the referent of both occurrences of &#8220;they&#8221; in the line to be the wicked (cf. NRSV, &#8220;let them be caught in the schemes they have devised&#8221;).</p>
