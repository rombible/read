<A NAME="1045"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=348><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you seek his wickedness.&#8221; As in v. 13, the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">darash</font>, &#8220;seek&#8221;) is used here in the sense of &#8220;seek an accounting.&#8221; One could understand the imperfect as describing a fact, &#8220;you hold him accountable,&#8221; or as anticipating divine judgment, &#8220;you will hold him accountable.&#8221; However, since the verb is in apparent parallelism with the preceding imperative (&#8220;break&#8221;), it is better to understand the imperfect as expressing the psalmist&#8217;s desire or request.</p>
