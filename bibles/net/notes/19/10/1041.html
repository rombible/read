<A NAME="1041"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=344><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to give into your hand, upon you, he abandons, [the] unfortunate [one].&#8221; The syntax is awkward and the meaning unclear. It is uncertain who or what is being given into God&#8217;s hand. Elsewhere the idiom &#8220;give into the hand&#8221; means to deliver into one&#8217;s possession. If &#8220;to give&#8221; goes with what precedes (as the accentuation of the Hebrew text suggests), then this may refer to the wicked man being delivered over to God for judgment. The present translation assumes that &#8220;to give&#8221; goes with what follows (cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV). The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1494;&#1465;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">azov</font>) here has the nuance &#8220;entrust&#8221; (see Gen 39:6; Job 39:11); the direct object (&#8220;[his] cause&#8221;) is implied.</p>
