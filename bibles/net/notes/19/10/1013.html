<A NAME="1013"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=316><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the wicked [one], according to the height of his nose, he does not seek, there is no God, all his thoughts.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;height of his nose&#8221; probably refers to an arrogant or snooty attitude; it likely pictures one with his nose turned upward toward the sky in pride. One could take the &#8220;wicked&#8221; as the subject of the negated verb &#8220;seek,&#8221; in which case the point is that the wicked do not &#8220;seek&#8221; God. The translation assumes that this statement, along with &#8220;there is no God,&#8221; is what the wicked man thinks to himself. In this case God is the subject of the verb &#8220;seek,&#8221; and the point is that God will not hold the wicked man accountable for his actions. Verse 13 strongly favors this interpretation. The statement &#8220;there is no God&#8221; is not a philosophical assertion that God does not exist, but rather a confident affirmation that he is unconcerned about how men live morally and ethically (see v. 11).</p>
