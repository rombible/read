<A NAME="1032"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=335><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lift up your hand.&#8221; Usually the expression &#8220;lifting the hand&#8221; refers to praying (Pss 28:2; 134:2) or making an oath (Ps 106:26), but here it probably refers to &#8220;striking a blow&#8221; (see 2 Sam 18:28; 20:21). Note v. 15, where the psalmist asks the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> to &#8220;break the arm of the wicked.&#8221; A less likely option is that the psalmist is requesting that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> declare by oath his intention to intervene.</p>
