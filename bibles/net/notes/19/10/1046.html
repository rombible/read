<A NAME="1046"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=349><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you will not find.&#8221; It is uncertain how this statement relates to what precedes. Some take <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bal</font>), which is used as a negative particle in vv. 4, 6, 11, 18, as asseverative here, &#8220;Indeed find (i.e., judge his wickedness).&#8221; The translation assumes that the final words are an asyndetic relative clause which refers back to what the wicked man boasted in God&#8217;s face (&#8220;you will not find [i.e., my wickedness]&#8221;). See v. 13.</p>
