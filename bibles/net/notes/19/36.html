<A NAME="361"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1283><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 36</i>. Though evil men plan to harm others, the psalmist is confident that the Lord is the just ruler of the earth who gives and sustains all life. He prays for divine blessing and protection and anticipates God&#8217;s judgment of the wicked.</p>
<A NAME="362"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1284><b>tn</b> In the Hebrew text the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1488;&#1501;</font> (&#8220;oracle&#8221;) appears at the beginning of the next verse (v. 2 in the Hebrew text because the superscription is considered v. 1). The resulting reading, &#8220;an oracle of rebellion for the wicked [is] in the midst of my heart&#8221; (cf. NIV) apparently means that the psalm, which foresees the downfall of the wicked, is a prophetic oracle about the rebellion of the wicked which emerges from the soul of the psalmist. One could translate, &#8220;Here is a poem written as I reflected on the rebellious character of evil men.&#8221; Another option, followed in the translation above, is to attach <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1488;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">um</font>, &#8220;oracle&#8221;) with the superscription. For another example of a Davidic poem being labeled an &#8220;oracle,&#8221; see 2 Sam 23:1.</p>
<A NAME="363"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1285><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[the] rebellion of an evil man [is] in the midst of my heart.&#8221; The translation assumes a reading &#8220;in the midst of his heart&#8221; (i.e., &#8220;to the core&#8221;) instead of &#8220;in the midst of my heart,&#8221; a change which finds support in a a few medieval Hebrew <span class="smallcaps">mss</span>, the Hebrew text of Origen&#8217;s Hexapla, and the Syriac.</p>
<A NAME="364"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1286><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;there is no dread of God before his eyes.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;dread of God&#8221; refers here to a healthy respect for God which recognizes that he will punish evil behavior.</p>
<A NAME="365"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1287><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for it causes to be smooth to him in his eyes to find his sin to hate.&#8221; The meaning of the Hebrew text is unclear. Perhaps the point is this: His rebellious attitude makes him reject any notion that God will hold him accountable. His attitude also prevents him from recognizing and repudiating his sinful ways.</p>
<A NAME="366"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1288><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he ceases to exhibit wisdom to do good.&#8221; The Hiphil forms are exhibitive, indicating the outward expression of an inner attitude.</p>
<A NAME="367"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1289><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he takes a stand in a way [that is] not good.&#8221; The word &#8220;way&#8221; here refers metaphorically to behavior or life style.</p>
<A NAME="368"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1290><b>tn</b> The three imperfect verbal forms in v. 4 highlight the characteristic behavior of the typical evildoer.</p>
<A NAME="369"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1291><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[is] in the heavens.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1292><b>sn</b> The Lord&#8217;s <i>loyal love/faithfulness</i> is almost limitless. He is loyal and faithful to his creation and blesses mankind and the animal kingdom with physical life and sustenance (vv. 6-9).</p>
<A NAME="3611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1293><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;mountains of God.&#8221; The divine name <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>, &#8220;God&#8221;) is here used in an idiomatic manner to indicate the superlative.</p>
<A NAME="3612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1294><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;deliver.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1295><b>sn</b> God&#8217;s <i>justice/fairness</i> is firm and reliable like the highest mountains and as abundant as the water in the deepest sea. The psalmist uses a legal metaphor to describe God&#8217;s preservation of his creation. Like a just judge who vindicates the innocent, God protects his creation from destructive forces.</p>
<A NAME="3614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1296><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;valuable.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1297><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the sons of man in the shadow of your wings find shelter.&#8221; The preservation of physical life is in view, as the next verse makes clear.</p>
<A NAME="3616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1298><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for with you is the fountain of life, in your light we see light.&#8221; Water (note &#8220;fountain&#8221;) and light are here metaphors for life.</p>
<A NAME="3617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1299><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;draw out to full length.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1300><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to those who know you.&#8221; The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yada</font>&#8217;, &#8220;know&#8221;) is used here of those who &#8220;know&#8221; the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> in the sense that they recognize his royal authority and obey his will (see Jer 22:16).</p>
<A NAME="3619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1301><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and your justice to.&#8221; The verb &#8220;extend&#8221; is understood by ellipsis in the second line (see the previous line).</p>
<A NAME="3620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1302><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the pure of heart.&#8221; The &#8220;heart&#8221; is here viewed as the seat of one&#8217;s moral character and motives. The &#8220;pure of heart&#8221; are God&#8217;s faithful followers who trust in and love the Lord and, as a result, experience his deliverance (see Pss 7:10; 11:2; 32:11; 64:10; 94:15; 97:11).</p>
<A NAME="3621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1303><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;let not a foot of pride come to me, and let not the hand of the evil ones cause me to wander as a fugitive.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1304><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;there the workers of wickedness have fallen.&#8221; The adverb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sham</font>, &#8220;there&#8221;) is used here for dramatic effect, as the psalmist envisions the evildoers lying fallen at a spot that is vivid in his imagination (BDB 1027 s.v.).</p>
<A NAME="3623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1305><b>tn</b> The psalmist uses perfect verbal forms in v. 12 to describe the demise of the wicked as if it has already taken place.</p>
