<A NAME="671"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2365><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 67</i>. The psalmist prays for God&#8217;s blessing upon his people and urges the nations to praise him for he is the just ruler of the world.</p>
<A NAME="672"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2366><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;have mercy on us.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="673"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2367><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal forms are understood as jussives expressing the psalmist&#8217;s prayer. Note the jussive form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">er</font>) in the next line.</p>
<A NAME="674"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2368><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;may he cause his face to shine with us.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="675"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2369><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to know in the earth your way, among all nations your deliverance.&#8221; The infinitive with -<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lamed</font>) expresses purpose/result. When God demonstrates his favor to his people, all nations will recognize his character as a God who delivers. The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">derekh</font>, &#8220;way&#8221;) refers here to God&#8217;s characteristic behavior, more specifically, to the way he typically saves his people.</p>
<A NAME="676"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2370><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;let the nations, all of them, thank you.&#8221; The prefixed verbal forms in vv. 3-4a are understood as jussives in this call to praise.</p>
<A NAME="677"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2371><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;peoples.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="678"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2372><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for you judge nations fairly, and [as for the] peoples in the earth, you lead them.&#8221; The imperfects are translated with the present tense because the statement is understood as a generalization about God&#8217;s providential control of the world. Another option is to understand the statement as anticipating God&#8217;s future rule (&#8220;for you will rule&#8230;and govern&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="679"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2373><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;let the nations, all of them, thank you.&#8221; The prefixed verbal forms in v. 5 are understood as jussives in this call to praise.</p>
<A NAME="6710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2374><b>tn</b> The prefixed verb forms in vv. 6b-7a are understood as jussives.</p>
<A NAME="6711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2375><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;will fear him.&#8221; After the jussive of the preceding line, the prefixed verbal form with prefixed <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) conjunctive is understood as indicating purpose/result. (Note how v. 3 anticipates the universal impact of God showing his people blessing.) Another option is to take the verb as a jussive and translate, &#8220;Let all the ends of the earth fear him.&#8221;</p>
