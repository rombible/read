<A NAME="731"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2635><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 73</i>. In this wisdom psalm the psalmist offers a personal testimony of his struggle with the age-old problem of the prosperity of the wicked. As he observed evil men prosper, he wondered if a godly lifestyle really pays off. In the midst of his discouragement, he reflected upon spiritual truths and realities. He was reminded that the prosperity of the wicked is only temporary. God will eventually vindicate his people.</p>
<A NAME="732"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2636><b>tn</b> Since the psalm appears to focus on an individual&#8217;s concerns, not the situation of Israel, this introduction may be a later addition designed to apply the psalm&#8217;s message to the entire community. To provide a better parallel with the next line, some emend the Hebrew phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500; &#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿyisra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohim</font>, &#8220;to Israel, God&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> [or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;</font>] <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohim </font>[or &#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>] <font face="Scholar">lÿyyashar</font>, &#8220;God [is good] to the upright one&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="733"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2637><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to the pure of heart.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="734"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2638><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb normally means &#8220;to pour out,&#8221; but here it must have the nuance &#8220;to slide.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>My feet almost slid out from under me</i>. The language is metaphorical. As the following context makes clear, the psalmist almost &#8220;slipped&#8221; in a spiritual sense. As he began to question God&#8217;s justice, the psalmist came close to abandoning his faith.</p>
<A NAME="735"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2639><b>tn</b> The imperfect verbal form here depicts the action as continuing in a past time frame.</p>
<A NAME="736"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2640><b>tn</b> Heb &#8220;peace&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shalom</font>).</p>
<A NAME="737"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2641><b>tn</b> In Isa 58:6, the only other occurrence of this word in the OT, the term refers to &#8220;bonds&#8221; or &#8220;ropes.&#8221; In Ps 73:4 it is used metaphorically of pain and suffering that restricts one&#8217;s enjoyment of life.</p>
<A NAME="738"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2642><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;bellies.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="739"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2643><b>tc</b> Or &#8220;fat.&#8221; The MT of v. 4 reads as follows: &#8220;for there are no pains at their death, and fat [is] their body.&#8221; Since a reference to the death of the wicked seems incongruous in the immediate context (note v. 5) and premature in the argument of the psalm (see vv. 18-20, 27), some prefer to emend the text by redividing it. The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿmotam</font>,&#8220;at their death&#8221;) is changed to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465; &#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lamo tam</font>, &#8220;[there are no pains] to them, strong [and fat are their bodies]&#8221;). The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tam</font>, &#8220;complete; sound&#8221;) is used of physical beauty in Song 5:2; 6:9. This emendation is the basis for the present translation. However, in defense of the MT (the traditional Hebrew text), one may point to an Aramaic inscription from Nerab which views a painful death as a curse and a nonpainful death in one&#8217;s old age as a sign of divine favor. See <i>ANET</i> 661.</p>
<A NAME="7310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2644><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the trouble of man they are not, and with mankind they are not afflicted.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2645><b>sn</b> <i>Arrogance is their necklace</i>. The metaphor suggests that their arrogance is something the wicked &#8220;wear&#8221; proudly. It draws attention to them, just as a beautiful necklace does to its owner.</p>
<A NAME="7312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2646><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a garment of violence covers them.&#8221; The metaphor suggests that violence is habitual for the wicked. They &#8220;wear&#8221; it like clothing; when one looks at them, violence is what one sees.</p>
<A NAME="7313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2647><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;it goes out from fatness their eye,&#8221; which might be paraphrased, &#8220;their eye protrudes [or &#8220;bulges&#8221;] because of fatness.&#8221; This in turn might refer to their greed; their eyes &#8220;bug out&#8221; when they see rich food or produce (the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1461;&#1500;&#1462;&#1489;</font> [<font face="Scholar">khelev</font>, &#8220;fatness&#8221;] sometimes refers to such food or produce). However, when used with the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatsa</font>&#8217;, &#8220;go out&#8221;) the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> (&#8220;from&#8221;) more naturally indicates source. For this reason it is preferable to emend <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1497;&#1504;&#1461;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">enemo</font>, &#8220;their eye&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;</font>, (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avonamo</font>, &#8220;their sin&#8221;) and read, &#8220;and their sin proceeds forth from fatness,&#8221; that is, their prosperity gives rise to their sinful attitudes. If one follows this textual reading, another interpretive option is to take <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1461;&#1500;&#1462;&#1489;</font> (&#8220;fatness&#8221;) in the sense of &#8220;unreceptive, insensitive&#8221; (see its use in Ps 17:10). In this case, the sin of the wicked proceeds forth from their spiritual insensitivity.</p>
<A NAME="7314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2648><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the thoughts of [their] heart [i.e., mind] cross over&#8221; (i.e., violate God&#8217;s moral boundary, see Ps 17:3).</p>
<A NAME="7315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2649><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">muq</font>, &#8220;mock&#8221;) occurs only here in the OT.</p>
<A NAME="7316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2650><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and speak with evil.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2651><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;oppression from an elevated place they speak.&#8221; The traditional accentuation of the MT places &#8220;oppression&#8221; with the preceding line. In this case, one might translate, &#8220;they mock and speak with evil [of] oppression, from an elevated place [i.e., &#8220;proudly&#8221;] they speak.&#8221; By placing &#8220;oppression&#8221; with what follows, one achieves better poetic balance in the parallelism.</p>
<A NAME="7318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2652><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they set in heaven their mouth, and their tongue walks through the earth.&#8221; The meaning of the text is uncertain. Perhaps the idea is that they lay claim to heaven (i.e., speak as if they were ruling in heaven) and move through the earth declaring their superiority and exerting their influence. Some take the preposition -<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet</font>) the first line as adversative and translate, &#8220;they set their mouth against heaven,&#8221; that is, they defy God.</p>
<A NAME="7319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2653><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;therefore his people return [so <i>Qere</i> (marginal reading); <i>Kethib</i> (consonantal text) has &#8220;he brings back&#8221;] to here, and waters of abundance are sucked up by them.&#8221; The traditional Hebrew text (MT) defies explanation. The present translation reflects M. Dahood&#8217;s proposed emendations (<i>Psalms </i>[AB], 2:190) and reads the Hebrew text as follows: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1461;&#1503; &#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; &#1500;&#1462;&#1495;&#1462;&#1501; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1461;&#1497; &#1502;&#1464;&#1500;&#1461;&#1488; &#1497;&#1464;&#1502;&#1465;&#1510;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1464;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (&#8220;therefore they are filled with food, and waters of abundance they suck up for themselves&#8221;). The reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; &#1500;&#1462;&#1495;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yisvÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">um lekhem</font>, &#8220;they are filled with food&#8221;) assumes (1) an emendation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489; &#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yashyyv</font>, &#8220;he will bring back his people&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yisvÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">um</font>, &#8220;they will be filled&#8221;; a Qal imperfect third masculine plural form from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1506;</font> [<font face="Scholar">sava</font>&#8217;] with enclitic <i>mem </i>[<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1501;</font>]), and (2) an emendation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1458;&#1500;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">halom</font>, &#8220;to here&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1462;&#1495;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (&#8220;food&#8221;). The expression &#8220;be filled/fill with food&#8221; appears elsewhere at least ten times (see Ps 132:15, for example). In the second line the Niphal form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yimmatsu</font>, derived from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">matsah</font>, &#8220;drain&#8221;) is emended to a Qal form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1502;&#1465;&#1510;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yamotsu</font>), derived from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">matsats</font>, &#8220;to suck&#8221;). In Isa 66:11 the verbs <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sava</font>&#8217;; proposed in Ps 73:10a) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (proposed in Ps 73:10b) are parallel. The point of the emended text is this: Because they are seemingly sovereign (v. 9), they become greedy and grab up everything they need and more.</p>
<A NAME="7320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2654><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;How does God know? Is there knowledge with the Most High?&#8221; They appear to be practical atheists, who acknowledge God&#8217;s existence and sovereignty in theory, but deny his involvement in the world (see Pss 10:4, 11; 14:1).</p>

<A NAME="7323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2657><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;I concluded&#8221; are supplied in the translation. It is apparent that vv. 13-14 reflect the psalmist&#8217;s thoughts at an earlier time (see vv. 2-3), prior to the spiritual awakening he describes in vv. 17-28.</p>
<A NAME="7324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2658><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;heart,&#8221; viewed here as the seat of one&#8217;s thoughts and motives.</p>
<A NAME="7325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2659><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and washed my hands in innocence.&#8221; The psalmist uses an image from cultic ritual to picture his moral lifestyle. The reference to &#8220;hands&#8221; suggests actions.</p>
<A NAME="7326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2660><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;If I had said, &#8216;I will speak out like this.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

Some equate the phrase with &#8220;generation of the godly&#8221; (Ps 14:5), &#8220;generation of the ones seeking him&#8221; (Ps 24:6), and &#8220;generation of the upright&#8221; (Ps 112:2). In Deut 14:1 the Israelites are referred to as God&#8217;s &#8220;sons.&#8221; Perhaps the psalmist refers here to those who are &#8220;Israelites&#8221; in the true sense because of their loyalty to God (note the juxtaposition of &#8220;Israel&#8221; with &#8220;the pure in heart&#8221; in v. 1).</p>
<A NAME="7328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2662><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and [when] I pondered to understand this, troubling it [was] in my eyes.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="7330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2664><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I discerned their end.&#8221; At the temple the psalmist perhaps received an oracle of deliverance announcing his vindication and the demise of the wicked (see Ps 12) or heard songs of confidence (for example, Ps 11), wisdom psalms (for example, Pss 1, 37), and hymns (for example, Ps 112) that describe the eventual downfall of the proud and wealthy.</p>
<A NAME="7331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2665><b>tn</b> The use of the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akh</font>, &#8220;surely&#8221;) here literarily counteracts its use in v. 13. The repetition draws attention to the contrast between the two statements, the first of which expresses the psalmist&#8217;s earlier despair and the second his newly discovered confidence.</p>

<A NAME="7335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2669><b>sn</b> <i>When you awake</i>. The psalmist compares God&#8217;s inactivity to sleep and the time of God&#8217;s judgment to his awakening from sleep.</p>

But this seems unlikely in the present context. The psalmist anticipates a time of vindication, when the wicked are destroyed and he is honored by God for his godly life style. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">laqakh</font>, &#8220;take&#8221;) here carries the nuance &#8220;lead, guide, conduct,&#8221; as in Num 23:14, 27-28; Josh 24:3 and Prov 24:11.</p>
