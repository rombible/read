<A NAME="241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=874><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 24</i>. The psalmist affirms the universal kingship of the sovereign creator, reminds his people that only the morally pure are qualified to worship him, and celebrates his splendor as a mighty warrior king.</p>
<A NAME="242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=875><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal form is understood as a preterite, referring to the creation of the world.</p>
<A NAME="243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=876><b>sn</b> <i>He&#8230;established it upon the ocean currents</i>. The description reflects ancient Israelite prescientific cosmology, which is based on outward appearances. The language also suggests that God&#8217;s creative work involved the subjugation of chaos, symbolized by the sea.</p>
<A NAME="244"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=877><b>tn</b> The imperfects in v. 3 are modal, expressing potential or permission.</p>
<A NAME="245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=878><b>sn</b> In this context the Lord&#8217;s <i>mountain</i> probably refers to Zion/Jerusalem (see Isa 2:2-3).</p>
<A NAME="246"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=879><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the innocent of hands and the pure of heart.&#8221; The &#8220;hands&#8221; allude to one&#8217;s actions, the &#8220;heart&#8221; to one&#8217;s thought life and motives.</p>
<A NAME="247"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=880><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;who does not lift up for emptiness my life.&#8221; The first person pronoun on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nafshiy</font>, &#8220;my life&#8221;) makes little sense here; many medieval Hebrew <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> support the ancient versions in reading a third person pronoun &#8220;his.&#8221; The idiom &#8220;lift the life&#8221; here means to &#8220;long for&#8221; or &#8220;desire strongly.&#8221; In this context (note the reference to an oath in the following line) &#8220;emptiness&#8221; probably refers to speech (see Ps 12:2).</p>
<A NAME="248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=881><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and does not swear an oath deceitfully.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="249"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=882><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he (the righteous individual described in v. 4) lifts up a blessing from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.&#8221; The singular subject is representative here, as v. 6 makes clear. The referent (godly people like the individual in v. 4) has been specified in the translation for clarity. The imperfect verbal form is generalizing; such people are typically rewarded for their deeds.</p>
<A NAME="2410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=883><b>tn</b> &#8220;and vindication from the God of his deliverance.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=884><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;this [is the] generation of the ones seeking him, the ones seeking your face, Jacob.&#8221; To &#8220;seek the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s face&#8221; means to seek his favor through prayer (see 2 Sam 21:1; Pss 27:8; 105:4).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This verse presents a somewhat idealized view of <i>Jacob</i>&#8217;<i>s descendants</i> as devoted worshipers of the Lord.</p>
<A NAME="2412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=885><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lift up your heads.&#8221; The gates of the Lord&#8217;s dwelling place are here personified. The idiom &#8220;lift up the head&#8221; often means &#8220;be confident, bold&#8221; (see Judg 8:28; Job 10:15; Ps 83:2; Zech 1:21).</p>
<A NAME="2413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=886><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lift yourselves up.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=887><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;king of glory.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=888><b>tn</b> Following the imperatives of the preceding lines, the prefixed verbal form with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) conjunctive indicates purpose or result.</p>
<A NAME="2416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=889><b>sn</b> <i>Who is this majestic king?</i> Perhaps the personified gates/doors ask this question, in response to the command given in v. 7.</p>
<A NAME="2417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=890><b>tn</b> Traditionally, &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of hosts,&#8221; a title which here pictures the Lord as a mighty warrior-king who leads armies into battle.</p>
