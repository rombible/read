<A NAME="2117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=773><b>tn</b> The king is now addressed. One could argue that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is still being addressed, but v. 9 militates against this proposal, for there the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is mentioned in the third person and appears to be distinct from the addressee (unless, of course, one takes &#8220;<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221; in v. 9 as vocative; see the note on &#8220;them&#8221; in v. 9b). Verse 7 begins this transition to a new addressee by referring to both the king and the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> in the third person (in vv. 1-6 the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is addressed and only the king referred to in the third person).</p>
