<A NAME="2110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=766><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you have granted him length of days forever and ever.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;length of days,&#8221; when used of human beings, usually refers to a lengthy period of time (such as one&#8217;s lifetime). See, for example, Deut 30:20; Job 12:12; Ps 91:16; Prov 3:2, 16; Lam 5:20. The additional phrase &#8220;forever and ever&#8221; is hyperbolic. While it seems to attribute eternal life to the king (see Pss 61:6-7; 72:5 as well), the underlying reality is the king&#8217;s enduring dynasty. He will live on, as it were, through his descendants, who will continue to rule over his kingdom long after he has passed off the scene.</p>
