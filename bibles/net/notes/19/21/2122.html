<A NAME="2122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=778><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, in his anger he swallows them, and fire devours them.&#8221; Some take &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221; as a vocative, in which case he is addressed in vv. 8-9a. But this makes the use of the third person in v. 9b rather awkward, though the king could be the subject (see vv. 1-7).</p>
