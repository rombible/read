<A NAME="1417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=445><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the counsel of the oppressed you put to shame.&#8221; Using a second person plural verb form, the psalmist addresses the wicked. Since the context indicates their attempt to harm the godly will be thwarted, the imperfect should be taken in a subjunctive (cf. NASB, NRSV) rather than an indicative manner (cf. NIV). Here it probably expresses their desire or intent (&#8220;want to humiliate&#8221;).</p>
