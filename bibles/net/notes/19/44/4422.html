<A NAME="4422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1596><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;gore&#8221; (like an ox). If this portion of the psalm contains the song of confidence/petition the Israelites recited prior to battle, then the imperfects here and in the next line may express their expectation of victory. Another option is that the imperfects function in an emphatic generalizing manner. In this case one might translate, &#8220;you [always] drive back&#8230;you [always] trample down.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Hebrew verb translated &#8220;drive back&#8221; is literally &#8220;gore&#8221;; the imagery is that of a powerful wild ox that &#8220;gores&#8221; its enemies and tramples them underfoot.</p>
