<A NAME="4453"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1627><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;would not God search out this, for he knows the hidden things of [the] heart?&#8221; The expression &#8220;search out&#8221; is used metonymically here, referring to discovery, the intended effect of a search. The &#8220;heart&#8221; (i.e., mind) is here viewed as the seat of one&#8217;s thoughts. The rhetorical question expects the answer, &#8220;Of course he would!&#8221; The point seems to be this: There is no way the Israelites who are the speakers in the psalm would reject God and turn to another god, for the omniscient God would easily discover such a sin.</p>
