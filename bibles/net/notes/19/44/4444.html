<A NAME="4444"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1618><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;we have not forgotten you.&#8221; To &#8220;forget&#8221; God refers here to worshiping false gods and thereby refusing to recognize his sovereignty (see v. 20, as well as Deut 8:19; Judg 3:7; 1 Sam 12:9; Isa 17:10; Jer 3:21; Ps 9:17).Thus the translation &#8220;we have not rejected you&#8221; has been used.</p>
