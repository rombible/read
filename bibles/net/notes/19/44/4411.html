<A NAME="4411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1585><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and you sent them out.&#8221; The translation assumes that the third masculine plural pronoun &#8220;them&#8221; refers to the fathers (v. 1), as in the preceding parallel line. See Ps 80:11, where Israel, likened to a vine, &#8220;spreads out&#8221; its tendrils to the west and east. Another option is to take the &#8220;peoples&#8221; as the referent of the pronoun and translate, &#8220;and you sent them away,&#8221; though this does not provide as tight a parallel with the corresponding line.</p>
