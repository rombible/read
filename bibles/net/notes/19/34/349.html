<A NAME="349"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1187><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they look to him and are radiant and their faces are not ashamed.&#8221; The third person plural subject (&#8220;they&#8221;) is unidentified; there is no antecedent in the Hebrew text. For this reason some prefer to take the perfect verbal forms in the first line as imperatives, &#8220;look to him and be radiant&#8221; (cf. NEB, NRSV). Some medieval Hebrew <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> and other ancient witnesses (Aquila, the Syriac, and Jerome) support an imperatival reading for the first verb. In the second line some (with support from the LXX and Syriac) change &#8220;their faces&#8221; to &#8220;your faces,&#8221; which allows one to retain more easily the jussive force of the verb (suggested by the preceding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>]): &#8220;do not let your faces be ashamed.&#8221; It is probable that the verbal construction in the second line is rhetorical, expressing the conviction that the action in view cannot or should not happen. See GKC 322 §109.<i>e</i>.</p>
