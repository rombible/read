<A NAME="342"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1180><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;By David, when he changed his sense before Abimelech and he drove him away and he went.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Pretended to be insane</i>. The psalm heading appears to refer to the account in 1 Sam 21:10-15 which tells how David, fearful that King Achish of Gath might kill him, pretended to be insane in hopes that the king would simply send him away. The psalm heading names the king Abimelech, not Achish, suggesting that the tradition is confused on this point. However, perhaps &#8220;Abimelech&#8221; was a royal title, rather than a proper name. See P. C. Craigie, <i>Psalms 1-50</i> (WBC), 278.</p>
