<A NAME="3440"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1218><b>sn</b> <i>Not one of them is broken</i>. The author of the Gospel of John saw a fulfillment of these words in Jesus&#8217; experience on the cross (see John 19:31-37), for the Roman soldiers, when they saw that Jesus was already dead, did not break his legs as was customarily done to speed the death of crucified individuals. John&#8217;s use of the psalm seems strange, for the statement in its original context suggests that the Lord protects the godly from physical harm. Jesus&#8217; legs may have remained unbroken, but he was brutally and unjustly executed by his enemies. John seems to give the statement a literal sense that is foreign to its original literary context by applying a promise of divine protection to a man who was seemingly not saved by God. However, John saw in this incident a foreshadowing of Jesus&#8217; ultimate deliverance and vindication. His unbroken bones were a reminder of God&#8217;s commitment to the godly and a sign of things to come. Jesus&#8217; death on the cross was not the end of the story; God vindicated him, as John goes on to explain in the following context (John 19:38-20:18).</p>
