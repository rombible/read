<A NAME="341"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1179><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 34</i>. In this song of thanksgiving the psalmist praises God for delivering him from distress. He encourages others to be loyal to the Lord, tells them how to please God, and assures them that the Lord protects his servants. The psalm is an acrostic; vv. 1-21 begin with successive letters of the Hebrew alphabet. (Verse 6 begins with the letter <i>he</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;</font>) and v. 7 with the letter <i>zayin</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;</font>). The letter <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>), which comes between <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;</font>, seems to be omitted, although it does appear at the beginning of v. 6b. The final verse of the psalm, which begins with the letter <i>pe</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;</font>), is outside the acrostic scheme.</p>
