<A NAME="371"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1306><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 37</i>. The psalmist<i> </i>urges his audience not to envy the wicked, but to trust in and obey the Lord, for he will destroy sinners and preserve the godly. When the smoke of judgment clears, the wicked will be gone, but the godly will remain and inherit God&#8217;s promised blessings. The psalm is an acrostic; every other verse begins with a successive letter of the Hebrew alphabet.</p>
