<A NAME="3743"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1348><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> the steps of a man are established, and in his way he delights.&#8221; The second line qualifies the first. The man whose behavior is commendable in God&#8217;s sight is the one whose ways are established by God. Another option is that the second line refers to the godly man delighting in God&#8217;s &#8220;way,&#8221; namely the lifestyle which he prescribes for men. In this case one might translate, &#8220;The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> grants success to the one who desires to obey his commands.&#8221;</p>
