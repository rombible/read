<A NAME="771"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2785><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 77</i>. The psalmist recalls how he suffered through a time of doubt, but tells how he found encouragement and hope as he recalled the way in which God delivered Israel at the Red Sea.</p>
<A NAME="772"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2786><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my voice to God.&#8221; The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qara</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to call out; to cry out&#8221;) should probably be understood by ellipsis (see Ps 3:4) both here and in the following (parallel) line.</p>
<A NAME="773"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2787><b>tn</b> The perfect with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive is best taken as future here (although some translations render this as a past tense; cf. NEB, NIV). The psalmist expresses his confidence that God will respond to his prayer. This mood of confidence seems premature (see vv. 3-4), but v. 1 probably reflects the psalmist&#8217;s attitude at the end of the prayer (see vv. 13-20). Having opened with an affirmation of confidence, he then retraces how he gained confidence during his trial (see vv. 2-12).</p>
<A NAME="774"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2788><b>tn</b> Here the psalmist refers back to the very recent past, when he began to pray for divine help.</p>
<A NAME="775"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2789><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my hand [at] night was extended and was not growing numb.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nagar</font>), which can mean &#8220;flow&#8221; in certain contexts, here has the nuance &#8220;be extended.&#8221; The imperfect form (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1464;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tafug</font>, &#8220;to be numb&#8221;) is used here to describe continuous action in the past.</p>
<A NAME="776"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2790><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;my soul.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>) with a pronominal suffix is often equivalent to a pronoun, especially in poetry (see BDB 660 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> 4.a).</p>
<A NAME="777"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2791><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will remember God and I will groan, I will reflect and my spirit will grow faint.&#8221; The first three verbs are cohortatives, the last a perfect with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive. The psalmist&#8217;s statement in v. 4 could be understood as concurrent with v. 1, or, more likely, as a quotation of what he had said earlier as he prayed to God (see v. 2). The words &#8220;I said&#8221; are supplied in the translation at the beginning of the verse to reflect this interpretation (see v. 10).</p>
<A NAME="778"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2792><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you held fast the guards of my eyes.&#8221; The &#8220;guards of the eyes&#8221; apparently refers to his eyelids. The psalmist seems to be saying that God would not bring him relief, which would have allowed him to shut his eyes and get some sleep (see v. 2).</p>
<A NAME="779"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2793><b>tn</b> The imperfect is used in the second clause to emphasize that this was an ongoing condition in the past.</p>
<A NAME="7710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2794><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the years of antiquity.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2795><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will remember my song in the night, with my heart I will reflect. And my spirit searched.&#8221; As in v. 4, the words of v. 6a are understood as what the psalmist said earlier. Consequently the words &#8220;I said&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarification (see v. 10). The prefixed verbal form with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive at the beginning of the final line is taken as sequential to the perfect &#8220;I thought&#8221; in v. 6.</p>
<A NAME="7712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2796><b>tn</b> As in vv. 4 and 6a, the words of vv. 7-9 are understood as a quotation of what the psalmist said earlier. Therefore the words &#8220;I asked&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarification.</p>
<A NAME="7713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2797><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;word,&#8221; which may refer here to God&#8217;s word of promise (note the reference to &#8220;loyal love&#8221; in the preceding line).</p>
<A NAME="7714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2798><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Most High.&#8221; This divine title (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1500;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">elyon</font>) pictures God as the exalted ruler of the universe who vindicates the innocent and judges the wicked. See especially Pss 7:17; 9:2; 18:13; 21:7; 47:2.</p>
<A NAME="7715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2799><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And I said, &#8216;This is my wounding, the changing of the right hand of the Most High.&#8217;&#8221; The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khallotiy</font>) appears to be a Qal infinitive construct (with a first person singular pronominal suffix) from the verbal root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khalal</font>, &#8220;to pierce; to wound&#8221;). The present translation assumes an emendation to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khalotiy</font>), a Qal infinitive construct (with a first person singular pronominal suffix) from the verbal root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khalah</font>, &#8220;be sick, weak&#8221;). The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿnot</font>) is understood as a Qal infinitive construct from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shanah</font>, &#8220;to change&#8221;) rather than a plural noun form, &#8220;years&#8221; (see v. 5). &#8220;Right hand&#8221; here symbolizes by metonymy God&#8217;s power and activity. The psalmist observes that his real problem is theological in nature. His experience suggests that the sovereign Lord has abandoned him and become inactive. However, this goes against the grain of his most cherished beliefs.</p>
<A NAME="7716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2800><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;yes, I will remember from old your wonders.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The psalmist refuses to allow skepticism to win out. God has revealed himself to his people in tangible, incontrovertible ways in the past and the psalmist vows to <i>remember</i> the historical record as a source of hope for the future.</p>
<A NAME="7717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2801><b>sn</b> Verses 13-20 are the content of the psalmist&#8217;s reflection (see vv. 11-12). As he thought about God&#8217;s work in Israel&#8217;s past, he reached the place where he could confidently cry out for God&#8217;s help (see v. 1).</p>
<A NAME="7718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2802><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;O God, in holiness [is] your way.&#8221; God&#8217;s &#8220;way&#8221; here refers to his actions. &#8220;Holiness&#8221; is used here in the sense of &#8220;set apart, unique,&#8221; rather than in a moral/ethical sense. As the next line and the next verse emphasize, God&#8217;s deeds are incomparable and set him apart as the one true God.</p>
<A NAME="7719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2803><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Who [is] a great god like God?&#8221; The rhetorical question assumes the answer, &#8220;No one!&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2804><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;redeemed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7721"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2805><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;with [your] arm.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7722"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2806><b>tn</b> The waters of the Red Sea are here personified; they are portrayed as seeing God and fearing him.</p>
<A NAME="7723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2807><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal form may be taken as a preterite or as an imperfect with past progressive force.</p>
<A NAME="7724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2808><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;of the sea&#8221; are supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="7725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2809><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal form may be taken as a preterite or as an imperfect with past progressive force.</p>
<A NAME="7726"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2810><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;water.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7727"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2811><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a sound the clouds gave.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7728"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2812><b>tn</b> The lightning accompanying the storm is portrayed as the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s &#8220;arrows&#8221; (see v. 18).</p>
<A NAME="7729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2813><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal form may be taken as a preterite or as an imperfect with past progressive force.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Verses 16-18 depict the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> coming in the storm to battle his enemies and subdue the sea. There is no record of such a storm in the historical account of the Red Sea crossing. The language the psalmist uses here is stereotypical and originates in Canaanite myth, where the storm god Baal subdues the sea in his quest for kingship. The psalmist has employed the stereotypical imagery to portray the exodus vividly and at the same time affirm that it is not Baal who subdues the sea, but Yahweh.</p>
<A NAME="7730"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2814><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the sea [was] your way.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7731"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2815><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and your paths [were] in the mighty waters.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="7732"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2816><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and your footprints were not known.&#8221;</p>
