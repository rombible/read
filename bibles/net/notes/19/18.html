<A NAME="181"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=533><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 18</i>. In this long song of thanks, the psalmist (a Davidic king, traditionally understood as David himself) affirms that God is his faithful protector. He recalls in highly poetic fashion how God intervened in awesome power and delivered him from death. The psalmist&#8217;s experience demonstrates that God vindicates those who are blameless and remain loyal to him. True to his promises, God gives the king victory on the battlefield and enables him to subdue nations. A parallel version of the psalm appears in 2 Sam 22:1-51.</p>
<A NAME="182"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=534><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;spoke.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="185"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=537><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and from the hand of Saul.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="186"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=538><b>tn</b> A number of translations (e.g., NASB, NIV, NRSV) assign the words &#8220;he said&#8221; to the superscription, in which case the entire psalm is in first person. Other translations (e.g., NAB) include the introductory &#8220;he said&#8221; at the beginning of v. 1.</p>
<A NAME="187"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=539><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rakham</font>) elsewhere appears in the Piel (or Pual) verbal stem with the basic meaning, &#8220;have compassion.&#8221; The verb occurs only here in the basic (Qal) stem. The basic stem of the verbal root also occurs in Aramaic with the meaning &#8220;love&#8221; (see <i>DNWSI</i> 2:1068-69; Jastrow 1467 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1501;</font>; G. Schmuttermayr, &#8220;<i>rhm</i>: eine lexikalische Studie,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 51 [1970]: 515-21). Since this introductory statement does not appear in the parallel version in 2 Sam 22:1-51, it is possible that it is a later addition to the psalm, made when the poem was revised for use in worship.</p>
<A NAME="188"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=540><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my strength.&#8221; &#8220;Strength&#8221; is metonymic here, referring to the Lord as the one who bestows strength to the psalmist; thus the translation &#8220;my source of strength.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="189"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=541><b>sn</b> <i>My high ridge</i>. This metaphor pictures God as a rocky, relatively inaccessible summit, where one would be able to find protection from enemies. See 1 Sam 23:25, 28.</p>
<A NAME="1810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=542><b>sn</b> <i>My stronghold</i>. David often found safety in such strongholds. See 1 Sam 22:4-5; 24:22; 2 Sam 5:9, 17; 23:14.</p>
<A NAME="1811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=543><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;in whom.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=544><b>sn</b> <i>Take shelter</i>. &#8220;Taking shelter&#8221; in the Lord is an idiom for seeking his protection. Seeking his protection presupposes and even demonstrates the subject&#8217;s loyalty to the Lord. In the psalms those who &#8220;take shelter&#8221; in the Lord are contrasted with the wicked and equated with those who love, fear and serve the Lord (Pss 5:11-12; 31:17-20; 34:21-22).</p>
<A NAME="1813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=545><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the horn of my salvation&#8221;; or &#8220;my saving horn.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Though some see &#8220;horn&#8221; as referring to a horn-shaped peak of a hill, or to the &#8220;horns&#8221; of an altar where one could find refuge, it is more likely that the horn of an ox underlies the metaphor (cf. Deut 33:17; 1 Kgs 22:11; Ps 92:10). The horn of the wild ox is frequently a metaphor for military strength; the idiom &#8220;exalt the horn&#8221; signifies military victory (see 1 Sam 2:10; Pss 89:17, 24; 92:10; Lam 2:17). In the ancient Near East powerful warrior-kings would sometimes compare themselves to a goring bull that uses its horns to kill its enemies. For examples, see P. Miller, &#8220;El the Warrior,&#8221; <i>HTR</i> 60 (1967): 422-25, and R. B. Chisholm, &#8220;An Exegetical and Theological Study of Psalm 18/2 Samuel 22&#8221; (Th.D. diss., Dallas Theological Seminary, 1983), 135-36. Ps 18:2 uses the metaphor of the horn in a slightly different manner. Here the Lord himself is compared to a horn. He is to the psalmist what the horn is to the ox, a source of defense and victory.</p>
<A NAME="1814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=546><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;my elevated place.&#8221; The parallel version of this psalm in 2 Sam 22:3 adds at this point, &#8220;my refuge, my savior, [you who] save me from violence.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=547><b>tn</b> In this song of thanksgiving, where the psalmist recalls how the Lord delivered him, the prefixed verbal form is best understood as a preterite indicating past tense, not an imperfect.</p>
<A NAME="1816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=548><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;worthy of praise, I cried out [to] the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.&#8221; Some take <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1492;&#1467;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿhullal</font>, &#8220;worthy of praise&#8221;) with what precedes and translate, &#8220;the praiseworthy one,&#8221; or &#8220;praiseworthy.&#8221; However, the various epithets in vv. 1-2 have the first person pronominal suffix, unlike <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1492;&#1467;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;</font>. If one follows the traditional verse division and takes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1492;&#1467;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;</font> with what follows, it is best understood as substantival and as appositional to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿhvah</font>): &#8220;[to the] praiseworthy one I cried out, [to the] <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=549><b>tc</b> Ps 18:4 reads &#8220;ropes,&#8221; while 2 Sam 22:5 reads &#8220;waves.&#8221; The reading of the psalm has been influenced by the next verse (note &#8220;ropes of Sheol&#8221;) and perhaps also by Ps 116:3 (where &#8220;ropes of death&#8221; appears, as here, with the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1507;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">afaf</font>). However, the parallelism of v. 4 (note &#8220;currents&#8221; in the next line) favors the reading &#8220;waves.&#8221; While the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1507;</font> is used with &#8220;ropes&#8221; as subject in Ps 116:3, it can also be used with engulfing &#8220;waters&#8221; as subject (see Jonah 2:5). Death is compared to surging waters in v. 4 and to a hunter in v. 5.</p>
<A NAME="1818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=550><b>tn</b> The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhal</font>) usually refers to a river or stream, but in this context the plural form likely refers to the currents of the sea (see vv. 15-16).</p>
<A NAME="1819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=551><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿliyya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) is used here as an epithet for death. Elsewhere it is a common noun meaning &#8220;wickedness, uselessness.&#8221; It is often associated with rebellion against authority and other crimes that result in societal disorder and anarchy. The phrase &#8220;man/son of wickedness&#8221; refers to one who opposes God and the order he has established. The term becomes an appropriate title for death, which, through human forces, launches an attack against God&#8217;s chosen servant.</p>
<A NAME="1820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=552><b>tn</b> In this poetic narrative context the prefixed verbal form is best understood as a preterite indicating past tense, not an imperfect. (Note the perfect verbal form in the parallel/preceding line.) The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">at</font>) sometimes by metonymy carries the nuance &#8220;frighten,&#8221; but the parallelism (see &#8220;engulfed&#8221;) favors the meaning &#8220;overwhelm&#8221; here.</p>
<A NAME="1821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=553><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;surrounded me.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=555><b>tn</b> In this poetic narrative context the four prefixed verbal forms in v. 6 are best understood as preterites indicating past tense, not imperfects.</p>
<A NAME="1824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=556><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from his temple.&#8221; Verse 10, which pictures God descending from the sky, indicates that the heavenly temple is in view, not the earthly one.</p>

M. Cross and D. N. Freedman, <i>Studies in Ancient Yahwistic Poetry </i>(SBLDS), 144, n. 13.</p>
<A NAME="1826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=558><b>sn</b> <i>The earth heaved and shook</i>. The imagery pictures an earthquake in which the earth&#8217;s surface rises and falls. The earthquake motif is common in OT theophanies of God as warrior and in ancient Near Eastern literary descriptions of warring gods and kings. See R. B. Chisholm, &#8220;An Exegetical and Theological Study of Psalm 18/2 Samuel 22&#8221; (Th.D. diss., Dallas Theological Seminary, 1983), 160-62.</p>
<A NAME="1827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=559><b>tn</b> 2 Sam 22:8 has &#8220;heavens&#8221; which forms a merism with &#8220;earth&#8221; in the preceding line. The &#8220;foundations of the heavens&#8221; would be the mountains. However, the reading &#8220;foundations of the mountains&#8221; has a parallel in Deut 32:22.</p>
<A NAME="1828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=560><b>tn</b> In this poetic narrative context the prefixed verbal form is best understood as a preterite indicating past tense, not an imperfect.

See also v. 15, &#8220;the powerful breath of your nose.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=563><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fire from his mouth devoured.&#8221; In this poetic narrative context the prefixed verbal form is best understood as a preterite indicating past tense, not an imperfect.

For other examples of fire as a weapon in OT theophanies and ancient Near Eastern portrayals of warring gods and kings, see R. B. Chisholm, &#8220;An Exegetical and Theological Study of Psalm 18/2 Samuel 22&#8221; (Th.D. diss., Dallas Theological Seminary, 1983), 165-67.</p>
<A NAME="1832"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=564><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;coals burned from him.&#8221; Perhaps the psalmist pictures God&#8217;s fiery breath igniting coals (cf. Job 41:21), which he then hurls as weapons (cf. Ps 120:4).</p>
<A NAME="1833"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=565><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">natah</font>) can carry the sense &#8220;[cause to] bend, bow down.&#8221; For example, Gen 49:15 pictures Issachar as a donkey that &#8220;bends&#8221; its shoulder or back under a burden. Here the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> causes the sky, pictured as a dome or vault, to sink down as he descends in the storm.</p>

<A NAME="1835"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=567><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a cherub.&#8221; Because of the typical associations of the word &#8220;cherub&#8221; in English with chubby winged babies, the term has been rendered &#8220;winged angel&#8221; in the translation.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Winged angel</i> (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;cherub&#8221;). Cherubs, as depicted in the OT, possess both human and animal (lion, ox, and eagle) characteristics (see Ezek 1:10; 10:14, 21; 41:18). They are pictured as winged creatures (Exod 25:20; 37:9; 1 Kgs 6:24-27; Ezek 10:8, 19) and serve as the very throne of God when the ark of the covenant is in view (Pss 80:1; 99:1; see Num 7:89; 1 Sam 4:4; 2 Sam 6:2; 2 Kgs 19:15). The picture of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> seated on the cherubs suggests they might be used by him as a vehicle, a function they carry out in Ezek 1:22-28 (the &#8220;living creatures&#8221; mentioned here are identified as cherubs in Ezek 10:20). In Ps 18:10 the image of a cherub serves to personify the wind (see the next line of the psalm).</p>
<A NAME="1836"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=568><b>tc</b> 2 Sam 22:11 reads &#8220;appeared&#8221; (from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>); the relatively rare verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">da</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>, &#8220;glide&#8221;) is more difficult and probably the original reading here in Ps 18.</p>
<A NAME="1837"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=569><b>sn</b> <i>The wings of the wind</i>. Verse 10 may depict (1) the Lord riding a cherub, which is in turn propelled by the wind current. Another option (2) is that two different vehicles (a cherub and the wind) are envisioned. Yet another option (3) is that the wind is personified as a cherub. For a discussion of ancient Near Eastern parallels to the imagery in v. 10, see M. Weinfeld, &#8220;&#8216;Rider of the Clouds&#8217; and &#8216;Gatherer of the Clouds&#8217;,&#8221; <i>JANESCU</i> 5 (1973): 422-24.</p>

<A NAME="18141"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">141</span><note=673><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;is the one who grants vengeance to me.&#8221; The plural form of the noun indicates degree here, suggesting complete vengeance or vindication.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Completely vindicates me</i>. In the ancient Near East military victory was sometimes viewed as a sign that one&#8217;s God had judged in favor of the victor, avenging and/or vindicating him. See, for example, Judg 11:27, 32-33, 36.</p>

However, it could mean &#8220;exalt, elevate&#8221; here, indicating that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has given the psalmist victory over his enemies and forced them to acknowledge the psalmist&#8217;s superiority (cf.

<A NAME="18146"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">146</span><note=678><b>sn</b> <i>I will give you thanks before the nations</i>. This probably alludes to the fact that the psalmist will praise the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> in the presence of the defeated nations when they, as his subjects, bring their tribute payments. Ideally the Davidic king was to testify to the nations of God&#8217;s greatness. See J. H. Eaton, <i>Kingship and the Psalms </i>(SBT), 182-85.</p>
