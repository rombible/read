<A NAME="579"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2089><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;may he send from heaven and deliver me.&#8221; The prefixed verbal forms are understood as jussives expressing the psalmist&#8217;s prayer. The second verb, which has a <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) conjunctive prefixed to it, probably indicates purpose. Another option is to take the forms as imperfects expressing confidence, &#8220;he will send from heaven and deliver me&#8221; (cf. NRSV). </p>
