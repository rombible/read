<A NAME="5713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2093><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my life, in the midst of lions, I lie down, devouring ones, sons of mankind, their teeth a spear and arrows and their tongue a sharp sword.&#8221; The syntax of the verse is difficult. Another option is to take &#8220;my life&#8221; with the preceding verse. For this to make sense, one must add a verb, perhaps &#8220;and may he deliver&#8221; (cf. the LXX), before the phrase. One might then translate, &#8220;May God send his loyal love and faithfulness and deliver my life.&#8221; If one does take &#8220;my life&#8221; with v. 4, then the parallelism of v. 5 is altered and one might translate: &#8220;in the midst of lions I lie down, [among] men who want to devour me, whose teeth&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
