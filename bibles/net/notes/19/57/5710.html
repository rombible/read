<A NAME="5710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2090><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he hurls insults, one who crushes me.&#8221; The translation assumes that this line identifies those from whom the psalmist seeks deliverance. (The singular is representative; the psalmist is surrounded by enemies, see v. 4.) Another option is to understand God as the subject of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kharaf</font>), which could then be taken as a homonym of the more common root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (&#8220;insult&#8221;) meaning &#8220;confuse.&#8221; In this case &#8220;one who crushes me&#8221; is the object of the verb. One might translate, &#8220;he [God] confuses my enemies.&#8221;</p>
