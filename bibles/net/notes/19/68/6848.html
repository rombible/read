<A NAME="6848"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=2423><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;so that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God might live [there].&#8221; Many take the infinitive construct with -<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lamed</font>) as indicating purpose here, but it is unclear how the offering of tribute enables the Lord to live in Zion. This may be an occurrence of the relatively rare emphatic <i>lamed</i> (see <i>HALOT</i> 510-11 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font>, though this text is not listed as an example there). If so, the statement corresponds nicely to the final line of v. 16, which also affirms emphatically that the Lord lives in Zion.</p>
