<A NAME="6865"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=2440><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ga</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ar</font>) is often understood to mean &#8220;rebuke.&#8221; In some cases it is apparent that scolding or threatening is in view (see Gen 37:10; Ruth 2:16; Zech 3:2). However, in militaristic contexts such as Ps 68 this translation is inadequate, for the verb refers in this setting to the warrior&#8217;s battle cry, which terrifies and paralyzes the enemy. See A. Caquot, <i>TDOT</i> 3:53, and note the use of the verb in Ps 106:9 and Nah 1:4, as well as the related noun in Job 26:11; Pss 18:15; 76:6; 104:7; Isa 50:2; 51:20; 66:15.</p>
