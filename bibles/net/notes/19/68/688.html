<A NAME="688"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2383><b>tn</b> Traditionally the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1512;&#1464;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aravot</font>) is taken as &#8220;steppe-lands&#8221; (often rendered &#8220;deserts&#8221;), but here the form is probably a homonym meaning &#8220;clouds.&#8221; Verse 33, which depicts God as the one who &#8220;rides on the sky&#8221; strongly favors this (see as well Deut 33:26), as does the reference in v. 9 to God as the source of rain. The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1512;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aravah</font>, &#8220;cloud&#8221;) is cognate with Akkadian <font face="Scholar">urpatu</font><i>/</i><font face="Scholar">erpetu</font> and with Ugaritic &#8217;<font face="Scholar">rpt</font>. The phrase <font face="Scholar">rkb </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">rpt</font> (&#8220;one who rides on the clouds&#8221;) appears in Ugaritic mythological texts as an epithet of the storm god Baal. The nonphonemic interchange of the bilabial consonants <font face="Scholar">b</font> and <font face="Scholar">p</font> is attested elsewhere in roots common to Hebrew and Ugaritic, though the phenomenon is relatively rare.</p>
