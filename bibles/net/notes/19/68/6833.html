<A NAME="6833"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2408><b>tn</b> The verb form appears to be a Hiphil jussive from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1490;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shalag</font>), which is usually understood as a denominative verb from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1490;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sheleg</font>, &#8220;snow&#8221;) with an indefinite subject. The form could be taken as a preterite, in which case one might translate, &#8220;when the sovereign judge scattered kings, it snowed on Zalmon&#8221; (cf. NIV, NRSV). The point of the image is unclear. Perhaps &#8220;snow&#8221; suggests fertility and blessing (see v. 9 and Isa 55:10), or the image of a snow-capped mountain suggests grandeur.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Zalmon </i>was apparently a mountain in the region, perhaps the one mentioned in Judg 9:46 as being in the vicinity of Shechem.</p>
