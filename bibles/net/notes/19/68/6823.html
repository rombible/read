<A NAME="6823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2398><b>tn</b> The meaning of the Hebrew text is unclear; it appears to read, &#8220;your animals, they live in it,&#8221; but this makes little, if any, sense in this context. Some suggest that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khayah</font>) is a rare homonym here, meaning &#8220;community&#8221; (BDB 312 s.v.) or &#8220;dwelling place&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 310 s.v. III *<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font>). In this case one may take &#8220;your community/dwelling place&#8221; as appositional to the third feminine singular pronominal suffix at the end of v. 9, the antecedent of which is &#8220;your inheritance.&#8221; The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yashvu-vah</font>, &#8220;they live in it&#8221;) may then be understood as an asyndetic relative clause modifying &#8220;your community/dwelling place.&#8221; A literal translation of vv. 9b-10a would be, &#8220;when it [your inheritance] is tired, you sustain it, your community/dwelling place in [which] they live.&#8221;</p>
