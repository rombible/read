<A NAME="6818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2393><b>sn</b> The language of vv. 7-8 is reminiscent of Judg 5:4-5, which tells how the God of Sinai came in the storm and annihilated the Canaanite forces led by Sisera. The presence of allusion does not mean, however, that this is a purely historical reference. The psalmist is describing God&#8217;s typical appearance as a warrior in terms of his prior self-revelation as ancient events are reactualized in the psalmist&#8217;s experience. (For a similar literary technique, see Hab 3.)</p>
