<A NAME="571"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2081><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 57</i>. The psalmist asks for God&#8217;s protection and expresses his confidence that his ferocious enemies will be destroyed by their own schemes.</p>
<A NAME="572"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2082><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;do not destroy.&#8221; Perhaps this refers to a particular style of music, a tune title, or a musical instrument. These words also appear in the heading to Pss 58-59, 75.</p>
<A NAME="573"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2083><b>tn</b> The precise meaning of the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<i>miktam</i>), which also appears in the heading to Pss 16, 56, 58-60 is uncertain. <i>HALOT</i> 582-83 s.v. defines it as &#8220;inscription.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="574"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2084><b>sn</b> According to the superscription, David wrote this psalm on the occasion when he fled from Saul and hid in &#8220;the cave.&#8221; This probably refers to either the incident recorded in 1 Sam 22:1 or to the one recorded in 1 Sam 24:3.</p>
<A NAME="575"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2085><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my life has taken shelter.&#8221; The Hebrew perfect verbal form probably refers here to a completed action with continuing results.</p>
<A NAME="576"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2086><b>sn</b> <i>In the shadow of your wings</i>. The metaphor likens God to a protective mother bird (see also Pss 17:8; 36:7).</p>
<A NAME="577"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2087><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to God Most High.&#8221; The divine title &#8220;Most High&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1500;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">elyon</font>) pictures God as the exalted ruler of the universe who vindicates the innocent and judges the wicked. See especially Ps 47:2.</p>
<A NAME="578"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2088><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;avenges in favor of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="579"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2089><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;may he send from heaven and deliver me.&#8221; The prefixed verbal forms are understood as jussives expressing the psalmist&#8217;s prayer. The second verb, which has a <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) conjunctive prefixed to it, probably indicates purpose. Another option is to take the forms as imperfects expressing confidence, &#8220;he will send from heaven and deliver me&#8221; (cf. NRSV). </p>
<A NAME="5710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2090><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he hurls insults, one who crushes me.&#8221; The translation assumes that this line identifies those from whom the psalmist seeks deliverance. (The singular is representative; the psalmist is surrounded by enemies, see v. 4.) Another option is to understand God as the subject of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kharaf</font>), which could then be taken as a homonym of the more common root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (&#8220;insult&#8221;) meaning &#8220;confuse.&#8221; In this case &#8220;one who crushes me&#8221; is the object of the verb. One might translate, &#8220;he [God] confuses my enemies.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2091><b>tn</b> The cohortative form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eshkÿvah</font>, &#8220;I lie down&#8221;) is problematic, for it does not seem to carry one of the normal functions of the cohortative (resolve or request). One possibility is that the form here is a &#8220;pseudo-cohortative&#8221; used here in a gnomic sense (<i>IBHS</i> 576-77 §34.5.3b).</p>
<A NAME="5712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2092><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;&#1463;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lahat</font>) is here understood as a <i>hapax legomenon</i> meaning &#8220;devour&#8221; (see <i>HALOT</i> 521 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1492;&#1496;</font>), a homonym of the more common verb meaning &#8220;to burn.&#8221; A more traditional interpretation takes the verb from this latter root and translates, &#8220;those who are aflame&#8221; (see BDB 529 s.v.; cf. NASB &#8220;those who breathe forth fire&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="5713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2093><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my life, in the midst of lions, I lie down, devouring ones, sons of mankind, their teeth a spear and arrows and their tongue a sharp sword.&#8221; The syntax of the verse is difficult. Another option is to take &#8220;my life&#8221; with the preceding verse. For this to make sense, one must add a verb, perhaps &#8220;and may he deliver&#8221; (cf. the LXX), before the phrase. One might then translate, &#8220;May God send his loyal love and faithfulness and deliver my life.&#8221; If one does take &#8220;my life&#8221; with v. 4, then the parallelism of v. 5 is altered and one might translate: &#8220;in the midst of lions I lie down, [among] men who want to devour me, whose teeth&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2094><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;be exalted.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2095><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;over all the earth [be] your splendor.&#8221; Though no verb appears, the tone of the statement is a prayer or wish. (Note the imperative form in the preceding line.)</p>
<A NAME="5716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2096><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for my feet.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2097><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my life bends low.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>) with a pronominal suffix is often equivalent to a pronoun, especially in poetry (see BDB 660 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> 4.a).</p>
<A NAME="5718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2098><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;before me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2099><b>tn</b> The perfect form is used rhetorically here to express the psalmist&#8217;s certitude. The demise of the enemies is so certain that he can speak of it as already accomplished.</p>
<A NAME="5720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2100><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;confident&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my heart is steadfast.&#8221; The &#8220;heart&#8221; is viewed here as the seat of the psalmist&#8217;s volition and/or emotions.</p>
<A NAME="5721"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2101><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;glory,&#8221; but that makes little sense in the context. Some view <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kavod</font>, &#8220;glory&#8221;) here as a metonymy for man&#8217;s inner being (see BDB 459 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</font> 5), but it is preferable to emend the form to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1461;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kÿvediy</font>, &#8220;my liver&#8221;). Like the heart, the liver is viewed as the seat of one&#8217;s emotions. See also Pss 16:9; 30:12; 108:1, as well as H. W. Wolff, <i>Anthropology of the Old Testament</i>, 64, and M. Dahood, <i>Psalms </i>(AB), 1:90. For an Ugaritic example of the heart/liver as the source of joy, see G. R. Driver, <i>Canaanite Myths and Legends</i>, 47-48: &#8220;her [Anat&#8217;s] liver swelled with laughter, her heart was filled with joy, the liver of Anat with triumph.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5722"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2102><b>tn</b> BDB 1007 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1512;</font> takes &#8220;dawn&#8221; as an adverbial accusative, though others understand it as a personified direct object. &#8220;Dawn&#8221; is used metaphorically for the time of deliverance and vindication the psalmist anticipates. When salvation &#8220;dawns,&#8221; the psalmist will &#8220;wake up&#8221; in praise.</p>
<A NAME="5723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2103><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the peoples.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2104><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for great upon the sky [or &#8220;heavens&#8221;] [is] your loyal love.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2105><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;be exalted.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5726"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2106><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;over all the earth [be] your splendor.&#8221; Though no verb appears, the tone of the statement is a prayer or wish. (Note the imperative form in the preceding line.)</p>
