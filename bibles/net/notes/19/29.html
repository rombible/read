<A NAME="291"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1014><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 29</i>. In this hymn of praise the psalmist calls upon the heavenly assembly to acknowledge the royal splendor of the Lord. He describes the Lord&#8217;s devastating power as revealed in the thunderstorm and affirms that the Lord exerts this awesome might on behalf of his people. In its original context the psalm was a bold polemic against the Canaanite storm god Baal, for it affirms that the Lord is the real king who controls the elements of the storm, contrary to pagan belief. See R. B. Chisholm, Jr., &#8220;The Polemic against Baalism in Israel&#8217;s Early History and Literature,&#8221; <i>BSac</i> 150 (1994): 280-82.</p>
<A NAME="292"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1015><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sons of gods,&#8221; or &#8220;sons of God.&#8221; Though <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elim</font>) is vocalized as a plural form (&#8220;gods&#8221;) in the MT, it is likely that the final <i>mem</i> is actually enclitic, rather than a plural marker. In this case one may read &#8220;God.&#8221; Some, following a Qumran text and the LXX, also propose the phrase occurred in the original text of Deut 32:8.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497; &#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿney </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elim</font>, &#8220;sons of gods&#8221; or &#8220;sons of God&#8221;) occurs only here and in Ps 89:6 (89:7 HT). In Ps 89 the &#8220;sons of gods/God&#8221; are also called &#8220;the assembly of the holy ones&#8221; and &#8220;council of the holy ones.&#8221; The heavenly assembly, comprised of so-called &#8220;angels&#8221; and other supernatural<i> </i>beings, appears to be in view. See Job 5:1; 15:15 and Zech 14:5, where these supernatural beings are referred to as &#8220;holy ones.&#8221; In Canaanite mythological texts the divine council of the high god El is referred to as &#8220;the sons of El.&#8221; The OT apparently borrows the Canaanite phrase and applies it to the supernatural beings that surround the heavenly throne.</p>
<A NAME="293"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1016><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;ascribe to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> glory and strength.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="294"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1017><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;ascribe to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> the glory of his name.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shem</font>, &#8220;name&#8221;) refers here to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s reputation. (The English term &#8220;name&#8221; is often used the same way.)</p>
<A NAME="295"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1018><b>tn</b> That is, properly dressed for the occasion.</p>
<A NAME="296"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1019><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the voice of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> [is] over the water.&#8221; As the next line makes clear, the &#8220;voice of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221; is here the thunder that accompanies a violent storm. The psalm depicts the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> in the role of a warrior-king, so the thunder is his battle cry, as it were.</p>
<A NAME="297"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1020><b>tn</b> The Hebrew perfect verbal form is probably descriptive. In dramatic fashion the psalmist portrays the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> coming in the storm to do battle with his enemies and to vindicate his people.</p>
<A NAME="298"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1021><b>tn</b> Traditionally &#8220;many waters.&#8221; The geographical references in the psalm (Lebanon, Sirion, Kadesh) suggest this is a reference to the Mediterranean Sea (see Ezek 26:19; 27:26). The psalmist describes a powerful storm moving in from the sea and sweeping over the mountainous areas north of Israel. The &#8220;surging waters&#8221; may symbolize the hostile enemies of God who seek to destroy his people (see Pss 18:17; 32:6; 77:20; 93:4; 144:7; Isa 17:13; Jer 51:55; Ezek 26:19; Hab 3:15). In this case the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is depicted as elevated above and sovereign over the raging waters.</p>
<A NAME="299"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1022><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the voice of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> [is] accompanied by strength.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2910"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1023><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the voice of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> [is] accompanied by majesty.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1024><b>tn</b> The Hebrew participial form draws attention to the durative nature of the action being described.</p>
<A NAME="2912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1025><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal forms with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive here and in v. 6a carry on the descriptive function of the preceding participle (see GKC 329 §111.<i>u</i>). The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shavar</font>) appears in the Qal in the first line of the verse, and in the Piel in the second line. The verb, which means &#8220;break&#8221; in the Qal, appears thirty-six times in the Piel, always with multiple objects (the object is either a collective singular or grammatically plural or dual form). The Piel may highlight the repetition of the pluralative action, or it may suggest an intensification of action, indicating repeated action comprising a whole, perhaps with the nuance &#8220;break again and again, break in pieces.&#8221; Another option is to understand the form as resultative: &#8220;make broken&#8221; (see <i>IBHS</i> 404-7 §24.3).</p>
<A NAME="2913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1026><b>sn</b> The <i>cedars </i>of the Lebanon forest were well-known in ancient Israel for their immense size. Here they may symbolize the arrogant enemies of God (see Isa 2:12-13).</p>
<A NAME="2914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1027><b>sn</b> <i>Sirion</i> is another name for Mount Hermon (Deut 3:9).</p>
<A NAME="2915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1028><b>sn</b> Lebanon and Sirion are compared to frisky young animals (<i>a calf&#8230;a young ox</i>) who skip and jump. The thunderous shout of the Lord is so powerful, one can see the very mountains shake on the horizon.</p>
<A NAME="2916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1029><b>tn</b> The verb normally means &#8220;to hew [stone or wood],&#8221; or &#8220;to hew out.&#8221; In Hos 6:5 it seems to mean &#8220;cut in pieces,&#8221; &#8220;knock down,&#8221; or perhaps &#8220;hack&#8221; (see F. I. Andersen and D. N. Freedman, <i>Hosea </i>[AB], 428). The Ugaritic cognate can mean &#8220;assault.&#8221; In v. 7 the verb seems to have a similar meaning, perhaps &#8220;attack, strike.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;flames of fire&#8221; is an adverbial accusative; the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s shout is accompanied by &#8220;flames of fire,&#8221; that is, lightning bolts.</p>
<A NAME="2917"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1030><b>sn</b> <i>The </i><span class="smallcaps">Lord</span><i>&#8217;s shout strikes with flaming fire</i>. The short line has invited textual emendation, but its distinct, brief form may highlight the statement, which serves as the axis of a chiastic structure encompassing vv. 5-9: (A) the Lord&#8217;s shout destroys the forest (v. 5); (B) the Lord&#8217;s shout shakes the terrain (v. 6); (C) the Lord&#8217;s shout is accompanied by destructive lightning (v. 7); (B´) the Lord&#8217;s shout shakes the terrain (v. 8); (A´) the Lord&#8217;s shout destroys the forest (v. 9).</p>
<A NAME="2918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1031><b>tn</b> The Hebrew imperfect verbal forms are descriptive in function; the psalmist depicts the action as underway.</p>
<A NAME="2919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1032><b>sn</b> <i>Kadesh</i>. The references to Lebanon and Sirion in v. 6 suggest this is a reference to the northern Kadesh, located north of Damascus, not the southern Kadesh mentioned so often in the OT. See M. Dahood, <i>Psalms </i>(AB), 1:178.</p>
<A NAME="2920"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1033><b>tn</b> The Hebrew imperfect verbal form is descriptive in function; the psalmist depicts the action as underway.</p>
<A NAME="2921"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1034><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the deer.&#8221; Preserving this reading, some translate the preceding verb, &#8220;causes [the deer] to give premature birth&#8221; (cf. NEB, NASB). But the Polel of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</font>/<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khul</font>/<font face="Scholar">khil</font>) means &#8220;give birth,&#8221; not &#8220;cause to give birth,&#8221; and the statement &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s shout gives birth to deer&#8221; is absurd. In light of the parallelism (note &#8220;forests&#8221; in the next line) and v. 5, it is preferable to emend <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ayyalot</font>, &#8220;deer&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elot</font>, &#8220;large trees&#8221;) understanding the latter as an alternate form of the usual plural form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ayyalim</font>).</p>
<A NAME="2922"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1035><b>tn</b> The verb is used in Joel 1:7 of locusts stripping the leaves from a tree. The prefixed verbal form with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive here carries the descriptive function of the preceding imperfect. See GKC 329 §111.<i>t</i>.</p>
<A NAME="2923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1036><b>tn</b> The usual form of the plural of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ar</font>, &#8220;forest&#8221;) is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arim</font>). For this reason some propose an emendation to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alot</font>, &#8220;female mountain goats&#8221;) which would fit nicely in the parallelism with &#8220;deer&#8221; (cf. NEB &#8220;brings kids early to birth&#8221;). In this case one would have to understand the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khasaf</font>) to mean &#8220;cause premature birth,&#8221; an otherwise unattested homonym of the more common <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (&#8220;strip bare&#8221;).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Lord&#8217;s thunderous shout is accompanied by high winds which damage the trees of the forest.</p>
<A NAME="2924"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1037><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;In his temple, all of it says, &#8216;Glory.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1038><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mabbul</font>, &#8220;flood&#8221;) appears only here and in Gen 6-11, where it refers to the Noahic flood. Some see a reference to that event here. The presence of the article (perhaps indicating uniqueness) and the switch to the perfect verbal form (which could be taken as describing a past situation) might support this. However, the immediate context indicates that the referent of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</font> is the &#8220;surging waters&#8221; mentioned in v. 3. The article indicates waters that are definite in the mind of the speaker and the perfect is probably descriptive in function, like &#8220;thunders&#8221; in v. 3. However, even though the historical flood is not the primary referent here, there may be a literary allusion involved. The psalmist views the threatening chaotic sea as a contemporary manifestation of the destructive waters of old.</p>
<A NAME="2926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1039><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal form with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive here carries the descriptive function of the preceding perfect.</p>
<A NAME="2927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1040><b>tn</b> The imperfect verbal forms in v. 11 are either descriptive or generalizing.</p>
<A NAME="2928"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1041><b>sn</b> <i>Strength</i>. This probably refers to military power; see the use of the noun in 1 Sam 2:10 and Ps 86:16.</p>
<A NAME="2929"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1042><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;blesses his people with peace.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shalom</font>, &#8220;peace&#8221;) probably refers here to the protection and prosperity experienced by God&#8217;s people after the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> intervenes in battle on their behalf.</p>
