<A NAME="1913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=698><b>sn</b> <i>He has pitched a tent for the sun</i>. The personified sun emerges from this &#8220;tent&#8221; in order to make its daytime journey across the sky. So the &#8220;tent&#8221; must refer metaphorically to the place where the sun goes to rest during the night.</p>
