<A NAME="6111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2215><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you grant the inheritance of those who fear your name.&#8221; &#8220;Inheritance&#8221; is normally used of land which is granted as an inheritance; here it refers metaphorically to the blessings granted God&#8217;s loyal followers. To &#8220;fear&#8221; God&#8217;s name means to have a healthy respect for his revealed reputation which in turn motivates one to obey God&#8217;s commands (see Ps 86:11).</p>
