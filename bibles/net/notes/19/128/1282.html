<A NAME="1282"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=4346><b>sn</b> The precise significance of this title, which appears in Pss 120-134, is unclear. Perhaps worshipers recited these psalms when they ascended the road to Jerusalem to celebrate annual religious festivals. For a discussion of their background see L. C. Allen, <i>Psalms 101-150 </i>(WBC), 219-21.</p>
