<A NAME="10414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=3574><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from the fruit of your works the earth is full.&#8221; The translation assumes that &#8220;fruit&#8221; is literal here. If &#8220;fruit&#8221; is understood more abstractly as &#8220;product; result,&#8221; then one could translate, &#8220;the earth flourishes as a result of your deeds&#8221; (cf. NIV, NRSV, REB).</p>
