<A NAME="1293"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=4363><b>tn</b> The background of the metaphor is not entirely clear. Perhaps the &#8220;ropes&#8221; are those used to harness the ox for plowing (see Job 39:10). Verse 3 pictures the wicked plowing God&#8217;s people as if they were a field. But when God &#8220;cut the ropes&#8221; of their ox, as it were, they could no longer plow. The point of the metaphor seems to be that God took away the enemies&#8217; ability to oppress his people. See L. C. Allen, <i>Psalms 101-150 </i>(WBC), 187.</p>
