<A NAME="7242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=2618><b>tn</b> The antecedent of the third masculine singular pronominal suffix is unclear. It is unlikely that the antecedent is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">erets</font>, &#8220;earth&#8221;) because this noun is normally grammatically feminine. Perhaps <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1465;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ro</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">sh</font>, &#8220;top [of the mountains]&#8221;) is the antecedent. Another option is to understand the pronoun as referring to the king, who would then be viewed as an instrument of divine agricultural blessing (see v. 6).</p>
