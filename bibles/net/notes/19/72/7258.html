<A NAME="7258"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=2634><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the prayers of David, son of Jesse, are concluded.&#8221; As noted earlier, v. 20 appears to be a remnant of an earlier collection of psalms or an earlier edition of the Psalter. In the present arrangement of the Book of Psalms, not all psalms prior to this are attributed to David (see Pss 1-2, 10, 33, 42-50, 66-67, 71-72) and several psalms attributed to David appear after this (see Pss 86, 101, 103, 108-110, 122, 124, 131, 138-145).</p>
