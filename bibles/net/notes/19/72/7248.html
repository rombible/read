<A NAME="7248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=2624><b>tc</b> The traditional accentuation and vocalization of the MT differ from the text assumed by the present translation. The MT reads as follows: &#8220;May there be an abundance of grain in the earth, / and on the tops of the mountains! / May its [or &#8220;his&#8221;?] fruit [trees?] rustle like [the trees of] Lebanon! / May they flourish from the city, like the grass of the earth!&#8221; If one follows the MT, then it would appear that the &#8220;fruit&#8221; of the third line is a metaphorical reference to the king&#8217;s people, who flow out from the cities to populate the land (see line 4). Elsewhere in the OT people are sometimes compared to grass that sprouts up from the land (see v. 7, as well as Isa 27:6; Pss 92:7; 103:15). The translation understands a different poetic structural arrangement and, assuming the emendations mentioned in earlier notes, interprets each line of the verse to be a prayer for agricultural abundance.</p>
