<A NAME="724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2580><b>sn</b> <i>Grant the king&#8230;Grant the king&#8217;s son</i>. It is not entirely clear whether v. 1 envisions one individual or two. The phrase &#8220;the king&#8217;s son&#8221; in the second line may simply refer to &#8220;the king&#8221; of the first line, drawing attention to the fact that he has inherited his dynastic rule. Another option is that v. 1 envisions a co-regency between father and son (a common phenomenon in ancient Israel) or simply expresses a hope for a dynasty that champions justice.</p>
