<A NAME="7234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2610><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal form is jussive, not imperfect. Because the form has the prefixed <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>), some subordinate it to what precedes as a purpose/result clause. In this case the representative poor individual might be the subject of this and the following verb, &#8220;so that he may live and give to him gold of Sheba.&#8221; But the idea of the poor offering gold is incongruous. It is better to take the jussive as a prayer with the king as subject of the verb. (Perhaps the initial <i>vav</i> is dittographic; note the <i>vav</i> at the end of the last form in v. 14.) The statement is probably an abbreviated version of the formula <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497; &#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿkhiy hammelekh</font>, &#8220;may the king live&#8221;; see 1 Sam 10:24; 2 Sam 16:16; 1 Kgs 1:25, 34, 39; 2 Kgs 11:12).</p>
