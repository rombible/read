<A NAME="7251"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=2627><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;may they bless one another by him,&#8221; that is, use the king&#8217;s name in their blessing formulae because he is a prime example of one blessed by God (for examples of such blessing formulae, see Gen 48:20 and Ruth 4:11). There is some debate on whether the Hitpael form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">barakh</font>, &#8220;bless&#8221;) is reflexive-reciprocal (as assumed in the present translation) or passive. The Hitpael of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> occurs in five other passages, including the hotly debated Gen 22:18 and 26:4. In these two texts one could understand the verb form as passive and translate, &#8220;all the nations of the earth <i>will be blessed</i> through your offspring,&#8221; or one could take the Hitpael as reflexive or reciprocal and translate, &#8220;all the nations of the earth <i>will pronounce blessings</i> [i.e., on themselves or one another] by your offspring.&#8221; In the first instance Abraham&#8217;s (or Isaac&#8217;s) offspring are viewed as a channel of divine blessing. In the second instance they are viewed as a prime example of blessing that will appear as part of the nations&#8217; blessing formulae, but not necessarily as a channel of blessing to the nations. In Deut 29:18 one reads: &#8220;When one hears the words of this covenant [or &#8220;oath&#8221;] and invokes a blessing on himself (Hitpael of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font>) in his heart, saying: &#8216;I will have peace, even though I walk with a rebellious heart.&#8217;&#8221; In this case the Hitpael is clearly reflexive, as the phrases &#8220;in his heart&#8221; and &#8220;I will have peace&#8221; indicate. The Hitpael of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> appears twice in Isaiah 65:16: &#8220;The one who invokes a blessing on himself (see Deut 9:18) in the land will invoke that blessing by the God of truth; and the one who makes an oath in the land will make that oath by the God of truth.&#8221; A passive nuance does not fit here. The parallel line, which mentions making an oath, suggests that the Hitpael of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> refers here to invoking a blessing. Both pronouncements of blessing and oaths will appeal to God as the one who rewards and judges, respectively. Jer 4:2 states: &#8220;If you swear, &#8216;As surely as the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> lives,&#8217; with truth, integrity, and honesty, then the nations will pronounce blessings by him and boast in him.&#8221; A passive nuance might work (&#8220;the nations will be blessed&#8221;), but the context refers to verbal pronouncements (swearing an oath, boasting), suggesting that the Hitpael of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> refers here to invoking a blessing. The logic of the verse seems to be as follows: If Israel conducts its affairs with integrity, the nation will be favored by the Lord, which will in turn attract the surrounding nations to Israel&#8217;s God. To summarize, while the evidence might leave the door open for a passive interpretation, there is no clear cut passive use. Usage favors a reflexive or reciprocal understanding of the Hitpael of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font>. In Ps 72:17 the Hitpael of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> is followed by the prepositional phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vo</font>, &#8220;by him&#8221;). The verb could theoretically be taken as passive, &#8220;may all the nations <i>be blessed</i> through him&#8221; (cf. NIV, NRSV), because the preceding context describes the positive effects of this king&#8217;s rule on the inhabitants of the earth. But the parallel line, which employs the Piel of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ashar</font>) in a factitive/declarative sense, &#8220;regard as happy, fortunate,&#8221; suggests a reflexive or reciprocal nuance for the Hitpael of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> here. If the nations regard the ideal king as a prime example of one who is fortunate or blessed, it is understandable that they would use his name in their pronouncements of blessing.</p>
