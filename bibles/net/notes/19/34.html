<A NAME="341"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1179><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 34</i>. In this song of thanksgiving the psalmist praises God for delivering him from distress. He encourages others to be loyal to the Lord, tells them how to please God, and assures them that the Lord protects his servants. The psalm is an acrostic; vv. 1-21 begin with successive letters of the Hebrew alphabet. (Verse 6 begins with the letter <i>he</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;</font>) and v. 7 with the letter <i>zayin</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;</font>). The letter <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>), which comes between <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;</font>, seems to be omitted, although it does appear at the beginning of v. 6b. The final verse of the psalm, which begins with the letter <i>pe</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;</font>), is outside the acrostic scheme.</p>
<A NAME="342"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1180><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;By David, when he changed his sense before Abimelech and he drove him away and he went.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Pretended to be insane</i>. The psalm heading appears to refer to the account in 1 Sam 21:10-15 which tells how David, fearful that King Achish of Gath might kill him, pretended to be insane in hopes that the king would simply send him away. The psalm heading names the king Abimelech, not Achish, suggesting that the tradition is confused on this point. However, perhaps &#8220;Abimelech&#8221; was a royal title, rather than a proper name. See P. C. Craigie, <i>Psalms 1-50</i> (WBC), 278.</p>
<A NAME="343"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1181><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;bless.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="344"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1182><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;continually [will] his praise [be] in my mouth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="345"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1183><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my soul will boast&#8221;; or better, &#8220;let my soul boast.&#8221; Following the cohortative form in v. 1, it is likely that the prefixed verbal form here is jussive.</p>
<A NAME="346"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1184><b>tn</b> The two prefixed verbal forms in this verse are best taken as jussives, for the psalmist is calling his audience to worship (see v. 3).</p>
<A NAME="347"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1185><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;exalt.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="348"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1186><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I sought the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="349"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1187><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they look to him and are radiant and their faces are not ashamed.&#8221; The third person plural subject (&#8220;they&#8221;) is unidentified; there is no antecedent in the Hebrew text. For this reason some prefer to take the perfect verbal forms in the first line as imperatives, &#8220;look to him and be radiant&#8221; (cf. NEB, NRSV). Some medieval Hebrew <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> and other ancient witnesses (Aquila, the Syriac, and Jerome) support an imperatival reading for the first verb. In the second line some (with support from the LXX and Syriac) change &#8220;their faces&#8221; to &#8220;your faces,&#8221; which allows one to retain more easily the jussive force of the verb (suggested by the preceding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>]): &#8220;do not let your faces be ashamed.&#8221; It is probable that the verbal construction in the second line is rhetorical, expressing the conviction that the action in view cannot or should not happen. See GKC 322 §109.<i>e</i>.</p>
<A NAME="3410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1188><b>tn</b> The pronoun refers back to &#8220;this oppressed man,&#8221; namely, the psalmist.</p>
<A NAME="3411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1189><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his&#8221;; the referent (the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1190><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;those who fear him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1191><b>tn</b> The prefixed verb with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive here carries the same generalizing force as the active participle in the first line. See GKC 329 §111.<i>u</i>.</p>
<A NAME="3414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1192><b>tn</b> This verb is normally used of tasting or savoring food. The metaphor here appears to compare the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> to a tasty meal.</p>
<A NAME="3415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1193><b>tn</b> The Hebrew noun is an abstract plural. The word often refers metonymically to the happiness that God-given security and prosperity produce (see Pss 1:1, 3; 2:12; 41:1; 65:4; 84:12; 89:15; 106:3; 112:1; 127:5; 128:1; 144:15).</p>
<A NAME="3416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1194><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;man.&#8221; The principle of the psalm is certainly applicable to all people, regardless of their gender or age. To facilitate modern application, we translate the gender and age specific &#8220;man&#8221; with the more neutral &#8220;one.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1195><b>tn</b> &#8220;Taking shelter&#8221; in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is an idiom for seeking his protection. Seeking his protection presupposes and even demonstrates the subject&#8217;s loyalty to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. In the psalms those who &#8220;take shelter&#8221; in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> are contrasted with the wicked and equated with those who love, fear, and serve the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> (Pss 2:12; 5:11-12; 31:17-20; 34:21-22).</p>
<A NAME="3418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1196><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fear.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1197><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;O holy ones of his.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1198><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;those who fear him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1199><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the fear of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> I will teach you.&#8221; In vv. 13-14 the psalmist explains to his audience what it means to &#8220;fear&#8221; the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.</p>
<A NAME="3422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1200><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Who is the man who desires life?&#8221; The rhetorical question is used to grab the audience&#8217;s attention. &#8220;Life&#8221; probably refers here to quality of life, not just physical existence or even duration of life. See the following line.</p>
<A NAME="3423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1201><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[Who] loves days to see good?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1202><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;guard your tongue from evil.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1203><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and your lips from speaking deception.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3426"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1204><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;do good.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3427"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1205><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;seek peace and pursue it.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3428"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1206><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the eyes of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> [are] toward the godly, and his ears [are] toward their cry for help.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3429"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1207><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the face of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> [is] against the doers of evil to cut off from the earth memory of them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3430"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1208><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they&#8221; (i.e., the godly mentioned in v. 15).</p>
<A NAME="3431"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1209><b>tn</b> The three perfect verbal forms are taken in a generalizing sense in v. 17 and translated with the present tense (note the generalizing mood of vv. 18-22).</p>
<A NAME="3432"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1210><b>tn</b> The Hebrew imperfect verbal form highlights the generalizing statement and draws attention to the fact that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> typically delivers the oppressed and needy.</p>
<A NAME="3433"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1211><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the crushed in spirit.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3434"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1212><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text uses the singular form; the representative or typical godly person is envisioned.</p>
<A NAME="3435"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1213><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;trials.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3436"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1214><b>tn</b> The Hebrew imperfect verbal form highlights the generalizing statement and draws attention to the fact that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> typically delivers the godly.</p>
<A NAME="3437"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1215><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;him,&#8221; agreeing with the singular form in the preceding line.</p>
<A NAME="3438"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1216><b>tn</b> The Hebrew participial form suggests such protection is characteristic.</p>
<A NAME="3439"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1217><b>tn</b> That is, he protects the godly from physical harm.</p>
<A NAME="3440"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1218><b>sn</b> <i>Not one of them is broken</i>. The author of the Gospel of John saw a fulfillment of these words in Jesus&#8217; experience on the cross (see John 19:31-37), for the Roman soldiers, when they saw that Jesus was already dead, did not break his legs as was customarily done to speed the death of crucified individuals. John&#8217;s use of the psalm seems strange, for the statement in its original context suggests that the Lord protects the godly from physical harm. Jesus&#8217; legs may have remained unbroken, but he was brutally and unjustly executed by his enemies. John seems to give the statement a literal sense that is foreign to its original literary context by applying a promise of divine protection to a man who was seemingly not saved by God. However, John saw in this incident a foreshadowing of Jesus&#8217; ultimate deliverance and vindication. His unbroken bones were a reminder of God&#8217;s commitment to the godly and a sign of things to come. Jesus&#8217; death on the cross was not the end of the story; God vindicated him, as John goes on to explain in the following context (John 19:38-20:18).</p>
<A NAME="3441"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1219><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;evil kills the wicked [one].&#8221; The singular form is representative; the typical evil person is envisioned. The Hebrew imperfect verbal form draws attention to the typical nature of the action.</p>
<A NAME="3442"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1220><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;are guilty,&#8221; but the verb is sometimes used metonymically with the meaning &#8220;to suffer the consequences of guilt,&#8221; the effect being substituted for the cause.</p>
<A NAME="3443"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1221><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;redeems the life of his servants.&#8221; The Hebrew participial form suggests such deliverance is characteristic.</p>
<A NAME="3444"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1222><b>tn</b> &#8220;Taking shelter&#8221; in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is an idiom for seeking his protection. Seeking his protection presupposes and even demonstrates the subject&#8217;s loyalty to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. In the psalms those who &#8220;take shelter&#8221; in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> are contrasted with the wicked and equated with those who love, fear, and serve the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> (Pss 2:12; 5:11-12; 31:19).</p>
