<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=790><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 22</i>. The psalmist cries out to the Lord for deliverance from his dangerous enemies, who have surrounded him and threaten his life. Confident that the Lord will intervene, he then vows to thank the Lord publicly for his help and anticipates a time when all people will recognize the Lord&#8217;s greatness and worship him.</p>
<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=791><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;according to the doe of the dawn.&#8221; Apparently this refers to a particular musical tune or style.</p>
<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=792><b>sn</b> From the psalmist&#8217;s perspective it seems that God has abandoned him, for he fails to answer his cry for help (vv. 1b-2).</p>
<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=793><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;far from my deliverance [are] the words of my groaning.&#8221; The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1490;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">agah</font>) and its related verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1463;&#1490;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ag</font>) are sometimes used of a lion&#8217;s roar, but they can also describe human groaning (see Job 3:24 and Pss 32:3 and 38:8.</p>
<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=794><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;there is no silence to me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=795><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[O] one who sits [on] the praises of Israel.&#8221; The verb &#8220;receiving&#8221; is supplied in the translation for clarity. The metaphorical language pictures the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> as sitting enthroned as king in his temple, receiving the praises that his people Israel offer up to him.</p>
<A NAME="227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=796><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fathers.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=797><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;in you&#8221; are supplied in the translation. They are understood by ellipsis (see the preceding line).</p>
<A NAME="229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=798><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;were not ashamed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=799><b>tn</b> The grammatical construction (conjunction + pronoun) highlights the contrast between the psalmist&#8217;s experience and that of his ancestors. When he considers God&#8217;s past reliability, it only heightens his despair and confusion, for God&#8217;s present silence stands in stark contrast to his past saving acts.</p>
<A NAME="2211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=800><b>tn</b> The metaphor expresses the psalmist&#8217;s self-perception, which is based on how others treat him (see the following line).</p>
<A NAME="2212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=801><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;not a human being.&#8221; The psalmist perceives himself as less than human.</p>
<A NAME="2213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=802><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a reproach of man and despised by people.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=803><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;scoff at, deride, mock.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=804><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they separate with a lip.&#8221; Apparently this refers to their verbal taunting.</p>
<A NAME="2216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=805><b>sn</b> <i>Shake their heads</i>. Apparently this refers to a taunting gesture. See also Job 16:4; Ps 109:25; Lam 2:15.</p>
<A NAME="2217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=806><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;they say&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarification and for stylistic reasons. The psalmist here quotes the sarcastic taunts of his enemies.</p>
<A NAME="2218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=807><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;roll [yourself].&#8221; The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1500;&#1500;</font> here has the sense of &#8220;commit&#8221; (see Prov 16:3). The imperatival form in the Hebrew text indicates the enemies here address the psalmist. Since they refer to him in the third person in the rest of the verse, some prefer to emend the verb to a perfect, &#8220;he commits himself to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=808><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Let him&#8221;; the referent (the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=809><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Let him&#8221;; the referent (the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=810><b>tn</b> That is, &#8220;for he [the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>] delights in him [the psalmist].&#8221; For other cases where the expression &#8220;delight in&#8221; refers to God&#8217;s delight in a person, see Num 14:8; 1 Kgs 10:9; Pss 18:19; 40:8.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This statement does not necessarily reflect the enemies&#8217; actual belief, but it does reflect the psalmist&#8217;s confession. The psalmist&#8217;s enemies sarcastically appeal to God to help him, because he claims to be an object of divine favor. However, they probably doubted the reality of his claim.</p>
<A NAME="2222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=811><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the one who pulled me.&#8221; The verb is derived from either <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gakhah</font>; see <i>HALOT</i> 187 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1495;&#1492;</font>) or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">giyakh</font>; see BDB 161 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1463;</font>) and seems to carry the nuance &#8220;burst forth&#8221; or &#8220;pull out.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=812><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;upon you I was cast from [the] womb.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=813><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from the womb of my mother you [have been] my God.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Despite the enemies&#8217; taunts, the psalmist is certain of his relationship with God, which began from the time of his birth (<i>from the time I came out of my mother&#8217;s womb</i>).</p>
<A NAME="2225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=814><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and there is no helper.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=815><b>sn</b> The psalmist figuratively compares his enemies to dangerous <i>bulls</i>.</p>
<A NAME="2227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=816><b>sn</b> <i>Bashan</i>, located east of the Jordan River, was well-known for its cattle. See Ezek 39:18; Amos 4:1.</p>
<A NAME="2228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=817><b>tn</b> &#8220;They&#8221; refers to the psalmist&#8217;s enemies, who in the previous verse are described as &#8220;powerful bulls.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=818><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they open against me their mouth[s].&#8221; To &#8220;open the mouth against&#8221; is a Hebrew idiom associated with eating and swallowing (see Ezek 2:8; Lam 2:16).</p>
<A NAME="2230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=819><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a lion ripping and roaring.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=820><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;like water I am poured out.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=821><b>sn</b> The <i>heart</i> is viewed here as the seat of the psalmist&#8217;s strength and courage.</p>
<A NAME="2233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=822><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my strength&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kokhiy</font>), but many prefer to emend the text to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khikiy</font>, &#8220;my palate&#8221;; cf. NEB, NRSV &#8220;my mouth&#8221;) assuming that an error of transposition has occurred in the traditional Hebrew text.</p>
<A NAME="2234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=823><b>tn</b> Cf. NEB &#8220;my jaw&#8221;; NASB, NRSV &#8220;my jaws&#8221;; NIV &#8220;the roof of my mouth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=824><b>sn</b> Here the psalmist addresses God and suggests that God is ultimately responsible for what is happening because of his failure to intervene (see vv. 1-2, 11).</p>
<A NAME="2236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=825><b>sn</b> The imperfect verbal form draws attention to the progressive nature of the action. The psalmist is in the process of dying.</p>
<A NAME="2237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=826><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;for.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=827><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;like a lion, my hands and my feet.&#8221; This reading is often emended because it is grammatically awkward, but perhaps its awkwardness is by rhetorical design. Its broken syntax may be intended to convey the panic and terror felt by the psalmist. The psalmist may envision a lion pinning the hands and feet of its victim to the ground with its paws (a scene depicted in ancient Near Eastern art), or a lion biting the hands and feet. The line has been traditionally translated, &#8220;they pierce my hands and feet,&#8221; and then taken as foreshadowing the crucifixion of Christ. Though Jesus does appropriate the language of this psalm while on the cross (compare v. 1 with Matt 27:46 and Mark 15:34), the NT does not cite this verse in describing the death of Jesus. (It does refer to vv. 7-8 and 18, however. See Matt 27:35, 39, 43; Mark 15:24, 29; Luke 23:34; John 19:23-24.) If one were to insist on an emendation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1458;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ka</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ariy</font>, &#8220;like a lion&#8221;) to a verb, the most likely verbal root would be <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">karah</font>, &#8220;dig&#8221;; see the LXX). In this context this verb could refer to the gnawing and tearing of wild dogs (cf. NCV, TEV, CEV). The ancient Greek version produced by Symmachus reads &#8220;bind&#8221; here, perhaps understanding a verbal root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1512;&#1498;</font>, which is attested in later Hebrew and Aramaic and means &#8220;to encircle, entwine, embrace&#8221; (see <i>HALOT</i> 497-98 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1512;&#1498;</font> and Jastrow 668 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font>). Neither one of these proposed verbs can yield a meaning &#8220;bore, pierce.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=828><b>tn</b> The imperfect verbal forms in vv. 17-18 draw attention to the progressive nature of the action.</p>
<A NAME="2240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=829><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they.&#8221; The masculine form indicates the enemies are in view. The referent (the psalmist&#8217;s enemies) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=830><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they gaze, they look upon me.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="2245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=834><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;my life.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2246"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=835><b>tn</b> The verb &#8220;save&#8221; is supplied in the translation; it is understood by ellipsis (see &#8220;deliver&#8221; in the preceding line).</p>
<A NAME="2247"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=836><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my only one.&#8221; The psalmist may mean that his life is precious, or that he feels isolated and alone.</p>
<A NAME="2248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=837><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from the hand.&#8221; Here &#8220;hand&#8221; is understood by metonymy as a reference to the &#8220;paw&#8221; and thus the &#8220;claws&#8221; of the wild dogs.</p>
<A NAME="2249"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=838><b>sn</b> The psalmist again compares his enemies to vicious <i>dogs</i> and ferocious <i>lions</i> (see vv. 13, 16).</p>
<A NAME="2250"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=839><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1461;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">remim</font>) appears to be an alternate spelling of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">emim</font>, &#8220;wild oxen&#8221;; see BDB 910 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1501;</font>).</p>
<A NAME="2251"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=840><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and from the horns of the wild oxen you answer me.&#8221; Most take the final verb with the preceding prepositional phrase. Some understand the verb form as a relatively rare precative perfect, expressing a wish or request (see <i>IBHS</i> 494-95 §30.5.4c, d). However, not all grammarians are convinced that the perfect is used as a precative in biblical Hebrew. (See the discussion at Ps 3:7.) Others prefer to take the perfect in its usual indicative sense. The psalmist, perhaps in response to an oracle of salvation, affirms confidently that God has answered him, assuring him that deliverance is on the way. The present translation takes the prepositional phrase as parallel to the preceding &#8220;from the mouth of the lion&#8221; and as collocated with the verb &#8220;rescue&#8221; at the beginning of the verse. &#8220;You have answered me&#8221; is understood as a triumphant shout which marks a sudden shift in tone and introduces the next major section of the psalm. By isolating the statement syntactically, the psalmist highlights the declaration.</p>
<A NAME="2252"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=841><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;brothers,&#8221; but here the term does not carry a literal familial sense. It refers to the psalmist&#8217;s fellow members of the Israelite covenant community (see v. 23).</p>
<A NAME="2253"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=842><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[you] fearers of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.&#8221; See Ps 15:4.</p>

<A NAME="2256"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=845><b>sn</b> In this verse the psalmist refers to himself in the third person and characterizes himself as oppressed.</p>
<A NAME="2257"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=846><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he did not hide his face from him.&#8221; For other uses of the idiom &#8220;hide the face&#8221; meaning &#8220;ignore,&#8221; see Pss 10:11; 13:1; 51:9. Sometimes the idiom carries the stronger idea of &#8220;reject&#8221; (see Pss 27:9; 88:14).</p>
<A NAME="2258"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=847><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;heard.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="2260"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=849><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my vows I will fulfill before those who fear him.&#8221; When asking the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> for help, the psalmists would typically promise to praise the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> publicly if he intervened and delivered them.</p>
<A NAME="2261"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=850><b>sn</b> <i>Eat and be filled</i>. In addition to praising the Lord, the psalmist also offers a thank offering to the Lord and invites others to share in a communal meal.</p>

NEB). Another option (cf. NIV, NRSV) is to take the forms as imperfects and translate, &#8220;all the people of the earth will acknowledge and turn&#8230;and worship.&#8221; See vv. 29-32.</p>
<A NAME="2264"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=853><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;families of the nations.&#8221;</p>

The psalmist envisions all people, whether healthy or dying, joining in worship of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.</p>
<A NAME="2268"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=857><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;eat and worship.&#8221; The verb forms (a perfect followed by a prefixed form with <i>vav</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>] consecutive) are normally used in narrative to relate completed actions. Here the psalmist uses the forms rhetorically as he envisions a time when the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will receive universal worship. The mood is one of wishful thinking and anticipation; this is not prophecy in the strict sense.</p>
<A NAME="2269"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=858><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all of the ones going down [into] the dust.&#8221; This group stands in contrast to those mentioned in the previous line.
