<A NAME="531"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1946><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 53</i>. This psalm is very similar to Ps 14. The major difference comes in v. 5, which corresponds to, but differs quite a bit from, Ps 14:5-6, and in the use of the divine name. Ps 14 uses &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yÿhvah</font>, &#8220;Yahweh&#8221;) in vv. 2a, 4, 6, and 7, while Ps 53 employs &#8220;God&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohim</font>) throughout, as one might expect in Pss 42-83, where the name &#8220;Yahweh&#8221; is relatively infrequent. The psalmist observes that the human race is morally corrupt. Evildoers oppress God&#8217;s people, but the psalmist is confident of God&#8217;s protection and anticipates a day when God will vindicate Israel.</p>
<A NAME="532"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1947><b>tn</b> The meaning of the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">makhalat</font>, &#8220;machalath&#8221;) is uncertain; perhaps it refers to a particular style of music, a tune title, or a musical instrument. The term also appears in the heading of Ps 88.</p>
<A NAME="533"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1948><b>tn</b> The meaning of the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">maskil</font>) is uncertain. See the note on the phrase &#8220;well-written song&#8221; in the superscription of Ps 52.</p>
<A NAME="534"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1949><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a fool says in his heart.&#8221; The singular is used here in a collective or representative sense; the typical fool is envisioned.</p>
<A NAME="535"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1950><b>sn</b> <i>There is no God</i>. This statement is probably not a philosophical assertion that God does not exist, but rather a confident affirmation that he is unconcerned about how men live morally and ethically (see Ps 10:4, 11).</p>
<A NAME="536"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1951><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they act corruptly, they do evil [with] injustice.&#8221; Ps 14:1 has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alilah</font>, &#8220;a deed&#8221;) instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1493;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aval</font>, &#8220;injustice&#8221;). The verbs describe the typical behavior of the wicked. The subject of the plural verbs is &#8220;sons of man&#8221; (v. 2). The entire human race is characterized by sinful behavior. This practical atheism &#8211; living as if there is no God who will hold them accountable for their actions &#8211; makes them fools, for one of the earmarks of folly is to fail to anticipate the long range consequences of one&#8217;s behavior.</p>
<A NAME="537"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1952><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;there is none that does good.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="538"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1953><b>sn</b> The picture of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> looking <i>down from heaven</i> draws attention to his sovereignty over the world.</p>
<A NAME="539"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1954><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;upon the sons of man.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1955><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;acts wisely.&#8221; The Hiphil is exhibitive.</p>
<A NAME="5311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1956><b>tn</b> That is, who seeks to have a relationship with God by obeying and worshiping him.</p>
<A NAME="5312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1957><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all of it turns away.&#8221; Ps 14:1 has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hakkol</font>) instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1467;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;</font>, and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sar</font>, &#8220;turn aside&#8221;) instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1490;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sag</font>, &#8220;turn away&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="5313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1958><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;together they are corrupt.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1959><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;there is none that does good.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1960><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the workers of wickedness.&#8221; See Pss 5:5; 6:8. Ps 14:4 adds <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kol</font>, &#8220;all of&#8221;) before &#8220;workers of wickedness.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1961><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Do they not understand?&#8221; The rhetorical question expresses the psalmist&#8217;s amazement at their apparent lack of understanding. This may refer to their lack of moral understanding, but it more likely refers to their failure to anticipate God&#8217;s defense of his people (see vv. 5-6).</p>
<A NAME="5317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1962><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;there they are afraid [with] fear.&#8221; The perfect verbal form is probably used in a rhetorical manner; the psalmist describes the future demise of the oppressors as if it were already occurring. The adverb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sham</font>, &#8220;there&#8221;) is also used here for dramatic effect, as the psalmist envisions the wicked standing in fear at a spot that is this vivid in his imagination (BDB 1027 s.v.). The cognate accusative following the verb emphasizes the degree of their terror (&#8220;absolutely&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="5318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1963><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;there is no fear.&#8221; Apparently this means the evildoers are so traumatized with panic (see v. 5b) that they now jump with fear at everything, even those things that would not normally cause fear. Ps 14:5 omits this line.</p>
<A NAME="5319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1964><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;scatters the bones.&#8221; The perfect is used in a rhetorical manner, describing this future judgment as if it were already accomplished. Scattering the bones alludes to the aftermath of a battle. God annihilates his enemies, leaving their carcasses spread all over the battlefield. As the bodies are devoured by wild animals and decay, the bones of God&#8217;s dead enemies are exposed. See Ps 141:7.</p>
<A NAME="5320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1965><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[those who] encamp [against] you.&#8221; The second person masculine singular pronominal suffix probably refers to God&#8217;s people viewed as a collective whole. Instead of &#8220;for God scatters the bones of those who encamp against you,&#8221; Ps 14:5 reads, &#8220;for God is with a godly generation.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1966><b>tn</b> Once again the perfect is used in a rhetorical manner, describing this future judgment as if it were already accomplished. As in the previous line, God&#8217;s people are probably addressed. The second person singular verb form is apparently collective, suggesting that the people are viewed here as a unified whole. Ps 14:6 reads here &#8220;the counsel of the oppressed you put to shame, even though God is his shelter,&#8221; the words being addressed to the wicked.</p>
<A NAME="5322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1967><b>tn</b> This refers metonymically to God, the one who lives in Zion and provides deliverance for Israel.</p>
<A NAME="5323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1968><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;turns with a turning [toward] his people.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿvut</font>) is apparently a cognate accusative of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shuv</font>).</p>
<A NAME="5324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1969><b>tn</b> The verb form is jussive.</p>
<A NAME="5325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1970><b>tn</b> Because the parallel verb is jussive, this verb, which is ambiguous in form, should be taken as a jussive as well.</p>
