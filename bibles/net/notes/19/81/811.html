The psalmist calls God&#8217;s people to assemble for a festival and then proclaims God&#8217;s message to them. The divine speech (vv. 6-16) recalls how God delivered the people from Egypt, reminds Israel of their rebellious past, expresses God&#8217;s desire for his people to obey him, and promises divine protection in exchange for obedience.</p>
