<A NAME="8128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=3002><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he fed him from the best of the wheat.&#8221; The Hebrew text has a third person form of the preterite with a <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive attached. However, it is preferable, in light of the use of the first person in v. 14 and in the next line, to emend the verb to a first person form and understand the <i>vav</i> as conjunctive, continuing the apodosis of the conditional sentence of vv. 13-14. The third masculine singular pronominal suffix refers to Israel, as in v. 6.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>I would feed</i>. After the parenthetical &#8220;curse&#8221; in v. 15, the Lord&#8217;s speech continues here.</p>
