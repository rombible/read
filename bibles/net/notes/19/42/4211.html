<A NAME="4211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1528><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;These things I will remember and I will pour out upon myself my soul.&#8221; &#8220;These things&#8221; are identified in the second half of the verse as those times when the psalmist worshiped in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s temple. The two cohortative forms indicate the psalmist&#8217;s resolve to remember and weep. The expression &#8220;pour out upon myself my soul&#8221; refers to mourning (see Job 30:16).</p>
