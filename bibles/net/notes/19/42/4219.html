<A NAME="4219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1536><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Hermons.&#8221; The plural form of the name occurs only here in the OT. Some suggest the plural refers to multiple mountain peaks (cf. NASB) or simply retain the plural in the translation (cf. NEB), but the final <i>mem</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1501;</font>) is probably dittographic (note that the next form in the text begins with the letter <i>mem</i>) or enclitic. At a later time it was misinterpreted as a plural marker and vocalized accordingly.</p>
