<A NAME="151"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=452><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 15</i>. This psalm describes the character qualities that one must possess to be allowed access to the divine presence.</p>
<A NAME="152"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=453><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Who may live as a resident alien in your tent?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="153"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=454><b>sn</b> In this context the Lord&#8217;s <i>holy hill</i> probably refers to Zion/Jerusalem. See Isa 66:20; Joel 2:1; 3:17; Zech 8:3; Pss 2:6; 43:3; 48:1; 87:1; Dan 9:16.</p>
<A NAME="154"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=455><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;one who walks blamelessly.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="155"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=456><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;one who speaks truth in his heart&#8221;; or &#8220;one who speaks truth [that is] in his heart.&#8221; This apparently refers to formulating a truthful statement in one&#8217;s mind and then honestly revealing that statement in one&#8217;s speech.</p>
<A NAME="156"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=457><b>sn</b> Hebrew literature often assumes and reflects the male-oriented perspective of ancient Israelite society. The principle of the psalm is certainly applicable to all people, regardless of their gender or age.</p>
<A NAME="157"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=458><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he does not slander upon his tongue.&#8221; For another example of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ragal</font>, &#8220;slander&#8221;) see 2 Sam 19:28.</p>
<A NAME="158"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=459><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;his fellow.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="159"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=460><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he does not lift up an insult against one who is near to him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=461><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;despised in his eyes [is] a rejected [one].&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1505;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nim</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">as</font>, &#8220;rejected [one]&#8221;) apparently refers here to one who has been rejected by God because of his godless behavior. It stands in contrast to &#8220;those who fear God&#8221; in the following line.</p>
<A NAME="1511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=462><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;those who fear the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.&#8221; The one who fears the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> respects his sovereignty and obeys his commandments. See Ps 128:1; Prov 14:2.</p>
<A NAME="1512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=463><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he takes an oath to do harm and does not change.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;to do harm&#8221; cannot mean &#8220;do harm to others,&#8221; for the preceding verse clearly characterizes this individual as one who does <i>not</i> harm others. In this context the phrase must refer to an oath to which a self-imprecation is attached. The godly individual takes his commitments to others so seriously he is willing to &#8220;swear to his own hurt.&#8221; For an example of such an oath, see Ruth 1:16-17.</p>
<A NAME="1513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=464><b>sn</b> <i>He does not charge interest</i>. Such an individual is truly generous, and not simply concerned with making a profit.</p>
<A NAME="1514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=465><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a bribe against the innocent he does not take.&#8221; For other texts condemning the practice of a judge or witness taking a bribe, see Exod 23:8; Deut 16:19; 27:25; 1 Sam 8:3; Ezek 22:12; Prov 17:23.</p>
<A NAME="1515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=466><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;does these things.&#8221;</p>
