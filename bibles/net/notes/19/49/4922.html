<A NAME="4922"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1800><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;their inward part [is] their houses [are] permanent, their dwelling places for a generation and a generation.&#8221; If one follows the MT, then <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qerev</font>, &#8220;inward part&#8221;) must refer to the seat of these people&#8217;s thoughts (for other examples of this use of the term, see BDB 899 s.v., though BDB prefers an emendation in this passage). In this case all three lines of v. 11 expose these people&#8217;s arrogant assumption that they will last forever, which then stands in sharp contrast to reality as summarized in v. 12. In this case one might translate the first two lines, &#8220;they think that their houses are permanent and that their dwelling places will last forever&#8221; (cf. NASB). Following the lead of several ancient versions, the present translation assumes an emendation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qirbam</font>, &#8220;their inward part&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qÿvarim</font>, &#8220;graves&#8221;). This assumes that the letters <i>bet</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;</font>) and <i>resh</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;</font>) were accidentally transposed in the MT. In this case the first two lines support the point made in v. 10, while the third line of v. 11 stands in contrast to v. 12. The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">olam</font>, &#8220;permanent house&#8221;) is used of a tomb in Eccl 12:5 (as well as in Phoenician tomb inscriptions, see <i>DNWSI</i> 1:160 for a list of texts) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mishkan</font>, &#8220;dwelling place&#8221;) refers to a tomb in Isa 22:16. Cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV.</p>
