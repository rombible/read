<A NAME="4927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1805><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;this [is] their way, [there is] folly [belonging] to them.&#8221; The Hebrew term translated &#8220;this&#8221; could refer (1) back to the preceding verse[s] or (2) ahead to the subsequent statements. The translation assumes the latter, since v. 12 appears to be a refrain that concludes the psalm&#8217;s first major section and marks a structural boundary. (A similar refrain [see v. 20] concludes the second half of the psalm.) The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">derekh</font>, &#8220;way&#8221;) often refers to one&#8217;s lifestyle, but, if it relates to what follows, then here it likely refers metonymically to one&#8217;s destiny (the natural outcome of one&#8217;s lifestyle [cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV &#8220;fate&#8221;]). (See the discussion in K. Koch, <i>TDOT</i> 3:285.) If one prefers the more common nuance (&#8220;lifestyle&#8221;), then the term would look back to the self-confident attitude described in the earlier verses.</p>
