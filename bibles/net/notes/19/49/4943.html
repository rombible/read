<A NAME="4943"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1821><b>tn</b> Verses 18-19a are one long sentence in the Hebrew text, which reads: &#8220;Though he blesses his soul in his life, [saying], &#8216;And let them praise you, for you do well for yourself,&#8217; it [that is, his soul] will go to the generation of his fathers.&#8221; This has been divided into two sentences in the translation for clarity, in keeping with the tendency of contemporary English to use shorter sentences.</p>
