<A NAME="491"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1779><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 49</i>. In this so-called wisdom psalm (see v. 3) the psalmist states that he will not fear the rich enemies who threaten him, for despite their wealth, they are mere men who will die like everyone else. The psalmist is confident the Lord will vindicate the godly and protect them from the attacks of their oppressors.</p>
