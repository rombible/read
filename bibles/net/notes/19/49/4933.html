<A NAME="4933"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1811><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;their form [will become an object] for the consuming of Sheol, from a lofty residence, to him.&#8221; The meaning of this syntactically difficult text is uncertain. The translation assumes that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsur</font>, &#8220;form&#8221;; this is the <i>Qere</i> [marginal] reading; the <i>Kethib</i> has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1464;&#1501;</font> [<font face="Scholar">tsiram</font>, &#8220;their image&#8221;]) refers to their physical form or bodies. &#8220;Sheol&#8221; is taken as the subject of &#8220;consume&#8221; (on the implied &#8220;become&#8221; before the infinitive &#8220;to consume&#8221; see GKC 349 §114.<i>k</i>). The preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">min</font>) prefixed to &#8220;lofty residence&#8221; is understood as privative, &#8220;away from; so as not.&#8221; The preposition -<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lamed</font>) is possessive, while the third person pronominal suffix is understood as a representative singular.</p>
