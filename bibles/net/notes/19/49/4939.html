<A NAME="4939"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1817><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he will take me.&#8221; To improve the poetic balance of the verse, some move the words &#8220;from the power of Sheol&#8221; to the following line. The verse would then read: &#8220;But God will rescue my life; / from the power of Sheol he will certainly deliver me&#8221; (cf. NEB).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> According to some, the psalmist here anticipates the resurrection (or at least an afterlife in God&#8217;s presence). But it is more likely that the psalmist here expresses his hope that God <i>will rescue</i> him from premature death at the hands of the rich oppressors denounced in the psalm. The psalmist is well aware that all (the wise and foolish) die (see vv. 7-12), but he is confident God will lead him safely through the present &#8220;times of trouble&#8221; (v. 5) and sweep the wicked away to their final destiny. The theme is a common one in the so-called wisdom psalms (see Pss 1, 34, 37, 112). For a fuller discussion of the psalmists&#8217; view of the afterlife, see R. B. Chisholm, Jr., &#8220;A Theology of the Psalms,&#8221; <i>A Biblical Theology of the Old Testament</i>, 284-88.</p>
