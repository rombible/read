<A NAME="4928"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1806><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and after them, in their mouth they take delight.&#8221; The meaning of the MT is not entirely clear. &#8220;After them&#8221; is understood here as substantival, &#8220;those who come after them&#8221; or &#8220;those who follow them.&#8221; &#8220;Their mouth&#8221; is taken as a metonymy for the arrogant attitude verbalized by the rich. In the expression &#8220;take delight in,&#8221; the preposition -<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet</font>) introduces the object/cause of one&#8217;s delight (see Pss 147:10; 149:4). So the idea here is that those who come after/follow the rich find the philosophy of life they verbalize and promote to be attractive and desirable.</p>
