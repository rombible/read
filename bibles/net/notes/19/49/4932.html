<A NAME="4932"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1810><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;will rule over them in the morning.&#8221; &#8220;Morning&#8221; here is a metaphor for a time of deliverance and vindication after the dark &#8220;night&#8221; of trouble (see Pss 30:5; 46:5; 59:16; 90:14; 143:8; Isa 17:14). In this context the psalmist confidently anticipates a day of vindication when the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will deliver the oppressed from the rich (see v. 15) and send the oppressors to Sheol.</p>
