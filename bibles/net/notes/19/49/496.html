<A NAME="496"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1784><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will turn my ear to a wise saying, I will open [i.e., &#8220;reveal; explain&#8221;] my insightful saying with a harp.&#8221; In the first line the psalmist speaks as a pupil who learns a song of wisdom from a sage. This suggests that the resulting insightful song derives from another source, perhaps God himself. Elsewhere the Hebrew word pair <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font>/<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mashal</font>/<font face="Scholar">khidah</font>) refers to a taunt song (Hab 2:6), a parable (Ezek 17:2), lessons from history (Ps 78:2), and proverbial sayings (Prov 1:6). Here it appears to refer to the insightful song that follows, which reflects on the mortality of humankind and the ultimate inability of riches to prevent the inevitable &#8211; death. Another option is that the word pair refers more specifically to the closely related proverbial sayings of vv. 12, 20 (note the use of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mashal</font>, &#8220;to be like&#8221; in both verses). In this case the psalmist first hears the sayings and then explains (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;opens&#8221;) their significance (see vv. 5-11, 13-19).</p>
