<A NAME="4912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1790><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he cannot pay to God his ransom price.&#8221; Num 35:31 may supply the legal background for the metaphorical language used here. The psalmist pictures God as having a claim on the soul of the individual. When God comes to claim the life that ultimately belongs to him, he demands a ransom price that is beyond the capability of anyone to pay. The psalmist&#8217;s point is that God has ultimate authority over life and death; all the money in the world cannot buy anyone a single day of life beyond what God has decreed.</p>
