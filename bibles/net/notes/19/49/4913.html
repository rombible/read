<A NAME="4913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1791><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;their life.&#8221; Some emend the text to &#8220;his life,&#8221; understanding the antecedent of the pronoun as &#8220;brother&#8221; in v. 7. However, the man and brother of v. 7 are representative of the human race in general, perhaps explaining why a plural pronoun appears in v. 8. Of course, the plural pronoun could refer back to &#8220;the rich&#8221; mentioned in v. 6. Another option (the one assumed in the translation) is that the suffixed <i>mem</i> is enclitic. In this case the &#8220;ransom price for human life&#8221; is referred to an abstract, general way.</p>
