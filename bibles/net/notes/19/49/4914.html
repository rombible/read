<A NAME="4914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1792><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and one ceases forever.&#8221; The translation assumes an indefinite subject which in turn is representative of the entire human race (&#8220;one,&#8221; that refers to human beings without exception). The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khadal</font>, &#8220;cease&#8221;) is understood in the sense of &#8220;come to an end; fail&#8221; (i.e., die). Another option is to translate, &#8220;and one ceases/refrains forever.&#8221; In this case the idea is that the living, convinced of the reality of human mortality, give up all hope of &#8220;buying off&#8221; God and refrain from trying to do so.</p>
