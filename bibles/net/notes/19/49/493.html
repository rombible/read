<A NAME="493"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1781><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;even the sons of mankind, even the sons of man.&#8221; Because of the parallel line, where &#8220;rich and poor&#8221; are mentioned, some treat these expressions as polar opposites, with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497; &#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿney </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adam</font>) referring to the lower classes and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497; &#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿney </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ish</font>) to higher classes (cf. NIV, NRSV). But usage does not support such a view. The rare phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497; &#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (&#8220;sons of man&#8221;) appears to refer to human beings in general in its other uses (see Pss 4:2; 62:9; Lam 3:33). It is better to understand &#8220;even the sons of mankind&#8221; and &#8220;even the sons of man&#8221; as synonymous expressions (cf. NEB &#8220;all mankind, every living man&#8221;). The repetition emphasizes the need for all people to pay attention, for the psalmist&#8217;s message is relevant to everyone.</p>
