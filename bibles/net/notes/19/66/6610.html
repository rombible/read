<A NAME="6610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2345><b>tn</b> Because of the reference to &#8220;the river,&#8221; some understand this as an allusion to Israel&#8217;s crossing the Jordan River. However, the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nahad</font>) does not always refer to a &#8220;river&#8221; in the technical sense; it can be used of sea currents (see Jonah 2:4). So this line may also refer to the Red Sea crossing (cf. NEB).</p>
