<A NAME="4543"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1679><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and a daughter of Tyre with a gift, your face they will appease, the rich of people.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;daughter of Tyre&#8221; occurs only here in the OT. It could be understood as addressed to the bride, indicating she was a Phoenician (cf. NEB). However, often in the OT the word &#8220;daughter,&#8221; when collocated with the name of a city or country, is used to personify the referent (see, for example, &#8220;Daughter Zion&#8221; in Ps 9:14, and &#8220;Daughter Babylon&#8221; in Ps 137:8). If that is the case here, then &#8220;Daughter Tyre&#8221; identifies the city-state of Tyre as the place from which the rich people come (cf. NRSV). The idiom &#8220;appease the face&#8221; refers to seeking one&#8217;s favor (see Exod 32:11; 1 Sam 13:12; 1 Kgs 13:6; 2 Kgs 13:4; 2 Chr 33:12; Job 11:19; Ps 119:58; Prov 19:6; Jer 26:19; Dan 9:13; Zech 7:2; 8:21-22; Mal 1:9).</p>
