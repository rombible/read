<A NAME="4525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1661><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>oil of joy</i> alludes to the fact that the coronation of the king, which was ritually accomplished by anointing his head with olive oil, was a time of great celebration and renewed hope. (If one understands the anointing in conjunction with the wedding ceremony, the &#8220;joy&#8221; would be that associated with the marriage.) The phrase &#8220;oil of joy&#8221; also appears in Isa 61:3, where mourners are granted &#8220;oil of joy&#8221; in conjunction with their deliverance from oppression.</p>
