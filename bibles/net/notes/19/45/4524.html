<A NAME="4524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1660><b>sn</b> <i>Anointed you</i>. When read in the light of the preceding context, the anointing is most naturally taken as referring to the king&#8217;s coronation. However, the following context (vv. 8-9) focuses on the wedding ceremony, so some prefer to see this anointing as part of the king&#8217;s preparations for the wedding celebration. Perhaps the reference to his anointing at his coronation facilitates the transition to the description of the wedding, for the king was also anointed on this occasion.</p>
