<A NAME="458"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1644><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;favor is poured out on your lips.&#8221; &#8220;Lips&#8221; probably stands by metonymy for the king&#8217;s speech. Some interpret the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khen</font>) as referring here to &#8220;gracious (i.e., kind and polite) speech&#8221;, but the word probably refers more generally to &#8220;attractive&#8221; speech that is impressively articulated and fitting for the occasion. For other instances of the term being used of speech, see Prov 22:11 and Eccl 10:12.</p>
