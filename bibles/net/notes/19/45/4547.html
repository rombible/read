<A NAME="4547"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1683><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;virgins after her, her companions, are led to you.&#8221; Some emend <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lakh</font>, &#8220;to you&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lah</font>, &#8220;to her,&#8221; i.e., the princess), because the princess is now being spoken of in the third person (vv. 13-14a), rather than being addressed directly (as in vv. 10-12). However, the ambiguous suffixed form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1498;&#1456;</font> need not be taken as second feminine singular. The suffix can be understood as a pausal second masculine singular form, addressed to the king. The translation assumes this to be the case; note that the king is addressed once more in vv. 16-17, where the second person pronouns are masculine.</p>
