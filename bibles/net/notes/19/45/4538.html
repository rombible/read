<A NAME="4538"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1674><b>tn</b> After the preceding imperatives, the jussive verbal form with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) conjunctive is best understood as introducing a purpose (&#8220;so that the king might desire your beauty&#8221;) or result clause (see the present translation and cf. also NASB). The point seems to be this: The bride might tend to be homesick, which in turn might cause her to mourn and diminish her attractiveness. She needs to overcome this temptation to unhappiness and enter into the marriage with joy. Then the king will be drawn to her natural beauty.</p>
