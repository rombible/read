<BODY ><p>
<A NAME="111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=358><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 11</i>. The psalmist rejects the advice to flee from his dangerous enemies. Instead he affirms his confidence in God&#8217;s just character and calls down judgment on evildoers.</p>
<A NAME="112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=359><b>tn</b> The Hebrew perfect verbal form probably refers here to a completed action with continuing results.</p>
<A NAME="113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=360><b>tn</b> The pronominal suffix attached to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>) is equivalent to a personal pronoun. See Ps 6:3.</p>
<A NAME="114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=361><b>tc</b> The MT is corrupt here. The <i>Kethib</i> (consonantal text) reads: &#8220;flee [masculine plural!] to your [masculine plural!] mountain, bird.&#8221; The <i>Qere</i> (marginal reading) has &#8220;flee&#8221; in a feminine singular form, agreeing grammatically with the addressee, the feminine noun &#8220;bird.&#8221; Rather than being a second masculine plural pronominal suffix, the ending <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1462;&#1501;</font>- (-<font face="Scholar">khem</font>) attached to &#8220;mountain&#8221; is better interpreted as a second feminine singular pronominal suffix followed by an enclitic <i>mem</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1501;</font>). &#8220;Bird&#8221; may be taken as vocative (&#8220;O bird&#8221;) or as an adverbial accusative of manner (&#8220;like a bird&#8221;). Either way, the psalmist&#8217;s advisers compare him to a helpless bird whose only option in the face of danger is to fly away to an inaccessible place.</p>
<A NAME="115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=362><b>tn</b> In the psalms the &#8220;wicked&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">rÿsha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>) are typically proud, practical atheists (Ps 10:2, 4, 11) who hate God&#8217;s commands, commit sinful deeds, speak lies and slander (Ps 50:16-20), and cheat others (Ps 37:21). They oppose God and threaten his people (Ps 3:8).</p>
<A NAME="116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=363><b>tn</b> The Hebrew imperfect verbal form depicts the enemies&#8217; hostile action as underway.</p>
<A NAME="117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=364><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a bow.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=365><b>sn</b> <i>In the darkness</i>. The enemies&#8217; attack, the precise form of which is not indicated, is compared here to a night ambush by archers; the psalmist is defenseless against this deadly attack.</p>
<A NAME="119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=366><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;pure of heart.&#8221; The &#8220;heart&#8221; is here viewed as the seat of one&#8217;s moral character and motives. The &#8220;pure of heart&#8221; are God&#8217;s faithful followers who trust in and love the Lord and, as a result, experience his deliverance (see Pss 7:10; 32:11; 36:10; 64:10; 94:15; 97:11).</p>
<A NAME="1110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=367><b>tn</b> The precise meaning of this rare word is uncertain. An Ugaritic cognate is used of the &#8220;bottom&#8221; or &#8220;base&#8221; of a cliff or mountain (see G. R. Driver, <i>Canaanite Myths and Legends</i>, 47, 159). The noun appears in postbiblical Hebrew with the meaning &#8220;foundation&#8221; (see Jastrow 1636 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1514;</font>).</p>
<A NAME="1111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=368><b>tn</b> The singular form is used here in a collective or representative sense. Note the plural form &#8220;pure [of heart]&#8221; in the previous verse.</p>
<A NAME="1112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=369><b>sn</b> The quotation of the advisers&#8217; words (which begins in 11:1c) ends at this point. They advise the psalmist to flee because the enemy is poised to launch a deadly attack. In such a lawless and chaotic situation godly people like the psalmist can accomplish nothing, so they might as well retreat to a safe place.</p>
<A NAME="1113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=370><b>tn</b> Because of the royal imagery involved here, one could translate &#8220;lofty palace.&#8221; The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s heavenly temple is in view here (see Mic 1:2-4).</p>
<A NAME="1114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=371><b>sn</b> <i>The </i><span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;<i>s throne is in heaven</i>. The psalmist is confident that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> reigns as sovereign king, &#8220;keeps an eye on&#8221; all people, and responds in a just manner to the godly and wicked.</p>
<A NAME="1115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=372><b>sn</b> <i>His eyes</i>. The anthropomorphic language draws attention to God&#8217;s awareness of and interest in the situation on earth. Though the enemies are hidden by the darkness (v. 2), the Lord sees all.</p>
<A NAME="1116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=373><b>tn</b> The two Hebrew imperfect verbal forms in this verse describe the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s characteristic activity.</p>
<A NAME="1117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=374><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;eyelids.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=375><b>tn</b> For other uses of the verb in this sense, see Job 7:18; Pss 7:9; 26:2; 139:23.</p>
<A NAME="1119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=376><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;test the sons of men.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=377><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;examines,&#8221; the same verb used in v. 4b. But here it is used in a metonymic sense of &#8220;examine and approve&#8221; (see Jer 20:12).</p>
<A NAME="1121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=378><b>tn</b> The singular form is used here in a collective or representative sense. Note the plural form &#8220;pure (of heart)&#8221; in v. 2.</p>
<A NAME="1122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=379><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his [very] being.&#8221; A <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>, &#8220;being, soul&#8221;) is also attributed to the Lord in Isa 1:14, where a suffixed form of the noun appears as the subject of the verb &#8220;hate.&#8221; Both there and here the term is used of the seat of one&#8217;s emotions and passions.</p>
<A NAME="1123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=380><b>sn</b> <i>He hates the wicked</i>. The Lord &#8220;hates&#8221; the wicked in the sense that he despises their wicked character and deeds, and actively opposes and judges them for their wickedness. See Ps 5:5.</p>
<A NAME="1124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=381><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the wicked [one] and the lover of violence.&#8221; The singular form is used here in a collective or representative sense. Note the plural form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rÿsha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>, &#8220;wicked [ones]&#8221;) in vv. 2 and 6.</p>
<A NAME="1125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=382><b>tn</b> The verb form is a jussive, indicating that the statement is imprecatory (&#8220;May the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> rain down&#8221;), not indicative (&#8220;The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> rains down&#8221;; see also Job 20:23). The psalmist appeals to God to destroy the wicked, rather than simply stating his confidence that God will do so. In this way the psalmist seeks to activate divine judgment by appealing to God&#8217;s just character. For an example of the power of such a curse, see Judg 9:7-57.</p>
<A NAME="1126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=383><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;traps, fire, and brimstone,&#8221; but the image of God raining traps, or snares, down from the sky is bizarre and does not fit the fire and storm imagery of this verse. The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pakhim</font>, &#8220;traps, snares&#8221;) should be emended to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1502;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pakhamey</font>, &#8220;coals of [fire]&#8221;). The rare noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pekham</font>, &#8220;coal&#8221;) occurs in Prov 26:21 and Isa 44:12; 54:16.</p>
<A NAME="1127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=384><b>sn</b> The image of God &#8220;raining down&#8221; <i>brimstone</i> on the objects of his judgment also appears in Gen 19:24 and Ezek 38:22.</p>
<A NAME="1128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=385><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[may] a wind of rage [be] the portion of their cup.&#8221; The precise meaning of the rare noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1508;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zil</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">afot</font>) is uncertain. It may mean &#8220;raging heat&#8221; (BDB 273 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1508;&#1464;&#1492;</font>) or simply &#8220;rage&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 272 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1508;&#1464;&#1492;</font>). If one understands the former sense, then one might translate &#8220;hot wind&#8221; (cf. NEB, NRSV). The present translation assumes the latter nuance, &#8220;a wind of rage&#8221; (the genitive is attributive) referring to a &#8220;whirlwind&#8221; symbolic of destructive judgment. In this mixed metaphor, judgment is also compared to an allotted portion of a beverage poured into one&#8217;s drinking cup (see Hab 2:15-16).</p>
<A NAME="1129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=386><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;for.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1130"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=387><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;righteous.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=388><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he loves righteous deeds.&#8221; The &#8220;righteous deeds&#8221; are probably those done by godly people (see v. 5). The Lord &#8220;loves&#8221; such deeds in the sense that he rewards them. Another option is to take <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1511;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsÿdaqot</font>) as referring to God&#8217;s acts of justice (see Ps 103:6). In this case one could translate, &#8220;he loves to do just deeds.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=389><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the upright will see his face.&#8221; The singular subject (&#8220;upright&#8221;) does not agree with the plural verb. However, collective singular nouns can be construed with a plural predicate (see GKC 462 §145.<i>b</i>). Another possibility is that the plural verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1462;&#1495;&#1457;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yekhezu</font>) is a corruption of an original singular form. To &#8220;see&#8221; God&#8217;s &#8220;face&#8221; means to have access to his presence and to experience his favor (see Ps 17:15 and Job 33:26 [where <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>), not <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1494;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khazah</font>), is used]). On the form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1464;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">fanemo</font>, &#8220;his face&#8221;) see GKC 300-301 §103.<i>b</i>, n. 3.</p>
