<A NAME="9010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=3279><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you bring them to an end [with] sleep.&#8221; The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zaram</font>) has traditionally been taken to mean &#8220;flood&#8221; or &#8220;overwhelm&#8221; (note the Polel form of a root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1512;&#1501;</font> in Ps 77:17, where the verb is used of the clouds pouring down rain). However, the verb form here is Qal, not Polel, and is better understood as a homonym meaning &#8220;to make an end [of life].&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shenah</font>, &#8220;sleep&#8221;) can be taken as an adverbial accusative; it is a euphemism here for death (see Ps 76:5-6).</p>
