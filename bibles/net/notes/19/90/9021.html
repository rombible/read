<A NAME="9021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=3290><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and their pride [is] destruction and wickedness.&#8221; The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1465;&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rohav</font>) occurs only here. BDB 923 s.v. assigns the meaning &#8220;pride,&#8221; deriving the noun from the verbal root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1492;&#1489;</font> (&#8220;to act stormily [boisterously, arrogantly]&#8221;). Here the &#8220;pride&#8221; of one&#8217;s days (see v. 9) probably refers to one&#8217;s most productive years in the prime of life. The words translated &#8220;destruction and wickedness&#8221; are also paired in Ps 10:7. They also appear in proximity in Pss 7:14 and 55:10. The oppressive and abusive actions of evil men are probably in view (see Job 4:8; 5:6; 15:35; Isa 10:1; 59:4).</p>
