<A NAME="904"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=3273><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and you gave birth to the earth and world.&#8221; The Polel verbal form in the Hebrew text pictures God giving birth to the world. The LXX and some other ancient textual witnesses assume a <i>polal</i> (passive) verbal form here. In this case the earth becomes the subject of the verb and the verb is understood as third feminine singular rather than second masculine singular.</p>
