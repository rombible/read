<A NAME="1337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=4430><b>sn</b> The <i>hills of Zion</i> are those surrounding Zion (see Pss 87:1; 125:2). The psalmist does not intend to suggest that the dew from Mt. Hermon in the distant north actually flows down upon Zion. His point is that the same kind of heavy dew that replenishes Hermon may also be seen on Zion&#8217;s hills. See A. Cohen, <i>Psalms</i> (SoBB), 439. &#8220;Dew&#8221; here symbolizes divine blessing, as the next line suggests.</p>
