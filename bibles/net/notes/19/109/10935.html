<A NAME="10935"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=3842><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and it came like water into his inner being, and like oil into his bones.&#8221; This may refer to this individual&#8217;s appetite for cursing. For him cursing was as refreshing as drinking water or massaging oneself with oil. Another option is that the destructive effects of a curse are in view. In this case a destructive curse invades his very being, like water or oil. Some who interpret the verse this way prefer to repoint the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) on &#8220;it came&#8221; to a conjunctive <i>vav</i> and interpret the prefixed verb as a jussive, &#8220;may it come!&#8221;</p>
