<A NAME="10952"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=3859><b>tn</b> The verbal sequence is perfect + prefixed form with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive. Since the psalmist seems to be anticipating the demise of his enemies, he may be using these forms rhetorically to describe the enemies&#8217; defeat as if it were already accomplished. Some emend the text to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; &#1497;&#1461;&#1489;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qamu yevoshu</font>, &#8220;may those who attack me be humiliated&#8221;). See L. C. Allen, <i>Psalms 101-150 </i>(WBC), 75.</p>
