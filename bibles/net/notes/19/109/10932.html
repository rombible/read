<A NAME="10932"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=3839><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he loved a curse and it came [upon] him.&#8221; A reference to the evil man experiencing a curse seems premature here, for the psalmist is asking God to bring judgment on his enemies. For this reason some (cf. NIV, NRSV) prefer to repoint the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) on &#8220;it came&#8221; as conjunctive and translate the verb as a jussive of prayer (&#8220;may it come upon him!&#8221;). The prefixed form with <i>vav</i> consecutive in the next line is emended in the same way and translated, &#8220;may it be far from him.&#8221; However, the psalmist may be indicating that the evil man&#8217;s lifestyle has already begun to yield its destructive fruit.</p>
