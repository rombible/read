<A NAME="10931"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=3838><b>sn</b> A <i>curse</i> in OT times consists of a formal appeal to God to bring judgment down upon another. Curses were sometimes justified (such as the one spoken by the psalmist here in vv. 6-19), but when they were not, the one pronouncing the curse was in danger of bringing the anticipated judgment down upon himself.</p>
