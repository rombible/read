<A NAME="5630"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2071><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in God I praise a word.&#8221; The syntax of the Hebrew text is difficult. The statement is similar to that of v. 4, except that the third person pronominal suffix is omitted here, where the text has simply &#8220;a word&#8221; instead of &#8220;his word.&#8221; (1) One could translate, &#8220;in God I will boast [with] a word.&#8221; In this case, the &#8220;word&#8221; refers to a song of praise. (2) If one assumes that God&#8217;s word is in view, as in v. 4, then one option is to translate, &#8220;in God I boast, [in] his word.&#8221; In this case the prepositional phrase &#8220;in God&#8221; goes with the following verb &#8220;I boast&#8221; (see Ps 44:8) and &#8220;[his] word&#8221; is appositional to &#8220;in God&#8221; and more specifically identifies the basis for the psalmist&#8217;s confidence. God&#8217;s &#8220;word&#8221; is here understood as an assuring promise of protection. (3) The present translation reflects another option: In this case &#8220;I praise [his] word&#8221; is a parenthetical statement, with &#8220;[his] word&#8221; being the object of the verb. The sentence begun with the prepositional phrase &#8220;in God&#8221; is then completed in v. 11, with the prepositional phrase being repeated after the parenthesis.</p>
