<A NAME="5610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2051><b>tn</b> Some take the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">marom</font>, &#8220;on high; above&#8221;) as an adverb modifying the preceding participle and translate, &#8220;proudly&#8221; (cf. NASB; NIV &#8220;in their pride&#8221;). The present translation assumes the term is a divine title here. The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is pictured as enthroned &#8220;on high&#8221; in Ps 92:8. (Note the substantival use of the term in Isa 24:4 and see C. A. Briggs and E. G. Briggs (<i>Psalms </i>[ICC], 2:34), who prefer to place the term at the beginning of the next verse.)</p>
