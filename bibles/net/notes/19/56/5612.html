<A NAME="5612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2053><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in God I boast, his word.&#8221; The syntax in the Hebrew text is difficult. (1) The line could be translated, &#8220;in God I boast, [in] his word.&#8221; Such a translation assumes that the prepositional phrase &#8220;in God&#8221; goes with the following verb &#8220;I boast&#8221; (see Ps 44:8) and that &#8220;his word&#8221; is appositional to &#8220;in God&#8221; and more specifically identifies the basis for the psalmist&#8217;s confidence. God&#8217;s &#8220;word&#8221; is here understood as an assuring promise of protection. Another option (2) is to translate, &#8220;in God I will boast [with] a word.&#8221; In this case, the &#8220;word&#8221; is a song of praise. (In this view the pronominal suffix &#8220;his&#8221; must be omitted as in v. 10.) The present translation reflects yet another option (3): In this case &#8220;I praise his word&#8221; is a parenthetical statement, with &#8220;his word&#8221; being the object of the verb. The sentence begun with the prepositional phrase &#8220;in God&#8221; is then completed in the next line, with the prepositional phrase being repeated after the parenthesis.</p>
