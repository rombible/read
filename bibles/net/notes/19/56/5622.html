<A NAME="5622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2063><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;because of wickedness, deliverance to them.&#8221; As it stands, the MT makes no sense. The negative particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ayin</font>, &#8220;there is not,&#8221; which is due to dittography of the immediately preceding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1493;&#1462;&#1503;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">aven</font>, &#8220;wickedness&#8221;), should probably be added before &#8220;deliverance&#8221; (see <i>BHS</i>, note a). The presence of an imperative in the next line (note &#8220;bring down&#8221;) suggests that this line should be translated as a prayer as well, &#8220;may there not be deliverance to them.&#8221;</p>
