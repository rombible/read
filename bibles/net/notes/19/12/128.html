<A NAME="128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=397><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[with] a lip of smoothness, with a heart and a heart they speak.&#8221; Speaking a &#8220;smooth&#8221; word refers to deceptive flattery (cf. Ps 5:9; 55:21; Prov 2:16; 5:3; 7:5, 21; 26:28; 28:23; Isa 30:10). &#8220;Heart&#8221; here refers to their mind, from which their motives and intentions originate. The repetition of the noun indicates diversity (see GKC 396 §123.<i>f</i>, <i>IBHS</i> 116 §7.2.3c, and Deut 25:13, where the phrase &#8220;weight and a weight&#8221; refers to two different measuring weights). These people have two different types of &#8220;hearts.&#8221; Their flattering words seem to express kind motives and intentions, but this outward display does not really reflect their true motives. Their real &#8220;heart&#8221; is filled with evil thoughts and destructive intentions. The &#8220;heart&#8221; that is seemingly displayed through their words is far different from the real &#8220;heart&#8221; they keep disguised. (For the idea see Ps 28:3.) In 1 Chr 12:33 the phrase &#8220;without a heart and a heart&#8221; means &#8220;undivided loyalty.&#8221;</p>
