<A NAME="1223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=412><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the wicked walk all around.&#8221; One could translate v. 8a as an independent clause, in which case it would be a concluding observation in proverbial style. The present translation assumes that v. 8a is a subordinate explanatory clause, or perhaps a subordinate temporal clause (&#8220;while the wicked walk all around&#8221;). The adverb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">saviv</font>, &#8220;around&#8221;), in combination with the Hitpael form of the verb &#8220;walk&#8221; (which indicates repeated action), pictures the wicked as ubiquitous. They have seemingly overrun society.</p>
