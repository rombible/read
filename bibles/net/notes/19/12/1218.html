<A NAME="1218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=407><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will place in deliverance, he pants for it.&#8221; The final two words in Hebrew (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1508;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1463; &#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yafiakh lo</font>) comprise an asyndetic relative clause, &#8220;the one who pants for it.&#8221; &#8220;The one who pants&#8221; is the object of the verb &#8220;place&#8221; and the antecedent of the pronominal suffix (in the phrase &#8220;for it&#8221;) is &#8220;deliverance.&#8221; Another option is to translate, &#8220;I will place in deliverance the witness for him,&#8221; repointing <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1508;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (a Hiphil imperfect from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font>, <font face="Scholar">puakh</font>, &#8220;pant&#8221;) as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1508;&#1461;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yafeakh</font>), a noun meaning &#8220;witness.&#8221; In this case the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> would be promising protection to those who have the courage to support the oppressed in the court of law. However, the first part of the verse focuses on the oppressed, not their advocates.</p>
