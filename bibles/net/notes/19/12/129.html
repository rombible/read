<A NAME="129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=398><b>tn</b> The verb form is a jussive, indicating that the statement is imprecatory (&#8220;May the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> cut off&#8221;), not indicative (&#8220;The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will cut off&#8221;; see also Ps 109:15 and Mal 2:12). The psalmist appeals to God to destroy the wicked, rather than simply stating his confidence that he will. In this way he seeks to activate divine judgment by appealing to God&#8217;s just character. For an example of the power of such a curse, see Judg 9:7-57.</p>
