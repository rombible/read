<A NAME="1222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=411><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you will protect him from this generation permanently.&#8221; The third masculine singular suffix on the verb &#8220;protect&#8221; is probably used in a distributive sense, referring to each one within the group mentioned previously (the oppressed/needy, referred to as &#8220;them&#8221; in the preceding line). On this grammatical point see GKC 396 §123.<i>f</i> (where the present text is not cited). (Some Hebrew <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> and ancient textual witnesses read &#8220;us,&#8221; both here and in the preceding line.) The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dor</font>, &#8220;generation&#8221;) refers here to the psalmist&#8217;s contemporaries, who were characterized by deceit and arrogance (see vv. 1-2). See BDB 189-90 s.v. for other examples where &#8220;generation&#8221; refers to a class of people.</p>
