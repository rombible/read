<A NAME="739"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2643><b>tc</b> Or &#8220;fat.&#8221; The MT of v. 4 reads as follows: &#8220;for there are no pains at their death, and fat [is] their body.&#8221; Since a reference to the death of the wicked seems incongruous in the immediate context (note v. 5) and premature in the argument of the psalm (see vv. 18-20, 27), some prefer to emend the text by redividing it. The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿmotam</font>,&#8220;at their death&#8221;) is changed to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465; &#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lamo tam</font>, &#8220;[there are no pains] to them, strong [and fat are their bodies]&#8221;). The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tam</font>, &#8220;complete; sound&#8221;) is used of physical beauty in Song 5:2; 6:9. This emendation is the basis for the present translation. However, in defense of the MT (the traditional Hebrew text), one may point to an Aramaic inscription from Nerab which views a painful death as a curse and a nonpainful death in one&#8217;s old age as a sign of divine favor. See <i>ANET</i> 661.</p>
