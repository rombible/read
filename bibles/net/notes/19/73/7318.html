<A NAME="7318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2652><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they set in heaven their mouth, and their tongue walks through the earth.&#8221; The meaning of the text is uncertain. Perhaps the idea is that they lay claim to heaven (i.e., speak as if they were ruling in heaven) and move through the earth declaring their superiority and exerting their influence. Some take the preposition -<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet</font>) the first line as adversative and translate, &#8220;they set their mouth against heaven,&#8221; that is, they defy God.</p>
