<A NAME="7317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2651><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;oppression from an elevated place they speak.&#8221; The traditional accentuation of the MT places &#8220;oppression&#8221; with the preceding line. In this case, one might translate, &#8220;they mock and speak with evil [of] oppression, from an elevated place [i.e., &#8220;proudly&#8221;] they speak.&#8221; By placing &#8220;oppression&#8221; with what follows, one achieves better poetic balance in the parallelism.</p>
