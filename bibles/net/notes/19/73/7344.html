<A NAME="7344"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=2678><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and afterward [to] glory you will take me.&#8221; Some interpreters view this as the psalmist&#8217;s confidence in an afterlife in God&#8217;s presence and understand <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">cavod</font>) as a metonymic reference to God&#8217;s presence in heaven. But this seems unlikely in the present context. The psalmist anticipates a time of vindication, when the wicked are destroyed and he is honored by God for his godly life style. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">laqakh</font>, &#8220;take&#8221;) here carries the nuance &#8220;lead, guide, conduct,&#8221; as in Num 23:14, 27-28; Josh 24:3 and Prov 24:11.</p>
