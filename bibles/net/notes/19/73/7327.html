<A NAME="7327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2661><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;look, the generation of your sons I would have betrayed.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;generation of your [i.e., God&#8217;s] sons&#8221; occurs only here in the OT. Some equate the phrase with &#8220;generation of the godly&#8221; (Ps 14:5), &#8220;generation of the ones seeking him&#8221; (Ps 24:6), and &#8220;generation of the upright&#8221; (Ps 112:2). In Deut 14:1 the Israelites are referred to as God&#8217;s &#8220;sons.&#8221; Perhaps the psalmist refers here to those who are &#8220;Israelites&#8221; in the true sense because of their loyalty to God (note the juxtaposition of &#8220;Israel&#8221; with &#8220;the pure in heart&#8221; in v. 1).</p>
