<A NAME="233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=866><b>tn</b> The imperfect verbal form in v. 5a carries on the generalizing mood of vv. 1-4. However, in v. 5b the psalmist switches to a perfect (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1463;&#1504;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;</font>, <font face="Scholar">dishanta</font>), which may have a generalizing force as well.

The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dashan</font>; the Piel is factitive) is often translated &#8220;anoint,&#8221; but this is misleading, for it might suggest a symbolic act of initiation into royal status. One would expect the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mashan</font>) in this case; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1503;</font> here describes an act of hospitality extended to guests and carries the nuance &#8220;refresh.&#8221; In Prov 15:30 it stands parallel to &#8220;make happy&#8221; and refers to the effect that good news has on the inner being of its recipient.</p>
