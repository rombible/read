<A NAME="239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=872><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the house of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.&#8221; The phrase may be purely metaphorical here, referring to the royal palace where the royal host of v. 5 holds his banquet and lives. If one takes the phrase more literally, it would refer to the earthly tabernacle (if one accepts Davidic authorship) or the later temple (see Judg 19:18; 1 Sam 1:7, 24; 2 Sam 12:20; 1 Kgs 7:12, 40, 45, 51).</p>
