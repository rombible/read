<A NAME="2310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=873><b>tn</b> The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456; &#1497;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">orekh yamim</font>, &#8220;length of days&#8221;) is traditionally translated &#8220;forever.&#8221; However, this phrase, when used elsewhere of people, usually refers to a lengthy period of time, such as one&#8217;s lifetime, and does not mean &#8220;forever&#8221; in the sense of eternity. (Cf. Deut 30:20; Job 12:12; Ps 91:16; Prov 3:2, 16; Lam 5:20.) Furthermore, the parallel phrase &#8220;all the days of my life&#8221; suggests this more limited meaning. Psalm 21:4, where the phrase is followed by &#8220;forever and ever,&#8221; may be an exception, though the juxtaposition of the phrases may be an example of intensification, where the second phrase goes beyond the limits of the first, rather than synonymity. Even if one takes both expressions as referring to eternal life, the language is part of the king&#8217;s hyperbolic description of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s blessings and should not be taken literally.</p>
