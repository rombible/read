<A NAME="236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=869><b>tn</b> The use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">radaf</font>, &#8220;pursue, chase&#8221;) with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489; &#1493;&#1464;&#1495;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tov vakhesed</font>, &#8220;goodness and faithfulness&#8221;) as subject is ironic. This is the only place in the entire OT where either of these nouns appears as the subject of this verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">radaf</font>, &#8220;pursue&#8221;). This verb is often used to describe the hostile actions of enemies. One might expect the psalmist&#8217;s enemies (see v. 5) to chase him, but ironically God&#8217;s &#8220;goodness and faithfulness&#8221; (which are personified and stand by metonymy for God himself) pursue him instead. The word &#8220;pursue&#8221; is used outside of its normal context in an ironic manner and creates a unique, but pleasant word picture of God&#8217;s favor (or a kind God) &#8220;chasing down&#8221; the one whom he loves.</p>
