The background for the imagery is probably the royal banquet. Ancient Near Eastern texts describe such banquets in similar terms to those employed by the psalmist. (See M. L. Barre and J. S. Kselman, &#8220;New Exodus, Covenant, and Restoration in Psalm 23,&#8221; <i>The Word of the Lord Shall Go Forth</i>, 97-127.) The reality behind the imagery is the Lord&#8217;s favor. Through his blessings and protection he demonstrates to everyone, including dangerous enemies, that the psalmist has a special relationship with him.</p>
