<A NAME="235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=868><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khesed</font>; v. 6) has been the subject of several monographs. G. R. Clark concludes that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1491;</font> &#8220;is not merely an attitude or an emotion; it is an emotion that leads to an activity beneficial to the recipient.&#8221; He explains that an act of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1491;</font> is &#8220;a beneficent action performed, in the context of a deep and enduring commitment between two persons or parties, by one who is able to render assistance to the needy party who in the circumstances is unable to help him- or herself.&#8221; (See G. R. Clark, <i>The Word </i>Hesed<i> in the Hebrew Bible</i> [JSOTSup], 267.) <i>HALOT</i> 336-37 s.v. defines the word as &#8220;loyalty,&#8221; or &#8220;faithfulness.&#8221; Other appropriate meanings might be &#8220;commitment&#8221; and &#8220;devotion.&#8221;</p>
