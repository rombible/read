<A NAME="411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1482><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 41</i>. The psalmist is confident (vv. 11-12) that the Lord has heard his request to be healed (vv. 4-10), and he anticipates the joy he will experience when the Lord intervenes (vv. 1-3). One must assume that the psalmist is responding to a divine oracle of assurance (see P. C. Craigie, <i>Psalms 1-50</i> [WBC], 319-20). The final verse is a fitting conclusion to this psalm, but it is also serves as a fitting conclusion to the first &#8220;book&#8221; (or major editorial division) of the Psalter. Similar statements appear at or near the end of each of the second, third, and fourth &#8220;books&#8221; of the Psalter (see Pss 72:19, 89:52, and 106:48 respectively).</p>
<A NAME="412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1483><b>tn</b> The Hebrew noun is an abstract plural. The word often refers metonymically to the happiness that God-given security and prosperity produce (see Pss 1:1, 3; 2:12; 34:9; 65:4; 84:12; 89:15; 106:3; 112:1; 127:5; 128:1; 144:15).</p>
<A NAME="413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1484><b>sn</b> <i>One who treats the poor properly</i>. The psalmist is characterizing himself as such an individual and supplying a reason why God has responded favorably to his prayer. The Lord&#8217;s attitude toward the merciful mirrors their treatment of the poor.</p>
<A NAME="414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1485><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the day of trouble&#8221; (see Ps 27:5).</p>
<A NAME="415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1486><b>tn</b> That is, the one who has been kind to the poor. The prefixed verbal form could be taken as jussive of prayer (&#8220;may the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> deliver,&#8221; see v. 2), but the preceding parallel line is a declaration of fact, not a prayer per se. The imperfect can be taken here as future (&#8220;will deliver,&#8221; cf. NEB, NASB) or as generalizing (&#8220;delivers,&#8221; cf. NIV, NRSV). The parallel line, which has a generalizing tone, favors the latter. At the same time, though the psalmist uses a generalizing style here, he clearly has himself primarily in view.</p>
<A NAME="416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1487><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal forms are taken as jussives in the translation because the jussive is clearly used in the final line of the verse, suggesting that this is a prayer. The psalmist stops to pronounce a prayer of blessing on the godly individual envisioned in v. 1. Of course, he actually has himself primarily in view. He mixes confidence (vv. 1, 3) with petition (v. 2) because he stands in the interval between the word of assurance and the actual intervention by God.</p>
<A NAME="417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1488><b>tc</b> The translation follows the consonantal Hebrew text (<i>Kethib</i>), which has a Pual (passive) prefixed form, regarded here as a jussive. The Pual of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ashar</font>) also appears in Prov 3:18. The marginal reading (<i>Qere</i>) assumes a <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive and Pual perfect. Some, with the support of the LXX, change the verb to a Piel (active) form with an objective pronominal suffix, &#8220;and may he bless him,&#8221; or &#8220;and he will bless him&#8221; (cf. NIV).</p>
<A NAME="418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1489><b>tn</b> The negative particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) before the prefixed verbal form indicates the verb is a jussive and the statement a prayer. Those who want to take v. 2 as a statement of confidence suggest emending the negative particle to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;), which is used with the imperfect. See the earlier note on the verbal forms in line one of this verse. According to GKC 322 §109.<i>e</i>, this is a case where the jussive is used rhetorically to &#8220;express that something cannot or should not happen.&#8221; In this case one might translate, &#8220;you will not turn him over to his enemies,&#8221; and take the preceding verbal forms as indicative in mood.</p>
<A NAME="419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1490><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;do not give him over to the desire of his enemies&#8221; (see Ps 27:12).</p>
<A NAME="4110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1491><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal form could be taken as jussive, continuing the prayer of v. 2, but the parallel line in v. 3b employs the perfect, suggesting that the psalmist is again speaking in the indicative mood (see v. 1b). The imperfect can be understood as future or as generalizing (see v. 1).</p>
<A NAME="4111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1492><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all his bed you turn in his illness.&#8221; The perfect is used here in a generalizing sense (see v. 1) or in a rhetorical manner to emphasize that the healing is as good as done.</p>
<A NAME="4112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1493><b>sn</b> In vv. 4-10 the psalmist recites the prayer of petition and lament he offered to the Lord.</p>
<A NAME="4113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1494><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my enemies speak evil concerning me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1495><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and his name perish.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1496><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to see.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1497><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he speaks deceitfully.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1498><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his heart gathers sin to itself.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1499><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he goes outside and speaks.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1500><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;together against me they whisper, all those who hate me.&#8221; The Hitpael of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lakhash</font>) refers here to whispering to one another (see 2 Sam 12:19).</p>
<A NAME="4120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1501><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;they say&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text, but are supplied in the translation to make it clear that v. 8 contains a quotation of what the psalmist&#8217;s enemies say about him (see v. 7a).</p>
<A NAME="4121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1502><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;thing of worthlessness.&#8221; In Ps 101:3 the phrase refers to evil deeds in general, but here it appears to refer more specifically to the illness that plagues the psalmist.</p>
<A NAME="4122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1503><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;is poured out on him.&#8221; The passive participle of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatsaq</font>) is used.</p>
<A NAME="4123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1504><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he who lies down will not again arise.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1505><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;man of my peace.&#8221; The phrase here refers to one&#8217;s trusted friend (see Jer 38:22; Obad 7).</p>
<A NAME="4125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1506><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;has made a heel great against me.&#8221; The precise meaning of this phrase, which appears only here, is uncertain.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The language of this verse is applied to Judas Iscariot in John 13:18.</p>
<A NAME="4126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1507><b>tn</b> The cohortative with prefixed <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) here indicates purpose or result (&#8220;Then I will repay them&#8221;) after the preceding imperatives.</p>
<A NAME="4127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1508><b>sn</b> <i>By this</i>. Having recalled his former lament and petition, the psalmist returns to the confident mood of vv. 1-3. The basis for his confidence may be a divine oracle of deliverance, assuring him that God would intervene and vindicate him. The demonstrative pronoun &#8220;this&#8221; may refer to such an oracle, which is assumed here, though its contents are not included. See P. C. Craigie, <i>Psalms 1-50</i> (WBC), 319, 321.</p>
<A NAME="4128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1509><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;will.&#8221; One may translate the imperfect verbal form as descriptive (present, cf. NIV) or as anticipatory (future, cf. NEB).</p>
<A NAME="4129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1510><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;shout.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4130"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1511><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;have upheld.&#8221; The perfect verbal form can be taken as generalizing/descriptive (present) or as a present perfect.</p>
<A NAME="4131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1512><b>sn</b> <i>Because of my integrity</i>. See Pss 7:8; 25:21; 26:1, 11.</p>
<A NAME="4132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1513><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal form with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive has the same aspectual function as the preceding perfect. It is either generalizing/descriptive (present) or has a present perfect nuance (&#8220;you have allowed&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="4133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1514><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and you cause me to stand before you permanently.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1515><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[be] blessed.&#8221; See Pss 18:46; 28:6; 31:21.</p>
<A NAME="4135"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1516><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from everlasting to everlasting.&#8221; See 1 Chr 16:36; Neh 9:5; Pss 90:2; 106:48.</p>
<A NAME="4136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1517><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;surely and surely&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1461;&#1503; &#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1461;&#1503;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amen vÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amen</font>], i.e., &#8220;amen and amen&#8221;). This is probably a congregational response to the immediately preceding statement about the propriety of praising God.</p>
