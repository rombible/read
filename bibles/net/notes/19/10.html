<A NAME="101"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=304><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 10</i>. Many Hebrew <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> and the ancient Greek version (LXX) combine Psalms 9 and 10 into a single psalm. Taken in isolation, Psalm 10 is a petition for help in which the psalmist urges the Lord to deliver him from his dangerous enemies, whom he describes in vivid and terrifying detail. The psalmist concludes with confidence; he is certain that God&#8217;s justice will prevail.</p>
<A NAME="102"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=305><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you hide for times in trouble.&#8221; The interrogative &#8220;why&#8221; is understood by ellipsis; note the preceding line. The Hiphil verbal form &#8220;hide&#8221; has no expressed object. Some supply &#8220;your eyes&#8221; by ellipsis (see BDB 761 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1501;</font> Hiph and <i>HALOT</i> 835 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1500;&#1501;</font> hif) or emend the form to a Niphal (&#8220;you hide yourself,&#8221; see <i>BHS</i>, note c; cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="103"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=306><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;because of the pride of [the] wicked he burns [i.e. hotly pursues] [the] oppressed.&#8221; The singular forms <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rasha</font>&#8217;, &#8220;wicked&#8221;) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aniy</font>, &#8220;oppressed&#8221;) are collective and representative, as indicated in the next line, which uses plural verb forms to describe the actions of both.</p>
<A NAME="104"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=307><b>tn</b> The two imperfect verbal forms in v. 2 describe either what typically happens (from the psalmist&#8217;s perspective) or what the psalmist was experiencing at the time he offered this prayer.</p>
<A NAME="105"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=308><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they are trapped in the schemes which they have thought up.&#8221; The referents of the two pronominal suffixes on the verbs have been specified in the translation for clarity. The referent of the first suffix (&#8220;they&#8221;) is taken as the oppressed, while the referent of the second (&#8220;they&#8221;) is taken to be the wicked (cf. NIV, which renders &#8220;wicked&#8221; in the previous line as a collective singular). Others take the referent of both occurrences of &#8220;they&#8221; in the line to be the wicked (cf. NRSV, &#8220;let them be caught in the schemes they have devised&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="106"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=309><b>tn</b> The translation assumes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) is asseverative: &#8220;indeed, certainly.&#8221; Another option is to translate &#8220;for,&#8221; understanding v. 3 as giving the reason why the wicked so arrogantly seek to destroy the helpless (so NASB, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="107"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=310><b>tn</b> The representative or typical evildoer is described in vv. 3-11, 13, 15. Since the singular form predominates in these verses, it has been retained in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="108"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=311><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the wicked [one] boasts on account of the desire of his appetite.&#8221; The translation assumes that the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) introduces the reason why the wicked boasts (cf. this use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">halal</font>) in Ps 119:164 and Ezra 3:11). In this case, the &#8220;desire of his appetite&#8221; refers by metonymy to the object desired and acquired.</p>
<A NAME="109"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=312><b>tn</b> The translation assumes the active participle is substantival, referring to the wicked man mentioned in the preceding line. The substantival participle is then understood as the subject of the following verbs. For other examples of the participle of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">batsar</font>) used of those who desire and/or acquire wealth through dishonest and/or violent means, see Prov 1:19; 15:27; Jer 6:13; 8:10; Hab 2:9.</p>
<A NAME="1010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=313><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">barakh</font>) normally means &#8220;to bless,&#8221; but in a few cases it exhibits the polarized meaning &#8220;to curse&#8221; (1 Kgs 21:10, 13; Job 1:5-11; 2:5-9). (Some regard this use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> as a mere euphemism.) The verb refers to the act of pronouncing or calling down a formal curse upon the object of one&#8217;s anger.</p>
<A NAME="1011"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=314><b>tn</b> The conjunction &#8220;and&#8221; is supplied in the translation; it does not appear in the Hebrew text.</p>
<A NAME="1012"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=315><b>tn</b> Another option is to translate, &#8220;he blesses one who robs others, [but] he curses the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.&#8221; In this case the subject of the verbs is &#8220;the wicked man&#8221; mentioned in the previous line, and &#8220;the one who robs others&#8221; is the object of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">barakh</font>), which is understood in its usual sense of &#8220;bless.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1013"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=316><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the wicked [one], according to the height of his nose, he does not seek, there is no God, all his thoughts.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;height of his nose&#8221; probably refers to an arrogant or snooty attitude; it likely pictures one with his nose turned upward toward the sky in pride. One could take the &#8220;wicked&#8221; as the subject of the negated verb &#8220;seek,&#8221; in which case the point is that the wicked do not &#8220;seek&#8221; God. The translation assumes that this statement, along with &#8220;there is no God,&#8221; is what the wicked man thinks to himself. In this case God is the subject of the verb &#8220;seek,&#8221; and the point is that God will not hold the wicked man accountable for his actions. Verse 13 strongly favors this interpretation. The statement &#8220;there is no God&#8221; is not a philosophical assertion that God does not exist, but rather a confident affirmation that he is unconcerned about how men live morally and ethically (see v. 11).</p>
<A NAME="1014"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=317><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they are firm, his ways, at every time.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khayil</font>, &#8220;be firm, be strong&#8221;) occurs only here and in Job 20:21, where it has the sense &#8220;endure.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1015"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=318><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[on a] height, your judgments from before him.&#8221; If the MT is retained, then the idea may be that God&#8217;s &#8220;judgments&#8221; are high above (i.e., not recognized) by the wicked man. However, the syntax is awkward. The translation assumes an emendation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">marom</font>, &#8220;height&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">saru</font>, &#8220;[your judgments] are turned aside&#8221;), the final <i>mem</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1501;</font>) being dittographic (note the initial <i>mem</i> on the immediately following word [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1496;&#1462;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mishÿfatekha</font>, &#8220;your judgments&#8221;). &#8220;Judgments&#8221; probably refers here to God&#8217;s laws or commands, rather than his judicial decisions or acts of judgment.</p>
<A NAME="1016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=319><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all his enemies, he snorts against them.&#8221; This may picture the wicked man defiantly challenging his enemies because he is confident of success. Another option is to take <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1508;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yafiakh</font>) from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yafakh</font>, &#8220;to testify&#8221;) and translate &#8220;he testifies against all his enemies,&#8221; implying that he gets the upper hand over them in legal battles. The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1508;&#1461;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yafeakh</font>, &#8220;witness&#8221;) is attested in biblical Hebrew (see Prov 6:19; 12:17; 14:5, 25; 19:5, 9, and Hab 2:3). The verb, however, is not clearly attested.</p>
<A NAME="1017"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=320><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he says in his heart/mind.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1018"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=321><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for a generation and a generation.&#8221; The traditional accentuation of the MT understands these words with the following line.</p>
<A NAME="1019"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=322><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;who, not in calamity.&#8221; If <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asher</font>) is taken as a relative pronoun here, then one could translate, &#8220;[I] who [am] not in calamity.&#8221; Some emend <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;</font> to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">osher</font>, &#8220;happiness&#8221;; see <i>HALOT</i> 99 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;</font>); one might then translate, &#8220;[I live in] happiness, not in calamity.&#8221; The present translation assumes that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;</font> functions here as a causal conjunction, &#8220;because, for.&#8221; For this use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;</font>, see BDB 83 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;</font> 8.c (where the present text is not cited).</p>

<A NAME="1028"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=331><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he crushes, he is bowed down, and he falls into his strong [ones], [the] unfortunate [ones].&#8221; This verse presents several lexical and syntactical difficulties. The first word (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yidekeh</font>) is an otherwise unattested Qal form of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dakhah</font>, &#8220;crush&#8221;). (The <i>Qere</i> [marginal] form is imperfect; the consonantal text [<i>Kethib</i>] has the perfect with a prefixed conjunction <i>vav</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>].) If the wicked man&#8217;s victim is the subject, which seems to be the case (note the two verbs which follow), then the form should be emended to a Niphal (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1499;&#1462;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yiddakheh</font>). The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">atsumayv</font>, &#8220;into his strong [ones]&#8221;), poses interpretive problems. The preposition -<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet</font>) follows the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nafal</font>, &#8220;fall&#8221;), so it may very well carry the nuance &#8220;into&#8221; here, with &#8220;his strong [ones]&#8221; then referring to something into which the oppressed individual falls. Since a net is mentioned in the preceding verse as the instrument used to entrap the victim, it is possible that &#8220;strong [ones]&#8221; here refers metonymically to the wicked man&#8217;s nets or traps. Ps 35:8 refers to a man falling into a net (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">reshet</font>), as does Ps 141:10 (where the plural of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;</font> [<font face="Scholar">mikhmar</font>, &#8220;net&#8221;] is used). A hunter&#8217;s net (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1514;</font>), is associated with snares (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;</font> [<font face="Scholar">pakh</font>], <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1465;&#1511;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, [<font face="Scholar">moqÿshim</font>]) and ropes (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1458;&#1489;&#1464;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khavalim</font>) in Ps 140:5. The final word in the verse (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khelka</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>, &#8220;unfortunate [ones]&#8221;) may be an alternate form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1461;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khelkhakh</font>, &#8220;unfortunate [one]&#8221;; see vv. 8, 14). The <i>Qere</i> (marginal reading) divides the form into two words, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1461;&#1497;&#1500; &#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khel ka</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>, &#8220;army/host of disheartened [ones]&#8221;). The three verb forms in v. 10 are singular because the representative &#8220;oppressed&#8221; individual is the grammatical subject (see the singular <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aniy</font>] in v. 9).</p>

<A NAME="1032"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=335><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lift up your hand.&#8221; Usually the expression &#8220;lifting the hand&#8221; refers to praying (Pss 28:2; 134:2) or making an oath (Ps 106:26), but here it probably refers to &#8220;striking a blow&#8221; (see 2 Sam 18:28; 20:21). Note v. 15, where the psalmist asks the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> to &#8220;break the arm of the wicked.&#8221; A less likely option is that the psalmist is requesting that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> declare by oath his intention to intervene.</p>
<A NAME="1033"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=336><b>tn</b> The rhetorical question expresses the psalmist&#8217;s outrage that the wicked would have the audacity to disdain God.</p>

<A NAME="1041"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=344><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to give into your hand, upon you, he abandons, [the] unfortunate [one].&#8221; The syntax is awkward and the meaning unclear. It is uncertain who or what is being given into God&#8217;s hand. Elsewhere the idiom &#8220;give into the hand&#8221; means to deliver into one&#8217;s possession. If &#8220;to give&#8221; goes with what precedes (as the accentuation of the Hebrew text suggests), then this may refer to the wicked man being delivered over to God for judgment. The present translation assumes that &#8220;to give&#8221; goes with what follows (cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV). The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1494;&#1465;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">azov</font>) here has the nuance &#8220;entrust&#8221; (see Gen 39:6; Job 39:11); the direct object (&#8220;[his] cause&#8221;) is implied.</p>
<A NAME="1042"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=345><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;help.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1043"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=346><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[for] one who is fatherless, you are a deliverer.&#8221; The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatom</font>) refers to one who has lost his father (not necessarily his mother, see Ps 109:9).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The fatherless</i>. Because they were so vulnerable and were frequently exploited, fatherless children are often mentioned as epitomizing the oppressed (see Pss 68:5; 82:3; 94:6; 146:9; as well as Job 6:27; 22:9; 24:3, 9; 29:12; 31:17, 21).</p>
<A NAME="1044"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=347><b>sn</b> The <i>arm</i> symbolizes the strength of the wicked, which they use to oppress and exploit the weak.</p>
<A NAME="1045"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=348><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you seek his wickedness.&#8221; As in v. 13, the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">darash</font>, &#8220;seek&#8221;) is used here in the sense of &#8220;seek an accounting.&#8221; One could understand the imperfect as describing a fact, &#8220;you hold him accountable,&#8221; or as anticipating divine judgment, &#8220;you will hold him accountable.&#8221; However, since the verb is in apparent parallelism with the preceding imperative (&#8220;break&#8221;), it is better to understand the imperfect as expressing the psalmist&#8217;s desire or request.</p>
<A NAME="1046"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=349><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you will not find.&#8221; It is uncertain how this statement relates to what precedes. Some take <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bal</font>), which is used as a negative particle in vv. 4, 6, 11, 18, as asseverative here, &#8220;Indeed find (i.e., judge his wickedness).&#8221; The translation assumes that the final words are an asyndetic relative clause which refers back to what the wicked man boasted in God&#8217;s face (&#8220;you will not find [i.e., my wickedness]&#8221;). See v. 13.</p>
<A NAME="1047"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=350><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is king forever and ever.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1048"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=351><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the nations perish from his land.&#8221; The perfect verb form may express what is typical or it may express rhetorically the psalmist&#8217;s certitude that God&#8217;s deliverance is &#8220;as good as done.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The nations</i> may be the underlying reality behind the psalmist&#8217;s references to the &#8220;wicked&#8221; in the earlier verses. This reference to the nations may have motivated the combining of Ps 10 with Ps 9 (see Ps 9:5, 15, 19).</p>
<A NAME="1049"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=352><b>sn</b> <i>You have heard</i>. The psalmist is confident that God has responded positively to his earlier petitions for divine intervention. The psalmist apparently prayed the words of vv. 16-18 after the reception of an oracle of deliverance (given in response to the confident petition of vv. 12-15) or after the Lord actually delivered him from his enemies.</p>
<A NAME="1050"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=353><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;desire.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1051"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=354><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you make firm their heart, you cause your ear to listen.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1052"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=355><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to judge (on behalf of),&#8221; or &#8220;by judging (on behalf of).&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1053"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=356><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;crushed.&#8221; See v. 10.</p>
<A NAME="1054"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=357><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he will not add again [i.e., &#8220;he will no longer&#8221;] to terrify, man from the earth.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">enosh</font>, &#8220;man&#8221;) refers here to the wicked nations (v. 16). By describing them as &#8220;from the earth,&#8221; the psalmist emphasizes their weakness before the sovereign, eternal king.</p>
