<A NAME="461"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1690><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 46</i>. In this so-called &#8220;Song Of Zion&#8221; God&#8217;s people confidently affirm that they are secure because the great warrior-king dwells within Jerusalem and protects it from the nations that cause such chaos in the earth. A refrain (vv. 7, 11) concludes the song&#8217;s two major sections.</p>
<A NAME="462"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1691><b>sn</b> The meaning of the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1464;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<i>alamoth</i>, which means &#8220;young women&#8221;) is uncertain; perhaps it refers to a particular style of music. Cf. 1 Chr 15:20.</p>
<A NAME="463"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1692><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;our refuge and strength,&#8221; which is probably a hendiadys meaning &#8220;our strong refuge&#8221; (see Ps 71:7). Another option is to translate, &#8220;our refuge and source of strength.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="464"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1693><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a helper in times of trouble he is found [to be] greatly.&#8221; The perfect verbal form has a generalizing function here. The adverb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1488;&#1465;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">od</font>, &#8220;greatly&#8221;) has an emphasizing function.</p>
<A NAME="465"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1694><b>tn</b> The imperfect is taken in a generalizing sense (cf. NEB) because the situation described in vv. 2-3 is understood as symbolizing typical world conditions. In this case the imperfect draws attention to the typical nature of the response. The covenant community characteristically responds with confidence, not fear. Another option is to take the situation described as purely hypothetical. In this case one might translate, &#8220;We will not fear, even though the earth should shake&#8221; (cf. NIV, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="466"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1695><b>tn</b> The Hiphil infinitival form is normally taken to mean &#8220;when [the earth] is altered,&#8221; being derived from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mur</font>, &#8220;to change&#8221;). In this case the Hiphil would be intransitive, as in Ps 15:4. <i>HALOT</i> 560 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;</font> emends the form to a Niphal and derives it from a homonymic root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> attested in Arabic with the meaning &#8220;shake.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="467"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1696><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;heart of the seas.&#8221; The plural may be used for emphasis, pointing to the deepest sea. Note that the next verse uses a singular pronoun (&#8220;its waters,&#8221; &#8220;its swelling&#8221;) in referring back to the plural noun.</p>
<A NAME="468"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1697><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;its waters.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="469"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1698><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;roar.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1699><b>tn</b> The three imperfect verbal forms in v. 3 draw attention to the characteristic nature of the activity described.</p>
<A NAME="4611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1700><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;at its swelling.&#8221; The Hebrew word often means &#8220;pride.&#8221; If the sea is symbolic of hostile nations, then this may be a case of double entendre. The surging, swelling sea symbolizes the proud, hostile nations. On the surface the psalmist appears to be depicting a major natural catastrophe, perhaps a tidal wave. If so, then the situation would be hypothetical. However, the repetition of the verbs <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hamah</font>, &#8220;crash; roar,&#8221; v. 3) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mot</font>, &#8220;shake,&#8221; v. 2) in v. 6, where nations/kingdoms &#8220;roar&#8221; and &#8220;shake,&#8221; suggests that the language of vv. 2-3 is symbolic and depicts the upheaval that characterizes relationships between the nations of the earth. As some nations (symbolized by the surging, chaotic waters) show hostility, others (symbolized by the mountains) come crashing down to destruction. The surging waters are symbolic of chaotic forces in other poetic texts (see, for example, Isa 17:12; Jer 51:42) and mountains can symbolize strong kingdoms (see, for example, Jer 51:25).</p>
<A NAME="4612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1701><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;A river, its channels cause the city of God to be glad.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The city of God</i> is Jerusalem (see Pss 48:1-2; 87:2-3). The river&#8217;s &#8220;channels&#8221; are probably <i>irrigation ditches</i> vital to growing crops. Some relate the imagery to the &#8220;waters of Shiloah&#8221; (see Isa 8:6), which flowed from the Gihon spring to the pool of Siloam. In Isa 8:6-8 these waters are contrasted with the flood waters symbolizing Assyria. Even if this is the reality behind the imagery, the picture of a river flowing through Jerusalem is idealized and exaggerated. The river and irrigation ditches symbolize the peace and prosperity that the Lord provides for Jerusalem, in contrast to the havoc produced by the turbulent waters (symbolic of the nations) outside the city. Some see here an adaptation of Canaanite (or, more specifically, Jebusite) mythical traditions of rivers/springs flowing from the high god El&#8217;s dwelling place. The Songs of Zion do utilize such imagery at times (see Ps 48:2). The image of a river flowing through Zion may have inspired prophetic visions of an eschatological river flowing from the temple (see Ezek 47:1-12; Joel 3:18).</p>
<A NAME="4613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1702><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the holy [place] of the dwelling places of.&#8221; The adjective &#8220;holy&#8221; is used here in a substantival manner and placed in construct with the following noun (see GKC 428 §132.<i>c</i>). Origen&#8217;s transliterated text assumes the reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1465;&#1491;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qodesh</font>, &#8220;holiness; holy place&#8221;), while the LXX assumes a Piel verbal form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qidesh</font>, &#8220;makes holy&#8221;) and takes the following form as &#8220;his dwelling place.&#8221; The plural form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mishkÿney</font>, &#8220;dwelling places of&#8221;) is probably a plural of degree, emphasizing the special character of this dwelling place. See GKC 397 §124.<i>b</i>. The form stands as an appositional genitive in relation to the preceding construct noun.</p>
<A NAME="4614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1703><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Most High.&#8221; This divine title (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1500;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">elyon</font>) pictures God as the exalted ruler of the universe who vindicates the innocent and judges the wicked. See especially Pss 7:17; 9:2; 18:13; 21:7; 47:2.</p>
<A NAME="4615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1704><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;God [is] within her.&#8221; The feminine singular pronoun refers to the city mentioned in v. 4.</p>
<A NAME="4616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1705><b>tn</b> Another option is to translate the imperfect verbal form as future, &#8220;it will not be upended.&#8221; Even if one chooses this option, the future tense must be understood in a generalizing sense. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mot</font>), translated &#8220;upended&#8221; here, is used in v. 2 of the mountains &#8220;tumbling&#8221; into the seas and in v. 6 of nations being &#8220;upended.&#8221; By way of contrast, Jerusalem, God&#8217;s dwelling place, is secure and immune from such turmoil and destruction.</p>
<A NAME="4617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1706><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;helps her.&#8221; The imperfect draws attention to the generalizing character of the statement.</p>
<A NAME="4618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1707><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;at the turning of morning.&#8221; (For other uses of the expression see Exod 14:27 and Judg 19:26).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>At the break of dawn</i>. The &#8220;morning&#8221; is viewed metaphorically as a time of deliverance and vindication after the dark &#8220;night&#8221; of trouble (see Ps 30:5; Isa 17:14). There may be an allusion here to Exod 14:27 (where the Lord destroyed the Egyptians at the &#8220;break of dawn&#8221;) or, more likely, to the miraculous deliverance of Jerusalem from the Assyrian siege, when the people discovered the dead bodies of the Assyrian army in the morning (Isa 37:36).</p>
<A NAME="4619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1708><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;nations roar, kingdoms shake.&#8221; The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hamah</font>, &#8220;roar, be in uproar&#8221;) is used in v. 3 of the waves crashing, while the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mot</font>, &#8220;overthrown&#8221;) is used in v. 2 of mountains tumbling into the sea (see also v. 5, where the psalm affirms that Jerusalem &#8220;cannot be moved&#8221;). The repetition of the verbs suggests that the language of vv. 2-3 is symbolic and depicts the upheaval that characterizes relationships between the nations of the earth. As some nations (symbolized by the surging, chaotic waters) show hostility, others (symbolized by the mountains) come crashing down to destruction. The surging waters are symbolic of chaotic forces in other poetic texts (see, for example, Isa 17:12; Jer 51:42) and mountains can symbolize strong kingdoms (see, for example, Jer 51:25).</p>
<A NAME="4620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1709><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;He.&#8221; God is the obvious referent here (see v. 5), and has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="4621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1710><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;offers his voice.&#8221; In theophanic texts the phrase refers to God&#8217;s thunderous shout which functions as a battle cry (see Pss 18:13; 68:33).</p>
<A NAME="4622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1711><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;melts.&#8221; See Amos 9:5. The image depicts the nation&#8217;s helplessness before Jerusalem&#8217;s defender, who annihilates their armies (see vv. 8-9). The imperfect verbal form emphasizes the characteristic nature of the action described.</p>
<A NAME="4623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1712><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of hosts is with us.&#8221; The title &#8220;<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of hosts&#8221; here pictures the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> as a mighty warrior-king who leads armies into battle (see Ps 24:10). The military imagery is further developed in vv. 8-9.</p>
<A NAME="4624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1713><b>tn</b> That is, Israel, or Judah (see Ps 20:1).</p>
<A NAME="4625"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1714><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;our elevated place&#8221; (see Pss 9:9; 18:2).</p>
<A NAME="4626"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1715><b>sn</b> In this context the Lord&#8217;s <i>exploits</i> are military in nature (see vv. 8b-9).</p>
<A NAME="4627"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1716><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;who sets desolations in the earth&#8221; (see Isa 13:9). The active participle describes God&#8217;s characteristic activity as a warrior.</p>
<A NAME="4628"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1717><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[the] one who causes wars to cease unto the end of the earth.&#8221; The participle continues the description begun in v. 8b and indicates that this is the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s characteristic activity. Ironically, he brings peace to the earth by devastating the warlike, hostile nations (vv. 8, 9b).</p>
<A NAME="4629"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1718><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shavar</font>, &#8220;break&#8221;) appears in the Piel here (see Ps 29:5). In the OT it occurs thirty-six times in the Piel, always with multiple objects (the object is either a collective singular or grammatically plural or dual form). The Piel may highlight the repetition of the pluralative action, or it may suggest an intensification of action, indicating repeated action comprising a whole, perhaps with the nuance &#8220;break again and again, break in pieces.&#8221; Another option is to understand the form as resultative: &#8220;make broken&#8221; (see <i>IBHS</i> 404-7 §24.3). The imperfect verbal form carries on and emphasizes the generalizing nature of the description.</p>
<A NAME="4630"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1719><b>tn</b> The perfect verbal form with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive carries along the generalizing emphasis of the preceding imperfect.</p>
<A NAME="4631"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1720><b>tn</b> The imperfect verbal form carries on and emphasizes the generalizing nature of the description.</p>
<A NAME="4632"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1721><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;wagons he burns with fire.&#8221; Some read &#8220;chariots&#8221; here (cf. NASB), but the Hebrew word refers to wagons or carts, not chariots, elsewhere in the OT. In this context, where military weapons are mentioned, it is better to revocalize the form as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1490;&#1460;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">agilot</font>, &#8220;round shields&#8221;), a word which occurs only here in the OT, but is attested in later Hebrew and Aramaic.</p>
<A NAME="4633"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1722><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;he says&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarification.</p>
<A NAME="4634"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1723><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;do nothing/be quiet (see 1 Sam 15:16) and know.&#8221; This statement may be addressed to the hostile nations, indicating they should cease their efforts to destroy God&#8217;s people, or to Judah, indicating they should rest secure in God&#8217;s protection. Since the psalm is an expression of Judah&#8217;s trust and confidence, it is more likely that the words are directed to the nations, who are actively promoting chaos and are in need of a rebuke.</p>
<A NAME="4635"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1724><b>tn</b> Elsewhere in the psalms the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rum</font>, &#8220;be exalted&#8221;) when used of God, refers to his exalted position as king (Pss 18:46; 99:2; 113:4; 138:6) and/or his self-revelation as king through his mighty deeds of deliverance (Pss 21:13; 57:5, 11).</p>
<A NAME="4636"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1725><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;among.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4637"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1726><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;in.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4638"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1727><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of hosts is with us.&#8221; The title &#8220;<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of hosts&#8221; here pictures the Lord as a mighty warrior-king who leads armies into battle (see Ps 24:10). The military imagery is further developed in vv. 8-9.</p>
<A NAME="4639"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1728><b>tn</b> That is, Israel, or Judah (see Ps 20:1).</p>
<A NAME="4640"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1729><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;our elevated place&#8221; (see Pss 9:9; 18:2).</p>
