<A NAME="8033"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2970><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;upon the son of man you strengthened for yourself.&#8221; In its only other use in the Book of Psalms, the phrase &#8220;son of man&#8221; refers to the human race in general (see Ps 8:4). Here the phrase may refer to the nation collectively as a man. Note the use of the statement &#8220;you strengthened for yourself&#8221; both here and in v. 15, where the &#8220;son&#8221; (i.e., the branch of the vine) refers to Israel.</p>
