<A NAME="8715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=3148><b>tn</b> As noted in v. 4, the translation assumes a contrast between &#8220;there&#8221; (the various foreign lands) and &#8220;in her&#8221; (Zion). In contrast to foreigners, the citizens of Zion have special status because of their birthplace (v. 5). In this case vv. 4 and 6 form a structural frame around v. 5.</p>
