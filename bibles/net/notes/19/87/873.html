<A NAME="873"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3136><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;glorious things are spoken about you.&#8221; The translation assumes this is a general reference to compliments paid to Zion by those who live within her walls and by those who live in the surrounding areas and lands. Another option is that this refers to a prophetic oracle about the city&#8217;s glorious future. In this case one could translate, &#8220;wonderful things are announced concerning you.&#8221; </p>
