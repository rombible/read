<A NAME="875"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=3138><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to those who know me&#8221; (see Ps 36:10). Apparently the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> speaks here. The verbal construction (the Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">zakhar</font>, &#8220;remember&#8221; followed by the preposition -<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font> [<font face="Scholar">le</font>] with a substantive) is rare, but the prepositional phrase is best understood as indicating the recipient of the announcement (see Jer 4:16). Some take the preposition in the sense of &#8220;among&#8221; and translate, &#8220;among those who know me&#8221; (cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV). In this case these foreigners are viewed as the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s people and the psalm is interpreted as anticipating a time when all nations will worship the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> (see Ps 86:9) and be considered citizens of Zion.</p>
