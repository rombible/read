<A NAME="65"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=166><b>tn</b> Normally the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bahal</font>) refers to an emotional response and means &#8220;tremble with fear, be terrified&#8221; (see vv. 3, 10). Perhaps here the &#8220;bones&#8221; are viewed as the seat of the psalmist&#8217;s emotions. However, the verb may describe one of the effects of his physical ailment, perhaps a fever. In Ezek 7:27 the verb describes how the hands of the people will shake with fear when they experience the horrors of divine judgment.</p>
