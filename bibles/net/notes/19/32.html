<A NAME="321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1114><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 32</i>. The psalmist recalls the agony he experienced prior to confessing his sins and affirms that true happiness comes when one&#8217;s sins are forgiven. He then urges others not to be stubborn, but to turn to God while forgiveness is available, for God extends his mercy to the repentant, while the wicked experience nothing but sorrow.</p>
<A NAME="322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1115><b>tn</b> The meaning of the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">maskil</font>) is uncertain. The word is derived from a verb meaning &#8220;to be prudent; to be wise.&#8221; Various options are: &#8220;a contemplative song,&#8221; &#8220;a song imparting moral wisdom,&#8221; or &#8220;a skillful [i.e., well-written] song.&#8221; The term occurs in the superscriptions of Pss 32, 42, 44, 45, 52-55, 74, 78, 88, 89, and 142, as well as in Ps 47:7.</p>
<A NAME="323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1116><b>tn</b> The Hebrew noun is an abstract plural. The word often refers metonymically to the happiness that God-given security and prosperity produce (see Pss 1:1, 3; 2:12; 34:9; 41:1; 65:4; 84:12; 89:15; 106:3; 112:1; 127:5; 128:1; 144:15). Here it refers to the relief that one experiences when one&#8217;s sins are forgiven.</p>
<A NAME="324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1117><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lifted up.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1118><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;covered over.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1119><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;man.&#8221; The word choice reflects the perspective of the psalmist, who is male. The principle of the psalm is certainly applicable to all people, regardless of their gender or age. To facilitate modern application, the gender and age specific &#8220;man&#8221; has been translated with the more neutral &#8220;one.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1120><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;blessed [is] the man to whom the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> does not impute wrongdoing.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1121><b>sn</b> <i>In whose spirit there is no deceit</i>. The point is not that the individual is sinless and pure. In this context, which focuses on confession and forgiveness of sin, the psalmist refers to one who refuses to deny or hide his sin, but instead honestly confesses it to God.</p>
<A NAME="329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1122><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;when I was silent.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1123><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my bones became brittle.&#8221; The psalmist pictures himself as aging and growing physically weak. Trying to cover up his sin brought severe physical consequences.</p>
<A NAME="3211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1124><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your hand was heavy upon me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1125><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my [?] was turned.&#8221; The meaning of the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿshad</font>) is uncertain. A noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lashad</font>, &#8220;cake&#8221;) is attested in Num 11:8, but it would make no sense to understand that word in this context. It is better to emend the form to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿshuddiy</font>, &#8220;to my destruction&#8221;) and understand &#8220;your hand&#8221; as the subject of the verb &#8220;was turned.&#8221; In this case the text reads, &#8220;[your hand] was turned to my destruction.&#8221; In Lam 3:3 the author laments that God&#8217;s &#8220;hand&#8221; was &#8220;turned&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hafakh</font>) against him in a hostile sense.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>You tried to destroy me</i>. The psalmist&#8217;s statement reflects his perspective. As far as he was concerned, it seemed as if the Lord was trying to kill him.</p>
<A NAME="3213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1126><b>tn</b> The translation assumes that the plural form indicates degree. If one understands the form as a true plural, then one might translate, &#8220;in the times of drought.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1127><b>sn</b> <i>Summer</i>. Perhaps the psalmist suffered during the hot season and perceived the very weather as being an instrument of divine judgment. Another option is that he compares his time of suffering to the uncomfortable and oppressive heat of summer.</p>
<A NAME="3215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1128><b>tn</b> The Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1491;&#1492;</font> normally means &#8220;give thanks, praise,&#8221; but here, as in Prov 28:13, it means &#8220;confess.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1129><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the wrongdoing of my sin.&#8221; By joining synonyms for &#8220;sin&#8221; in this way, the psalmist may be emphasizing the degree of his wrongdoing.</p>
<A NAME="3217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1130><b>tn</b> A &#8220;faithful follower&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1505;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khasid</font>) is one who does what is right in God&#8217;s eyes and remains faithful to God (see Pss 4:3; 12:1; 18:25; 31:23; 37:28; 86:2; 97:10).</p>
<A NAME="3218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1131><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;at a time of finding.&#8221; This may mean, &#8220;while there is time to &#8216;find&#8217; [the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>]&#8221; and seek his forgiveness (cf. NIV). Some emend the text by combining <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1510;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿtso</font>&#8217;, &#8220;finding&#8221;) with the following term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">raq</font>, &#8220;only, surely&#8221;) and read either <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;</font>[<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1465;</font>]<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1510;</font> (<font face="Scholar">matsor</font>, &#8220;distress&#8221;; see Ps 31:22) or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;</font>[<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1465;</font>]<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1510;</font> (<font face="Scholar">matsoq</font>, &#8220;hardship&#8221;; see Ps 119:143). In this case, one may translate &#8220;in a time of distress/hardship&#8221; (cf. NEB, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="3219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1132><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">raq</font>) occasionally has an asseverative force.</p>
<A NAME="3220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1133><b>sn</b> The <i>surging</i> <i>water</i> is here a metaphor for trouble that endangers one&#8217;s life.</p>
<A NAME="3221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1134><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;him.&#8221; The translation uses the plural &#8220;them&#8221; to agree with the plural &#8220;every one of your faithful followers&#8221; in the first line of v. 6.</p>
<A NAME="3222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1135><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[with] shouts of joy of deliverance you surround me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1136><b>tn</b> The second person pronominal forms in this verse are singular. The psalmist addresses each member of his audience individually (see also the note on the word &#8220;eye&#8221; in the next line). A less likely option (but one which is commonly understood) is that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> addresses the psalmist in vv. 8-9 (cf. NASB &#8220;I will instruct you and teach you&#8230;I will counsel you with My eye upon you&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="3224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1137><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will instruct you and I will teach you in the way [in] which you should walk.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1138><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will advise, upon you my eye,&#8221; that is, &#8220;I will offer advice [with] my eye upon you.&#8221; In 2 Chr 20:12 the statement &#8220;our eye is upon you&#8221; means that the speakers are looking to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> for intervention. Here the expression &#8220;my eye upon you&#8221; may simply mean that the psalmist will teach his pupils directly and personally.</p>
<A NAME="3226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1139><b>tn</b> The verb form is plural (i.e., &#8220;do not all of you be&#8221;); the psalmist addresses the whole group.</p>
<A NAME="3227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1140><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;like a horse, like a mule without understanding.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1141><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;with a bridle and bit, its [?] to hold, not to come near to you.&#8221; The meaning of the Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adiy</font>) is uncertain. Normally the word refers to &#8220;jewelry,&#8221; so some suggest the meaning &#8220;trappings&#8221; here (cf. NASB). Some emend the form to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1495;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿkhehem</font>, &#8220;their jawbones&#8221;) but it is difficult to see how the present Hebrew text, even if corrupt, could have derived from this proposed original reading. P. C. Craigie (<i>Psalms 1-50</i> [WBC], 265) takes the form from an Arabic root and translates &#8220;whose gallop.&#8221; Cf. also NRSV &#8220;whose temper must be curbed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1142><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;many [are the] pains of evil [one].&#8221; The singular form is representative here; the typical evildoer, representative of the larger group of wicked people, is in view.</p>
<A NAME="3230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1143><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;but the one who trusts in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, faithfulness surrounds him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1144><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all [you] pure of heart.&#8221; The &#8220;heart&#8221; is here viewed as the seat of one&#8217;s moral character and motives. The &#8220;pure of heart&#8221; are God&#8217;s faithful followers who trust in and love the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and, as a result, experience his deliverance (see Pss 7:10; 11:2; 36:10; 64:10; 94:15; 97:11).</p>
