<A NAME="6421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2298><b>tc</b> The MT reads literally, &#8220;and they caused him to stumble, upon them, their tongue.&#8221; Perhaps the third plural subject of the verb is indefinite with the third singular pronominal suffix on the verb being distributive (see Ps 63:10). In this case one may translate, &#8220;each one will be made to stumble.&#8221; The preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) might then be taken as adversative, &#8220;against them [is] their tongue.&#8221; Many prefer to emend the text to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1499;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1461;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465; &#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1461;&#1497; &#1500;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyakhshilemo </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aley lÿshonam</font>, &#8220;and he caused them to stumble over their tongue&#8221;). However, if this reading is original, it is difficult to see how the present reading of the MT arose. Furthermore, the preposition is not collocated with the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kashal</font>) elsewhere. It is likely that the MT is corrupt, but a satisfying emendation has not yet been proposed.</p>
