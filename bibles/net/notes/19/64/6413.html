<A NAME="6413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2290><b>tn</b> If this is a direct quotation (cf. NASB, NIV), the pronoun &#8220;them&#8221; refers to the snares mentioned in the previous line. If it is an indirect quotation, then the pronoun may refer to the enemies themselves (cf. NEB, which is ambiguous). Some translations retain the direct quotation but alter the pronoun to &#8220;us,&#8221; referring clearly to the enemies (cf. NRSV).</p>
