<A NAME="6418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2295><b>tn</b> The prefixed verb with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive is normally used in narrative contexts to describe completed past actions. It is possible that the conclusion to the psalm (vv. 7-10) was added to the lament after God&#8217;s judgment of the wicked in response to the psalmist&#8217;s lament (vv. 1-6). The translation assumes that these verses are anticipatory and express the psalmist&#8217;s confidence that God would eventually judge the wicked. The psalmist uses a narrative style as a rhetorical device to emphasize his certitude. See GKC 329-30 §111.<i>w</i>.</p>
