<A NAME="471"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1730><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 47</i>. In this hymn the covenant community praises the Lord as the exalted king of the earth who has given them victory over the nations and a land in which to live.</p>
<A NAME="472"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1731><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Shout to God with [the] sound of a ringing cry!&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="473"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1732><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> Most High.&#8221; The divine title &#8220;Most High&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1500;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">elyon</font>) pictures the Lord as the exalted ruler of the universe who vindicates the innocent and judges the wicked.</p>
<A NAME="474"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1733><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;awesome.&#8221; The Niphal participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nora</font>&#8217;), when used of God in the psalms, focuses on the effect that his royal splendor and powerful deeds have on those witnessing his acts (Pss 66:3, 5; 68:35; 76:7, 12; 89:7; 96:4; 99:3; 111:9). Here it refers to his capacity to fill his defeated foes with terror and his people with fearful respect.</p>
<A NAME="475"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1734><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a great king over all the earth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="476"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1735><b>tn</b> On the meaning of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">davar</font>, &#8220;subdue&#8221;), a homonym of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8220;speak&#8221;), see <i>HALOT</i> 209-10 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;</font>. See also Ps 18:47 and 2 Chr 22:10. The preterite form of the verb suggests this is an historical reference and the next verse, which mentions the gift of the land, indicates that the conquest under Joshua is in view.</p>
<A NAME="477"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1736><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;peoples&#8221; (see Pss 2:1; 7:7; 9:8; 44:2).</p>
<A NAME="478"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1737><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he chose for us our inheritance.&#8221; The prefixed verbal form is understood as a preterite (see &#8220;subdued&#8221; in v. 3).</p>
<A NAME="479"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1738><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the pride of.&#8221; The phrase is appositional to &#8220;our inheritance,&#8221; indicating that the land is here described as a source of pride to God&#8217;s people.</p>
<A NAME="4710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1739><b>tn</b> That is, Israel.</p>
<A NAME="4711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1740><b>sn</b> <i>Jacob whom he loves</i>. The Lord&#8217;s covenantal devotion to his people is in view.</p>
<A NAME="4712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1741><b>sn</b> <i>God ascended his throne</i>. In the context of vv. 3-4, which refer to the conquest of the land under Joshua, v. 5 is best understood as referring to an historical event. When the Lord conquered the land and placed his people in it, he assumed a position of kingship, as predicted by Moses (see Exod 15:17-18, as well as Ps 114:1-2). That event is here described metaphorically in terms of a typical coronation ceremony for an earthly king (see 2 Sam 15:10; 2 Kgs 9:13). Verses 1-2, 8-9 focus on God&#8217;s continuing kingship, which extends over all nations.</p>
<A NAME="4713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1742><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;God ascended amid a shout.&#8221; The words &#8220;his throne&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarification. The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s coronation as king is described here (see v. 8). Here the perfect probably has a present perfect function, indicating a completed action with continuing effects.</p>
<A NAME="4714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1743><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> amid the sound of the ram horn.&#8221; The verb &#8220;ascended&#8221; is understood by ellipsis; see the preceding line.</p>
<A NAME="4715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1744><b>tn</b> The meaning of the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">maskil</font>) is uncertain. The word is derived from a verb meaning &#8220;to be prudent; to be wise.&#8221; Various options are: &#8220;a contemplative song,&#8221; &#8220;a song imparting moral wisdom,&#8221; or &#8220;a skillful [i.e., well-written] song.&#8221; The term also occurs in the superscriptions of Pss 32, 42, 44, 45, 52-55, 74, 78, 88, 89, and 142. Here, in a context of celebration, the meaning &#8220;skillful, well-written&#8221; would fit particularly well.</p>
<A NAME="4716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1745><b>tn</b> When a new king was enthroned, his followers would acclaim him king using this enthronement formula (Qal perfect 3ms <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">malakh</font>, &#8220;to reign,&#8221; followed by the name of the king). See 2 Sam 15:10; 1 Kgs 1:11, 13, 18; 2 Kgs 9:13, as well as Isa 52:7. In this context the perfect verbal form is generalizing, but the declaration logically follows the historical reference in v. 5 to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s having ascended his throne.</p>
<A NAME="4717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1746><b>tc</b> The words &#8220;along with&#8221; do not appear in the MT. However, the LXX has &#8220;with,&#8221; suggesting that the original text may have read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1460;&#1501; &#1506;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">am</font>, &#8220;along with the people&#8221;). In this case the MT is haplographic (the consonantal sequence <i>ayin</i>-<i>mem</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1501;</font>] being written once instead of twice). Another option is that the LXX is simply and correctly interpreting &#8220;people&#8221; as an adverbial accusative and supplying the appropriate preposition.</p>
<A NAME="4718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1747><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for to God [belong] the shields of the earth.&#8221; Perhaps the rulers are called &#8220;shields&#8221; because they are responsible for protecting their people. See Ps 84:9, where the Davidic king is called &#8220;our shield,&#8221; and perhaps also Hos 4:18.</p>
<A NAME="4719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1748><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alah</font>, &#8220;ascend&#8221;) appears once more (see v. 5), though now in the Niphal stem.</p>
