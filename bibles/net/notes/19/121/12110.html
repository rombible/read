<A NAME="12110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=4273><b>sn</b> One hardly thinks of the moon&#8217;s rays as being physically harmful, like those of the sun. The reference to the <i>moon</i> may simply lend poetic balance to the verse, but it is likely that the verse reflects an ancient, primitive belief that the moon could have an adverse effect on the mind (note the English expression &#8220;moonstruck,&#8221; which reflects such a belief). Another possibility is that the sun and moon stand by metonymy for harmful forces characteristic of the day and night, respectively.</p>
