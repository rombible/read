<A NAME="1211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=4264><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 121</i>. The psalm affirms that the Lord protects his people Israel. Unless the psalmist addresses an observer (note the second person singular forms in vv. 3-8), it appears there are two or three speakers represented in the psalm, depending on how one takes v. 3. The translation assumes that speaker one talks in vv. 1-2, that speaker two responds to him with a prayer in v. 3 (this assumes the verbs are true jussives of prayer), and that speaker three responds with words of assurance in vv. 4-8. If the verbs in v. 3 are taken as a rhetorical use of the jussive, then there are two speakers. Verses 3-8 are speaker two&#8217;s response to the words of speaker one. See the note on the word &#8220;sleep&#8221; at the end of v. 3.</p>
