<A NAME="1218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=4271><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal forms following the negative particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1500;</font> appear to be jussives. As noted above, if they are taken as true jussives of prayer, then the speaker in v. 3 would appear to be distinct from both the speaker in vv. 1-2 and the speaker in vv. 4-8. However, according to GKC 322 §109.<i>e</i>), the jussives are used rhetorically here &#8220;to express the conviction that something cannot or should not happen.&#8221; In this case one should probably translate, &#8220;he will not allow your foot to slip, your protector will not sleep,&#8221; and understand just one speaker in vv. 4-8.</p>
