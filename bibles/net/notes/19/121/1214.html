<A NAME="1214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4267><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">me</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ayin</font>) is interrogative, not relative, in function. Rather than directly stating that his source of help descends from the hills, the psalmist is asking, &#8220;From where does my help come?&#8221; Nevertheless, the first line does indicate that he is looking toward the hills for help, probably indicating that he is looking up toward the sky in anticipation of supernatural intervention. The psalmist assumes the dramatic role of one needing help. He answers his own question in v. 2.</p>
