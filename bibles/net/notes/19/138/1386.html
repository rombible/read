<A NAME="1386"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=4483><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal forms here and in the following verse are understood as jussives, for the psalmist appears to be calling upon the kings to praise God. Another option is to take them as imperfects and translate, &#8220;the kings of the earth will give thanks&#8230;and will sing.&#8221; In this case the psalmist anticipates a universal response to his thanksgiving song.</p>
