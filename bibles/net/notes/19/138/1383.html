<A NAME="1383"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=4480><b>tc</b> The MT reads, &#8220;for you have made great over all your name your word.&#8221; If retained, this must mean that God's mighty intervention, in fulfillment of his word of promise, surpassed anything he had done prior to this. However, the statement is odd and several emendations have been proposed. Some read, &#8220;for you have exalted over everything your name and your word,&#8221; while others suggest, &#8220;for you have exalted over all the heavens your name and your word.&#8221; The translation assumes an emendation of &#8220;your name&#8221; to &#8220;your heavens&#8221; (a construction that appears in Pss 8:3 and 144:5). The point is that God has been faithful to his promise and the reliability of that promise is apparent to all. For a fuller discussion of these options, see L. C. Allen, <i>Psalms 101-150 </i>(WBC), 244.</p>
