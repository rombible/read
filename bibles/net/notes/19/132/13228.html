<A NAME="13228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=4421><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;there I will cause a horn to sprout for David.&#8221; The horn of an ox underlies the metaphor (cf. Deut 33:17; 1 Kgs 22:11; Pss 18:2; 92:10). The horn of the wild ox is frequently a metaphor for military strength; the idiom &#8220;exalt the horn&#8221; signifies military victory (see 1 Sam 2:10; Pss 89:17, 24; 92:10; Lam 2:17). In the ancient Near East powerful warrior-kings would sometimes compare themselves to a goring bull that used its horns to kill its enemies. For examples, see P. Miller, &#8220;El the Warrior,&#8221; <i>HTR</i> 60 (1967): 422-25, and R. B. Chisholm, &#8220;An Exegetical and Theological Study of Psalm 18/2 Samuel 22&#8221; (Th.D. diss., Dallas Theological Seminary, 1983), 135-36.</p>
