<A NAME="13211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=4404><b>sn</b> Some understand <i>Ephrathah</i> as a reference to Kiriath-jearim because of the apparent allusion to this site in the next line (see the note on &#8220;Jaar&#8221;). The ark was kept in Kiriath-jearim after the Philistines released it (see 1 Sam 6:21-7:2). However, the switch in verbs from &#8220;heard about&#8221; to &#8220;found&#8221; suggests that Ephrathah not be equated with Jair. The group who is speaking heard about the ark while they were in Ephrath. They then went to retrieve it from Kiriath-jearim (&#8220;Jaar&#8221;). It is more likely that Ephrathah refers to a site near Bethel (Gen 35:16, 19; 48:7) or to Bethlehem (Ruth 4:11; Mic 5:2).</p>
