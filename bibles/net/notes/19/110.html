<A NAME="1101"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=3864><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 110</i>. In this royal psalm the psalmist announces God&#8217;s oracle to the Davidic king. The first part of the oracle appears in v. 1, the second in v. 4. In vv. 2-3 the psalmist addresses the king, while in vv. 5-7 he appears to address God.</p>
<A NAME="1102"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=3865><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1488;&#1467;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">um</font>) is used frequently in the OT of a formal divine announcement through a prophet.</p>
<A NAME="1103"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3866><b>sn</b> <i>My lord</i>. In the psalm&#8217;s original context the speaker is an unidentified prophetic voice in the royal court. In the course of time the psalm is applied to each successive king in the dynasty and ultimately to the ideal Davidic king. NT references to the psalm understand David to be speaking about his &#8220;lord,&#8221; the Messiah. (See Matt 22:43-45; Mark 12:36-37; Luke 20:42-44; Acts 2:34-35).</p>
<A NAME="1104"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=3867><b>tn</b> To sit at the &#8220;right hand&#8221; of the king was an honor (see 1 Kgs 2:19). In Ugaritic myth (<i>CTA</i> 4 v. 108-10) the artisan god Kothar-and Khasis is described as sitting at the right hand of the storm god Baal. See G. R. Driver, <i>Canaanite Myths and Legends</i>, 61-62.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Lord&#8217;s invitation to the Davidic king to <i>sit down</i> at his <i>right hand</i> reflects the king&#8217;s position as the Lord&#8217;s vice-regent.</p>
<A NAME="1105"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=3868><b>sn</b> When the Lord made his covenant with David, he promised to subdue the king&#8217;s <i>enemies</i> (see 2 Sam 7:9-11; Ps 89:22-23).</p>
<A NAME="1106"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=3869><b>tn</b> Since the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is mentioned in the third person (note the use of the first person in v. 1), it is likely that these are the psalmist&#8217;s words to the king, not a continuation of the oracle per se.</p>
<A NAME="1107"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=3870><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal form is understood here as descriptive-dramatic or as generalizing, though it could be taken as future.</p>
<A NAME="1108"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=3871><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your strong scepter,&#8221; symbolic of the king&#8217;s royal authority and dominion.</p>
<A NAME="1109"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=3872><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your people, free will offerings.&#8221; Perhaps the people, in their willingness to volunteer, are compared metaphorically to freewill offerings. Following the LXX, some revocalize the text and read &#8220;with you is nobility.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="11010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=3873><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the day of your power.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="11011"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=3874><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in splendor of holiness.&#8221; The plural construct form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hadrey</font>, from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hadar</font>, &#8220;splendor&#8221;) occurs only here; it may indicate degree or perhaps refer by metonymy to garments (see Pss 29:2 and 96:9, where the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1514; &#1511;&#1465;&#1491;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> [<font face="Scholar">hadrat qodesh</font>] refers to &#8220;holy attire&#8221;). If one retains the reading of the MT, this phrase should probably be taken with the preceding line. However, because of the subsequent references to &#8220;dawn&#8221; and to &#8220;dew,&#8221; it is better to emend the text to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497; &#1511;&#1465;&#1491;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">harrey qodesh</font>, &#8220;mountains of holiness&#8221;), a reading found in many medieval Hebrew <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> and in some other ancient witnesses (see Joel 2:2; Ps 133:3, as well as L. C. Allen, <i>Psalms 101-150 </i>[WBC], 80). The &#8220;mountains of holiness&#8221; are probably the hills surrounding Zion (see Ps 87:1; 125:2; 133:3).</p>
<A NAME="11012"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=3875><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from the womb of dawn.&#8221; The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1462;&#1495;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rekhem</font>, &#8220;womb&#8221;) is probably used here metonymically for &#8220;birth.&#8221; The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mishkhar</font>) occurs only here and should be emended to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shakhar</font>, &#8220;dawn&#8221;) with the <i>mem</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;</font>) being understood as dittographic (note the final <i>mem</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1501;</font>] on the preceding word). The phrase &#8220;womb [i.e., &#8220;birth&#8221;] of dawn&#8221; refers to sunrise.</p>
<A NAME="11013"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=3876><b>sn</b> The point of the metaphor is not entirely clear. The <i>dew</i> may symbolize the king&#8217;s youthful vitality or, more likely (note the parallelism), may refer to his army of strong, youthful warriors.</p>
<A NAME="11014"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=3877><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to you [is].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="11015"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=3878><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;swears, vows.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="11016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=3879><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;will not change his mind.&#8221; The negated Niphal imperfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakham</font>) is a way of marking an announcement as an irrevocable decree. See 1 Sam 15:29; Ezek 24:14, as well as R. B. Chisholm, &#8220;Does God &#8216;Change His Mind&#8217;?&#8221; <i>BSac</i> 152 (1995): 387-99.</p>
<A NAME="11017"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=3880><b>sn</b> <i>You are an eternal priest</i>. The Davidic king exercised a non-Levitical priestly role. The king superintended Judah&#8217;s cultic ritual, had authority over the Levites, and sometimes led in formal worship. David himself instructed the Levites to bring the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem (1 Chr 15:11-15), joined the procession, offered sacrifices, wore a priestly ephod, and blessed the people (2 Sam 6:12-19). At the dedication of the temple Solomon led the ceremony, offering sacrifices and praying on behalf of the people (1 Kgs 8).</p>
<A NAME="11018"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=3881><b>tn</b> The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al-divratiy</font>) is a variant of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al-divrat</font>; the final <i>yod</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font>] being an archaic genitival ending), which in turn is a variant of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500; &#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al davar</font>). Both phrases can mean &#8220;concerning&#8221; or &#8220;because of,&#8221; but neither of these nuances fits the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> in Ps 110:4. Here the phrase probably carries the sense &#8220;according to the manner of.&#8221; See L. C. Allen, <i>Psalms 101-150 </i>(WBC), 81.</p>
<A NAME="11019"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=3882><b>sn</b> The Davidic king&#8217;s priestly role is analogous to that of <i>Melchizedek</i>, who was both &#8220;king of Salem&#8221; (i.e., Jerusalem) and a &#8220;priest of God Most High&#8221; in the time of Abraham (Gen 14:18-20). Like Melchizedek, the Davidic king was a royal priest, distinct from the Aaronic line (see Heb 7). The analogy focuses on the king&#8217;s priestly role; the language need not imply that Melchizedek himself was &#8220;an eternal priest.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="11020"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=3883><b>tn</b> As pointed in the Hebrew text, this title refers to God (many medieval Hebrew <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yehveh</font>, &#8220;<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221; here). The present translation assumes that the psalmist here addresses the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> as he celebrates what the king is able to accomplish while positioned at God&#8217;s &#8220;right hand.&#8221; According to this view the king is the subject of the third person verb forms in vv. 5b-7. (2) Another option is to understand the king as the addressee (as in vv. 2-3). In this case &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221; is the subject of the third person verbs throughout vv. 5-7 and is depicted as a warrior in a very anthropomorphic manner. In this case the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is pictured as being at the psalmist&#8217;s right hand (just the opposite of v. 1). See Pss 16:8; 121:5. (3) A third option is to revocalize <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adonay</font>, &#8220;<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221;) as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adoniy</font>, &#8220;my lord&#8221;; see v. 1). In this case one may translate, &#8220;My lord, at his [God&#8217;s] right hand, strikes down.&#8221; In this case the king is the subject of the third person verbs in vv. 5b-7.</p>
<A NAME="11021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=3884><b>tn</b> The perfect verbal forms in vv. 5-6 are understood here as descriptive-dramatic or as generalizing. Another option is to take them as rhetorical. In this case the psalmist describes anticipated events as if they had already taken place.</p>
<A NAME="11022"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=3885><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the day of his anger.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="11023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=3886><b>tn</b> The imperfect verbal forms in vv. 6-7 are understood here as descriptive-dramatic or as generalizing, though they could be taken as future.</p>
<A NAME="11024"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=3887><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;among.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="11025"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=3888><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he fills [with] corpses,&#8221; but one expects a double accusative here. The translation assumes an emendation to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1456;&#1493;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514; &#1490;&#1461;&#1488;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;</font>) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;</font> or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488; &#1490;&#1461;&#1488;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514; &#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1493;&#1460;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (for a similar construction see Ezek 32:5). In the former case <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew"> &#1490;&#1461;&#1488;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font>(<font face="Scholar">ge</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ayot</font>) has accidentally dropped from the text due to homoioteleuton; in the latter case it has dropped out due to homoioarcton.</p>
<A NAME="11026"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=3889><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he strikes [the verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">makhats</font>), translated &#8220;strikes down&#8221; in v. 5] head[s] over a great land.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rabbah</font>, &#8220;great&#8221;) is here used of distance or spatial measurement (see 1 Sam 26:13).</p>
<A NAME="11027"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=3890><b>tn</b> Here the expression &#8220;lifts up the head&#8221; refers to the renewed physical strength and emotional vigor (see Ps 3:3) provided by the refreshing water. For another example of a victorious warrior being energized by water in the aftermath of battle, see Judg 15:18-19 (see also 1 Sam 30:11-12, where the setting is different, however).</p>
