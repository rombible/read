<A NAME="5829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2135><b>tn</b> The plural participle is unusual here if the preceding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohim</font>) is here a plural of majesty, referring to the one true God. Occasionally the plural of majesty does take a plural attributive (see GKC 428-29 §132.<i>h</i>). It is possible that the final <i>mem</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1501;</font>) on the participle is enclitic, and that it was later misunderstood as a plural ending. Another option is to translate, &#8220;Yes indeed, there are gods who judge in the earth.&#8221; In this case, the statement reflects the polytheistic mindset of pagan observers who, despite their theological ignorance, nevertheless recognize divine retribution when they see it.</p>
