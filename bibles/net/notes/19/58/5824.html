<A NAME="5824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2130><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;like living, like burning anger he will sweep it away.&#8221; The meaning of the text is unclear. The translation assumes that within the cooking metaphor (see the previous line) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khay</font>, &#8220;living&#8221;) refers here to raw meat (as in 1 Sam 2:15, where it modifies <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">basar</font>, &#8220;flesh&#8221;) and that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kharun</font>; which always refers to God&#8217;s &#8220;burning anger&#8221; elsewhere) here refers to food that is cooked. The pronominal suffix on the verb &#8220;sweep away&#8221; apparently refers back to the &#8220;thorns&#8221; of the preceding line. The image depicts swift and sudden judgment. Before the fire has been adequately kindled and all the meat cooked, the winds of judgment will sweep away everything in their path.</p>
