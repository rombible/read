<A NAME="5317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1962><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;there they are afraid [with] fear.&#8221; The perfect verbal form is probably used in a rhetorical manner; the psalmist describes the future demise of the oppressors as if it were already occurring. The adverb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sham</font>, &#8220;there&#8221;) is also used here for dramatic effect, as the psalmist envisions the wicked standing in fear at a spot that is this vivid in his imagination (BDB 1027 s.v.). The cognate accusative following the verb emphasizes the degree of their terror (&#8220;absolutely&#8221;).</p>
