<A NAME="531"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1946><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 53</i>. This psalm is very similar to Ps 14. The major difference comes in v. 5, which corresponds to, but differs quite a bit from, Ps 14:5-6, and in the use of the divine name. Ps 14 uses &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yÿhvah</font>, &#8220;Yahweh&#8221;) in vv. 2a, 4, 6, and 7, while Ps 53 employs &#8220;God&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohim</font>) throughout, as one might expect in Pss 42-83, where the name &#8220;Yahweh&#8221; is relatively infrequent. The psalmist observes that the human race is morally corrupt. Evildoers oppress God&#8217;s people, but the psalmist is confident of God&#8217;s protection and anticipates a day when God will vindicate Israel.</p>
