<A NAME="5321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1966><b>tn</b> Once again the perfect is used in a rhetorical manner, describing this future judgment as if it were already accomplished. As in the previous line, God&#8217;s people are probably addressed. The second person singular verb form is apparently collective, suggesting that the people are viewed here as a unified whole. Ps 14:6 reads here &#8220;the counsel of the oppressed you put to shame, even though God is his shelter,&#8221; the words being addressed to the wicked.</p>
