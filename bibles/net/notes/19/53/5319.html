<A NAME="5319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1964><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;scatters the bones.&#8221; The perfect is used in a rhetorical manner, describing this future judgment as if it were already accomplished. Scattering the bones alludes to the aftermath of a battle. God annihilates his enemies, leaving their carcasses spread all over the battlefield. As the bodies are devoured by wild animals and decay, the bones of God&#8217;s dead enemies are exposed. See Ps 141:7.</p>
