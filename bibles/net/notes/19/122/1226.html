<A NAME="1226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=4280><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Jerusalem, which is built like a city which is joined to her together.&#8221; The meaning of the Hebrew text is unclear. Many regard this as a description of the compact way in which the city was designed or constructed. The translation assumes an emendation of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1467;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khubbÿrah</font>, &#8220;is joined&#8221;) to a noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khevrah</font>, &#8220;association; company&#8221;). The text then reads literally, &#8220;Jerusalem, which is built like a city which has a company together.&#8221; This in turn can be taken as a reference to Jerusalem&#8217;s role as a city where people congregated for religious festivals and other civic occasions (see vv. 4-5).</p>
