<A NAME="1512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=463><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he takes an oath to do harm and does not change.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;to do harm&#8221; cannot mean &#8220;do harm to others,&#8221; for the preceding verse clearly characterizes this individual as one who does <i>not</i> harm others. In this context the phrase must refer to an oath to which a self-imprecation is attached. The godly individual takes his commitments to others so seriously he is willing to &#8220;swear to his own hurt.&#8221; For an example of such an oath, see Ruth 1:16-17.</p>
