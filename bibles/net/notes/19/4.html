<A NAME="41"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=92><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 4</i>. The psalmist asks God to hear his prayer, expresses his confidence that the Lord will intervene, and urges his enemies to change their ways and place their trust in God. He concludes with another prayer for divine intervention and again affirms his absolute confidence in God&#8217;s protection.</p>
<A NAME="42"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=93><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;God of my righteousness.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="43"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=94><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in distress (or &#8220;a narrow place&#8221;) you make (a place) large for me.&#8221; The function of the Hebrew perfect verbal form here is uncertain. The translation above assumes that the psalmist is expressing his certitude and confidence that God will intervene. The psalmist is so confident of God&#8217;s positive response to his prayer, he can describe God&#8217;s deliverance as if it had already happened. Such confidence is consistent with the mood of the psalm (vv. 3, 8). Another option is to take the perfects as precative, expressing a wish or request (&#8220;lead me&#8221;). See <i>IBHS</i> 494-95 §30.5.4c, d. However, not all grammarians are convinced that the perfect is used as a precative in biblical Hebrew.</p>
<A NAME="44"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=95><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;show me favor.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="45"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=96><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;hear.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="46"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=97><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sons of man.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="47"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=98><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;how long my honor to shame?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="48"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=99><b>tn</b> The interrogative construction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;&#1470;&#1502;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ad-meh</font>, &#8220;how long?&#8221;), is understood by ellipsis in the second line.</p>
<A NAME="49"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=100><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;emptiness.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=101><b>tn</b> Heb &#8220;a lie.&#8221; Some see the metonymic language of v. 2b (&#8220;emptiness, lie&#8221;) as referring to idols or false gods. However, there is no solid immediate contextual evidence for such an interpretation. It is more likely that the psalmist addresses those who threaten him (see v. 1) and refers in a general way to their sinful lifestyle. (See R. Mosis, <i>TDOT</i> 7:121.) The two terms allude to the fact that sinful behavior is ultimately fruitless and self-destructive.</p>
<A NAME="411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=102><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and know that.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=103><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> sets apart a faithful one for himself.&#8221; The psalmist states a general principle, though the singular form and the parallel line indicate he has himself in mind as the representative godly person. A <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1505;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khasid</font>; here translated as &#8220;the godly&#8221;) is one who does what is right in God&#8217;s eyes and remains faithful to God (see Pss 12:1; 18:25; 31:23; 37:28; 86:2; 97:10).</p>
<A NAME="413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=104><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;hears.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=105><b>sn</b> The psalmist warns his enemies that they need to <i>tremble with fear </i>before God and repudiate their sinful ways.</p>
<A NAME="415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=106><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;say in your heart(s) on your bed(s) and wail/lament.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1465;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dommu</font>) is understood as a form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (&#8220;wail, lament&#8221;) in sorrow and repentance. Another option is to take the verb from II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">damam</font>, &#8220;be quiet&#8221;); cf. NIV, NRSV &#8220;be silent.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=107><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;proper, right.&#8221; The phrase also occurs in Deut 33:19 and Ps 51:19.</p>
<A NAME="417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=108><b>sn</b> <i>Trust in the </i><span class="smallcaps">Lord</span><i>.</i> The psalmist urges his enemies to make peace with God and become his followers.</p>
<A NAME="418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=109><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lift up upon us the light of your face, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1505;&#1492;</font> is apparently an alternate form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;</font>, &#8220;lift up.&#8221; See GKC 217 §76.<i>b</i>. The idiom &#8220;light of your face&#8221; probably refers to a smile (see Eccl 8:1), which in turn suggests favor and blessing (see Num 6:25; Pss 31:16; 44:3; 67:1; 80:3, 7, 19; 89:15; Dan 9:17).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Smile upon us.</i> Though many are discouraged, the psalmist asks the Lord to intervene and transform the situation.</p>
<A NAME="419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=110><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you place joy in my heart.&#8221; Another option is to understand the perfect verbal form as indicating certitude, &#8220;you will make me happier.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=111><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from (i.e., more than) the time (when) their grain and their wine are abundant.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=112><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in peace at the same time I will lie down and sleep.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=113><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for you, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, solitarily, securely make me dwell.&#8221; The translation understands <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿvadad</font>) as modifying the verb; the Lord keeps enemies away from the psalmist so that he is safe and secure. Another option is to take <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1491;</font> with what precedes and translate, &#8220;you alone, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, make me secure.&#8221;</p>
