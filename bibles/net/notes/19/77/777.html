<A NAME="777"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2791><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will remember God and I will groan, I will reflect and my spirit will grow faint.&#8221; The first three verbs are cohortatives, the last a perfect with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive. The psalmist&#8217;s statement in v. 4 could be understood as concurrent with v. 1, or, more likely, as a quotation of what he had said earlier as he prayed to God (see v. 2). The words &#8220;I said&#8221; are supplied in the translation at the beginning of the verse to reflect this interpretation (see v. 10).</p>
