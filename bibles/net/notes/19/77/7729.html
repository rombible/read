<A NAME="7729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2813><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal form may be taken as a preterite or as an imperfect with past progressive force.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Verses 16-18 depict the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> coming in the storm to battle his enemies and subdue the sea. There is no record of such a storm in the historical account of the Red Sea crossing. The language the psalmist uses here is stereotypical and originates in Canaanite myth, where the storm god Baal subdues the sea in his quest for kingship. The psalmist has employed the stereotypical imagery to portray the exodus vividly and at the same time affirm that it is not Baal who subdues the sea, but Yahweh.</p>
