<A NAME="7711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2795><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will remember my song in the night, with my heart I will reflect. And my spirit searched.&#8221; As in v. 4, the words of v. 6a are understood as what the psalmist said earlier. Consequently the words &#8220;I said&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarification (see v. 10). The prefixed verbal form with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive at the beginning of the final line is taken as sequential to the perfect &#8220;I thought&#8221; in v. 6.</p>
