<A NAME="759"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2748><b>tn</b> The identity of the speaker in vv. 4-6 is unclear. The present translation assumes that the psalmist, who also speaks in vv. 7-9 (where God/the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is spoken of in the third person) here addresses the proud and warns them of God&#8217;s judgment. The presence of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>, &#8220;for&#8221;) at the beginning of both vv. 6-7 seems to indicate that vv. 4-9 are a unit. However, there is no formal indication of a new speaker in v. 4 (or in v. 10, where God appears to speak). Another option is to see God speaking in vv. 2-6 and v. 10 and to take only vv. 7-9 as the words of the psalmist. In this case one must interpret <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> at the beginning of v. 7 in an asseverative or emphatic sense (&#8220;surely; indeed&#8221;).</p>
