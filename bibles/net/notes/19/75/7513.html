<A NAME="7513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2752><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for not from the east or from the west, and not from the wilderness of the mountains.&#8221; If one follows this reading the sentence is elliptical. One must supply &#8220;does help come,&#8221; or some comparable statement. However, it is possible to take <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">harim</font>) as a Hiphil infinitive from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rum</font>), the same verb used in vv. 4-5 of &#8220;lifting up&#8221; a horn. In this case one may translate the form as &#8220;victory.&#8221; In this case the point is that victory does not come from alliances with other nations.</p>
