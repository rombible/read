<A NAME="7510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2749><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;do not lift up a horn.&#8221; The horn of an ox underlies the metaphor (see Deut 33:17; 1 Kgs 22:11; Ps 92:10). The horn of the wild ox is frequently a metaphor for military strength; the idiom &#8220;exalt/lift up the horn&#8221; signifies military victory (see 1 Sam 2:10; Pss 89:17, 24; 92:10; Lam 2:17). Here the idiom seems to refer to an arrogant attitude that assumes victory has been achieved.</p>
