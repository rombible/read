<A NAME="5532"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2020><b>tn</b> The prefixed verb with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive normally appears in narrational contexts to indicate past action, but here it continues the anticipatory (future) perspective of the preceding line. In Ps 77:6 one finds the same sequence of cohortative + prefixed verbal form with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive. In this case as well, both forms refer to future actions.</p>
