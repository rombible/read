<A NAME="8430"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=3086><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[Oh] the happiness [of] the man [who] trusts in you.&#8221; Hebrew literature often assumes and reflects the male-oriented perspective of ancient Israelite society. The principle stated here is certainly applicable to all people, regardless of their gender or age. To facilitate modern application, we translate the gender and age specific &#8220;man&#8221; with the plural &#8220;those.&#8221; The individual referred to here is representative of all followers of God, as the use of the plural form in v. 12b indicates.</p>
