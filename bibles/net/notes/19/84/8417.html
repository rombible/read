<A NAME="8417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=3073><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they go from strength to strength.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;from strength to strength&#8221; occurs only here in the OT. With a verb of motion, the expression &#8220;from [common noun] to [same common noun]&#8221; normally suggests movement from one point to another or through successive points (see Num 36:7; 1 Chr 16:20; 17:5; Ps 105:13; Jer 25:32). Ps 84:7 may be emphasizing that the pilgrims move successively from one &#8220;place of strength&#8221; to another as they travel toward Jerusalem. All along the way they find adequate provisions and renewed energy for the trip.</p>
