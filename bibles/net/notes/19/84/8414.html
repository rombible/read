<A NAME="8414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=3070><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;a spring they make it,&#8221; but this makes little sense. Many medieval Hebrew <span class="smallcaps">mss</span>, as well as the LXX, understand God to be the subject and the valley to be the object, &#8220;he [God] makes it [the valley] [into] a spring.&#8221;</p>
