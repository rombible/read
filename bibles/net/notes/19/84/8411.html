<A NAME="8411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=3067><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[Oh] the happiness [of] the man.&#8221; Hebrew literature often assumes and reflects the male-oriented perspective of ancient Israelite society. The principle stated here was certainly applicable to all people, regardless of their gender or age. To facilitate modern application, we translate the gender and age specific &#8220;man&#8221; with the plural &#8220;those.&#8221; The individual referred to in v. 5a is representative of followers of God, as the use of plural forms in vv. 5b-7 indicates.</p>
