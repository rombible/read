<A NAME="8420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=3076><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;our shield&#8221; refers metaphorically to the Davidic king, who, as God&#8217;s vice-regent, was the human protector of the people. Note the parallelism with &#8220;your anointed one&#8221; here and with &#8220;our king&#8221; in Ps 89:18.</p>
