<A NAME="61"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=162><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 6</i>. The psalmist begs the Lord to withdraw his anger and spare his life. Having received a positive response to his prayer, the psalmist then confronts his enemies and describes how they retreat.</p>
<A NAME="62"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=163><b>tn</b> The meaning of the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿminit</font>, &#8220;sheminith&#8221;) is uncertain; perhaps it refers to a particular style of music. See 1 Chr 15:21.</p>
<A NAME="63"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=164><b>sn</b> The implication is that the psalmist has sinned, causing God to discipline him by bringing a life-threatening illness upon him (see vv. 2-7).</p>
<A NAME="64"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=165><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;show me favor.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="65"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=166><b>tn</b> Normally the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bahal</font>) refers to an emotional response and means &#8220;tremble with fear, be terrified&#8221; (see vv. 3, 10). Perhaps here the &#8220;bones&#8221; are viewed as the seat of the psalmist&#8217;s emotions. However, the verb may describe one of the effects of his physical ailment, perhaps a fever. In Ezek 7:27 the verb describes how the hands of the people will shake with fear when they experience the horrors of divine judgment.</p>
<A NAME="66"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=167><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my being is very terrified.&#8221; The suffixed form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>, &#8220;being&#8221;) is often equivalent to a pronoun in poetic texts.</p>
<A NAME="67"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=168><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and you, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, how long?&#8221; The suffering psalmist speaks in broken syntax. He addresses God, but then simply cries out with a brief, but poignant, question: How long will this (= his suffering) continue?</p>
<A NAME="68"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=169><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my being,&#8221; or &#8220;my life.&#8221; The suffixed form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>, &#8220;being&#8221;) is often equivalent to a pronoun in poetic texts.</p>
<A NAME="69"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=170><b>sn</b> <i>Deliver me because of your faithfulness</i>. Though the psalmist is experiencing divine discipline, he realizes that God has made a commitment to him in the past, so he appeals to God&#8217;s faithfulness in his request for help.</p>
<A NAME="610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=171><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for there is not in death your remembrance.&#8221; The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1461;&#1499;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zekher</font>, &#8220;remembrance&#8221;) here refers to the name of the Lord as invoked in liturgy and praise. Cf. Pss 30:4; 97:12. &#8220;Death&#8221; here refers to the realm of death where the dead reside. See the reference to Sheol in the next line.</p>
<A NAME="611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=172><b>tn</b> The rhetorical question anticipates the answer, &#8220;no one.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>In Sheol who gives you thanks?</i> According to the OT, those who descend into the realm of death/Sheol are cut off from God&#8217;s mighty deeds and from the worshiping covenant community that experiences divine intervention (Pss 30:9; 88:10-12; Isa 38:18). In his effort to elicit a positive divine response, the psalmist reminds God that he will receive no praise or glory if he allows the psalmist to die. Dead men do not praise God!</p>
<A NAME="612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=173><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I cause to swim through all the night my bed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=174><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;with my tears my bed I flood/melt.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=175><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has the singular &#8220;eye&#8221; here.</p>
<A NAME="615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=176><b>tn</b> Or perhaps, &#8220;are swollen.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=177><b>tn</b> Or perhaps, &#8220;grow old.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=178><b>sn</b> In his weakened condition the psalmist is vulnerable to the taunts and threats of his <i>enemies</i>.</p>
<A NAME="618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=179><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all [you] workers of wickedness.&#8221; See Ps 5:5.</p>
<A NAME="619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=180><b>sn</b> <i>The </i><span class="smallcaps">Lord</span><i> has heard</i>. The psalmist&#8217;s mood abruptly changes because the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> responded positively to the lament and petition of vv. 1-7 and promised him deliverance.</p>
<A NAME="620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=181><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal form is probably a preterite here; it is parallel to a perfect and refers to the fact that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has responded favorably to the psalmist&#8217;s request.</p>
<A NAME="621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=182><b>tn</b> The four prefixed verbal forms in this verse are understood as jussives. The psalmist concludes his prayer with an imprecation, calling judgment down on his enemies.</p>
<A NAME="622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=183><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and may they be very terrified.&#8221; The psalmist uses the same expression in v. 3 to describe the terror he was experiencing. Now he asks the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> to turn the tables and cause his enemies to know what absolute terror feels like.</p>
