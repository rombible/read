<A NAME="561"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2042><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 56</i>. Despite the threats of his enemies, the psalmist is confident the Lord will keep his promise to protect and deliver him.</p>
<A NAME="562"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2043><b>tn</b> The literal meaning of this phrase is &#8220;silent dove, distant ones.&#8221; Perhaps it refers to a particular style of music, a tune title, or a type of musical instrument.</p>
<A NAME="563"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2044><b>tn</b> The precise meaning of the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">miktam</font>), which also appears in the heading to Pss 16 and 57-60 is uncertain. <i>HALOT</i> 582-83 s.v. defines it as &#8220;inscription.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="564"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2045><b>sn</b> According to the superscription, David wrote this psalm when the Philistines seized him and took him to King Achish of Gath (see 1 Sam 21:11-15).</p>
<A NAME="565"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2046><b>tn</b> According to BDB 983 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1463;&#1507;</font>, the verb is derived from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">af</font>, &#8220;to trample, crush&#8221;) rather than the homonymic verb &#8220;pant after.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="566"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2047><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a fighter.&#8221; The singular is collective for his enemies (see vv. 5-6). The Qal of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lakham</font>, &#8220;fight&#8221;) also occurs in Ps 35:1.</p>
<A NAME="567"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2048><b>tn</b> The imperfect verbal form draws attention to the continuing nature of the enemies&#8217; attacks.</p>
<A NAME="568"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2049><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to those who watch me [with evil intent].&#8221; See also Pss 5:8; 27:11; 54:5; 59:10.</p>
<A NAME="569"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2050><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;for.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2051><b>tn</b> Some take the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">marom</font>, &#8220;on high; above&#8221;) as an adverb modifying the preceding participle and translate, &#8220;proudly&#8221; (cf. NASB; NIV &#8220;in their pride&#8221;). The present translation assumes the term is a divine title here. The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is pictured as enthroned &#8220;on high&#8221; in Ps 92:8. (Note the substantival use of the term in Isa 24:4 and see C. A. Briggs and E. G. Briggs (<i>Psalms </i>[ICC], 2:34), who prefer to place the term at the beginning of the next verse.)</p>
<A NAME="5611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2052><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[in] a day.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2053><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in God I boast, his word.&#8221; The syntax in the Hebrew text is difficult. (1) The line could be translated, &#8220;in God I boast, [in] his word.&#8221; Such a translation assumes that the prepositional phrase &#8220;in God&#8221; goes with the following verb &#8220;I boast&#8221; (see Ps 44:8) and that &#8220;his word&#8221; is appositional to &#8220;in God&#8221; and more specifically identifies the basis for the psalmist&#8217;s confidence. God&#8217;s &#8220;word&#8221; is here understood as an assuring promise of protection. Another option (2) is to translate, &#8220;in God I will boast [with] a word.&#8221; In this case, the &#8220;word&#8221; is a song of praise. (In this view the pronominal suffix &#8220;his&#8221; must be omitted as in v. 10.) The present translation reflects yet another option (3): In this case &#8220;I praise his word&#8221; is a parenthetical statement, with &#8220;his word&#8221; being the object of the verb. The sentence begun with the prepositional phrase &#8220;in God&#8221; is then completed in the next line, with the prepositional phrase being repeated after the parenthesis.</p>
<A NAME="5613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2054><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;flesh,&#8221; which refers by metonymy to human beings (see v. 11, where &#8220;man&#8221; is used in this same question), envisioned here as mortal and powerless before God.</p>
<A NAME="5614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2055><b>tn</b> The rhetorical question assumes the answer, &#8220;Nothing!&#8221; The imperfect is used in a modal sense here, indicating capability or potential.</p>
<A NAME="5615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2056><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my affairs they disturb.&#8221; For other instances of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">davar</font>) meaning &#8220;affairs, business,&#8221; see BDB 183 s.v.. The Piel of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">atsav</font>, &#8220;to hurt&#8221;) occurs only here and in Isa 63:10, where it is used of &#8220;grieving&#8221; (or &#8220;offending&#8221;) the Lord&#8217;s holy Spirit. Here in Ps 56:5, the verb seems to carry the nuance &#8220;disturb, upset,&#8221; in the sense of &#8220;cause trouble.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2057><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;against me [are] all their thoughts for harm.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2058><b>tn</b> The verb is from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gur</font>), which means &#8220;to challenge, attack&#8221; in Isa 54:15 and &#8220;to stalk&#8221; (with hostile intent) in Ps 59:3.</p>
<A NAME="5618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2059><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;hide.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2060><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my heels.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2061><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;according to,&#8221; in the sense of &#8220;inasmuch as; since,&#8221; or &#8220;when; while.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2062><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they wait [for] my life.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2063><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;because of wickedness, deliverance to them.&#8221; As it stands, the MT makes no sense. The negative particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ayin</font>, &#8220;there is not,&#8221; which is due to dittography of the immediately preceding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1493;&#1462;&#1503;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">aven</font>, &#8220;wickedness&#8221;), should probably be added before &#8220;deliverance&#8221; (see <i>BHS</i>, note a). The presence of an imperative in the next line (note &#8220;bring down&#8221;) suggests that this line should be translated as a prayer as well, &#8220;may there not be deliverance to them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2064><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in anger.&#8221; The pronoun &#8220;your&#8221; is supplied in the translation for clarification.</p>
<A NAME="5624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2065><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;people&#8221; in a general sense.</p>
<A NAME="5625"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2066><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my wandering you count, you.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1465;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nod</font>, &#8220;wandering,&#8221; derived from the verbal root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nod</font>, &#8220;to wander&#8221;; cf. NASB) here refers to the psalmist&#8217;s &#8220;changeable circumstances of life&#8221; and may be translated &#8220;misery.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">safar</font>, &#8220;count&#8221;) probably carries the nuance &#8220;assess&#8221; here. Cf. NIV &#8220;my lament&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;my tossings.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5626"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2067><b>tn</b> Traditionally &#8220;your bottle.&#8221; Elsewhere the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1465;&#1488;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">no</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">d</font>, &#8220;leather container&#8221;) refers to a container made from animal skin which is used to hold wine or milk (see Josh 9:4, 13; Judg 4:19; 1 Sam 16:20). If such a container is metaphorically in view here, then the psalmist seems to be asking God to store up his tears as a reminder of his suffering.</p>
<A NAME="5627"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2068><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;recorded&#8221; is supplied in the translation for clarification. The rhetorical question assumes a positive response (see the first line of the verse).</p>
<A NAME="5628"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2069><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;then my enemies will turn back in the day I cry out.&#8221; The Hebrew particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1494;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">az</font>, &#8220;then&#8221;) is probably used here to draw attention to the following statement.</p>
<A NAME="5629"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2070><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;this I know, that God is for me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5630"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2071><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in God I praise a word.&#8221; The syntax of the Hebrew text is difficult. The statement is similar to that of v. 4, except that the third person pronominal suffix is omitted here, where the text has simply &#8220;a word&#8221; instead of &#8220;his word.&#8221; (1) One could translate, &#8220;in God I will boast [with] a word.&#8221; In this case, the &#8220;word&#8221; refers to a song of praise. (2) If one assumes that God&#8217;s word is in view, as in v. 4, then one option is to translate, &#8220;in God I boast, [in] his word.&#8221; In this case the prepositional phrase &#8220;in God&#8221; goes with the following verb &#8220;I boast&#8221; (see Ps 44:8) and &#8220;[his] word&#8221; is appositional to &#8220;in God&#8221; and more specifically identifies the basis for the psalmist&#8217;s confidence. God&#8217;s &#8220;word&#8221; is here understood as an assuring promise of protection. (3) The present translation reflects another option: In this case &#8220;I praise [his] word&#8221; is a parenthetical statement, with &#8220;[his] word&#8221; being the object of the verb. The sentence begun with the prepositional phrase &#8220;in God&#8221; is then completed in v. 11, with the prepositional phrase being repeated after the parenthesis.</p>
<A NAME="5631"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2072><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221; parallels &#8220;in God&#8221; in the first line. Once again the psalmist parenthetically remarks &#8220;I boast in [his] word&#8221; before completing the sentence in v. 11.</p>
<A NAME="5632"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2073><b>tn</b> The statement is similar to that of v. 4, except &#8220;flesh&#8221; is used there instead of &#8220;man.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="5633"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2074><b>tn</b> The rhetorical question assumes the answer, &#8220;Nothing!&#8221; The imperfect is used in a modal sense here, indicating capability or potential.</p>
<A NAME="5634"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2075><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;upon me, O God, [are] your vows.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5635"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2076><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will repay thank-offerings to you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5636"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2077><b>tn</b> The perfect verbal form is probably future perfect; the psalmist promises to make good on his vows once God has delivered him (see Pss 13:5; 52:9). (2) Another option is to understand the final two verses as being added later, after the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> intervened on the psalmist&#8217;s behalf. In this case one may translate, &#8220;for you have delivered.&#8221; Other options include taking the perfect as (3) generalizing (&#8220;for you deliver&#8221;) or (4) rhetorical (&#8220;for you will&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="5637"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2078><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;are not my feet [kept] from stumbling?&#8221; The rhetorical question expects the answer, &#8220;Of course they are!&#8221; The question has been translated as an affirmation for the sake of clarification of meaning.</p>
<A NAME="5638"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2079><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;walk before.&#8221; For a helpful discussion of the background and meaning of this Hebrew idiom, see M. Cogan and H. Tadmor, <i>II Kings</i> (AB), 254; cf. the same idiom in 2 Kgs 20:3; Isa 38:3.</p>
<A NAME="5639"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2080><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the light of life.&#8221; The phrase is used here and in Job 33:30.</p>
