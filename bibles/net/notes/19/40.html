<A NAME="401"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1442><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 40</i>. The psalmist combines a song of thanksgiving for a recent act of divine deliverance (vv. 1-11) with a confident petition for renewed divine intervention (vv. 12-17).</p>
<A NAME="402"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1443><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;relying, I relied.&#8221; The infinitive absolute precedes the finite verbal form to emphasize the verbal idea. The emphasis is reflected in the translation through the adverb &#8220;completely.&#8221; Another option is to translate, &#8220;I waited patiently&#8221; (cf. NASB, NIV, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="403"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1444><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;cistern of roaring.&#8221; The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bor</font>, &#8220;cistern, pit&#8221;) is used metaphorically here of Sheol, the place of death, which is sometimes depicted as a raging sea (see Ps 18:4, 15-16). The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">on</font>, &#8220;roaring&#8221;) refers elsewhere to the crashing sound of the sea&#8217;s waves (see Ps 65:7).</p>
<A NAME="404"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1445><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from the mud of mud.&#8221; The Hebrew phrase translated &#8220;slimy mud&#8221; employs an appositional genitive. Two synonyms are joined in a construct relationship to emphasize the single idea. For a detailed discussion of the grammatical point with numerous examples, see Y. Avishur, &#8220;Pairs of Synonymous Words in the Construct State (and in Appositional Hendiadys) in Biblical Hebrew,&#8221; <i>Semitics</i> 2 (1971): 17-81.</p>
<A NAME="405"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1446><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he established my footsteps.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="406"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1447><b>sn</b> A <i>new song</i> was appropriate because the Lord had intervened in the psalmist&#8217;s experience in a fresh and exciting way.</p>
<A NAME="407"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1448><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he placed in my mouth a new song, praise to our God.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="408"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1449><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;may many see and fear and trust in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.&#8221; The translation assumes that the initial prefixed verbal form is a jussive (&#8220;may many see&#8221;), rather than an imperfect (&#8220;many will see&#8221;). The following prefixed verbal forms with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) conjunctive are taken as indicating purpose or result (&#8220;so that they might swear allegiance&#8230;and trust&#8221;) after the introductory jussive.</p>
<A NAME="409"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1450><b>tn</b> The Hebrew noun is an abstract plural. The word often refers metonymically to the happiness that God-given security and prosperity produce (see Pss 1:1, 3; 2:12; 34:9; 41:1; 65:4; 84:12; 89:15; 106:3; 112:1; 127:5; 128:1; 144:15).</p>
<A NAME="4010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1451><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;man.&#8221; See the note on the word &#8220;one&#8221; in Ps 1:1.</p>
<A NAME="4011"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1452><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;who has made the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> his [object of] trust.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4012"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1453><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and does not turn toward.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4013"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1454><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;those falling away toward a lie.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4014"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1455><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;many things you have done, you, O <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> my God, your amazing deeds and your thoughts toward us.&#8221; The precise meaning of the text is not clear, but the psalmist seems to be recalling the Lord&#8217;s miraculous deeds on Israel&#8217;s behalf (see Pss 9:1; 26:7), as well as his covenantal decrees and promises (see Ps 33:11).</p>
<A NAME="4015"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1456><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;there is none arrayed against you.&#8221; The precise meaning of the text is unclear, but the collocation <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456; &#1488;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arakh </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>, &#8220;array against&#8221;) is used elsewhere of military (Judg 20:30; 1 Chr 19:17) or verbal opposition (Job 32:14).</p>
<A NAME="4016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1457><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will declare and I will speak, they are too numerous to recount.&#8221; The present translation assumes that the cohortatives are used in a hypothetical manner in a formally unmarked conditional sentence, &#8220;Should I try to declare [them] and speak [of them]&#8230;&#8221; (cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV). For other examples of cohortatives in the protasis (&#8220;if&#8221; clause) of a conditional sentence, see GKC 320 §108.<i>e</i>. (It should be noted, however, that <i>GKC</i> understands this particular verse in a different manner. See GKC 320 §108.<i>f</i>, where it is suggested that the cohortatives are part of an apodosis with the protasis being suppressed.) Another option is to take the cohortatives as a declaration of the psalmist&#8217;s resolve to announce the truth expressed in the next line. In this case one might translate: &#8220;I will declare and speak [the truth]: They are too numerous to recount.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4017"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1458><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sacrifice and offering you do not desire.&#8221; The statement is exaggerated for the sake of emphasis (see Ps 51:16 as well). God is pleased with sacrifices, but his first priority is obedience and loyalty (see 1 Sam 15:22). Sacrifices and offerings apart from genuine allegiance are meaningless (see Isa 1:11-20).</p>
<A NAME="4018"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1459><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;ears you hollowed out for me.&#8221; The meaning of this odd expression is debated (this is the only collocation of &#8220;hollowed out&#8221; and &#8220;ears&#8221; in the OT). It may have been an idiomatic expression referring to making a point clear to a listener. The LXX has &#8220;but a body you have prepared for me,&#8221; a reading which is followed in Heb 10:5.</p>
<A NAME="4019"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1460><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the roll of the scroll it is written concerning me.&#8221; Apparently the psalmist refers to the law of God (see v. 8), which contains the commandments God desires him to obey. If this is a distinctly royal psalm, then the psalmist/king may be referring specifically to the regulations of kingship prescribed in Deut 17:14-20. See P. C. Craigie, <i>Psalms 1-50</i> (WBC), 315.</p>
<A NAME="4020"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1461><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;your will.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1462><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your law [is] in the midst of my inner parts.&#8221; The &#8220;inner parts&#8221; are viewed here as the seat of the psalmist&#8217;s thought life and moral decision making.</p>
<A NAME="4022"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1463><b>sn</b> The <i>great assembly</i> is also mentioned in Pss 22:25 and 35:18.</p>
<A NAME="4023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1464><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I proclaim justice in the great assembly.&#8221; Though &#8220;justice&#8221; appears without a pronoun here, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s just acts are in view (see v. 10). His &#8220;justice&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1462;&#1491;&#1462;&#1511;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tsedeq</font>) is here the deliverance that originates in his justice; he protects and vindicates the one whose cause is just.</p>
<A NAME="4024"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1465><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Look! My lips I do not restrain.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4025"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1466><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your justice I have not hidden in the midst of my heart.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4026"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1467><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I have not hidden your loyal love and reliability.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4027"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1468><b>tn</b> Some (cf. NIV, NRSV) translate the verb as a request (&#8220;do not withhold&#8221;), but elsewhere in the psalms the second masculine singular prefixed form, when addressed to God and preceded by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;), is always indicative in mood and never has the force of a prayer (see Pss 16:10; 22:2; 44:9 51:16-17; 60:10; 108:11; cf. NEB, NASB).</p>
<A NAME="4028"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1469><b>tn</b> In this line the psalmist makes the transition from confidence to petition (see v. 13). Since the prefixed verbal form in the preceding line is imperfect/indicative, one could take the verb in this line as imperfect as well and translate, &#8220;your loyal love and faithfulness continually protect me&#8221; (cf. NEB). However, the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) at the beginning of the next verse, if causal (&#8220;because&#8221;), is best understood as introducing a motivating argument in support of a petition. For this reason v. 11b is best taken as a prayer with the prefixed form being understood as jussive (cf. NIV, NRSV). For parallels to the proposed construction (jussive followed by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> + perfect introducing motivating argument), see Ps 25:21, as well as Pss 10:2-3; 22:8.</p>
<A NAME="4029"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1470><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;sinful deeds.&#8221; The Hebrew term used here can have a nonmoral nuance (&#8220;dangers&#8221;) or a moral one (&#8220;sinful deeds&#8221;) depending on the context. The next line (see &#8220;my sins&#8221;) seems to favor the moral sense, but the psalmist also speaks of enemies shortly after this (v. 14).</p>
<A NAME="4030"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1471><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and my heart abandons me.&#8221; The &#8220;heart&#8221; is here viewed as the seat of emotional strength and courage. For a similar idea see Ps 38:10.</p>
<A NAME="4031"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1472><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;hurry to my help.&#8221; See Pss 22:19; 38:22.</p>
<A NAME="4032"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1473><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;may they be embarrassed and ashamed together, the ones seeking my life to snatch it away.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4033"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1474><b>tn</b> The four prefixed verbal forms in this verse (&#8220;may those&#8230;be&#8230;embarrassed and ashamed&#8230;may those&#8230;be turned back and ashamed&#8221;) are understood as jussives. The psalmist is calling judgment down on his enemies.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> See Ps 35:4 for a similar prayer.</p>
<A NAME="4034"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1475><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal form is understood as a jussive in this imprecation.</p>
<A NAME="4035"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1476><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;May they be humiliated according to their shame, those who say to me, &#8216;Aha! Aha!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4036"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1477><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;those who love,&#8221; which stands metonymically for its cause, the experience of being delivered by the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.</p>
<A NAME="4037"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1478><b>tn</b> The three prefixed verbal forms prior to the quotation are understood as jussives. The psalmist balances out his imprecation against his enemies with a prayer of blessing upon the godly.</p>
<A NAME="4038"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1479><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal form is taken as a jussive, &#8220;may the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> be magnified [in praise].&#8221; Another option is to take the verb as an imperfect, &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is great&#8221; (cf. NRSV). See Ps 35:27.</p>
<A NAME="4039"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1480><b>sn</b> See Pss 35:10; 37:14.</p>
<A NAME="4040"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1481><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal form may be taken as a jussive of prayer (as in the present translation; cf. NIV) or as an imperfect, &#8220;The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will pay attention to me&#8221; (cf. NRSV). The parallel in Ps 70:5 has, &#8220;O God, hurry to me!&#8221; For this reason some prefer to emend <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yakhashav</font>, &#8220;may he pay attention&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khushah</font>, &#8220;hurry!&#8221;). The syntax of the Hebrew text is awkward; elsewhere when the Qal of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khashav</font>, &#8220;reckon; consider&#8221;) is collocated with the preposition -<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lamed</font>) and a pronominal suffix there is an accompanying direct object or additional prepositional phrase/adverbial accusative (see Gen 15:6; 2 Sam 19:19; Job 13:24; 19:11; 33:10; Pss 32:2; 41:7; Amos 6:5).</p>
