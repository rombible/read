<A NAME="1112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=369><b>sn</b> The quotation of the advisers&#8217; words (which begins in 11:1c) ends at this point. They advise the psalmist to flee because the enemy is poised to launch a deadly attack. In such a lawless and chaotic situation godly people like the psalmist can accomplish nothing, so they might as well retreat to a safe place.</p>
