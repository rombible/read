<A NAME="114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=361><b>tc</b> The MT is corrupt here. The <i>Kethib</i> (consonantal text) reads: &#8220;flee [masculine plural!] to your [masculine plural!] mountain, bird.&#8221; The <i>Qere</i> (marginal reading) has &#8220;flee&#8221; in a feminine singular form, agreeing grammatically with the addressee, the feminine noun &#8220;bird.&#8221; Rather than being a second masculine plural pronominal suffix, the ending <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1462;&#1501;</font>- (-<font face="Scholar">khem</font>) attached to &#8220;mountain&#8221; is better interpreted as a second feminine singular pronominal suffix followed by an enclitic <i>mem</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1501;</font>). &#8220;Bird&#8221; may be taken as vocative (&#8220;O bird&#8221;) or as an adverbial accusative of manner (&#8220;like a bird&#8221;). Either way, the psalmist&#8217;s advisers compare him to a helpless bird whose only option in the face of danger is to fly away to an inaccessible place.</p>
