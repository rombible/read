<A NAME="1125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=382><b>tn</b> The verb form is a jussive, indicating that the statement is imprecatory (&#8220;May the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> rain down&#8221;), not indicative (&#8220;The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> rains down&#8221;; see also Job 20:23). The psalmist appeals to God to destroy the wicked, rather than simply stating his confidence that God will do so. In this way the psalmist seeks to activate divine judgment by appealing to God&#8217;s just character. For an example of the power of such a curse, see Judg 9:7-57.</p>
