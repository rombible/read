<A NAME="451"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1637><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 45</i>. This is a romantic poem celebrating the Davidic king&#8217;s marriage to a lovely princess. The psalmist praises the king for his military prowess and commitment to justice, urges the bride to be loyal to the king, and anticipates that the marriage will be blessed with royal offspring.</p>
<A NAME="452"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1638><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;according to lilies.&#8221; &#8220;Lilies&#8221; may be a tune title or musical style, suggestive of romantic love. The imagery of a &#8220;lily&#8221; appears frequently in the Song of Solomon in a variety of contexts (see 2:1-2, 16; 4:5; 5:13; 6:2-3; 7:2).</p>
<A NAME="453"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1639><b>tn</b> The meaning of the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;</font> (<i>maskil</i>) is uncertain. See the note on the phrase &#8220;well-written song&#8221; in the superscription of Ps 42.</p>
<A NAME="454"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1640><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[with] a good word.&#8221; The &#8220;good word&#8221; probably refers here to the song that follows.</p>
<A NAME="455"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1641><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my works [are] for a king.&#8221; The plural &#8220;works&#8221; may here indicate degree, referring to the special musical composition that follows.</p>
<A NAME="456"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1642><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my tongue [is] a stylus of a skillful scribe.&#8221; Words flow from the psalmist&#8217;s tongue just as they do from a scribe&#8217;s stylus.</p>
<A NAME="457"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1643><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you are handsome from the sons of man.&#8221; The preposition &#8220;from&#8221; is used in a comparative (&#8220;more than&#8221;) sense. The peculiar verb form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1508;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1508;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yafyafita</font>) is probably the result of dittography of <i>yod</i>-<i>pe</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1508;</font>) and should be emended to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1508;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yafita</font>). See GKC 152 §55.<i>e</i>.</p>
<A NAME="458"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1644><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;favor is poured out on your lips.&#8221; &#8220;Lips&#8221; probably stands by metonymy for the king&#8217;s speech. Some interpret the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khen</font>) as referring here to &#8220;gracious (i.e., kind and polite) speech&#8221;, but the word probably refers more generally to &#8220;attractive&#8221; speech that is impressively articulated and fitting for the occasion. For other instances of the term being used of speech, see Prov 22:11 and Eccl 10:12.</p>
<A NAME="459"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1645><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;this demonstrates.&#8221; The construction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al-ken</font>, &#8220;therefore&#8221;) usually indicates what logically follows from a preceding statement. However, here it may infer the cause from the effect, indicating the underlying basis or reason for what precedes (see BDB 487 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503;</font> 3.f; C. A. Briggs and E. G. Briggs, <i>Psalms </i>[ICC], 1:386).</p>
<A NAME="4510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1646><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;blesses you forever.&#8221; Here &#8220;bless&#8221; means to &#8220;endue with the power and skill to rule effectively,&#8221; as the following verses indicate.</p>
<A NAME="4511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1647><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;mighty one.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1648><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has simply, &#8220;your majesty and your splendor,&#8221; which probably refers to the king&#8217;s majestic splendor when he appears in full royal battle regalia.</p>
<A NAME="4513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1649><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and your majesty, be successful.&#8221; The syntax is awkward. The phrase &#8220;and your majesty&#8221; at the beginning of the verse may be accidentally repeated (dittography); it appears at the end of v. 3.</p>
<A NAME="4514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1650><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;for the sake of truth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1651><b>tc</b> The precise meaning of the MT is uncertain. The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1504;&#1456;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anvah</font>) occurs only here. One could emend the text to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492; &#1493;&#1456;&#1510;&#1462;&#1491;&#1462;&#1511;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anavah vÿtsedeq</font>, &#8220;[for the sake of truth], humility, and justice&#8221;). In this case &#8220;humility&#8221; would perhaps allude to the king&#8217;s responsibility to &#8220;serve&#8221; his people by promoting justice (cf. NIV &#8220;in behalf of truth, humility and righteousness&#8221;). The present translation assumes an emendation to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">an</font>, &#8220;because; on account of&#8221;) which would form a suitable parallel to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al-dÿvar</font>, &#8220;because; for the sake of&#8221;) in the preceding line.</p>
<A NAME="4516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1652><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and your right hand will teach you mighty acts&#8221;; or &#8220;and may your right hand teach you mighty acts.&#8221; After the imperatives in the first half of the verse, the prefixed verbal form with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) conjunctive likely indicates purpose (&#8220;so that your right hand might teach you mighty acts&#8221;) or result (see the present translation). The &#8220;right hand&#8221; here symbolizes the king&#8217;s military strength. His right hand will &#8220;teach&#8221; him mighty acts by performing them and thereby causing him to experience their magnificence.</p>
<A NAME="4517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1653><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your arrows are sharp &#8211; peoples beneath you fall &#8211; in the heart of the enemies of the king.&#8221; The choppy style reflects the poet&#8217;s excitement.</p>
<A NAME="4518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1654><b>sn</b> The king&#8217;s <i>throne</i> here symbolizes his rule.</p>
<A NAME="4519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1655><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;forever and ever.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>O God.</i> The king is clearly the addressee here, as in vv. 2-5 and 7-9. Rather than taking the statement at face value, many prefer to emend the text because the concept of deifying the earthly king is foreign to ancient Israelite thinking (cf. NEB &#8220;your throne is like God&#8217;s throne, eternal&#8221;). However, it is preferable to retain the text and take this statement as another instance of the royal hyperbole that permeates the royal psalms. Because the Davidic king is God&#8217;s vice-regent on earth, the psalmist addresses him as if he were God incarnate. God energizes the king for battle and accomplishes justice through him. A similar use of hyperbole appears in Isa 9:6, where the ideal Davidic king of the eschaton is given the title &#8220;Mighty God&#8221; (see the note on this phrase there). Ancient Near Eastern art and literature picture gods training kings for battle, bestowing special weapons, and intervening in battle. According to Egyptian propaganda, the Hittites described Rameses II as follows: &#8220;No man is he who is among us, It is Seth great-of-strength, Baal in person; Not deeds of man are these his doings, They are of one who is unique&#8221; (see Miriam Lichtheim, <i>Ancient Egyptian Literature</i>, 2:67). Ps 45:6 and Isa 9:6 probably envision a similar kind of response when friends and foes alike look at the Davidic king in full battle regalia. When the king&#8217;s enemies oppose him on the battlefield, they are, as it were, fighting against God himself.</p>
<A NAME="4520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1656><b>sn</b> The king&#8217;s <i>scepter</i> symbolizes his royal authority.</p>
<A NAME="4521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1657><b>sn</b> To <i>love justice</i> means to actively promote it.</p>
<A NAME="4522"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1658><b>sn</b> To <i>hate evil</i> means to actively oppose it.</p>
<A NAME="4523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1659><b>tn</b> For other examples of the repetition of Elohim, &#8220;God,&#8221; see Pss 43:4; 48:8, 14; 50:7; 51:14; 67:7. Because the name Yahweh (&#8220;<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221;) is relatively rare in Pss 42-83, where the name Elohim (&#8220;God&#8221;) predominates, this compounding of Elohim may be an alternative form of the compound name &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> my/your/our God.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1660><b>sn</b> <i>Anointed you</i>. When read in the light of the preceding context, the anointing is most naturally taken as referring to the king&#8217;s coronation. However, the following context (vv. 8-9) focuses on the wedding ceremony, so some prefer to see this anointing as part of the king&#8217;s preparations for the wedding celebration. Perhaps the reference to his anointing at his coronation facilitates the transition to the description of the wedding, for the king was also anointed on this occasion.</p>
<A NAME="4525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1661><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>oil of joy</i> alludes to the fact that the coronation of the king, which was ritually accomplished by anointing his head with olive oil, was a time of great celebration and renewed hope. (If one understands the anointing in conjunction with the wedding ceremony, the &#8220;joy&#8221; would be that associated with the marriage.) The phrase &#8220;oil of joy&#8221; also appears in Isa 61:3, where mourners are granted &#8220;oil of joy&#8221; in conjunction with their deliverance from oppression.</p>
<A NAME="4526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1662><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from your companions.&#8221; The &#8220;companions&#8221; are most naturally understood as others in the royal family or, more generally, as the king&#8217;s countrymen.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Verses 6-7 are quoted in Heb 1:8-9, where they are applied to Jesus.</p>
<A NAME="4527"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1663><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;perfumed with&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarification.</p>
<A NAME="4528"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1664><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the palaces of ivory.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;palaces of ivory&#8221; refers to palaces that had ivory panels and furniture decorated with ivory inlays. Such decoration with ivory was characteristic of a high level of luxury. See 1 Kgs 22:39 and Amos 3:15.</p>
<A NAME="4529"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1665><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from the palaces of ivory stringed instrument[s] make you happy.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4530"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1666><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;daughters of kings.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4531"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1667><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;valuable ones.&#8221; The form is feminine plural.</p>
<A NAME="4532"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1668><b>tn</b> This rare Hebrew noun apparently refers to the king&#8217;s bride, who will soon be queen (see Neh 2:6). The Aramaic cognate is used of royal wives in Dan 5:2-3, 23.</p>
<A NAME="4533"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1669><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a consort stands at your right hand, gold of Ophir.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Gold from Ophir</i> is also mentioned in Isa 13:12 and Job 28:16. The precise location of Ophir is uncertain; Arabia, India, East Africa, and South Africa have all been suggested as options.</p>
<A NAME="4534"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1670><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;daughter.&#8221; The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1514;</font> (&#8220;daughter&#8221;) can sometimes refer to a young woman in a general sense (see H. Haag, <i>TDOT</i> 2:334).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Listen, O princess</i>. The poet now addresses the bride.</p>
<A NAME="4535"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1671><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;see and turn your ear.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>, &#8220;see&#8221;) is used here of mental observation.</p>
<A NAME="4536"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1672><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your people.&#8221; This reference to the &#8220;people&#8221; of the princess suggests she was a foreigner. Perhaps the marriage was arranged as part of a political alliance between Israel (or Judah) and a neighboring state. The translation &#8220;your homeland&#8221; reflects such a situation.</p>
<A NAME="4537"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1673><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the house of your father.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4538"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1674><b>tn</b> After the preceding imperatives, the jussive verbal form with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) conjunctive is best understood as introducing a purpose (&#8220;so that the king might desire your beauty&#8221;) or result clause (see the present translation and cf. also NASB). The point seems to be this: The bride might tend to be homesick, which in turn might cause her to mourn and diminish her attractiveness. She needs to overcome this temptation to unhappiness and enter into the marriage with joy. Then the king will be drawn to her natural beauty.</p>
<A NAME="4539"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1675><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;desire.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4540"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1676><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;bow down.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4541"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1677><b>sn</b> <i>Submit to him</i>. The poet here makes the point that the young bride is obligated to bring pleasure to her new husband. Though a foreign concept to modern western culture, this was accepted as the cultural norm in the psalmist&#8217;s day.</p>
<A NAME="4542"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1678><b>map</b> For location see Map1-A2; Map2-G2; Map4-A1; JP3-F3; JP4-F3.</p>
<A NAME="4543"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1679><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and a daughter of Tyre with a gift, your face they will appease, the rich of people.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;daughter of Tyre&#8221; occurs only here in the OT. It could be understood as addressed to the bride, indicating she was a Phoenician (cf. NEB). However, often in the OT the word &#8220;daughter,&#8221; when collocated with the name of a city or country, is used to personify the referent (see, for example, &#8220;Daughter Zion&#8221; in Ps 9:14, and &#8220;Daughter Babylon&#8221; in Ps 137:8). If that is the case here, then &#8220;Daughter Tyre&#8221; identifies the city-state of Tyre as the place from which the rich people come (cf. NRSV). The idiom &#8220;appease the face&#8221; refers to seeking one&#8217;s favor (see Exod 32:11; 1 Sam 13:12; 1 Kgs 13:6; 2 Kgs 13:4; 2 Chr 33:12; Job 11:19; Ps 119:58; Prov 19:6; Jer 26:19; Dan 9:13; Zech 7:2; 8:21-22; Mal 1:9).</p>
<A NAME="4544"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1680><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[the] daughter of a king.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4545"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1681><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[is] completely glorious.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4546"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1682><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;within, from settings of gold, her clothing.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pÿnimah</font>, &#8220;within&#8221;), if retained, would go with the preceding line and perhaps refer to the bride being &#8220;within&#8221; the palace or her bridal chamber (cf. NIV, NRSV). Since the next two lines refer to her attire (see also v. 9b), it is preferable to emend the form to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1492;&#1468;&#1464;</font> (&#8220;her pearls&#8221;) or to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8220;pearls&#8221;). The <i>mem</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;</font>) prefixed to &#8220;settings&#8221; is probably dittographic.</p>
<A NAME="4547"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1683><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;virgins after her, her companions, are led to you.&#8221; Some emend <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lakh</font>, &#8220;to you&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lah</font>, &#8220;to her,&#8221; i.e., the princess), because the princess is now being spoken of in the third person (vv. 13-14a), rather than being addressed directly (as in vv. 10-12). However, the ambiguous suffixed form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1498;&#1456;</font> need not be taken as second feminine singular. The suffix can be understood as a pausal second masculine singular form, addressed to the king. The translation assumes this to be the case; note that the king is addressed once more in vv. 16-17, where the second person pronouns are masculine.</p>
<A NAME="4548"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1684><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they are led with joy and happiness, they enter the house of the king.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4549"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1685><b>tn</b> The pronoun is second masculine singular, indicating the king is being addressed from this point to the end of the psalm.</p>
<A NAME="4550"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1686><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal form could be taken as jussive and the statement interpreted as a prayer, &#8220;May your sons carry on the dynasty of your ancestors!&#8221; The next line could then be taken as a relative clause, &#8220;[your sons] whom you will make princes throughout the land.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4551"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1687><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in place of your fathers will be your sons.&#8221;</p>

The king&#8217;s &#8220;name&#8221; stands here for his reputation and character, which the poet praised in vv. 2-7.</p>
<A NAME="4553"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1689><b>sn</b> <i>The nations will praise you</i>. As God&#8217;s vice-regent on earth, the king is deserving of such honor and praise.</p>
