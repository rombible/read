<A NAME="351"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1223><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 35</i>. The author, who faces ruthless enemies who seek his life for no reason, begs the Lord to fight his battles for him and to vindicate him by annihilating his adversaries.</p>
<A NAME="352"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1224><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;contend.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="353"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1225><b>tn</b> Two different types of shields are mentioned here. See also Ezek 38:4. Many modern translations render the first term (translated here &#8220;small shield&#8221;) as &#8220;buckler&#8221; (cf. NASB &#8220;buckler and shield&#8221;; the order is often reversed in the translation, apparently for stylistic reasons: cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV &#8220;shield and buckler&#8221;). The English term &#8220;buckler,&#8221; referring to a small round shield held on the arm to protect the upper body, is unfamiliar to many modern readers, so the term &#8220;small shield&#8221; was used in the present translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="354"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1226><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;javelin.&#8221; On the meaning of this word, which occurs only here in the Hebrew Bible, see M. Dahood, <i>Psalms </i>(AB), 1:210-11.</p>
<A NAME="355"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1227><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;draw out spear and lance to meet.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="356"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1228><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;say to me,&#8221; or &#8220;say to my soul.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="357"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1229><b>tn</b> The four prefixed verbal forms in this verse are understood as jussives. The psalmist is calling judgment down on his enemies. See also the distinct jussive form in v. 6.</p>
<A NAME="358"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1230><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal form is taken as a jussive. See v. 4.</p>
<A NAME="359"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1231><b>sn</b> See the mention of <i>the </i><span class="smallcaps">Lord</span><i>&#8217;s angel</i> in Ps 34:7.</p>
<A NAME="3510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1232><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;as the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s angel pushes [them].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1233><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal form is distinctly jussive, indicating this is a prayer.</p>
<A NAME="3512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1234><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for without cause they hid for me a pit of their net, without cause they dug for my life.&#8221; It appears that the words &#8220;pit&#8221; and &#8220;net&#8221; have been transposed. &#8220;Net&#8221; goes with the verb &#8220;hid&#8221; in the first line (see v. 8, as well as Pss 9:15; 31:4), while &#8220;pit&#8221; goes with the verb &#8220;dug&#8221; in the second line (see Ps 7:15).</p>
<A NAME="3513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1235><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;let destruction [which] he does not know come to him.&#8221; The singular is used of the enemy in v. 8, probably in a representative or collective sense. The psalmist has more than one enemy, as vv. 1-7 make clear.</p>
<A NAME="3514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1236><b>tn</b> The psalmist&#8217;s prayer for his enemies&#8217; demise continues. See vv. 4-6.</p>
<A NAME="3515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1237><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;then my soul will rejoice in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and be happy in his deliverance.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1238><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all my bones will say.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1239><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[the one who] rescues.&#8221; The substantival participle in the Hebrew text characterizes God as one who typically rescues the oppressed.</p>
<A NAME="3518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1240><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from [the one who is] too strong for him.&#8221; The singular forms are used in a representative sense. The typical oppressed individual and typical oppressor are in view.</p>
<A NAME="3519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1241><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the oppressed [one] and needy [one] from [the one who] robs him.&#8221; As in the previous line, the singular forms are used in a representative sense.</p>
<A NAME="3520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1242><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;witnesses of violence rise up.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1243><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[that] which I do not know they ask me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3522"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1244><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they repay me evil instead of good.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1245><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[there is] bereavement to my soul.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1246><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth.&#8221; Sackcloth was worn by mourners. When the psalmist&#8217;s enemies were sick, he was sorry for their misfortune and mourned for them.</p>
<A NAME="3525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1247><b>sn</b> Fasting was also a practice of mourners. By refraining from normal activities, such as <i>eating food</i>, the mourner demonstrated the sincerity of his sorrow.</p>
<A NAME="3526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1248><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and my prayer upon my chest will return.&#8221; One could translate, &#8220;but my prayer was returning upon my chest,&#8221; but the use of the imperfect verbal form sets this line apart from the preceding and following lines (vv. 13a, 14), which use the perfect to describe the psalmist&#8217;s past actions.</p>
<A NAME="3527"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1249><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;like a friend, like a brother to me I walked about.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3528"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1250><b>sn</b> <i>I bowed down</i>. Bowing down was a posture for mourning. See Ps 38:6.</p>
<A NAME="3529"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1251><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;like mourning for a mother [in] sorrow I bowed down.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3530"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1252><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they gathered together against me, stricken [ones], and I did not know.&#8221; The Hebrew form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1461;&#1499;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nekhim</font>, &#8220;stricken ones&#8221; ?) is problematic. Some suggest an emendation to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1499;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>[<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1456;</font>] (<font face="Scholar">kÿnokhÿrim</font>, &#8220;foreigners&#8221;) or &#8220;like foreigners,&#8221; which would fit with what follows, &#8220;[like] foreigners that I do not recognize.&#8221; Perhaps the form should be read as a Qal active participle, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1465;&#1499;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nokhim</font>, &#8220;ones who strike&#8221;) from the verbal root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhah</font>, &#8220;to strike&#8221;). The Qal of this verb is unattested in biblical Hebrew, but the <i>peal</i> (basic) stem appears in Old Aramaic (J. Fitzmyer, <i>The Aramaic Inscriptions of Sefire</i> [BibOr], 114; <i>DNWSI</i> 1:730.) In this case one might translate, &#8220;attackers gathered together against me though I was not aware of it&#8221; (cf. NASB &#8220;smiters&#8221;; NEB, NRSV &#8220;ruffians&#8221;; NIV &#8220;attackers&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="3531"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1253><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they tore and did not keep quiet.&#8221; By using the verb &#8220;tear,&#8221; the psalmist likens his enemies to a wild animal (see Hos 13:8). In v. 17 he compares them to hungry young lions.</p>
<A NAME="3532"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1254><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;as profane [ones] of mockers of food,&#8221; which is nonsensical.

<A NAME="3533"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1255><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;gnashing at me with their teeth.&#8221; The infinitive absolute adds a complementary action &#8211; they gnashed with their teeth as they taunted.</p>
<A NAME="3534"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1256><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;O Lord, how long will you see?&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="3537"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1259><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my only one.&#8221; The psalmist may mean that his life is precious, or that he feels isolated and alone (see Ps 22:20). The verb &#8220;guard&#8221; is supplied in the translation, because the verb &#8220;rescue&#8221; is understood by ellipsis (see the previous line).</p>
<A NAME="3538"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1260><b>sn</b> The <i>great assembly </i>is also mentioned in Ps 22:25.</p>
<A NAME="3539"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1261><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;among numerous people.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3540"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1262><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[with] a lie.&#8221; The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1511;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sheqer</font>, &#8220;lie&#8221;) is used here as an adverb, &#8220;falsely, wrongfully&#8221; (see Ps 38:19).</p>
<A NAME="3541"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1263><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;rejoice.&#8221;</p>

In the Book of Proverbs &#8220;winking an eye&#8221; is associated with deceit and trickery (see 6:13; 10:10; 16:30).</p>
<A NAME="3543"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1265><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for they do not speak peace.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3544"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1266><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;but against the quiet ones of the land words of deceit they plan.&#8221; The imperfect verbal forms in v. 20 highlight their characteristic behavior.</p>
<A NAME="3545"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1267><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they cause their mouth to be wide against me.&#8221; The prefixed verbal form with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive here carries on the generalizing mood of the previous verse. For other examples of this use of the prefixed verbal form with <i>vav</i> consecutive, see GKC 329 §111.<i>t</i>.</p>
<A NAME="3546"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1268><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;our eye sees.&#8221; Apparently this is an idiom meaning to &#8220;look in triumph&#8221; or &#8220;gloat over&#8221; (see Ps 54:7).</p>
<A NAME="3547"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1269><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you see, O <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.&#8221; There is a deliberate play on words. In v. 21 the enemies say, &#8220;our eye sees,&#8221; but the psalmist is confident that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> &#8220;sees&#8221; as well, so he appeals to him for help (see also v. 17).</p>
<A NAME="3548"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1270><b>sn</b> Though he is confident that the Lord is aware of his situation (see v. 22a), the psalmist compares the Lord&#8217;s inactivity to sleep and urges him to <i>wake up</i>.</p>
<A NAME="3549"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1271><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for my justice.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="3553"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1275><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Aha! Our desire!&#8221; The &#8220;desire&#8221; of the psalmist&#8217;s enemies is to triumph over him.</p>
<A NAME="3554"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1276><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;may they be embarrassed and ashamed together, the ones who rejoice over my harm.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3555"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=1277><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;may they be clothed with shame and humiliation, the ones who magnify [themselves] against me.&#8221; The prefixed verbal forms in v. 26 are understood as jussives (see vv. 24b-25, where the negative particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) appears before the prefixed verbal forms, indicating they are jussives). The psalmist is calling down judgment on his enemies.</p>
<A NAME="3556"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=1278><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal forms in v. 27a are understood as jussives (see vv. 24b-26).</p>
<A NAME="3557"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=1279><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal form is taken as a jussive, &#8220;may the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> be magnified [in praise].&#8221; Another option is to take the verb as an imperfect, &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is great.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3558"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=1280><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the one who desires the peace of his servant.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3559"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=1281><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and my tongue will proclaim your justice.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3560"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=1282><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all the day your praise.&#8221; The verb &#8220;proclaim&#8221; is understood by ellipsis in the second line (see the previous line).</p>
