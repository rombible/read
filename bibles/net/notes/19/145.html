<A NAME="14515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=4674><b>tc</b> Psalm 145 is an acrostic psalm, with each successive verse beginning with a successive letter of the Hebrew alphabet. However, in the traditional Hebrew (Masoretic) text of Psalm 145 there is no verse beginning with the letter <i>nun</i>. One would expect such a verse to appear as the fourteenth verse, between the <i>mem</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;</font>) and <i>samek</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;</font>) verses. Several ancient witnesses, including one medieval Hebrew manuscript, the Qumran scroll from cave 11, the LXX, and the Syriac, supply the missing <i>nun</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;</font>) verse, which reads as follows: &#8220;The Lord is reliable in all his words, and faithful in all his deeds.&#8221; One might paraphrase this as follows: &#8220;The Lord&#8217;s words are always reliable; his actions are always faithful.&#8221; Scholars are divided as to the originality of this verse. L. C. Allen argues for its inclusion on the basis of structural considerations (<i>Psalms 101-150</i> [WBC], 294-95), but there is no apparent explanation for why, if original, it would have been accidentally omitted. The psalm may be a partial acrostic, as in Pss 25 and 34 (see M. Dahood, <i>Psalms </i>[AB], 3:335). The glaring omission of the <i>nun </i>line would have invited a later redactor to add such a line.</p>
