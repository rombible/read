<A NAME="178"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=501><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you tested me, you do not find, I plan, my mouth will not cross over.&#8221; The Hebrew verbal form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1465;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zammotiy</font>) is a Qal perfect, first person singular from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zamam</font>, &#8220;plan, plan evil&#8221;). Some emend the form to a suffixed form of the noun, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zimmatiy</font>, &#8220;my plan/evil plan&#8221;), and take it as the object of the preceding verb &#8220;find.&#8221; However, the suffix seems odd, since the psalmist is denying that he has any wrong thoughts. If one takes the form with what precedes, it might make better sense to read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zimmot</font>, &#8220;evil plans&#8221;). However, this emendation leaves an unclear connection with the next line. The present translation maintains the verbal form found in the MT and understands it in a neutral sense, &#8220;I have decided&#8221; (see Jer 4:28). The words &#8220;my mouth will not cross over&#8221; (i.e., &#8220;transgress, sin&#8221;) can then be taken as a noun clause functioning as the object of the verb.</p>
