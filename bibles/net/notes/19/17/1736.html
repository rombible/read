<A NAME="1736"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=529><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and [with] your treasures you fill their belly.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>You overwhelm them with the riches they desire.</i> The psalmist is not accusing God of being unjust; he is simply observing that the wicked often prosper and that God is the ultimate source of all blessings that human beings enjoy (see Matt 5:45). When the wicked are ungrateful for God&#8217;s blessings, they become even more culpable and deserving of judgment. So this description of the wicked actually supports the psalmist&#8217;s appeal for deliverance. God should rescue him because he is innocent (see vv. 3-5) and because the wicked, though blessed abundantly by God, still have the audacity to attack God&#8217;s people.</p>
