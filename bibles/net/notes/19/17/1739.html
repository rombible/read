<A NAME="1739"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=532><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will be satisfied, when I awake, [with] your form.&#8221; The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tÿmunah</font>) normally carries the nuance &#8220;likeness&#8221; or &#8220;form.&#8221; In Job 4:16 it refers to a ghostlike spiritual entity (see v. 15) that revealed itself to Eliphaz during the night. The psalmist may anticipate a mystical encounter with God in which he expects to see a manifestation of God&#8217;s presence (i.e., a theophany), perhaps in conjunction with an oracle of deliverance. During the quiet darkness of the night, God examines the psalmist&#8217;s inner motives and finds them to be pure (see v. 3). The psalmist is confident that when he awakens, perhaps sometime during the night or in the morning, he will be visited by God and assured of vindication.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>When I awake you will reveal yourself to me</i>. Some see in this verse an allusion to resurrection. According to this view, when the psalmist awakens from the sleep of death, he will see God. It is unlikely that the psalmist had such a highly developed personal eschatology. As noted above, it is more likely that he is anticipating a divine visitation and mystical encounter as a prelude to his deliverance from his enemies.</p>
