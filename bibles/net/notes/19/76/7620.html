<A NAME="7620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2780><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the anger of men will praise you.&#8221; This could mean that men&#8217;s anger (subjective genitive), when punished by God, will bring him praise, but this interpretation does not harmonize well with the next line. The translation assumes that God&#8217;s anger is in view here (see v. 7) and that &#8220;men&#8221; is an objective genitive. God&#8217;s angry judgment against men brings him praise because it reveals his power and majesty (see vv. 1-4).</p>
