<A NAME="31"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=69><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 3</i>. The psalmist acknowledges that he is confronted by many enemies (vv. 1-2). But, alluding to a divine oracle he has received (vv. 4-5), he affirms his confidence in God&#8217;s ability to protect him (vv. 3, 6) and requests that God make his promise a reality (vv. 7-8).</p>
<A NAME="32"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=70><b>sn</b> According to Jewish tradition, David offered this prayer when he was forced to flee from Jerusalem during his son Absalom&#8217;s attempted coup (see 2 Sam 15:13-17).</p>
<A NAME="33"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=71><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mah</font>, &#8220;how&#8221;) is used here as an adverbial exclamation (see BDB 553 s.v.).</p>
<A NAME="34"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=72><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;many rise up against me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="35"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=73><b>tn</b> Heb &#8220;there is no deliverance for him in God.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="36"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=74><b>sn</b> The function of the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1462;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">selah</font>), transliterated here &#8220;<i>Selah</i>,&#8221; is uncertain. It may be a musical direction of some kind.</p>
<A NAME="37"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=75><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a shield round about me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="38"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=76><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my glory,&#8221; or &#8220;my honor.&#8221; The psalmist affirms that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is his source of honor, i.e., the one who gives him honor in the sight of others. According to BDB 459 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</font> 7, the phrase refers to God as the one to whom the psalmist gives honor. But the immediate context focuses on what God does for the psalmist, not vice-versa.</p>
<A NAME="39"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=77><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[the one who] lifts my head.&#8221; This phrase could be understood to refer to a general strengthening of the psalmist by God during difficult circumstances. However, if one takes the suggestion of the superscription that this is a Davidic psalm written during the revolt of Absalom, the phrase &#8220;lift the head&#8221; could refer to the psalmist&#8217;s desire for restoration to his former position (cf. Gen 40:13 where the same phrase is used). Like the Hebrew text, the present translation (&#8220;who restores me&#8221;) can be understood in either sense.</p>
<A NAME="310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=78><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal form could be an imperfect, yielding the translation &#8220;I cry out,&#8221; but the verb form in the next line (a <i>vav</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>] consecutive with the preterite) suggests this is a brief narrative of what has already happened. Consequently the verb form in v. 4a is better understood as a preterite, &#8220;I cried out.&#8221; (For another example of the preterite of this same verb form, see Ps 30:8.) Sometime after the crisis arose, the psalmist prayed to the Lord and received an assuring answer. Now he confidently awaits the fulfillment of the divine promise.</p>
<A NAME="311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=79><b>sn</b> <i>His holy hill</i>. That is, Zion (see Pss 2:6; 48:1-2). The psalmist recognizes that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> dwells in his sanctuary on Mount Zion.</p>
<A NAME="312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=80><b>tn</b> The three verbal forms that appear in succession here (perfect + <i>vav</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>] consecutive with preterite + perfect) are most naturally taken as narrational. When the psalmist received an assuring word from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, he was able to sleep calmly. Because the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> was protecting him, he awoke safely from his sleep.</p>
<A NAME="313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=81><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;supports&#8221;; &#8220;sustains.&#8221; In this explanatory causal clause the imperfect verbal form probably has a habitual or present progressive nuance, for the psalmist is confident of God&#8217;s continual protection (see v. 3). Another option is to take the verb as a preterite, &#8220;for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> protected me.&#8221; In this case, the psalmist focuses specifically on the protection God provided while he slept.</p>
<A NAME="314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=82><b>tn</b> The imperfect verbal form here expresses the psalmist&#8217;s continuing attitude as he faces the crisis at hand.</p>
<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=83><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;troops.&#8221; The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">am</font>) sometimes refers to a military contingent or army.</p>
<A NAME="316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=84><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;who all around take a stand against me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=85><b>tn</b> In v. 2 the psalmist describes his enemies as those who &#8220;confront&#8221; him (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> [<font face="Scholar">qamim</font>], literally, &#8220;rise up against him&#8221;). Now, using the same verbal root (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">qum</font>) he asks the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> to rise up (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">qumah</font>) in his defense.</p>
<A NAME="318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=86><b>tn</b> Elsewhere in the psalms the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>), when collocated with a perfect verbal form and subordinated to a preceding imperative directed to God, almost always has an explanatory or causal force (&#8220;for, because&#8221;) and introduces a motivating argument for why God should respond positively to the request (see Pss 5:10; 6:2; 12:1; 16:1; 41:4; 55:9; 56:1; 57:1; 60:2; 69:1; 74:20; 119:94; 123:3; 142:6; 143:8). (On three occasions the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> is recitative after a verb of perception [&#8220;see/know that,&#8221; see Pss 4:3; 25:19; 119:159]). If <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> is taken as explanatory here, then the psalmist is arguing that God should deliver him now because that is what God characteristically does. However, such a motivating argument is not used in the passages cited above. The motivating argument usually focuses on the nature of the psalmist&#8217;s dilemma or the fact that he trusts in the Lord. For this reason it is unlikely that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> has its normal force here. Most scholars understand the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> as having an asseverative (emphasizing) function here (&#8220;indeed, yes&#8221;; NEB leaves the particle untranslated).</p>
<A NAME="319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=87><b>tn</b> If the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) is taken as explanatory, then the perfect verbal forms in v. 7b would describe God&#8217;s characteristic behavior. However, as pointed out in the preceding note on the word &#8220;yes,&#8221; the particle probably has an asseverative force here. If so, the perfects may be taken as indicating rhetorically the psalmist&#8217;s certitude and confidence that God will intervene. The psalmist is so confident of God&#8217;s positive response to his prayer, he can describe God&#8217;s assault on his enemies as if it had already happened. Such confidence is consistent with the mood of the psalm, as expressed before (vv. 3-6) and after this (v. 8). Another option is to take the perfects as precative, expressing a wish or request (&#8220;Strike all my enemies on the jaw, break the teeth of the wicked&#8221;). See <i>IBHS</i> 494-95 §30.5.4c, d. However, not all grammarians are convinced that the perfect is used as a precative in biblical Hebrew.</p>
<A NAME="320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=88><b>sn</b> The expression <i>break the teeth</i> may envision violent hand-to hand combat, though it is possible that the enemies are pictured here as a dangerous animal (see Job 29:17).</p>
<A NAME="321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=89><b>tn</b> In the psalms the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rÿsha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>, &#8220;wicked&#8221;) describes people who are proud, practical atheists (Ps 10:2, 4, 11) who hate God&#8217;s commands, commit sinful deeds, speak lies and slander (Ps 50:16-20), and cheat others (Ps 37:21). They oppose God and his people.</p>
<A NAME="322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=90><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> [is] deliverance.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=91><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;upon your people [is] your blessing.&#8221; In this context God&#8217;s &#8220;blessing&#8221; includes deliverance/protection, vindication, and sustained life (see Pss 21:3, 6; 24:5).</p>
