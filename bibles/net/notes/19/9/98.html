<A NAME="98"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=263><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ga</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ar</font>) is often understood to mean &#8220;rebuke&#8221; and in this context taken to refer to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s &#8220;rebuke&#8221; of the nations. In some cases it is apparent that scolding or threatening is in view (see Gen 37:10; Ruth 2:16; Zech 3:2). However, in militaristic contexts this translation is inadequate, for the verb refers in this setting to the warrior&#8217;s battle cry, which terrifies and paralyzes the enemy. See A. Caquot, <i>TDOT</i> 3:53, and note the use of the verb in Pss 68:30; 106:9; and Nah 1:4, as well as the related noun in Job 26:11; Pss 18:15; 76:6; 104:7; Isa 50:2; 51:20; 66:15.</p>
