<A NAME="913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=268><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;it has perished, their remembrance, they.&#8221; The independent pronoun at the end of the line is in apposition to the preceding pronominal suffix and lends emphasis (see <i>IBHS</i> 299 §16.3.4). The referent of the masculine pronoun is the nations/enemies (cf. v. 5), not the cities (the Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arim</font>, &#8220;cities&#8221;] is grammatically feminine). This has been specified in the present translation for clarity; many modern translations retain the pronoun &#8220;them,&#8221; resulting in ambiguity (cf. NRSV &#8220;their cities you have rooted out; the very memory of them has perished&#8221;).</p>
