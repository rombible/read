<A NAME="91"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=256><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 9</i>. The psalmist, probably speaking on behalf of Israel or Judah, praises God for delivering him from hostile nations. He celebrates God&#8217;s sovereignty and justice, and calls on others to join him in boasting of God&#8217;s greatness. Many Hebrew <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> and the ancient Greek version (LXX) combine Psalms 9 and 10 into a single psalm.</p>
