<A NAME="942"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=297><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;forget.&#8221; &#8220;Forgetting God&#8221; refers here to worshiping false gods and thereby refusing to recognize his sovereignty (see also Deut 8:19; Judg 3:7; 1 Sam 12:9; Isa 17:10; Jer 3:21; Ps 44:20). The nations&#8217; refusal to acknowledge God&#8217;s sovereignty accounts for their brazen attempt to attack and destroy his people.</p>
