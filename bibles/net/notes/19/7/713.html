<A NAME="713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=196><b>tn</b> The vocalization of the verb form seems to be a mixture of Qal and Piel (see GKC 168 §63.<i>n</i>). The translation assumes the Piel, which would emphasize the repetitive nature of the action. The translation assumes the prefixed verbal form is a jussive. The psalmist is so certain that he is innocent of the sins mentioned in vv. 3-4, he pronounces an imprecation on himself for rhetorical effect.</p>
