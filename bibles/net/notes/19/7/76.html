<A NAME="76"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=189><b>tn</b> The verb is singular in the Hebrew text, even though &#8220;all who chase me&#8221; in v. 1 refers to a whole group of enemies. The singular is also used in vv. 4-5, but the psalmist returns to the plural in v. 6. The singular is probably collective, emphasizing the united front that the psalmist&#8217;s enemies present. This same alternation between a collective singular and a plural referring to enemies appears in Pss 9:3, 6; 13:4; 31:4, 8; 41:6, 10-11; 42:9-10; 55:3; 64:1-2; 74:3-4; 89:22-23; 106:10-11; 143:3, 6, 9.</p>
