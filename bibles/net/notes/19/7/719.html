<A NAME="719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=202><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Lift yourself up in the angry outbursts of my enemies.&#8221; Many understand the preposition prefixed to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avrot</font>, &#8220;angry outbursts&#8221;) as adversative, &#8220;against,&#8221; and the following genitive &#8220;enemies&#8221; as subjective. In this case one could translate, &#8220;rise up against my furious enemies&#8221; (cf. NIV, NRSV). The present translation, however, takes the preposition as indicating manner (cf. &#8220;in your anger&#8221; in the previous line) and understands the plural form of the noun as indicating an abstract quality (&#8220;fury&#8221;) or excessive degree (&#8220;raging fury&#8221;). Cf. Job 21:30.</p>
