<A NAME="981"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=3438><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 98</i>. The psalmist summons the whole earth to praise God because he reveals his justice and delivers Israel.</p>
<A NAME="982"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=3439><b>sn</b> A <i>new song</i> is appropriate because the Lord is constantly intervening in the world as its just king. See Ps 96:1.</p>
<A NAME="983"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3440><b>tn</b> The perfect verbal forms in vv. 1-3 are understood here as describing characteristic divine activities. Another option is to translate them as present perfects, &#8220;has performed&#8230;has accomplished deliverance, etc.&#8221; referring to completed actions that have continuing results.</p>
<A NAME="984"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=3441><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his right hand delivers for him and his holy arm.&#8221; The right hand and arm symbolize his power as a warrior-king (see Isa 52:10). His arm is &#8220;holy&#8221; in the sense that it is in a category of its own; God&#8217;s power is incomparable.</p>
<A NAME="985"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=3442><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;makes known his deliverance.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="986"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=3443><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he remembers his loyal love and his faithfulness to the house of Israel.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="987"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=3444><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the deliverance of our God,&#8221; with &#8220;God&#8221; being a subjective genitive (= God delivers).</p>
<A NAME="988"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=3445><b>tn</b> The verbal forms in v. 9 probably describe God&#8217;s typical, characteristic behavior, though they may depict in dramatic fashion the outworking of divine judgment or anticipate a future judgment of worldwide proportions (&#8220;will judge&#8230;&#8221;).</p>
