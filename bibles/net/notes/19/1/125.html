<A NAME="125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=25><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the judgment.&#8221; The article indicates a judgment that is definite in the mind of the speaker. In the immediate context this probably does not refer to the &#8220;final judgment&#8221; described in later biblical revelation, but to a temporal/historical judgment which the author anticipates. Periodically during the OT period, God would come in judgment, removing the wicked from the scene, while preserving a godly remnant (see Gen 6-9; Ps 37; Hab 3).</p>
