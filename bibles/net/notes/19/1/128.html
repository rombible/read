<A NAME="128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=28><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> knows the way of the righteous.&#8221; To &#8220;know a way&#8221; means, in its most basic sense, &#8220;to recognize/acknowledge a pathway, route, or prescribed way of life&#8221; (see Josh 3:4; Job 21:14; Ps 67:2; Isa 42:16; Jer 5:4-5). Here it could refer to the Lord recognizing the behavior of the godly and, by metonymy, rewarding their godliness with security and prosperity (resulting in the translation, &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> rewards the behavior of the godly&#8221;). The present translation takes the verb in the sense of &#8220;mark out&#8221; (cf. Job 23:10), which metonymically could mean &#8220;watch over, protect, guard.&#8221; In this case the &#8220;way of the godly&#8221; is not their behavior, but their course of life or destiny; a translation reflecting this would be &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> protects the lives of the godly&#8221; or &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> watches over the destiny of the godly&#8221; (cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV). The Hebrew active participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1461;&#1506;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yodea</font>&#8217;, &#8220;knows&#8221;) has here a characteristic durative force.</p>
