<A NAME="120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=20><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and all which he does prospers&#8221;; or &#8220;and all which he does he causes to prosper.&#8221; (The simile of the tree does not extend to this line.) It is not certain if the Hiphil verbal form (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1510;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1463;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yatsliakh</font>) is intransitive-exhibitive (&#8220;prospers&#8221;) or causative (&#8220;causes to prosper&#8221;) here. If the verb is intransitive, then <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kol</font>, &#8220;all, everything&#8221;) is the subject. If the verb is causative, then the godly individual or the Lord himself is the subject and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1500;</font> is the object. The wording is reminiscent of Josh 1:8, where the Lord tells Joshua: &#8220;This law scroll must not leave your lips! You must memorize it day and night so you can carefully obey all that is written in it. Then you will prosper (literally, &#8220;cause your way to prosper&#8221;) and be successful.&#8221;</p>
