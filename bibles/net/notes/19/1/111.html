<A NAME="111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his delight [is] in the law of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.&#8221; In light of the following line, which focuses on studying the Lord&#8217;s law, one might translate, &#8220;he finds pleasure in studying the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s commands.&#8221; However, even if one translates the line this way, it is important to recognize that mere study and intellectual awareness are not ultimately what bring divine favor. Study of the law is metonymic here for the correct attitudes and behavior that should result from an awareness of and commitment to God&#8217;s moral will; thus &#8220;obeying&#8221; has been used in the translation rather than &#8220;studying.&#8221;</p>
