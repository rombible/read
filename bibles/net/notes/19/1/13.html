<A NAME="13"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[Oh] the happiness [of] the man.&#8221; Hebrew wisdom literature often assumes and reflects the male-oriented perspective of ancient Israelite society. The principle of the psalm is certainly applicable to all people, regardless of their gender or age. To facilitate modern application, we translate the gender and age specific &#8220;man&#8221; with the more neutral &#8220;one.&#8221; (Generic &#8220;he&#8221; is employed in vv. 2-3). Since the godly man described in the psalm is representative of followers of God (note the plural form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> [<font face="Scholar">tsadiqim</font>, &#8220;righteous, godly&#8221;] in vv. 5-6), one could translate the collective singular with the plural &#8220;those&#8221; both here and in vv. 2-3, where singular pronouns and verbal forms are utilized in the Hebrew text (cf. NRSV). However, here the singular form may emphasize that godly individuals are usually outnumbered by the wicked. Retaining the singular allows the translation to retain this emphasis.</p>
