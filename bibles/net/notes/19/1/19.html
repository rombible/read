<A NAME="19"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=9><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word refers to arrogant individuals (Prov 21:24) who love conflict (Prov 22:10) and vociferously reject wisdom and correction (Prov 1:22; 9:7-8; 13:1; 15:12). To &#8220;sit in the assembly&#8221; of such people means to completely identify with them in their proud, sinful plans and behavior.</p>
