<A NAME="129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=29><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;but the way of the wicked perishes.&#8221; The &#8220;way of the wicked&#8221; may refer to their course of life (Ps 146:9; Prov 4:19; Jer 12:1) or their sinful behavior (Prov 12:26; 15:9). The Hebrew imperfect verbal form probably describes here what typically happens, though one could take the form as indicating what will happen (&#8220;will perish&#8221;).</p>
