<A NAME="124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=24><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;arise in,&#8221; but the verb is used metonymically here in the sense of &#8220;stand&#8221;; &#8220;endure,&#8221; as in 1 Sam 13:14 and Job 8:15. The negated Hebrew imperfect verbal form is here taken as indicating incapability or lack of potential, though one could understand the verb form as indicating what is typical (&#8220;do not withstand&#8221;) or what will happen (&#8220;will not withstand&#8221;).</p>
