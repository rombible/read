<A NAME="301"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1043><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 30</i>. The author thanks the Lord for delivering him from death and urges others to join him in praise. The psalmist experienced divine discipline for a brief time, but when he cried out for help the Lord intervened and restored his favor.</p>
<A NAME="302"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1044><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a song of the dedication of the house.&#8221; The referent of &#8220;house&#8221; is unclear. It is possible that David wrote this psalm for the dedication ceremony of Solomon&#8217;s temple. Another possibility is that the psalm was used on the occasion of the dedication of the second temple following the return from exile, or on the occasion of the rededication of the temple in Maccabean times.</p>
<A NAME="303"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1045><b>tn</b> Elsewhere the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dalah</font>) is used of drawing water from a well (Exod 2:16, 19; Prov 20:5). The psalmist was trapped in the pit leading to Sheol (see v. 3), but the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> hoisted him up. The Piel stem is used here, perhaps suggesting special exertion on the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s part.</p>
<A NAME="304"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1046><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;rejoice.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="305"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1047><b>sn</b> <i>You healed me</i>. Apparently the psalmist was plagued by a serious illness that threatened his life. See Ps 41.</p>
<A NAME="306"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1048><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;my life.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="307"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1049><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you kept me alive from those descending into the pit.&#8221; The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bor</font>, &#8220;pit, cistern&#8221;) is sometimes used of the grave and/or the realm of the dead. The translation follows the consonantal Hebrew text (<i>Kethib</i>); the marginal reading (<i>Qere</i>) has, &#8220;you kept me alive so that I did not go down into the pit.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="308"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1050><b>tn</b> A &#8220;faithful follower&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1505;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;</font>) is one who does what is right in God&#8217;s eyes and remains faithful to God (see Pss 4:3; 12:1; 16:10; 31:23; 37:28; 86:2; 97:10).</p>
<A NAME="309"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1051><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to his holy remembrance.&#8221; The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1461;&#1499;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zekher</font>, &#8220;remembrance&#8221;) here refers to the name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> as invoked in liturgy and praise. Cf. Pss 6:5; 97:12.The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s &#8220;name&#8221; is &#8220;holy&#8221; in the sense that it is a reminder of his uniqueness and greatness.</p>
<A NAME="3010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1052><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for [there is] a moment in his anger, [but] life in his favor.&#8221; Because of the parallelism with &#8220;moment,&#8221; some understand <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khayyim</font>) in a quantitative sense: &#8220;lifetime&#8221; (cf. NIV, NRSV). However, the immediate context, which emphasizes deliverance from death (see v. 3), suggests that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> has a qualitative sense: &#8220;physical life&#8221; or even &#8220;prosperous life&#8221; (cf. NEB &#8220;in his favour there is life&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="3011"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1053><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the evening weeping comes to lodge, but at morning a shout of joy.&#8221; &#8220;Weeping&#8221; is personified here as a traveler who lodges with one temporarily.</p>
<A NAME="3012"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1054><b>sn</b> <i>In my self-confidence I said&#8230; </i>Here the psalmist begins to fill in the background of the crisis referred to in the earlier verses. He had been arrogant and self-confident, so the Lord withdrew his protection and allowed trouble to invade his life (vv. 8-11).</p>
<A NAME="3013"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1055><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in your good favor you caused to stand for my mountain strength.&#8221; Apparently this means &#8220;you established strength for my mountain&#8221; (&#8220;mountain&#8221; in this case representing his rule, which would be centered on Mt. Zion) or &#8220;you established strength as my mountain&#8221; (&#8220;mountain&#8221; in this case being a metaphor for security).</p>
<A NAME="3014"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1056><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you hid your face.&#8221; The idiom &#8220;hide the face&#8221; can mean &#8220;ignore&#8221; (see Pss 10:11; 13:1; 51:9) or, as here, carry the stronger idea of &#8220;reject&#8221; (see Ps 88:14).</p>
<A NAME="3015"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1057><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal forms in v. 8 are probably preterites; the psalmist recalls that he prayed in his time of crisis.</p>
<A NAME="3016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1058><b>sn</b> The following two verses (vv. 9-10) contain the prayer (or an excerpt of the prayer) that the psalmist offered to the Lord during his crisis.</p>
<A NAME="3017"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1059><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;What profit [is there] in my blood?&#8221; &#8220;Blood&#8221; here represents his life.</p>
<A NAME="3018"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1060><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shakhat</font>, &#8220;pit&#8221;) is often used as a title for Sheol (see Pss 16:10; 49:9; 55:24; 103:4).</p>
<A NAME="3019"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1061><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;dust.&#8221; The words &#8220;of the grave&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarification.</p>
<A NAME="3020"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1062><b>tn</b> The rhetorical questions anticipate the answer, &#8220;Of course not!&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> According to the OT, those who descend into the realm of death/Sheol are cut off from God&#8217;s mighty deeds and from the worshiping covenant community that experiences divine intervention (Pss 6:5; 88:10-12; Isa 38:18). In his effort to elicit a positive divine response, the psalmist reminds God that he will receive no praise or glory if he allows the psalmist to die. Dead men do not praise God!</p>
<A NAME="3021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1063><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;be a helper to me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3022"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1064><b>sn</b> <i>Covered me with joy</i>. &#8220;Joy&#8221; probably stands metonymically for festive attire here.</p>
<A NAME="3023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1065><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;so that&#8221;; or &#8220;in order that.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3024"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1066><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;glory.&#8221; Some view <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1464;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khavod</font>, &#8220;glory&#8221;) here as a metonymy for man&#8217;s inner being (see BDB 459 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</font> 5), but it is preferable to emend the form to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1461;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kÿvediy</font>, &#8220;my liver&#8221;). Like the heart, the liver is viewed as the seat of one&#8217;s emotions. See also Pss 16:9; 57:9; 108:1, as well as H. W. Wolff, <i>Anthropology of the Old Testament</i>, 64, and M. Dahood, <i>Psalms </i>(AB), 1:90. For an Ugaritic example of the heart/liver as the source of joy, see G. R. Driver, <i>Canaanite Myths and Legends</i>, 47-48: &#8220;her [Anat&#8217;s] liver swelled with laughter, her heart was filled with joy, the liver of Anat with triumph.&#8221; &#8220;Heart&#8221; is used in the translation above for the sake of English idiom; the expression &#8220;my liver sings&#8221; would seem odd indeed to the modern reader.</p>
<A NAME="3025"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1067><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;forever.&#8221;</p>
