<A NAME="743"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2690><b>sn</b> The psalmist does not really believe God has <i>permanently rejected</i> his people or he would not pray as he does in this psalm. But this initial question reflects his emotional response to what he sees and is overstated for the sake of emphasis. The severity of divine judgment gives the appearance that God has permanently abandoned his people.</p>
