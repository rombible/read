<A NAME="7430"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2717><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has the plural form, &#8220;sea monsters&#8221; (cf. NRSV &#8220;dragons&#8221;), but it is likely that an original enclitic <i>mem</i> has been misunderstood as a plural ending. The imagery of the mythological sea monster is utilized here. See the note on &#8220;Leviathan&#8221; in v. 14.</p>
