<A NAME="161"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=467><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 16</i>. The psalmist seeks divine protection because he has remained loyal to God. He praises God for his rich blessings, and is confident God will vindicate him and deliver him from death.</p>
<A NAME="162"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=468><b>tn</b> The precise meaning of the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mikhtam</font>) is uncertain. <i>HALOT</i> 582-83 s.v. defines it as &#8220;inscription.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="163"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=469><b>tn</b> The Hebrew perfect verbal form probably refers here to a completed action with continuing results (see 7:1; 11:1).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Taken shelter</i>. &#8220;Taking shelter&#8221; in the Lord is an idiom for seeking his protection. Seeking his protection presupposes and even demonstrates the subject&#8217;s loyalty to the Lord. In the psalms those who &#8220;take shelter&#8221; in the Lord are contrasted with the wicked and equated with those who love, fear and serve the Lord (Pss 5:11-12; 31:17-20; 34:21-22).</p>
<A NAME="164"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=470><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my good [is] not beyond you.&#8221; For the use of the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) in the sense of &#8220;beyond,&#8221; see BDB 755 s.v. 2.</p>
<A NAME="165"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=471><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;regarding the holy ones who [are] in the land, they; and the mighty [ones] in [whom is/was] all my desire.&#8221; The difficult syntax makes the meaning of the verse uncertain. The phrase &#8220;holy ones&#8221; sometimes refers to God&#8217;s angelic assembly (see Ps 89:5, 7), but the qualifying clause &#8220;who are in the land&#8221; suggests that here it refers to God&#8217;s people (Ps 34:9) or to their priestly leaders (2 Chr 35:3).</p>
<A NAME="166"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=472><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;their troubles multiply, another, they pay a dowry.&#8221; The meaning of the text is unclear. The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">atsÿvotam</font>, &#8220;troubles&#8221;) appears to be a plural form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">atsÿvet</font>, &#8220;pain, wound&#8221;; see Job 9:28; Ps 147:3). Because idolatry appears to be in view (see v. 4b), some prefer to emend the noun to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">atsÿvim</font>, &#8220;idols&#8221;). &#8220;Troubles&#8221; may be a wordplay on &#8220;idols&#8221; or a later alteration designed to emphasize that idolatry leads to trouble. The singular form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;</font> (&#8220;another&#8221;) is syntactically problematic here. Perhaps the form should be emended to a plural <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1495;&#1461;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akherim</font>, &#8220;others&#8221;). (The final <i>mem</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1501;</font>] could have been lost by haplography; note the <i>mem</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;</font>] at the beginning of the next word.) In this case it might be taken as an abbreviated form of the well-attested phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1458;&#1495;&#1461;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohim </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akherim</font>, &#8220;other gods&#8221;). (In Isa 42:8 the singular form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akher</font>, &#8220;another&#8221;) is used of another god.) The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mahar</font>) appears in the Qal stem; the only other use of a Qal verbal form of a root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;&#1463;&#1512;</font> is in Exod 22:15, where the denominative verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mahor</font>, &#8220;purchase [a wife]&#8221;) appears; cf. the related noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1465;&#1492;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mohar</font>, &#8220;bride money, purchase price for a wife&#8221;). If that verb is understood here, then the idolaters are pictured as eager bridegrooms paying the price to acquire the object of their desire. Another option is to emend the verb to a Piel and translate, &#8220;hurry (after).&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="167"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=473><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will not pour out their drink offerings of blood.&#8221; The third masculine plural suffix would appear to refer back to the people/leaders mentioned in v. 3. However, if we emend <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1495;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akher</font>, &#8220;another&#8221;) to the plural <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1495;&#1461;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akherim</font>, &#8220;other [gods]&#8221;) in v. 4, the suffix can be understood as referring to these gods &#8211; &#8220;the drink offerings [made to] them.&#8221; The next line favors this interpretation. Perhaps this refers to some type of pagan cultic ritual. Elsewhere wine is the prescribed content of drink offerings.</p>
<A NAME="168"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=474><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and I will not lift up their names upon my lips.&#8221; The expression &#8220;lift up the name&#8221; probably refers here to swearing an oath in the name of deity (see Exod 20:7; Deut 5:11). If so, the third masculine plural suffix on &#8220;names&#8221; likely refers to the pagan gods, not the people/leaders. See the preceding note.</p>
<A NAME="169"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=475><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;O <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the portion of my possession and my cup&#8221;; or &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> [is] the portion of my possession and my cup.&#8221; The psalmist compares the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> to landed property, which was foundational to economic stability in ancient Israel, and to a cup of wine, which may symbolize a reward (in Ps 11:6 it symbolizes the judgment one deserves) or divine blessing (see Ps 23:5). The metaphor highlights the fact that God is the psalmist&#8217;s source of security and prosperity.</p>
<A NAME="1610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=476><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you take hold of my lot.&#8221; The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tomikh</font>) should be emended to a participle, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;&#1502;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tomekh</font>). The psalmist pictures the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> as casting his lot (a method used to allot landed property) for him, thus assuring that he will receive a fertile piece of land (see v. 6). As in the previous line, land represents security and economic stability, thus &#8220;you make my future secure.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=477><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;measuring lines have fallen for me in pleasant [places]; yes, property [or &#8220;an inheritance&#8221;] is beautiful for me.&#8221; On the dative use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font>, see BDB 758 s.v. II.8. Extending the metaphor used in v. 5, the psalmist compares the divine blessings he has received to a rich, beautiful tract of land that one might receive by allotment or inheritance.</p>
<A NAME="1612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=478><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;bless,&#8221; that is, &#8220;proclaim as worthy of praise.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=479><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;because.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=480><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;counsels, advises.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=481><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;yes, [during] nights my kidneys instruct [or &#8220;correct&#8221;] me.&#8221; The &#8220;kidneys&#8221; are viewed here as the seat of the psalmist&#8217;s moral character (see Ps 26:2). In the quiet darkness the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> speaks to his inner being, as it were, and enables him to grow in moral understanding.</p>
<A NAME="1616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=482><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I set the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> before me continually.&#8221; This may mean that the psalmist is aware of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s presence and sensitive to his moral guidance (see v. 7), or that he trusts in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s protection (see the following line).</p>
<A NAME="1617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=483><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my glory is happy.&#8221; Some view the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kÿvodiy</font>, &#8220;my glory&#8221;) as a metonymy for man&#8217;s inner being (see BDB 459 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</font> 5), but it is preferable to emend the form to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1461;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kÿvediy</font>, &#8220;my liver&#8221;). Like the heart, the liver is viewed as the seat of one&#8217;s emotions. See also Pss 30:12; 57:9; 108:1, as well as H. W. Wolff, <i>Anthropology of the Old Testament</i>, 64, and M. Dahood, <i>Psalms </i>(AB), 1:90. For an Ugaritic example of the heart/liver as the source of joy, see G. R. Driver, <i>Canaanite Myths and Legends</i>, 47-48: &#8220;her [Anat&#8217;s] liver swelled with laughter, her heart was filled with joy, the liver of Anat with triumph.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=484><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;yes, my flesh dwells securely.&#8221; The psalmist&#8217;s &#8220;flesh&#8221; stands by metonymy for his body and, by extension, his physical life.</p>
<A NAME="1619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=485><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;my life.&#8221; The suffixed form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>, &#8220;being&#8221;) is often equivalent to a pronoun in poetic texts.</p>
<A NAME="1620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=486><b>sn</b> In ancient Israelite cosmology <i>Sheol</i> is the realm of the dead, viewed as being under the earth&#8217;s surface. See L. I. J. Stadelmann, <i>The Hebrew Conception of the World</i>, 165-76.</p>
<A NAME="1621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=487><b>tn</b> A &#8220;faithful follower&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1505;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;</font> [<font face="Scholar">khasid</font>], traditionally rendered &#8220;holy one&#8221;) is one who does what is right in God&#8217;s eyes and remains faithful to God (see Pss 4:3; 12:1; 18:25; 31:23; 37:28; 86:2; 97:10). The psalmist here refers to himself, as the parallel line (&#8220;You will not abandon me to Sheol&#8221;) indicates.</p>
<A NAME="1622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=488><b>tn</b> That is, &#8220;experience.&#8221; The psalmist is confident that the Lord will protect him in his present crisis (see v. 1) and prevent him from dying.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> According to Peter, the words of Ps 16:8-11 are applicable to Jesus (Acts 2:25-29). Peter goes on to argue that David, being a prophet, foresaw future events and spoke of Jesus&#8217; resurrection from the dead (Acts 2:30-33). Paul seems to concur with Peter in this understanding (see Acts 13:35-37). For a discussion of the NT application of these verses to Jesus&#8217; resurrection, see R. B. Chisholm, Jr., &#8220;A Theology of the Psalms,&#8221; <i>A Biblical Theology of the Old Testament</i>, 292-95.</p>
<A NAME="1623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=489><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shakhat</font>, &#8220;pit&#8221;) is often used as a title for Sheol (see Pss 30:9; 49:9; 55:24; 103:4). Note the parallelism with the previous line.</p>
<A NAME="1624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=490><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;cause me to know&#8221;; or &#8220;cause me to experience.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1625"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=491><b>tn</b> This is a metaphorical way of saying, &#8220;you preserve my life.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;path of life&#8221; stands in contrast to death/Sheol in Prov 2:18-19; 5:5-6; 15:24.</p>
<A NAME="1626"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=492><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;abundance of joy [is] with your face.&#8221; The plural form of the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">simkhah</font>, &#8220;joy&#8221;) occurs only here and in Ps 45:15. It may emphasize the degree of joy experienced.</p>
<A NAME="1627"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=493><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;delight [is] in your right hand forever.&#8221; The plural form of the adjective <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">na</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>, &#8220;pleasant, delightful&#8221;) may here emphasize the degree of delight experienced (see Job 36:11).</p>
