<A NAME="14426"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=4650><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;grown up in their youth.&#8221; The translation assumes that &#8220;grown up&#8221; modifies &#8220;plants&#8221; (just as &#8220;carved&#8221; modifies &#8220;corner pillars&#8221; in the second half of the verse). Another option is to take &#8220;grown up&#8221; as a predicate in relation to &#8220;our sons,&#8221; in which case one might translate, &#8220;they will be strapping youths.&#8221;</p>
