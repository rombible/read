<A NAME="14420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=4644><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;who [with] their mouth speak falsehood, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.&#8221; The reference to the &#8220;right hand&#8221; is probably a metonymy for an oath. When making an oath, one would raise the hand as a solemn gesture. See Exod 6:8; Num 14:30; Deut 32:40. The figure thus represents the making of false oaths (false promises).</p>
