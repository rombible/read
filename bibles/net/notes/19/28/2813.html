<A NAME="2813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=998><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;or the work of his hands.&#8221; In this context &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s actions&#8221; and &#8220;the work of his hands&#8221; probably refer to the way he carries out justice by vindicating the godly and punishing the wicked. (Note the final line of the verse, which refers to divine judgment. See also Ps 92:4-7.) Evil men do not &#8220;understand&#8221; God&#8217;s just ways; they fail to realize he will protect the innocent. Consequently they seek to harm the godly, as if they believe they will never be held accountable for their actions.</p>
