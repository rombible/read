<A NAME="138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=421><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Give light [to] my eyes.&#8221; The Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ur</font>), when used elsewhere with &#8220;eyes&#8221; as object, refers to the law of God giving moral enlightenment (Ps 19:8), to God the creator giving literal eyesight to all people (Prov 29:13), and to God giving encouragement to his people (Ezra 9:8). Here the psalmist pictures himself as being on the verge of death. His eyes are falling shut and, if God does not intervene soon, he will &#8220;fall asleep&#8221; for good.</p>
