<A NAME="1091"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=3808><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 109</i>. Appealing to God&#8217;s justice, the psalmist asks God to vindicate him and to bring severe judgment down upon his enemies.</p>
<A NAME="1092"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=3809><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;do not be deaf.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1093"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3810><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for a mouth of evil and a mouth of deceit against me they open, they speak with me [with] a tongue of falsehood.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1094"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=3811><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and [with] words of hatred they surround me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1095"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=3812><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in place of my love they oppose me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1096"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=3813><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and I, prayer.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1097"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=3814><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they set upon me evil in place of good.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1098"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=3815><b>sn</b> In vv. 6-19 the psalmist calls on God to judge his enemies severely. Some attribute this curse-list to the psalmist&#8217;s enemies rather than the psalmist. In this case one should paraphrase v. 6: &#8220;They say about me, &#8216;Appoint an evil man, etc.&#8217;&#8221; Those supporting this line of interpretation point out that vv. 2-5 and 20 refer to the enemies&#8217; attack on the psalmist being a verbal one. Furthermore in vv. 1-5, 20 the psalmist speaks of his enemies in the plural, while vv. 6-19 refer to an individual. This use of the singular in vv. 6-19 could be readily explained if this is the psalmist&#8217;s enemies&#8217; curse on him. However, it is much more natural to understand vv. 6-19 as the psalmist&#8217;s prayer against his enemies. There is no introductory quotation formula in v. 6 to indicate that the psalmist is quoting anyone, and the statement &#8220;may the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> repay my accusers in this way&#8221; in v. 20 most naturally appears to be a fitting conclusion to the prayer in vv. 6-19. But what about the use of the singular in vv. 6-19? Often in the psalms the psalmist will describe his enemies as a group, but then speak of them as an individual as well, as if viewing his adversaries collectively as one powerful foe. See, for example, Ps 7, where the psalmist uses both the plural (vv. 1, 6) and the singular (vv. 2, 4-5) in referring to enemies. Perhaps by using the singular in such cases, the psalmist wants to single out each enemy for individual attention, or perhaps he has one especially hostile enemy in mind who epitomizes the opposition of the whole group. This may well be the case in Ps 109. Perhaps we should understand the singular throughout vv. 6-19 in the sense of &#8220;each and every one.&#8221; For a lengthy and well-reasoned defense of the opposite view &#8211; that vv. 6-19 are a quotation of what the enemies said about the psalmist &#8211; see L. C. Allen, <i>Psalms 101-150 </i>(WBC), 72-73.</p>
<A NAME="1099"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=3816><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;appoint against him an evil [man].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="10910"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=3817><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal form is taken as a jussive here (note the imperative in the preceding line).</p>
<A NAME="10911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=3818><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal form could be taken as a jussive, but the use of the imperfect form in the following line suggests that v. 7 anticipates the outcome of the accusation envisioned in v. 6.</p>
<A NAME="10912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=3819><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he will go out [as] a criminal&#8221; (that is, guilty).</p>
<A NAME="10913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=3820><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal forms (except those with <i>vav</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>] consecutive) in vv. 8-20 are taken as jussives of prayer. Note the distinct jussive forms used in vv. 12-13, 15, 19.</p>
<A NAME="10914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=3821><b>tn</b> The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1511;&#1467;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pÿquddah</font>) can mean &#8220;charge&#8221; or &#8220;office,&#8221; though BDB 824 s.v. suggests that here it refers to his possessions.</p>
<A NAME="10915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=3822><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;sons.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="10921"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=3828><b>tn</b> Perhaps this refers to being generous (see Ps 37:21).</p>
<A NAME="10922"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=3829><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;offspring.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="10923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=3830><b>sn</b> On the expression <i>cut off</i> see Ps 37:28.</p>
<A NAME="10924"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=3831><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in another generation may their name be wiped out.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="10925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=3832><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;fathers&#8217; sins.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="10926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=3833><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;not be wiped out.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> According to ancient Israelite theology and its doctrine of corporate solidarity and responsibility, children could be and often were punished for the sins of their parents. For a discussion of this issue see J. Kaminsky, <i>Corporate Responsibility in the Hebrew Bible </i>(JSOTSup). (Kaminsky, however, does not deal with Ps 109.)</p>
<A NAME="10927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=3834><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;may they [that is, the sins mentioned in v. 14] be before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> continually.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="10928"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=3835><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;their memory.&#8221; The plural pronominal suffix probably refers back to the children mentioned in v. 13, and for clarity this has been specified in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="10929"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=3836><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he did not remember to do loyal love.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="10930"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=3837><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he chased an oppressed and needy man, and one timid of heart to put [him] to death.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="10931"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=3838><b>sn</b> A <i>curse</i> in OT times consists of a formal appeal to God to bring judgment down upon another. Curses were sometimes justified (such as the one spoken by the psalmist here in vv. 6-19), but when they were not, the one pronouncing the curse was in danger of bringing the anticipated judgment down upon himself.</p>
<A NAME="10932"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=3839><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he loved a curse and it came [upon] him.&#8221; A reference to the evil man experiencing a curse seems premature here, for the psalmist is asking God to bring judgment on his enemies. For this reason some (cf. NIV, NRSV) prefer to repoint the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) on &#8220;it came&#8221; as conjunctive and translate the verb as a jussive of prayer (&#8220;may it come upon him!&#8221;). The prefixed form with <i>vav</i> consecutive in the next line is emended in the same way and translated, &#8220;may it be far from him.&#8221; However, the psalmist may be indicating that the evil man&#8217;s lifestyle has already begun to yield its destructive fruit.</p>
<A NAME="10933"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=3840><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he did not delight in a blessing and it is far from him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="10934"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=3841><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he put on a curse as [if it were] his garment.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="10935"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=3842><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and it came like water into his inner being, and like oil into his bones.&#8221; This may refer to this individual&#8217;s appetite for cursing. For him cursing was as refreshing as drinking water or massaging oneself with oil. Another option is that the destructive effects of a curse are in view. In this case a destructive curse invades his very being, like water or oil. Some who interpret the verse this way prefer to repoint the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) on &#8220;it came&#8221; to a conjunctive <i>vav</i> and interpret the prefixed verb as a jussive, &#8220;may it come!&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="10936"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=3843><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;may it be for him like a garment one puts on.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="10937"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=3844><b>tn</b> The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1494;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mezakh</font>, &#8220;belt; waistband&#8221;) occurs only here in the OT. The form apparently occurs in Isa 23:10 as well, but an emendation is necessary there.</p>
<A NAME="10938"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=3845><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[may] this [be] the repayment to my accusers from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="10939"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=3846><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;against.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="10940"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=3847><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>, &#8220;being; soul&#8221;) with a pronominal suffix is often equivalent to a pronoun, especially in poetry (see BDB 660 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> 4.a).</p>
<A NAME="10941"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=3848><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;but you, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, Master, do with me for the sake of your name.&#8221; Here &#8220;name&#8221; stands metonymically for God&#8217;s reputation.</p>
<A NAME="10942"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=3849><b>tc</b> The verb in the Hebrew text (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khalal</font>) appears to be a Qal form from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1500;&#1500;</font> meaning &#8220;pierced; wounded.&#8221; However, the Qal of this root is otherwise unattested. The translation assumes an emendation to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yakhil</font>), a Qal imperfect from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khul</font>, &#8220;tremble&#8221;) or to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kholal</font>), a <i>polal</i> perfect from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khul</font>). See Ps 55:4, which reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497; &#1497;&#1464;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">libbiy yakhil bÿqirbbiy</font>, &#8220;my heart trembles [i.e., &#8220;beats violently&#8221;] within me&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="10943"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=3850><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;like a shadow when it is extended I go.&#8221; He is like a late afternoon shadow made by the descending sun that will soon be swallowed up by complete darkness. See Ps 102:11.</p>
<A NAME="10944"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=3851><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my knees stagger from fasting.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="10945"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=3852><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and my flesh is lean away from fatness [i.e., &#8220;lean so as not to be fat&#8221;].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="10946"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=3853><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;as for me, I am a reproach to them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="10947"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=3854><b>sn</b> <i>They shake their heads</i>. Apparently shaking the head was a taunting gesture. See also Job 16:4; Ps 22:7; Lam 2:15.</p>
<A NAME="10948"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=3855><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;deliver me according to your faithfulness.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="10949"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=3856><b>tn</b> After the preceding imperative, the prefixed verbal form with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) conjunctive indicates purpose or result.</p>
<A NAME="10950"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=3857><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;that your hand [is] this.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="10951"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=3858><b>tn</b> Another option is to translate the imperfect as a prayer/request (&#8220;may you bless&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="10952"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=3859><b>tn</b> The verbal sequence is perfect + prefixed form with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive. Since the psalmist seems to be anticipating the demise of his enemies, he may be using these forms rhetorically to describe the enemies&#8217; defeat as if it were already accomplished. Some emend the text to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; &#1497;&#1461;&#1489;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qamu yevoshu</font>, &#8220;may those who attack me be humiliated&#8221;). See L. C. Allen, <i>Psalms 101-150 </i>(WBC), 75.</p>
<A NAME="10953"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=3860><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;clothed.&#8221; Another option is to translate the prefixed verbal forms in this line and the next as jussives (&#8220;may my accusers be covered with shame&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="10954"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=3861><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will thank the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> very much with my mouth.&#8221;</p>
