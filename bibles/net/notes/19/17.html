<A NAME="171"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=494><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 17</i>. The psalmist asks God to intervene on his behalf because his life is threatened by dangerous enemies. He appeals to divine justice, for he is certain of his own innocence. Because he is innocent, he expects to encounter God and receive an assuring word.</p>
<A NAME="172"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=495><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;hear, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, what is just.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="173"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=496><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Listen to my prayer, [made] without lips of deceit.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="174"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=497><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;From before you may my justice come out.&#8221; The prefixed verbal form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatsa</font>&#8217;) could be taken as an imperfect, but following the imperatives in v. 1, it is better understood as a jussive of prayer.</p>
<A NAME="175"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=498><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;May your eyes look at what is right.&#8221; The prefixed verbal form is understood as jussive. (See also the preceding note on the word &#8220;behalf.&#8221;)</p>
<A NAME="176"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=499><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you tested my heart.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="177"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=500><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you visited [at] night.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="178"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=501><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you tested me, you do not find, I plan, my mouth will not cross over.&#8221; The Hebrew verbal form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1465;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zammotiy</font>) is a Qal perfect, first person singular from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zamam</font>, &#8220;plan, plan evil&#8221;). Some emend the form to a suffixed form of the noun, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zimmatiy</font>, &#8220;my plan/evil plan&#8221;), and take it as the object of the preceding verb &#8220;find.&#8221; However, the suffix seems odd, since the psalmist is denying that he has any wrong thoughts. If one takes the form with what precedes, it might make better sense to read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zimmot</font>, &#8220;evil plans&#8221;). However, this emendation leaves an unclear connection with the next line. The present translation maintains the verbal form found in the MT and understands it in a neutral sense, &#8220;I have decided&#8221; (see Jer 4:28). The words &#8220;my mouth will not cross over&#8221; (i.e., &#8220;transgress, sin&#8221;) can then be taken as a noun clause functioning as the object of the verb.</p>
<A NAME="179"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=502><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;with regard to the deeds of man[kind].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=503><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;by the word of your lips, I, I have watched the paths of the violent&#8221; (i.e., &#8220;watched&#8221; in the sense of &#8220;watched for the purpose of avoiding&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=504><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my steps stay firm in your tracks.&#8221; The infinitive absolute functions here as a finite verb (see GKC 347 §113.<i>gg</i>). God&#8217;s &#8220;tracks&#8221; are his commands, i.e., the moral pathways he has prescribed for the psalmist.</p>
<A NAME="1712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=505><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my footsteps do not stagger.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=506><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Turn your ear toward me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=507><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my word.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=508><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Set apart faithful acts.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=509><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[O] one who delivers those who seek shelter from the ones raising themselves up, by your right hand.&#8221; The Lord&#8217;s &#8220;right hand&#8221; here symbolizes his power to protect and deliver.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Those who look to you for protection from their enemies</i>. &#8220;Seeking shelter&#8221; in the Lord is an idiom for seeking his protection. Seeking his protection presupposes and even demonstrates the subject&#8217;s loyalty to the Lord. In the psalms those who &#8220;take shelter&#8221; in the Lord are contrasted with the wicked and equated with those who love, fear and serve the Lord (Pss 5:11-12; 31:17-20; 34:21-22).</p>
<A NAME="1717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=510><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Protect me like the pupil, a daughter of an eye.&#8221; The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bat</font>, &#8220;daughter&#8221;) should probably be emended to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bavat</font>, &#8220;pupil&#8221;). See Zech 2:12 HT (2:8 ET) and <i>HALOT</i> 107 s.v. *<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font>.</p>
<A NAME="1718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=511><b>sn</b> <i>Your wings</i>. The metaphor compares God to a protective mother bird.</p>
<A NAME="1719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=512><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from before&#8221;; or &#8220;because.&#8221; In the Hebrew text v. 9 is subordinated to v. 8. The words &#8220;protect me&#8221; are supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="1720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=513><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;destroy.&#8221; The psalmist uses the perfect verbal form to emphasize the degree of danger. He describes the wicked as being already in the process of destroying him.</p>
<A NAME="1721"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=514><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my enemies, at the risk of life they surround me.&#8221; The Hebrew phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿnefesh</font>) sometimes has the nuance &#8220;at the risk of [one&#8217;s] life&#8221; (see 1 Kgs 2:23; Prov 7:23; Lam 5:9).</p>
<A NAME="1722"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=515><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;their fat they close.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1461;&#1500;&#1462;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khelev</font>, &#8220;fat&#8221;) appears to stand by metonymy for their calloused hearts. They attack the psalmist without feeling any pity or remorse. Some propose emending the text to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1461;&#1500;&#1462;&#1489; &#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khelev libbamo</font>, &#8220;fat of their heart[s]; cf. Ps 119:70, &#8220;their heart is insensitive like fat&#8221;). This assumes haplography of the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lamed-bet</font>) consonantal sequence.</p>
<A NAME="1723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=516><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[with] their mouth they speak with arrogance.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=517><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;our steps, now they surround me.&#8221; The <i>Kethib</i> (consonantal text) has &#8220;surround me,&#8221; while the <i>Qere</i> (marginal reading) has &#8220;surround us,&#8221; harmonizing the pronoun to the preceding &#8220;our steps.&#8221; The first person plural pronoun does not fit the context, where the psalmist speaks as an individual. In the preceding verses the psalmist uses a first person singular verbal or pronominal form twenty times. For this reason it is preferable to emend &#8220;our steps&#8221; to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ishÿruni</font>, &#8220;they attack me&#8221;) from the verbal root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ashur</font>, &#8220;march, stride, track&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=518><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;their eyes they set to bend down in the ground.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1726"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=519><b>tn</b> Here the psalmist switches to the singular pronoun; he views his enemies collectively, or singles out a representative of the group, perhaps its leader.</p>
<A NAME="1727"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=520><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his likeness [is] like a lion.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=522><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sitting.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1730"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=523><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Be in front of his face.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1731"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=524><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;bring him to his knees.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1733"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=526><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from men [by] your hand, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.&#8221; The translation assumes an emendation (both here and in the following line) of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mimtim</font>, &#8220;from men&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mimmitim</font>, &#8220;from those who kill&#8221;). For other uses of the plural form of the Hiphil participle of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mut</font>, &#8220;die&#8221;), see 2 Kgs 17:26 (used with lions as subject), Job 33:22 (apparently referring to the agents of death), and Jer 26:15 (used of those seeking Jeremiah&#8217;s life).</p>
<A NAME="1734"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=527><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from men, from [the] world.&#8221; On the emendation of &#8220;men&#8221; to &#8220;murderers,&#8221; see the preceding note on the word &#8220;murderers.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1735"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=528><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;their portion, in life.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1736"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=529><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and [with] your treasures you fill their belly.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>You overwhelm them with the riches they desire.</i> The psalmist is not accusing God of being unjust; he is simply observing that the wicked often prosper and that God is the ultimate source of all blessings that human beings enjoy (see Matt 5:45). When the wicked are ungrateful for God&#8217;s blessings, they become even more culpable and deserving of judgment. So this description of the wicked actually supports the psalmist&#8217;s appeal for deliverance. God should rescue him because he is innocent (see vv. 3-5) and because the wicked, though blessed abundantly by God, still have the audacity to attack God&#8217;s people.</p>
<A NAME="1737"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=530><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they are satisfied [with] sons and leave their abundance to their children.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1738"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=531><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I, in innocence, I will see your face.&#8221; To &#8220;see&#8221; God&#8217;s &#8220;face&#8221; means to have access to his presence and to experience his favor (see Ps 11:7; see also Job 33:26 [where <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>), not <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khazah</font>), is used]). Here, however, the psalmist may be anticipating a mystical experience. See the following note on the word &#8220;me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1739"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=532><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will be satisfied, when I awake, [with] your form.&#8221; The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tÿmunah</font>) normally carries the nuance &#8220;likeness&#8221; or &#8220;form.&#8221; In Job 4:16 it refers to a ghostlike spiritual entity (see v. 15) that revealed itself to Eliphaz during the night. The psalmist may anticipate a mystical encounter with God in which he expects to see a manifestation of God&#8217;s presence (i.e., a theophany), perhaps in conjunction with an oracle of deliverance. During the quiet darkness of the night, God examines the psalmist&#8217;s inner motives and finds them to be pure (see v. 3). The psalmist is confident that when he awakens, perhaps sometime during the night or in the morning, he will be visited by God and assured of vindication.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>When I awake you will reveal yourself to me</i>. Some see in this verse an allusion to resurrection. According to this view, when the psalmist awakens from the sleep of death, he will see God. It is unlikely that the psalmist had such a highly developed personal eschatology. As noted above, it is more likely that he is anticipating a divine visitation and mystical encounter as a prelude to his deliverance from his enemies.</p>
