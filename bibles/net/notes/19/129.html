<A NAME="1291"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=4361><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 129</i>. Israel affirms God&#8217;s justice and asks him to destroy the enemies of Zion.</p>
<A NAME="1292"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=4362><b>sn</b> The precise significance of this title, which appears in Pss 120-134, is unclear. Perhaps worshipers recited these psalms when they ascended the road to Jerusalem to celebrate annual religious festivals. For a discussion of their background see L. C. Allen, <i>Psalms 101-150 </i>(WBC), 219-21.</p>
<A NAME="1293"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=4363><b>tn</b> The background of the metaphor is not entirely clear. Perhaps the &#8220;ropes&#8221; are those used to harness the ox for plowing (see Job 39:10). Verse 3 pictures the wicked plowing God&#8217;s people as if they were a field. But when God &#8220;cut the ropes&#8221; of their ox, as it were, they could no longer plow. The point of the metaphor seems to be that God took away the enemies&#8217; ability to oppress his people. See L. C. Allen, <i>Psalms 101-150 </i>(WBC), 187.</p>
<A NAME="1294"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4364><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shalaf</font>) normally means &#8220;to draw [a sword]&#8221; or &#8220;to pull.&#8221; BDB 1025 s.v. suggests the meaning &#8220;to shoot up&#8221; here, but it is more likely that the verb here means &#8220;to pluck; to pull up,&#8221; a nuance attested for this word in later Hebrew and Aramaic (see Jastrow 1587 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1507;</font>).</p>
<A NAME="1295"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=4365><b>tn</b> The perfect verbal form is used for rhetorical effect; it describes an anticipated development as if it were already reality.</p>
