<A NAME="51"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=114><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 5</i>. Appealing to God&#8217;s justice and commitment to the godly, the psalmist asks the Lord to intervene and deliver him from evildoers.</p>
<A NAME="52"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=115><b>tn</b> The meaning of the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nÿkhilot</font>), which occurs only here, is uncertain. Many relate the form to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khalil</font>, &#8220;flute&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="53"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=116><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my words.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="54"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=117><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;sighing.&#8221; The word occurs only here and in Ps 39:3.</p>
<A NAME="55"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=118><b>sn</b> <i>In the morning</i> is here viewed as the time of prayer (Pss 59:16; 88:13) and/or of deliverance (Ps 30:5).</p>
<A NAME="56"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=119><b>tn</b> The imperfect is here understood in a specific future sense; the psalmist is expressing his confidence that God will be willing to hear his request. Another option is to understand the imperfect as expressing the psalmist&#8217;s wish or request. In this case one could translate, &#8220;<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, in the morning hear me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="57"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=120><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my voice.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="58"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=121><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will arrange for you.&#8221; Some understand a sacrifice or offering as the implied object (cf. NEB &#8220;I set out my morning sacrifice&#8221;). The present translation assumes that the implied object is the psalmist&#8217;s case/request. See Isa 44:7.</p>
<A NAME="59"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=122><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and I will watch.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=123><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;for.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=124><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;not a God [who] delights [in] wickedness [are] you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=125><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has simply the singular form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1506;</font>, which may be taken as an abstract noun &#8220;evil&#8221; (the reference to &#8220;wickedness&#8221; in the preceding line favors this; cf. NEB, NASB, NRSV) or as a substantival adjective &#8220;evil one&#8221; (the references to evil people in the next two verses favor this; cf. NIV &#8220;with you the wicked cannot dwell&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=126><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;cannot dwell as a resident alien [with] you.&#8221; The negated imperfect verbal form here indicates incapability or lack of permission. These people are morally incapable of dwelling in God&#8217;s presence and are not permitted to do so.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Only the godly are allowed to dwell with the Lord. <i>Evil people</i> are excluded. See Ps 15.</p>
<A NAME="514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=127><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;before your eyes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=128><b>sn</b> <i>You hate</i>. The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> &#8220;hates&#8221; the wicked in the sense that he despises their wicked character and deeds and actively opposes and judges them for their wickedness. See Ps 11:5.</p>
<A NAME="516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=129><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all the workers of wickedness.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=130><b>tn</b> The imperfect verbal form indicates God&#8217;s typical response to such individuals. Another option is to translate the verb as future (&#8220;You will destroy&#8221;); the psalmist may be envisioning a time of judgment when God will remove the wicked from the scene.</p>
<A NAME="518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=131><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;those who speak a lie.&#8221; In the OT a &#8220;lie&#8221; does not refer in a general philosophical sense to any statement that fails to correspond to reality. Instead it refers more specifically to a slanderous and/or deceitful statement that promotes one&#8217;s own selfish, sinful interests and/or exploits or harms those who are innocent. Note the emphasis on violence and deceit in the following line.</p>
<A NAME="519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=132><b>tn</b> The imperfect verbal form highlights the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s characteristic attitude toward such individuals.</p>
<A NAME="520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=133><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a man of bloodshed and deceit.&#8221; The singular <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ish</font>, &#8220;man&#8221;) is used here in a collective or representative sense; thus the translation &#8220;people&#8221; is appropriate here. Note the plural forms in vv. 5-6a.</p>
<A NAME="521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=134><b>sn</b> <i>But as for me</i>. By placing the first person pronoun at the beginning of the verse, the psalmist highlights the contrast between the evildoers&#8217; actions and destiny, outlined in the preceding verses, with his own.</p>
<A NAME="522"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=135><b>sn</b> <i>I will enter your house</i>. The psalmist is confident that God will accept him into his presence, in contrast to the evildoers (see v. 5).</p>
<A NAME="523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=136><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in fear [of] you.&#8221; The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yir</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>, &#8220;fear&#8221;), when used of fearing God, is sometimes used metonymically for what it ideally produces: &#8220;worship, reverence, piety.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=137><b>tn</b> God&#8217;s providential leading is in view. His <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsÿdaqah</font>, &#8220;righteousness&#8221;) includes here the deliverance that originates in his righteousness; he protects and vindicates the one whose cause is just. For other examples of this use of the word, see BDB 842 s.v.</p>
<A NAME="525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=138><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;because of those who watch me [with evil intent].&#8221; See also Pss 27:11; 56:2.</p>
<A NAME="526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=139><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;make level before me your way.&#8221; The imperative &#8220;make level&#8221; is Hiphil in the <i>Kethib</i> (consonantal text); Piel in the <i>Qere</i> (marginal reading). God&#8217;s &#8220;way&#8221; is here the way in which he leads the psalmist providentially (see the preceding line, where the psalmist asks the Lord to lead him).</p>
<A NAME="527"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=140><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;certainly.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="528"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=141><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for there is not in his mouth truthfulness.&#8221; The singular pronoun (&#8220;his&#8221;) probably refers back to the &#8220;man of bloodshed and deceit&#8221; mentioned in v. 6. The singular is collective or representative, as the plural in the next line indicates, and so has been translated &#8220;they.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="529"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=142><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;their inward part[s] [is] destruction.&#8221; For a discussion of the extended metaphor in v. 9b, see the note on the word &#8220;it&#8221; at the end of the verse.</p>
<A NAME="530"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=143><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;their throat is an open grave.&#8221; For a discussion of the extended metaphor in v. 9b, see the note on the word &#8220;it&#8221; at the end of the verse. The metaphor is suggested by the physical resemblance of the human throat to a deeply dug grave; both are dark chasms.</p>
<A NAME="531"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=144><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they make smooth their tongue.&#8221; Flattering, deceitful words are in view. See Ps 12:2. The psalmist&#8217;s deceitful enemies are compared to the realm of death/Sheol in v. 9b. Sheol was envisioned as a dark region within the earth, the entrance to which was the grave with its steep slopes (cf. Ps 88:4-6). The enemies&#8217; victims are pictured here as slipping down a steep slope (the enemies&#8217; tongues) and falling into an open grave (their throat) that terminates in destruction in the inner recesses of Sheol (their stomach). The enemies&#8217; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;</font> (&#8220;inward part&#8221;) refers here to their thoughts and motives, which are destructive in their intent. The throat is where these destructive thoughts are transformed into words, and their tongue is what they use to speak the deceitful words that lead their innocent victims to their demise.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> As the psalmist walks down the path in which God leads him, he asks the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> to guide his steps and remove danger from the path (v. 8), because he knows his enemies have &#8220;dug a grave&#8221; for him and are ready to use their deceitful words to &#8220;swallow him up&#8221; like the realm of death (i.e., Sheol) and bring him to ruin.</p>
<A NAME="532"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=145><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;declare/regard them as guilty.&#8221; Declaring the psalmist&#8217;s adversaries guilty is here metonymic for judging them or paying them back for their wrongdoing.</p>
<A NAME="533"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=146><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;may they fall from their plans.&#8221; The prefixed verbal form is a jussive, expressing an imprecation. The psalmist calls judgment down on the evildoers. Their plans will be their downfall in that God will judge them for their evil schemes.</p>
<A NAME="534"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=147><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;banish them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="535"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=148><b>tn</b> The Hebrew noun used here, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pesha</font>&#8217;), refers to rebellious actions. The psalmist pictures his enemies as rebels against God (see the next line).</p>
<A NAME="536"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=149><b>sn</b> <i>Take shelter</i>. &#8220;Taking shelter&#8221; in the Lord is an idiom for seeking his protection. Seeking his protection presupposes and even demonstrates the subject&#8217;s loyalty to the Lord. In the psalms those who &#8220;take shelter&#8221; in the Lord are contrasted with the wicked and equated with those who love, fear and serve the Lord (Pss 5:11-12; 31:17-20; 34:21-22).</p>
<A NAME="537"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=150><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal form is a jussive of wish or prayer. The psalmist calls on God to reward his faithful followers.</p>
<A NAME="538"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=151><b>tn</b> Or perhaps more hyperbolically, &#8220;forever.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="539"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=152><b>tn</b> As in the preceding line, the prefixed verbal form is a jussive of wish or prayer.</p>
<A NAME="540"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=153><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;put a cover over them.&#8221; The verb form is a Hiphil imperfect from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sakhakh</font>, &#8220;cover, shut off&#8221;). The imperfect expresses the psalmist&#8217;s wish or request.</p>
<A NAME="541"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=154><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the lovers of your name.&#8221; The phrase refers to those who are loyal to the Lord. See Pss 69:36; 119:132; Isa 56:6.</p>
<A NAME="542"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=155><b>tn</b> The <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) with prefixed verbal form following the volitional &#8220;shelter them&#8221; indicates purpose or result (&#8220;so that those&#8230;may rejoice).</p>
<A NAME="543"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=156><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;For.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="544"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=157><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;bless.&#8221; The imperfect verbal forms here and in the next line highlight how God characteristically rewards and protects the godly.</p>
<A NAME="545"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=158><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;innocent.&#8221; The singular form is used here in a collective or representative sense.</p>
<A NAME="546"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=159><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;surround.&#8221; In 1 Sam 23:26 the verb describes how Saul and his men hemmed David in as they chased him.</p>
<A NAME="547"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=160><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;him.&#8221; The singular form is used here in a collective or representative sense and is thus translated &#8220;them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="548"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=161><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;with favor&#8221; (cf. NRSV). There is no preposition before the noun in the Hebrew text, nor is there a pronoun attached. &#8220;Favor&#8221; here stands by metonymy for God&#8217;s defensive actions on behalf of the one whom he finds acceptable.</p>
