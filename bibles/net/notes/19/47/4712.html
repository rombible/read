<A NAME="4712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1741><b>sn</b> <i>God ascended his throne</i>. In the context of vv. 3-4, which refer to the conquest of the land under Joshua, v. 5 is best understood as referring to an historical event. When the Lord conquered the land and placed his people in it, he assumed a position of kingship, as predicted by Moses (see Exod 15:17-18, as well as Ps 114:1-2). That event is here described metaphorically in terms of a typical coronation ceremony for an earthly king (see 2 Sam 15:10; 2 Kgs 9:13). Verses 1-2, 8-9 focus on God&#8217;s continuing kingship, which extends over all nations.</p>
