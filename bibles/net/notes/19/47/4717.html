<A NAME="4717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1746><b>tc</b> The words &#8220;along with&#8221; do not appear in the MT. However, the LXX has &#8220;with,&#8221; suggesting that the original text may have read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1460;&#1501; &#1506;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">am</font>, &#8220;along with the people&#8221;). In this case the MT is haplographic (the consonantal sequence <i>ayin</i>-<i>mem</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1501;</font>] being written once instead of twice). Another option is that the LXX is simply and correctly interpreting &#8220;people&#8221; as an adverbial accusative and supplying the appropriate preposition.</p>
