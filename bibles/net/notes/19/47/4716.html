<A NAME="4716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1745><b>tn</b> When a new king was enthroned, his followers would acclaim him king using this enthronement formula (Qal perfect 3ms <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">malakh</font>, &#8220;to reign,&#8221; followed by the name of the king). See 2 Sam 15:10; 1 Kgs 1:11, 13, 18; 2 Kgs 9:13, as well as Isa 52:7. In this context the perfect verbal form is generalizing, but the declaration logically follows the historical reference in v. 5 to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s having ascended his throne.</p>
