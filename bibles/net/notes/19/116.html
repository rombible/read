<A NAME="1161"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=3971><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 116</i>. The psalmist thanks the Lord for delivering him from a life threatening crisis and promises to tell the entire covenant community what God has done for him.</p>
<A NAME="1162"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=3972><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I love because the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> heard my voice, my pleas.&#8221; It is possible that &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221; originally appeared directly after &#8220;I love&#8221; and was later accidentally misplaced. The translation assumes the prefixed verbal form is a preterite. The psalmist recalls that God heard his cry for help (note the perfect in v. 2a and the narrative in vv. 3-4).</p>
<A NAME="1163"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3973><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;because he turned his ear to me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1164"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=3974><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and in my days I will cry out.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1165"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=3975><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;surrounded me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1166"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=3976><b>tn</b> The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1510;&#1512;</font> (&#8220;straits; distress&#8221;) occurs only here, Ps 118:5 and Lam 1:3. If retained, it refers to Sheol as a place where one is confined or severely restricted (cf. BDB 865 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1510;&#1463;&#1512;</font>, &#8220;<i>the straits</i> of Sheol&#8221;; NIV &#8220;the anguish of the grave&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;the pangs of Sheol&#8221;). However, <i>HALOT</i> 624 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1510;&#1463;&#1512;</font> suggests an emendation to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1491;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿtsadey</font>, &#8220;snares of&#8221;), a rare noun attested in Job 19:6 and Eccl 7:26. This proposal, which is reflected in the translation, produces better parallelism with &#8220;ropes&#8221; in the preceding line.</p>
<A NAME="1167"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=3977><b>tn</b> The translation assumes the prefixed verbal form is a preterite. The psalmist recalls the crisis from which the Lord delivered him.</p>
<A NAME="1168"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=3978><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;guards.&#8221; The active participle indicates this is a characteristic of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.</p>
<A NAME="1169"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=3979><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the [morally] naive,&#8221; that is, the one who is young and still in the process of learning right from wrong and distinguishing wisdom from folly. See Ps 19:7.</p>
<A NAME="11610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=3980><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I was low.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="11611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=3981><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;return, my soul, to your place of rest.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="11612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=3982><b>tn</b> The Hebrew idiom <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1500; &#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gamal </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) means &#8220;to repay,&#8221; here in a positive sense (cf. Ps 13:5).</p>
<A NAME="11613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=3983><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;for.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="11614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=3984><b>tn</b> &#8220;<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221; is supplied here in the translation for clarification.</p>
<A NAME="11615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=3985><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;walk before&#8221; (see Ps 56:13). On the meaning of the Hebrew idiom, see the notes at 2 Kgs 20:3/Isa 38:3.</p>
<A NAME="11616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=3986><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lands, regions.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="11617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=3987><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I said in my haste.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="11618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=3988><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a cup of deliverance I will lift up.&#8221; Perhaps this alludes to a drink offering the psalmist will present as he thanks the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> for his deliverance. See v. 17.</p>
<A NAME="11619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=3989><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;precious in the eyes of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> [is] the death of his godly ones.&#8221; The point is not that God delights in or finds satisfaction in the death of his followers! The psalmist, who has been delivered from death, affirms that the life-threatening experiences of God&#8217;s followers get God&#8217;s attention, just as a precious or rare object would attract someone&#8217;s eye. See Ps 72:14 for a similar expression of this belief.</p>
<A NAME="11620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=3990><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I am your servant, the son of your female servant.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;son of a female servant&#8221; (see also Ps 86:16) is used of a son born to a secondary wife or concubine (Exod 23:12). In some cases the child&#8217;s father is the master of the house (see Gen 21:10, 13; Judg 9:18). The use of the expression here certainly does not imply that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has such a secondary wife or concubine! It is used metaphorically and idiomatically to emphasize the psalmist&#8217;s humility before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and his status as the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s servant.</p>
<A NAME="11621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=3991><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;you have loosed my bonds.&#8221; In this context the imagery refers to deliverance from death (see v. 3).</p>
