<A NAME="641"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2278><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 64</i>. The psalmist asks God to protect him from his dangerous enemies and then confidently affirms that God will destroy his enemies and demonstrate his justice in the sight of all observers.</p>
<A NAME="642"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2279><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my voice.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="643"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2280><b>tn</b> The imperfect verbal form is used here to express the psalmist&#8217;s request.</p>
<A NAME="644"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2281><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from the terror of [the] enemy.&#8221; &#8220;Terror&#8221; is used here metonymically for the enemy&#8217;s attacks that produce fear because they threaten the psalmist&#8217;s life.</p>
<A NAME="645"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2282><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;workers of wickedness.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="646"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2283><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;who.&#8221; A new sentence was started here in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="647"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2284><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a bitter word.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="648"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2285><b>tn</b> The psalmist uses the singular because he is referring to himself here as representative of a larger group.</p>
<A NAME="649"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2286><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and are unafraid.&#8221; The words &#8220;of retaliation&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarification.</p>
<A NAME="6410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2287><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they give strength to themselves, an evil matter [or &#8220;word&#8221;].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="6411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2288><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they report about hiding.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="6412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2289><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they say.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="6413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2290><b>tn</b> If this is a direct quotation (cf. NASB, NIV), the pronoun &#8220;them&#8221; refers to the snares mentioned in the previous line. If it is an indirect quotation, then the pronoun may refer to the enemies themselves (cf. NEB, which is ambiguous). Some translations retain the direct quotation but alter the pronoun to &#8220;us,&#8221; referring clearly to the enemies (cf. NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="6414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2291><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;search out, examine,&#8221; which here means (by metonymy) &#8220;devise.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="6415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2292><b>tc</b> The MT has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1502;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tamnu</font>, &#8220;we are finished&#8221;), a Qal perfect first common plural form from the verbal root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tamam</font>). Some understand this as the beginning of a quotation of the enemies&#8217; words and translate, &#8220;we have completed,&#8221; but the Hiphil would seem to be required in this case. The present translation follows many medieval Hebrew <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> in reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1464;&#1502;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tomnu</font>, &#8220;they hide&#8221;), a Qal perfect third common plural form from the verbal root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">taman</font>).</p>
<A NAME="6416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2293><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a searched-out search,&#8221; which is understood as referring here to a thoroughly planned plot to destroy the psalmist.</p>
<A NAME="6417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2294><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the inner part of man, and a heart [is] deep.&#8221; The point seems to be that a man&#8217;s inner thoughts are incapable of being discovered. No one is a mind reader! Consequently the psalmist is vulnerable to his enemies&#8217; well-disguised plots.</p>
<A NAME="6418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2295><b>tn</b> The prefixed verb with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive is normally used in narrative contexts to describe completed past actions. It is possible that the conclusion to the psalm (vv. 7-10) was added to the lament after God&#8217;s judgment of the wicked in response to the psalmist&#8217;s lament (vv. 1-6). The translation assumes that these verses are anticipatory and express the psalmist&#8217;s confidence that God would eventually judge the wicked. The psalmist uses a narrative style as a rhetorical device to emphasize his certitude. See GKC 329-30 §111.<i>w</i>.</p>
<A NAME="6419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2296><b>tn</b> The perfect verbal form here expresses the psalmist&#8217;s certitude about the coming demise of the wicked.</p>
<A NAME="6420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2297><b>tn</b> The translation follows the traditional accentuation of the MT. Another option is to translate, &#8220;But God will shoot them down with an arrow, suddenly they will be wounded&#8221; (cf. NIV, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="6421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2298><b>tc</b> The MT reads literally, &#8220;and they caused him to stumble, upon them, their tongue.&#8221; Perhaps the third plural subject of the verb is indefinite with the third singular pronominal suffix on the verb being distributive (see Ps 63:10). In this case one may translate, &#8220;each one will be made to stumble.&#8221; The preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) might then be taken as adversative, &#8220;against them [is] their tongue.&#8221; Many prefer to emend the text to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1499;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1461;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465; &#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1461;&#1497; &#1500;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyakhshilemo </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aley lÿshonam</font>, &#8220;and he caused them to stumble over their tongue&#8221;). However, if this reading is original, it is difficult to see how the present reading of the MT arose. Furthermore, the preposition is not collocated with the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kashal</font>) elsewhere. It is likely that the MT is corrupt, but a satisfying emendation has not yet been proposed.</p>
<A NAME="6422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2299><b>tn</b> The Hitpolel verbal form is probably from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nud</font>; see <i>HALOT</i> 678 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1493;&#1491;</font>), which is attested elsewhere in the Hitpolel stem, not the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nadad</font>, as proposed by BDB 622 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1491;</font>), which does not occur elsewhere in this stem.</p>
<A NAME="6423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2300><b>tc</b> Many medieval Hebrew <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyir</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">u</font>, &#8220;and they will see&#8221;) instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyirÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">u</font>, &#8220;and they will proclaim&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="6424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2301><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the work of God,&#8221; referring to the judgment described in v. 7.</p>
<A NAME="6425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2302><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;upright in heart.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="6426"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2303><b>tn</b> That is, about the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s accomplishments on their behalf.</p>
