<A NAME="2251"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=840><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and from the horns of the wild oxen you answer me.&#8221; Most take the final verb with the preceding prepositional phrase. Some understand the verb form as a relatively rare precative perfect, expressing a wish or request (see <i>IBHS</i> 494-95 §30.5.4c, d). However, not all grammarians are convinced that the perfect is used as a precative in biblical Hebrew. (See the discussion at Ps 3:7.) Others prefer to take the perfect in its usual indicative sense. The psalmist, perhaps in response to an oracle of salvation, affirms confidently that God has answered him, assuring him that deliverance is on the way. The present translation takes the prepositional phrase as parallel to the preceding &#8220;from the mouth of the lion&#8221; and as collocated with the verb &#8220;rescue&#8221; at the beginning of the verse. &#8220;You have answered me&#8221; is understood as a triumphant shout which marks a sudden shift in tone and introduces the next major section of the psalm. By isolating the statement syntactically, the psalmist highlights the declaration.</p>
