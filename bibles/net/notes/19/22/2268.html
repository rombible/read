<A NAME="2268"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=857><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;eat and worship.&#8221; The verb forms (a perfect followed by a prefixed form with <i>vav</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>] consecutive) are normally used in narrative to relate completed actions. Here the psalmist uses the forms rhetorically as he envisions a time when the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will receive universal worship. The mood is one of wishful thinking and anticipation; this is not prophecy in the strict sense.</p>
