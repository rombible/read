<A NAME="2218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=807><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;roll [yourself].&#8221; The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1500;&#1500;</font> here has the sense of &#8220;commit&#8221; (see Prov 16:3). The imperatival form in the Hebrew text indicates the enemies here address the psalmist. Since they refer to him in the third person in the rest of the verse, some prefer to emend the verb to a perfect, &#8220;he commits himself to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.&#8221;</p>
