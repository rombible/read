<A NAME="2238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=827><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;like a lion, my hands and my feet.&#8221; This reading is often emended because it is grammatically awkward, but perhaps its awkwardness is by rhetorical design. Its broken syntax may be intended to convey the panic and terror felt by the psalmist. The psalmist may envision a lion pinning the hands and feet of its victim to the ground with its paws (a scene depicted in ancient Near Eastern art), or a lion biting the hands and feet. The line has been traditionally translated, &#8220;they pierce my hands and feet,&#8221; and then taken as foreshadowing the crucifixion of Christ. Though Jesus does appropriate the language of this psalm while on the cross (compare v. 1 with Matt 27:46 and Mark 15:34), the NT does not cite this verse in describing the death of Jesus. (It does refer to vv. 7-8 and 18, however. See Matt 27:35, 39, 43; Mark 15:24, 29; Luke 23:34; John 19:23-24.) If one were to insist on an emendation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1458;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ka</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ariy</font>, &#8220;like a lion&#8221;) to a verb, the most likely verbal root would be <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">karah</font>, &#8220;dig&#8221;; see the LXX). In this context this verb could refer to the gnawing and tearing of wild dogs (cf. NCV, TEV, CEV). The ancient Greek version produced by Symmachus reads &#8220;bind&#8221; here, perhaps understanding a verbal root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1512;&#1498;</font>, which is attested in later Hebrew and Aramaic and means &#8220;to encircle, entwine, embrace&#8221; (see <i>HALOT</i> 497-98 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1512;&#1498;</font> and Jastrow 668 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font>). Neither one of these proposed verbs can yield a meaning &#8220;bore, pierce.&#8221;</p>
