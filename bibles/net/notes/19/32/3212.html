<A NAME="3212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1125><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my [?] was turned.&#8221; The meaning of the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿshad</font>) is uncertain. A noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lashad</font>, &#8220;cake&#8221;) is attested in Num 11:8, but it would make no sense to understand that word in this context. It is better to emend the form to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿshuddiy</font>, &#8220;to my destruction&#8221;) and understand &#8220;your hand&#8221; as the subject of the verb &#8220;was turned.&#8221; In this case the text reads, &#8220;[your hand] was turned to my destruction.&#8221; In Lam 3:3 the author laments that God&#8217;s &#8220;hand&#8221; was &#8220;turned&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hafakh</font>) against him in a hostile sense.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>You tried to destroy me</i>. The psalmist&#8217;s statement reflects his perspective. As far as he was concerned, it seemed as if the Lord was trying to kill him.</p>
