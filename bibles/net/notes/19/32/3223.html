<A NAME="3223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1136><b>tn</b> The second person pronominal forms in this verse are singular. The psalmist addresses each member of his audience individually (see also the note on the word &#8220;eye&#8221; in the next line). A less likely option (but one which is commonly understood) is that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> addresses the psalmist in vv. 8-9 (cf. NASB &#8220;I will instruct you and teach you&#8230;I will counsel you with My eye upon you&#8221;).</p>
