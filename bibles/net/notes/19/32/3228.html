<A NAME="3228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1141><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;with a bridle and bit, its [?] to hold, not to come near to you.&#8221; The meaning of the Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adiy</font>) is uncertain. Normally the word refers to &#8220;jewelry,&#8221; so some suggest the meaning &#8220;trappings&#8221; here (cf. NASB). Some emend the form to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1495;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿkhehem</font>, &#8220;their jawbones&#8221;) but it is difficult to see how the present Hebrew text, even if corrupt, could have derived from this proposed original reading. P. C. Craigie (<i>Psalms 1-50</i> [WBC], 265) takes the form from an Arabic root and translates &#8220;whose gallop.&#8221; Cf. also NRSV &#8220;whose temper must be curbed.&#8221;</p>
