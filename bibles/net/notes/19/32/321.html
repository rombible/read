<A NAME="321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1114><b>sn</b> <i>Psalm 32</i>. The psalmist recalls the agony he experienced prior to confessing his sins and affirms that true happiness comes when one&#8217;s sins are forgiven. He then urges others not to be stubborn, but to turn to God while forgiveness is available, for God extends his mercy to the repentant, while the wicked experience nothing but sorrow.</p>
