<A NAME="44"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=250><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;is done.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">na</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asim</font>, Niphal participle mpl from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1463;&#1492;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">asah</font>, &#8220;to do&#8221;) is a probably a verbal use of the participle rather than a substantival use (NEB: &#8220;all the <i>acts</i> of oppression&#8221;). This verbal use of the participle depicts durative or universal gnomic action. It emphasizes the lamentable continuity of oppression throughout human history. The English versions translate it variously: &#8220;[all the oppressions that] are done&#8221; (KJV, ASV, Douay, YLT), &#8220;[all the oppression] that goes on&#8221; (NJPS, Moffatt), &#8220;[all the oppressions] that are practiced&#8221; (RSV, NRSV), &#8220;[all the oppressions] that occur&#8221; (MLB), &#8220;[all the acts of oppression] which were being done&#8221; (NASB), &#8220;[all the oppressions] that take place&#8221; (NAB), &#8220;[all the oppression] that was taking place&#8221; (NIV).</p>
