<A NAME="432"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=278><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;he laments&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but is supplied in the translation for clarity. The direct discourse (&#8220;For whom am I toiling and depriving myself of pleasure?&#8221;) is not introduced with an introductory structure. As in the LXX, some translations suggest that these words are spoken by a lonely workaholic, e.g., &#8220;He says&#8230;&#8221; (NAB, NEB, ASV, NIV, NRSV). Others suggest that this is a question that he never asks himself, e.g., &#8220;Yet he never asks himself&#8230;&#8221; (KJV, RSV, MLB, YLT, Douay, NASB, Moffatt).</p>
