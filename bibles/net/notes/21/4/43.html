<A NAME="43"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=249><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;all the oppressions&#8221; or &#8220;all the oppression&#8221;; alternately, &#8220;all the various kinds of oppression.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1511;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">osheq</font>) denotes &#8220;oppression,&#8221; e.g., Jer 6:6; 22:17; Ezek 18:18; 22:7, 12, 29; Pss 73:8; 119:134 (see <i>HALOT </i>897 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1511;</font> 1; BDB 799 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1511;</font> 1). It occurs several times in the book, always in reference to personal rather than national oppression (4:1; 5:8 ET [5:7 HT]; 7:7). The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ashuqim</font>) is plural and articular (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;the oppressions&#8221;). The article indicates a generic class (&#8220;oppression&#8221;). The plural may be classified in one of two ways: (1) a plural of number, which refers to specific kinds of oppression that occur on earth: &#8220;the various kinds of oppression&#8221;; (2) an abstract plural, which is used to refer to abstract concepts: &#8220;the oppression&#8221;; or (3) a plural of intensity, which describes the oppression at hand as particularly grievous: &#8220;awful oppression&#8221; or &#8220;severe oppression.&#8221; The LXX renders it as a plural of number: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#965;&#954;&#959;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#943;&#945;&#962; </font>(<font face="Greektl">sukofantias</font>, &#8220;oppressions&#8221;), as does the Vulgate. Most English versions treat it as a plural of number: &#8220;the oppressions&#8221; (KJV, ASV, NAB, RSV, NRSV, MLB, YLT); however, a few treat it as an abstract plural: &#8220;the oppression&#8221; (NJPS, NIV, Moffatt).</p>
