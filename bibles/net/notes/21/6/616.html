<A NAME="616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=365><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;he has no burial.&#8221; The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1490;&#1463;&#1501;&#1470;&#1511;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492; &#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿgam-qÿvurah lo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">-haytah</font>, &#8220;he even has no burial&#8221;) is traditionally treated as part of a description of the man&#8217;s sorry final state, that is, he is deprived of even a proper burial (KJV, NEB, RSV, NRSV, ASV, NASB, NIV, NJPS, MLB, Moffatt). However, the preceding parallel lines suggest that this a hyperbolic protasis: &#8220;If he were to live one hundred years&#8230;even if he were never buried [i.e., were to live forever]&#8230;.&#8221; A similar idea occurs elsewhere (e.g., Pss 49:9; 89:48). See D. R. Glenn, &#8220;Ecclesiastes,&#8221; <i>BKCOT</i>, 990.</p>
