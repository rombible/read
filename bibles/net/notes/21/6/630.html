<A NAME="630"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=379><b>sn</b> <i>So what advantage does the wise man have over a fool? </i>The rhetorical question in Hebrew implies a negative answer: the wise man has no absolute advantage over a fool in the sense that both will share the same fate: death. Qoheleth should not be misunderstood here as denying that wisdom has no relative advantage over folly; elsewhere he affirms that wisdom does yield some relative benefits in life (7:1-22). However, wisdom cannot deliver one from death.</p>
