<A NAME="613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=362><b>sn</b> <i>Instead, someone else enjoys it</i>. A person may be unable to enjoy the fruit of his/her labor due to an unfortunate turn of events that robs a person of his possessions (5:13-14) or a miserly, lifelong hoarding of one&#8217;s wealth that robs him of the ability to enjoy what he has worked so hard to acquire (5:15-17). Qoheleth recommends the enjoyment of life and the fruit of one&#8217;s labor, as God enables (5:18-20). Unfortunately, the ability to enjoy the fruits of one&#8217;s labor is often thwarted by the obstacles described in 6:1-2 and 6:3-9.</p>
