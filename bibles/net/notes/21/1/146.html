<A NAME="146"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=46><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I gave my heart&#8221; or &#8220;I set my mind.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">libbi</font>, &#8220;my heart&#8221;) is an example of synecdoche of part (heart) for the whole (myself). Qoheleth uses this figurative expression frequently in the book. On the other hand, in Hebrew mentality, the term &#8220;heart&#8221; is frequently associated with one&#8217;s thoughts and reasoning; thus, this might be a metonymy of association (heart = thoughts). The equivalent English idiom would be &#8220;I applied my mind.&#8221;</p>
