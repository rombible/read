The root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font> is repeated in 1:6-7 to emphasize that everything in nature (e.g., wind and water) continually repeats its actions. For all of the repetition of the cycles of nature, nothing changes; all the constant motion produces nothing new.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This verse does not refer to the cycle of evaporation or the return of water by underground streams, as sometimes suggested.
