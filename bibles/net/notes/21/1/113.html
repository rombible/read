<A NAME="113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=13><b>sn</b> The Hebrew root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1500;</font>, (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amal</font>, &#8220;toil&#8221;) is repeated here for emphasis: &#8220;What gain does anyone have in his <i>toil</i> with which he <i>toils</i>.&#8221; For all his efforts, man&#8217;s endeavors and secular achievements will not produce anything of ultimate value that will radically revolutionize anything in the world. The term &#8220;toil&#8221; is used in a pejorative sense to emphasize that the only thing that man obtains ultimately from all his efforts is weariness and exhaustion. Due to sin, mankind has been cursed with the futility of his labor that renders work a &#8220;toilsome&#8221; task (Gen 3:17-19). Although it was not yet revealed to Qoheleth, God will one day deliver the redeemed from this plight in the future kingdom when man&#8217;s labor will no longer be toilsome, but profitable, fulfilling, and enjoyable (Isa 65:17-23).</p>
