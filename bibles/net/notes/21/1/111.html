<A NAME="111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the man.&#8221; The Hebrew term could be used here in a generic sense, referring to the typical man (hence, &#8220;a man&#8221;). However, it is more likely that the form is collective and that humankind in general is in view (note NIV &#8220;man&#8221;). Note the reference to &#8220;a generation&#8221; coming and going in the next verse, as well as v. 13, where the phrase &#8220;the sons of man&#8221; (= humankind) appears. In this case the singular pronominal suffix and singular verb later in v. 3 reflect grammatical agreement, not individuality. </p>
