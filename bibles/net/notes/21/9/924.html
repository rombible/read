<A NAME="924"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=593><b>tn</b> As discussed in the note on the word &#8220;futile&#8221; in 1:2, the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hevel</font>) has a wide range of meanings, and should not be translated the same in every place (see <i>HALOT </i>236&#8211;37 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1500;</font>; BDB 210&#8211;11 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1489;&#1462;&#1500;</font>). The term is used in two basic ways in OT, literally and figuratively. The literal, concrete sense is used in reference to the wind, man&#8217;s transitory breath, evanescent vapor (Isa 57:13; Pss 62:10; 144:4; Prov 21:6; Job 7:16). In this sense, it is often a synonym for &#8220;breath; wind&#8221; (Eccl 1:14; Isa 57:13; Jer 10:14). The literal sense lent itself to the metaphorical sense. Because breath/vapor/wind is transitory and fleeting, the figurative connotation &#8220;fleeting; transitory&#8221; arose (e.g., Prov 31:30; Eccl 6:12; 7:15; 9:9; 11:10; Job 7:16). In this sense, it is parallel to &#8220;few days&#8221; and &#8220;[days] which he passes like a shadow&#8221; (Eccl 6:12). It is used in reference to youth and vigor (11:10) or life (6:12; 7:15; 9:9) which are &#8220;transitory&#8221; or &#8220;fleeting.&#8221; In this context, the most appropriate meaning is &#8220;fleeting.&#8221;</p>
