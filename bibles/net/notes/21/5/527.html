<A NAME="527"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=321><b>tn</b> The syntax and exegesis of the line is difficult. There are three basic interpretive options: (1) the king takes care of the security of the cultivated land: &#8220;in any case, the advantage of a country is that there is a king for the cultivated land&#8221;; (2) the king is in favor of a prosperous agricultural policy: &#8220;in any case, the advantage of a country is that there is a king who is obeyed for the sake of the agriculture&#8221;; and (3) the king exploits the poor farmers: &#8220;the produce of the land is [seized] by all, even the king is served by the fields.&#8221; Perhaps the best option in the light of the context is to take the referent of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kol</font>, &#8220;all&#8221;) to the government officials of 5:8 rather than to the people as a whole. The verse depicts the exploitation of the poor farmers by corrupt government officials. This is reflected in two English versions: &#8220;the increase from the land is taken by all; the king himself profits from the fields&#8221; (NIV); &#8220;the profit of the land is among all of them; a cultivated field has a king&#8221; (RSV margin). On the other hand, the LXX treated the syntax so the king is viewed in a neutral sense: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#953; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#945; &#947;&#951;&#962; &#7952;&#960;&#953; &#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#953; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;</font>,<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> &#946;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#965;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#965; &#945;&#961;&#947;&#959;&#965; &#949;&#7984;&#961;&#947;&#945;&#963;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#965;</font> (&#8220;The abundance of the earth is for everyone; the king is dependent on the tilled field&#8221;). Most English versions deal with the syntax so that the king is viewed in a neutral or positive sense: &#8220;the profit of the earth is for all; the king himself is served by the field&#8221; (KJV); &#8220;a king who cultivates the field is an advantage to the land&#8221; (NASB); &#8220;this is an advantage for a land: a king for a plowed field&#8221; (NRSV); &#8220;the greatest advantage in all the land is his: he controls a field that is cultivated&#8221; (NJPS); &#8220;a country prospers with a king who has control&#8221; (Moffatt); &#8220;a king devoted to the field is an advantage to the land&#8221; (MLB); &#8220;a king is an advantage to a land with cultivated fields&#8221; (RSV); &#8220;the best thing for a country is a king whose own lands are well tilled&#8221; (NEB); and &#8220;an advantage for a country in every respect is a king for the arable land&#8221; (NAB).
