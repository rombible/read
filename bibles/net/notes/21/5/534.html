The related term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tov</font>, &#8220;good&#8221;) connotes &#8220;prosperity&#8221; as well (Prov 11:10; Job 20:21; 21:16); cf. <i>HALOT </i>372 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font> 1.b. Here, it refers to the possessions and wealth a person acquires as the fruit of his labors. This nuance is well reflected in several English versions: &#8220;The more a man gains, the more there are to spend it&#8221; (Moffatt); &#8220;When riches multiply, so do those who live off them&#8221; (NEB); &#8220;As his substance increase, so do those who consume it&#8221; (NJPS); and &#8220;Where there are great riches, there are also many to devour them&#8221; (NAB). The line does not describe the economic law of &#8220;supply and demand,&#8221; as some versions seem to imply, e.g., &#8220;As goods increase, so do those who consume them&#8221; (NIV); &#8220;When goods increase, those who eat them increase&#8221; (NRSV); cf. also KJV, ASV, RSV, MLB, NASB.</p>
