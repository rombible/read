<A NAME="731"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=426><b>tn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">davar</font>) denotes &#8220;matter; thing&#8221; here rather than &#8220;speech; word,&#8221; as the parallelism with &#8220;patience&#8221; suggests. The term was misunderstood as &#8220;speech; word&#8221; by the Vulgate (so also Douay).</p>
