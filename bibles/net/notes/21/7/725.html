<A NAME="725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=420><b>tn</b> It is difficult to determine whether the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hevel</font>) means &#8220;fleeting&#8221; or &#8220;useless&#8221; in this context. The imagery of quick-burning thorns under a cooking pot is ambiguous and can be understood in more than one way: (1) It is useless to try to heat a cooking pot by burning thorns because they burn out before the pot can be properly heated; (2) the heat produced by quick-burning thorns is fleeting &#8211; it produces quick heat, but lasts only for a moment. Likewise, the &#8220;laughter of a fool&#8221; can be taken in both ways: (1) In comparison to the sober reflection of the wise, the laughter of fools is morally useless: the burning of thorns, like the laughter of fools, makes a lot of noise but accomplishes nothing; (2) the laughter of fools is fleeting due to the brevity of life and certainty of death. Perhaps this is an example of intentional ambiguity.</p>
