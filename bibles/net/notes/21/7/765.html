<A NAME="765"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=460><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;both.&#8221; The term &#8220;warnings&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is supplied in the translation for clarity. Alternately, &#8220;both [extremes]&#8221; or &#8220;both [fates].&#8221; The point of this expression is either (1) &#8220; he achieves both things,&#8221; (2) &#8220;he escapes all these misfortunes,&#8221; (3) &#8220;he does his duty by both,&#8221; or (4) &#8220;he avoids both extremes.&#8221; See D. Barthélemy, ed., <i>Preliminary and Interim Report on the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project</i>, 3:580&#8211;81.</p>
