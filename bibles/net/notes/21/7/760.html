<A NAME="760"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=455><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Why should you ruin yourself?&#8221;; or &#8220;Why should you destroy yourself?&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1461;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shamem</font>) is traditionally taken as &#8220;to destroy; to ruin oneself.&#8221; For its use here <i>HALOT</i> 1566 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1501;</font> 2 has &#8220;to cause oneself ruin&#8221;; BDB 1031 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1461;&#1501;</font> 2 has &#8220;cause oneself desolation, ruin.&#8221; Most English versions take a similar approach: &#8220;Why destroy yourself?&#8221; (KJV, ASV, NEB, NRSV, MLB, NIV); &#8220;Why ruin yourself?&#8221; (NAB, NASB). However, in the Hitpolel stem the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1501;</font> never means this elsewhere, but is always nuanced elsewhere as &#8220;to be appalled; to be astonished; to be dumbfounded; to be confounded; to be horrified&#8221; (e.g., Ps 143:4; Isa 59:16; 63:5; Dan 8:27); cf. BDB 1031 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1461;&#1501;</font> 1; <i>HALOT</i> 1566 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1501;</font> 1. It is taken this way in the English version of the Tanakh: &#8220;or you may be dumbfounded&#8221; (NJPS). Likewise, Cohen renders, &#8220;Why should you be overcome with amazement?&#8221; (A. Cohen, <i>The Five Megilloth</i> [SoBB], 154). If a person was trusting in his own righteousness or wisdom to guarantee prosperity, he might be scandalized by the exceptions to the doctrine of retribution that Qoheleth had observed in 7:15. D. R. Glenn (&#8220;Ecclesiastes,&#8221; <i>BKCOT</i>, 994) notes: &#8220;This fits in nicely with Solomon&#8217;s argument here. He urged his readers not to be over-righteous or over-wise &#8216;lest they be confounded or astonished.&#8217; He meant that they should not depend on their righteousness or wisdom to guarantee God&#8217;s blessing because they might be confounded, dismayed, or disappointed like the righteous people whom Solomon had seen perishing in spite of their righteousness [in 7:15].&#8221; See GKC 149 §54.<i>c</i>.</p>
