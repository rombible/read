<A NAME="743"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=438><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Wisdom is a shade, money is a shade.&#8221; The repetition of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1510;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿtsel</font>, &#8220;shade; protection&#8221;) suggests that the A-line and B-line function as comparisons. Thus the Hebrew phrases &#8220;Wisdom is a shade, money is a shade&#8221; may be nuanced, &#8220;Wisdom [provides] protection [just as] money [provides] protection.&#8221; This approach is adopted by several translations: &#8220;wisdom is a defense, as money is a defense&#8221; (ASV), &#8220;wisdom is protection just as money is protection&#8221; (NASB), &#8220;wisdom like wealth is a defense&#8221; (Moffatt), &#8220;the protection of wisdom is as the protection of money&#8221; (NAB), &#8220;the protection of wisdom is like the protection of money&#8221; (RSV, NRSV), &#8220;wisdom protects as wealth protects&#8221; (MLB), and &#8220;wisdom is a shelter, as money is a shelter&#8221; (NIV). The comparison is missed by KJV: &#8220;wisdom is a defense, and money is a defense.&#8221; Less likely is taking <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet</font>) in a locative sense: &#8220;to be in the shelter of wisdom is to be in the shelter of money&#8221; (NJPS).</p>
