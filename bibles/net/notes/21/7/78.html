<A NAME="78"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=403><b>sn</b> There are two ways to understand this proverb: (1) Happy times (characterized by celebration and &#8220;fragrant perfume&#8221;) teach us less than hard times (&#8220;the day of one&#8217;s death&#8221;) which can bring about moral improvement (&#8220;a good reputation&#8221;). (2) It is better to come to the end of one&#8217;s life (&#8220;day of one&#8217;s death&#8221;) with a good reputation (&#8220;a good name&#8221;) than to merely be starting life (&#8220;day of one&#8217;s birth&#8221;) in an auspicious manner in joy and wealth (&#8220;fine perfume&#8221;). Folly and wickedness could foil a good beginning so that a person ends life as a fool. For example, Solomon began as the wisest man who ever lived, only to end life as one of history&#8217;s greatest fools.</p>
