<A NAME="753"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=448><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;in his righteousness.&#8221; The preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet</font>) on the terms <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1510;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1511;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿtsirqo</font>, &#8220;his righteousness&#8221;) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ato</font>, &#8220;his evil-doing&#8221;) in the following line are traditionally taken in a locative sense: &#8220;in his righteousness&#8221; and &#8220;in his wickedness&#8221; (KJV, NASB, NIV). However, it is better to take the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet</font>) in the adversative sense &#8220;in spite of&#8221; (e.g., Lev 26:27; Num 14:11; Deut 1:32; Isa 5:25; 9:11, 16, 20; 10:4; 16:14; 47:9; Pss 27:3; 78:32; Ezra 3:3); cf. <i>HALOT </i>104 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font> 7; BDB 90 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font> 3.7. NJPS renders it well: &#8220;Sometimes a good man perishes in spite of his goodness, and sometimes a wicked one endures in spite of his wickedness.&#8221; In a similar vein, D. R. Glenn (&#8220;Ecclesiastes,&#8221; <i>BKCOT</i>, 993&#8211;94) writes: &#8220;The word &#8216;in&#8217; in the phrases &#8216;in his righteousness&#8217; and &#8216;in his wickedness&#8217; can here mean &#8216;in spite of.&#8217; These phrases&#8230;argue against the common view that in 7:16 Solomon was warning against legalistic or Pharisaic self-righteousness. Such would have been a sin and would have been so acknowledged by Solomon who was concerned about <i>true</i> exceptions to the doctrine of retribution, not supposed ones (cf. 8:10&#8211;14 where this doctrine is discussed again).&#8221;</p>
