<A NAME="767"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=462><b>tn</b> The introductory particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) is rendered variously: &#8220;for&#8221; (KJV); &#8220;indeed&#8221; (NASB); not translated (NIV); &#8220;for&#8221; (NJPS). The particle functions in an explanatory sense, explaining the need for wisdom in v. 19. Righteousness alone cannot always protect a person from calamity (7:15-16); therefore, something additional, such as wisdom, is needed. The need for wisdom as protection from calamity is particularly evident in the light of the fact that no one is truly righteous (7:19-20).</p>
