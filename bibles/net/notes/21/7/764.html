<A NAME="764"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=459><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;will escape both&#8221;; or &#8220;will go forth in both.&#8221; The Hebrew phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1461;&#1510;&#1461;&#1488; &#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1467;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yetse</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et-kullam</font>, &#8220;he will follow both of them&#8221;) has been interpreted in several ways: (1) To adopt a balanced lifestyle that is moderately righteous while allowing for self-indulgence in moderate wickedness (&#8220;to follow both of them,&#8221; that is, to follow both righteousness and wickedness). However, this seems to unnecessarily encourage an antinomian rationalization of sin and moral compromise. (2) To avoid the two extremes of being over-righteous and over-wicked. This takes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1461;&#1510;&#1461;&#1488;</font> in the sense of &#8220;to escape,&#8221; e.g., Gen 39:12, 15; 1 Sam 14:14; Jer 11:11; 48:9; cf. <i>HALOT </i>426 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1510;&#1488;</font> 6.c; BDB 423 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font> 1.d. (3) To follow both of the warnings given in 7:16-17. This approach finds parallels in postbiblical rabbinic literature denoting the action of discharging one&#8217;s duty of obedience and complying with instruction. In postbiblical rabbinic literature the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1491;&#1461;&#1497;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1461;&#1510;&#1461;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yetse</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> yade</font>, &#8220;to go out of the hands&#8221;) is an idiom meaning &#8220;to comply with the requirements of the law&#8221; (Jastrow 587 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font> Hif.5.a). This fits nicely with the context of 7:16-17 in which Qoheleth issued two warnings. In 7:18a Qoheleth exhorted his readers to follow both of his warnings: &#8220;It is best to grasp the first warning without letting go of the second warning.&#8221; The person who fears God will heed both warnings. He will not depend upon his own righteousness and wisdom, but upon God&#8217;s sovereign bestowal of blessings. Likewise, he will not exploit the exceptions to the doctrine of retribution to indulge in sin, rationalizing sin away just because the wicked sometimes do not get what they deserve.</p>
