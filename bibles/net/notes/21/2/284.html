<A NAME="284"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">84</span><note=167><b>tn</b> The 3rd person masculine singular suffix on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1462;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">annikhennu</font>, &#8220;I must leave it&#8221;) refers to Qoheleth&#8217;s wealth, that is, the fruit of his labor (see the note on the phrase &#8220;hard labor&#8221; in 2:18). The suffix is rendered literally by nearly all translations; however, a few make its referent explicit: &#8220;I have to leave its fruits&#8221; (NEB), &#8220;I must leave them [= all the fruits of my labor]&#8221; (NAB).</p>
