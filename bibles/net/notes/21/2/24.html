<A NAME="24"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=87><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;I will test you with pleasure.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">simkhah</font>, &#8220;pleasure&#8221;) has a two-fold range of meanings: (1) it can refer to the legitimate enjoyment of life that Qoheleth affirms is good (5:17; 8:15; 9:7; 11:8, 9) and that God gives to those who please him (2:26; 5:19); or (2) it can refer to foolish pleasure, self-indulgent, frivolous merrymaking (2:1, 2; 7:4). The parallelism in 2:2 between <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1492;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sÿkhoq</font>, &#8220;laughter, frivolous merrymaking&#8221;), which always appears in the context of banqueting, drinking, and merrymaking, suggests that the pejorative sense is in view in this context.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The statement <i>I will try self-indulgent pleasure</i> is a figurative expression known as metonymy of association. As 2:1-3 makes clear, it is not so much Qoheleth who is put to the test with pleasure, but rather that pleasure is put to the test by Qoheleth. </p>
