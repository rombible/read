<A NAME="280"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">80</span><note=163><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I hated all my toil for which I had toiled.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1502;&#1464;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amali</font>, &#8220;my toil&#8221;) is repeated throughout 2:18-21. In each case, it functions as a metonymy of cause (i.e., toil) for effect (i.e., fruit of labor). See, e.g., Ps 105:44; BDB 765 s.v <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;</font> 3. The metonymy is indicated by several factors: (1) The 3rd person masculine singular suffix (&#8220;it&#8221;) on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1462;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">annikhennu</font>, &#8220;I must leave it&#8221;) in 2:18, and on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1462;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yittÿnennu</font>, &#8220;I must give it&#8221;) in 2:21 refer to his wealth, that is, the fruit of his labor. (2) In 2:21 the 3rd person masculine singular suffix on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1500;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488; &#1506;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shello</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amal-bo</font>, &#8220;who did not work for it&#8221;) refers to the inheritance that Qoheleth must turn over to his successor, namely, the fruit of his labor. (3) While he himself enjoyed the fruit of his labor, he despaired that he had to turn the fruit of his labor over to his successor: &#8220;So I loathed all the [fruit of] my labor&#8221; (2:18a) and &#8220;I began to despair about the [fruit of] my labor&#8221; (2:20a). Although most translations render <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1502;&#1464;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;</font> as &#8220;my toil&#8221; in 2:18, the metonymy is recognized by several English translations: &#8220;So I hated all <i>the fruit of</i> my labor for which I had labored&#8221; (NASB); &#8220;So I detested all <i>the fruits of</i> my labor&#8221; (NAB); &#8220;I hated all <i>the things</i> I had toiled for&#8221; (NIV); and &#8220;So I loathed all the <i>wealth</i> that I <i>was gaining</i>&#8221; (NJPS).</p>
