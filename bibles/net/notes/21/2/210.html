<A NAME="210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=93><b>tn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">simkhah</font>, &#8220;pleasure&#8221;) has a two-fold range of meanings in Ecclesiastes: (1) it can refer to the enjoyment of life that Qoheleth affirms is good (5:17; 8:15; 9:7; 11:8, 9) and that God gives to those who are pleasing to him (2:26; 5:19); and (2) it can refer to foolish pleasure, that is, frivolous merrymaking (2:1, 2; 7:4). The parallelism between <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sÿkhoq</font>, &#8220;laughter, frivolous merrymaking&#8221;) in 2:2 suggests that the pejorative sense is in view here.</p>
