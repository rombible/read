<A NAME="2121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">121</span><note=204><b>tn</b> The antecedent of the demonstrative pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zeh</font>, &#8220;this&#8221;) is debated: (1) Some refer it to the enjoyment which Qoheleth had just commended in 2:24-26. However, this is inconsistent with the enjoyment theme found elsewhere in the book. It also ignores the fact that 2:24-26 states that such enjoyment is a good gift from God. (2) Others refer it to the term &#8220;toil&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1500;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">amal</font>) which is repeated throughout 2:18-26. However, Qoheleth affirmed that if one is righteous, he can find enjoyment in his toil, even though so much of it is ultimately futile. (3) Therefore, it seems best to refer it to the grievous &#8220;task&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1503;</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">inyan</font>) God has given to the sinner in 2:26b. Consistent with the meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hevel</font>, &#8220;futile; profitless; fruitless&#8221;), 2:26b emphasizes that the &#8220;task&#8221; of the sinner is profitless: he labors hard to amass wealth, only to see the fruit of his labor given away to someone else. The righteous man&#8217;s enjoyment of his work and the fruit of his labor under the blessing of God (2:24-26a) is not included in this.</p>
