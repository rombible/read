<A NAME="299"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">99</span><note=182><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;he must turn over an inheritance&#8221;; or &#8220;he must turn it over, namely, an inheritance.&#8221; There are two approaches to the syntax of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1500;&#1456;&#1511;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khelqo</font>, &#8220;his inheritance&#8221;): (1) The 3rd person masculine singular suffix is a subjective genitive: &#8220;his inheritance&#8221; = the inheritance which he must give to his heir. The referent of the 3rd person masculine singular suffix is Qoheleth in 2:21a who worked hard to amass the fortune. The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1461;&#1500;&#1462;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kheleq</font>, &#8220;inheritance&#8221;) functions as an adverbial accusative of state (GKC 372 §118.<i>a</i>) or a predicate accusative (R. J. Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 12-13, §57): &#8220;He must give it [i.e., his fortune] as an inheritance.&#8221; (2) The 3rd person masculine singular suffix is an objective genitive: &#8220;his inheritance&#8221; = the inheritance which the heir will receive from Qoheleth. The referent of the 3rd person masculine singular suffix is the heir in 2:21b. The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1461;&#1500;&#1462;&#1511;</font> (&#8220;inheritance&#8221;) functions as the accusative direct object in apposition (R. J. Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 15-16, §71) to the 3rd person masculine singular suffix on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1462;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yittÿnennu</font>, &#8220;he must give it&#8221;; Qal imperfect 3rd person masculine singular from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">natan</font>, + 3rd person masculine singular suffix): &#8220;He must give it, namely, his inheritance, to one who did not work for it.&#8221;</p>
