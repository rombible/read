<A NAME="2117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">117</span><note=200><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>the task of amassing wealth</i> (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;the task of gathering and heaping up&#8221;) implicitly compares the work of the farmer reaping his crops and storing them up in a barn, to the work of the laborer amassing wealth as the fruit of his labor. However, rather than his storehouse being safe for the future, the sinner is deprived of it.</p>
