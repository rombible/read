<A NAME="2115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">115</span><note=198><b>tc</b> The MT reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mimmenni</font>, &#8220;more than I&#8221;). However, an alternate textual tradition of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mimmennu</font>,&#8220;apart from him [= God]&#8221;) is preserved in several medieval Hebrew <sc>mss, and is reflected in most of the versions (LXX, Syriac, Syro-Hexapla, and Jerome). The textual deviation is a case of simple orthographic confusion between <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yod</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vav</font>) as frequently happened, e.g., MT <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1493; &#1500;&#1510;&#1493; &#1510;&#1493; &#1500;&#1510;&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsv ltsv tsv ltsv</font>) versus 1QIsa<sup>a</sup> 28:10 <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1497; &#1500;&#1510;&#1497; &#1510;&#1497; &#1500;&#1510;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsy ltsy ts ltsy</font>); see P. K. McCarter, Jr., <i>Textual Criticism</i>, 47. It is difficult to determine which reading is original here. The MT forms a parenthetical clause, where Qoheleth refers to himself: no one had more of an opportunity to experience more enjoyment in life than he (e.g., 2:1-11). The alternate textual tradition is a causal clause, explaining why the ability to enjoy life is a gift from God: no one can experience enjoyment in life &#8220;apart from him,&#8221; that is, apart from &#8220;the hand of God&#8221; in 2:24. It is possible that internal evidence supports the alternate textual tradition. In 2:24-26, Qoheleth is not emphasizing his own resources to enjoy life, as he had done in 2:1-11; but that the ability to enjoy life is the gift of God. On the other hand, the Jerusalem Hebrew Bible project retains the MT reading with a &#8220;B&#8221; rating; see D. Barthélemy, ed., <i>Preliminary and Interim Report on the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project</i>, 3:570. The English versions are split on the textual problem: a few retain MT <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8220;more than I&#8221;), e.g., KJV, ASV, YLT, Douay, NJPS, while others adopt the alternate reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</font>, &#8220;apart from him&#8221; (NEB, NAB, MLB, NASB, RSV, NRSV, NIV, Moffatt).</p>
