<A NAME="232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=115><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;sons of a house&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497; &#1489;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">vÿne vayit</font>) appears to be parallel to &#8220;a son of my house&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ven-beti</font>) which refers to a person born into slavery from male and female servants in the master&#8217;s possession, e.g., Eleazar of Damascus (Gen 15:3). The phrase appears to denote children born from male and female slaves already in his possession, that is, &#8220;homeborn slaves&#8221; (NASB) or &#8220;other slaves who were born in my house&#8221; (NIV). Apparently confusing the sense of the phrase with the referent of the phrase in Gen 15:3, NJPS erroneously suggests &#8220;stewards&#8221; in Eccl 2:7.</p>
