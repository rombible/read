<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=101><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and my heart was leading along in wisdom.&#8221; The <i>vav</i> + noun, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿlibbi</font>) introduces a disjunctive, parenthetical clause designed to qualify the speaker&#8217;s remarks lest he be misunderstood: &#8220;Now my heart/mind&#8230;.&#8221; He emphasizes that he never lost control of his senses in this process. It was a purely mental, cognitive endeavor; he never actually gave himself over to wanton self-indulgence in wine or folly.</p>
