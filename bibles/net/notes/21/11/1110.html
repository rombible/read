<A NAME="1110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=700><b>sn</b> This proverb criticizes those who are overly cautious. The farmer who waits for the most opportune moment to plant when there is no wind to blow away the seed, and to reap when there is no rain to ruin a ripe harvest, will never do anything but sit around waiting for the right moment.</p>
