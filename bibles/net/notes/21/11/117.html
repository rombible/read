<A NAME="117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=697><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;investments&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text; it is added here for clarity. This line is traditionally understood as an exhortation to be generous to a multitude of people (KJV, NAB, ASV, NASB, RSV, NRSV, NIV, NJPS); however, it is better taken as shrewd advice to not commit all one&#8217;s possessions to a single venture (A. Cohen, <i>The Five Megilloth</i> [SoBB], 181). D. R. Glenn (&#8220;Ecclesiastes,&#8221; <i>BKCOT</i>, 1003) writes: &#8220;In view of the possibility of disaster, a person should make prudent investments in numerous ventures rather than put all his &#8216;eggs in one basket&#8217; (e.g., Gen 32:7-8 for a practical example of this advice).&#8221; Several translations reflect this: &#8220;Divide your merchandise among seven ventures, eight maybe&#8221; (NEB); &#8220;Take shares in several ventures&#8221; (Moffatt).</p>
