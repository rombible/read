<A NAME="113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=693><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;upon the surface of the waters.&#8221; This is traditionally viewed as extolling generosity from which a reward will be reaped. On the other hand, some scholars suggest that the imagery deals with commercial business through maritime trade. M. Jastrow took this verse as advice to take risks in business by trusting one&#8217;s goods or ships that will after many days return with a profit (A. Cohen, <i>The Five Megilloth</i> [SoBB], 181). Sea trade was risky in the ancient Near East, but it brought big returns to its investors (e.g., 1 Kgs 9:26-28; 10:22; Ps 107:23); see D. R. Glenn, &#8220;Ecclesiastes,&#8221; <i>BKCOT</i>, 1002-3. The verse is rendered thus: &#8220;Send your grain across the seas, and in time you will get a return&#8221; (NEB); or &#8220;Trust your goods far and wide at sea, till you get a good return after a while&#8221; (Moffatt).</p>
