<A NAME="116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=696><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;seven or eight&#8221; is a graded numerical saying depicting an indefinite plurality: &#8220;The collocation of a numeral with the next above it is a rhetorical device employed in numerical sayings to express a number, which need not, or cannot, be more exactly specified. It must be gathered from the context whether such formulae are intended to denote only an insignificant number (e.g., Is 17:6 &#8220;two&#8221; or at the most &#8220;three&#8221;) or a considerable number (e.g., Mi 5:4). Sometimes, however, this juxtaposition serves to express merely an indefinite total, without the collateral idea of intensifying the lower by means of the higher number&#8221; (GKC 437 §134.<i>s</i>). Examples: &#8220;one&#8221; or &#8220;two&#8221; (Deut 32:30; Jer 3:14; Job 33:14; 40:5; Ps 62:12); &#8220;two&#8221; or &#8220;three&#8221; (2 Kgs 9:32; Isa 17:6; Hos 6:2; Amos 4:8; Sir 23:16; 26:28; 50:25); &#8220;three&#8221; or &#8220;four&#8221; (Jer 36:23; Amos 1:3-11; Prov 21:19; 30:15, 18; Sir 26:5); &#8220;four&#8221; or &#8220;five&#8221; (Isa 17:6); &#8220;six&#8221; or &#8220;seven&#8221; (Job 5:19; Prov 6:16); &#8220;seven&#8221; or &#8220;eight&#8221; (Mic 5:4; Eccl 11:2).</p>
