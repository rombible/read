<A NAME="1115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=705><b>tn</b> The terms &#8220;morning&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1511;&#1462;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">boqer</font>) and &#8220;evening&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">erev</font>) form a merism (a figure of speech using two polar extremes to include everything in between) that connotes &#8220;from morning until evening.&#8221; The point is not that the farmer should plant at two times in the day (morning and evening), but that he should plant all day long (from morning until evening). This merism is reflected in several translations: &#8220;in the morning&#8230;until evening&#8221; (NEB, Moffatt).</p>
