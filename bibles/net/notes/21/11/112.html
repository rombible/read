<A NAME="112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=692><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your bread.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1462;&#1495;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lekhem</font>) is traditionally rendered &#8220;bread&#8221; (KJV, NAB, RSV, NRSV, ASV, NASB, NIV, NJPS). However, 11:1-2 seems to deal with exporting goods overseas (D. R. Glenn, &#8220;Ecclesiastes,&#8221; <i>BKCOT</i>, 1002-3). It is better to take <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1462;&#1495;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (&#8220;bread&#8221;) as a metonymy of product, standing for the grain and wheat from which bread is produced (e.g., Gen 41:54-55; 47:13, 15, 17, 19; 49:20; Num 15:19; 2 Kgs 18:32; Isa 28:28; 30:23; 36:17; 55:10; Jer 5:17; Ezek 48:18; Job 28:5; Ps 104:14; Prov 28:3); see <i>HALOT</i> 526 s.v. 1; BDB 537 s.v. 1.b. It is taken this way by several translations: &#8220;grain&#8221; (NEB) and &#8220;goods&#8221; (Moffatt). Qoheleth encouraged the export of grain products overseas in international trade.</p>
