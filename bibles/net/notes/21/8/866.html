<A NAME="866"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=551><b>sn</b> <i>Except to eat, drink, and enjoy life</i>. Qoheleth is not commending a self-indulgent lifestyle of Epicurean hedonism. Nor is he lamenting the absolute futility of life and the lack of eternal retribution. He is submitting to the reality that in a sin-cursed world there is much of human existence marked by relative futility. Since the righteous man cannot assume that he will automatically experience temporal prosperity and blessings on this earth, he should &#8211; at the very least &#8211; enjoy each day to its fullest as a gift from God. D. R. Glenn (&#8220;Ecclesiastes,&#8221; <i>BKCOT</i>, 997) notes, &#8220;Each day&#8217;s joys should be received as gifts from God&#8217;s hands and be savored as God permits (3:13; 5:19).&#8221;</p>
