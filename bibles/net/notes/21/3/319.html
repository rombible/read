<A NAME="319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=224><b>tn</b> Traditionally, &#8220;what God has done from the beginning to the end.&#8221; The temporal clause <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1512;&#1465;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;&#1470;&#1505;&#1493;&#1465;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mero</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">sh vÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ad-sof</font>, &#8220;from the beginning to the end&#8221;) is traditionally taken in reference to &#8220;eternity&#8221; (the traditional understanding of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1501;</font> [<font face="Scholar">ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">olam</font>] earlier in the verse; see the note on &#8220;ignorance&#8221;), e.g., KJV, NEB, NAB, ASV, NASB, NIV, RSV, NRSV. However, if <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1501;</font> simply denotes &#8220;the future&#8221; (e.g., <i>HALOT </i>799 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1501;</font> 2; BDB 762 s.v. III <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1501;</font> 2.a; <i>THAT</i> 2:241), this temporal clause would refer to the events God has ordained to transpire in an individual&#8217;s life, from beginning to end. This approach is adopted by one English version: &#8220;but without man ever guessing, from first to last, all the things that God brings to pass&#8221; (NJPS). This would fit well in the context begun in 3:1 with the fourteen merisms encompassing man&#8217;s life, starting with &#8220;a time to be born&#8221; (i.e., from the beginning in 3:11) and concluding with &#8220;a time to die&#8221; (i.e., to the end in 3:11). This approach is also supported by the admonition of 3:12-13, namely, since no one knows what will happen to him in the future days of his life, Qoheleth recommends that man enjoy each day as a gift from God.</p>
