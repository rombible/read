<A NAME="310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=215><b>sn</b> This rhetorical question is an example of negative affirmation, expecting a negative answer: &#8220;Man gains nothing from his toil!&#8221; (see E. W. Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, 949-51). Any <i>advantage</i> that man might <i>gain from his toil</i> is nullified by his ignorance of divine providence.</p>
