<A NAME="1238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=764><b>sn</b> The exhortation may be understood in two ways: (1) to avoid any so-called wisdom sayings beyond those mentioned in vv. 10-11: &#8220;The words of the wise&#8230;are given from one shepherd. And of anything beyond these, my son, be warned!&#8221; (see RSV, NRSV, NAB, Douay, NIV). This is paraphrased well by Moffatt: &#8220;My son, avoid anything beyond the scriptures of wisdom&#8221; (Moffatt). (2) The exhortation refers to the concerns of v. 12b, namely, diligent study is wearisome, i.e., &#8220;Furthermore, my son, be warned: there is no end to the making of books, and much study is wearisome to the body&#8221; (see NEB, ASV, NASB, MLB).</p>
