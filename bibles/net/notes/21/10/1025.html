<A NAME="1025"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=650><b>tn</b> The four imperfect verbs in vv. 8-9 may be nuanced as indicatives (&#8220;will&#8230;&#8221;) or in a modal sense denoting possibility (&#8220;may&#8230;&#8221;). The LXX rendered them with indicatives, as do many English translations (KJV, RSV, NRSV, ASV, MLB, YLT, NJPS). However, it is better to take them in a modal sense (NEB, NAB, NASB, NIV, NCV, CEV, NLT). One who digs a pit does not necessarily fall into it, but he may under the right conditions.</p>
