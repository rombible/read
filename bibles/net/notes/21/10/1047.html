<A NAME="1047"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=672><b>tn</b> This line may be interpreted in one of three ways: (1) &#8220;the labor of fools wearies him because he did not know enough to go to a town,&#8221; referring to the labor of the peasants who had not been able to find a place in town where life was easier; (2) &#8220;the labor of the fools so wearies everyone of them (singular pronoun taken in a distributive sense) so much that he even does not know how to go to town,&#8221; that is, he does not even know how to do the easiest thing in the world; (3) &#8220;let the labor of fools so weary him that he may not even know how to go to town,&#8221; taking the verb as a jussive, describing the foolish man described in 10:12-14. See D. Barthélemy, ed., <i>Preliminary and Interim Report on the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project</i>, 3:592&#8211;93.</p>
