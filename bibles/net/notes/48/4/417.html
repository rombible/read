<A NAME="417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=190><b>tn</b> The adjective &#8220;religious&#8221; has been supplied in the translation to make clear that the problem concerns observing certain days, etc. in a religious sense (cf. NIV, NRSV &#8220;special days&#8221;). In light of the polemic in this letter against the Judaizers (those who tried to force observance of the Mosaic law on Gentile converts to Christianity) this may well be a reference to the observance of Jewish Sabbaths, feasts, and other religious days.</p>
