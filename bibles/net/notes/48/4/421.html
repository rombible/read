<A NAME="421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=194><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;as an angel of God&#8230;as Christ Jesus.&#8221; This could be understood to mean either &#8220;you welcomed me like an angel of God would,&#8221; or &#8220;you welcomed me as though I were an angel of God.&#8221; In context only the second is accurate, so the translation has been phrased to indicate this.</p>
