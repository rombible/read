<A NAME="48"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=181><b>tn</b> The Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#965;&#7985;&#959;&#952;&#949;&#963;&#943;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Juioqesia</font>) was originally a legal technical term for adoption as a son with full rights of inheritance. BDAG 1024 s.v. notes, &#8220;a legal t.t. of &#8216;adoption&#8217; of children, in our lit., i.e. in Paul, only in a transferred sense of a transcendent filial relationship between God and humans (with the legal aspect, not gender specificity, as major semantic component).&#8221; Although some modern translations remove the filial sense completely and render the term merely &#8220;adoption&#8221; (cf. NAB), the retention of this component of meaning was accomplished in the present translation by the phrase &#8220;as sons.&#8221;</p>
