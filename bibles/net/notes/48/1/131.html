There is hardly any reason why scribes would omit the words (although the Beatty papyrus and the Western text do at times omit words and phrases), but several reasons why scribes would add the words (especially the need to clarify). The confluence of witnesses for the shorter reading (including a few fathers and versions) adds strong support for its authenticity. It is also in keeping with Paul&#8217;s style to refrain from mentioning God by name as a rhetorical device (cf. <i>ExSyn</i> 437 [although this section deals with passive constructions, the principle is the same]). NA<sup>27</sup> includes the words in brackets, indicating some doubts as to their authenticity.</p>
