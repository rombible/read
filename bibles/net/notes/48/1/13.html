Thus, the reading adopted in the translation is more widespread geographically and is found in the two earliest witnesses, along with several good representatives of the Alexandrian, Western, and Byzantine texttypes. Internally, there would be a strong motivation for scribes to change the order: &#8220;from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ&#8221; is Paul&#8217;s normal greeting; here alone is the pronoun attached to &#8220;Jesus Christ&#8221; (except in the pastorals, though the greeting in these letters is nevertheless unlike the rest of the <i>corpus Paulinum</i>). Intrinsically, the chosen reading is superior as well: Scribes would be prone to emulate Paul&#8217;s regular style, while in an early letter such as this one his regular style was yet to be established (for a similar situation, cf. the text-critical discussion at 1 Thess 1:1). Hence, there is a strong probability that the reading in the translation is authentic. Although B. M. Metzger argues that &#8220;the apostle&#8217;s stereotyped formula was altered by copyists who, apparently in the interest of Christian piety, transferred the possessive pronoun so it would be more closely associated with &#8216;Lord Jesus Christ&#8217;&#8221; (<i>TCGNT</i> 520), one might expect to see the same alterations in other Pauline letters. That this is not the case argues for &#8220;our Lord Jesus Christ&#8221; as the authentic reading here.</p>
