If it is a subjective genitive, the meaning is &#8220;a revelation from Jesus Christ&#8221; but if objective genitive, it is &#8220;a revelation about Jesus Christ.&#8221; Most likely this is objective since the explanation in vv. 15-16 mentions God revealing the Son to Paul so that he might preach, although the idea of a direct revelation to Paul at some point cannot be ruled out.</p>
