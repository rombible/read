During the Roman occupation, some independent kingdoms arose like that of the Nabateans south of Damascus, and these could be called simply Arabia. In light of the proximity to Damascus, this may well be the territory Paul says he visited here. See also C. W. Briggs, &#8220;The Apostle Paul in Arabia,&#8221; <i>Biblical World </i>41 (1913): 255-59.</p>
