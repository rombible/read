The construction &#8220;of God and Christ&#8221; appears to be motivated as a more explicit affirmation of the deity of Christ (following as it apparently does the Granville Sharp rule). Although Paul certainly has an elevated Christology, explicit &#8220;God-talk&#8221; with reference to Jesus does not normally appear until the later books (cf., e.g., Titus 2:13, Phil 2:10-11, and probably Rom 9:5). For different arguments but the same textual conclusions, see <i>TCGNT</i> 524.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I live by faith in the Son of God.&#8221; See note on &#8220;faithfulness of Jesus Christ&#8221; in v. 16 for the rationale behind the translation &#8220;the faithfulness of the Son of God.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> On the phrase <i>because of the faithfulness of the Son of God</i>,<i> ExSyn</i> 116, which notes that the grammar is not decisive, nevertheless suggests that &#8220;the faith/faithfulness of Christ is not a denial of faith <i>in </i>Christ as a Pauline concept (for the idea is expressed in many of the same contexts, only with the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#969;</font> rather than the noun), but implies that the object of faith is a worthy object, for he himself is faithful.&#8221; Though Paul elsewhere teaches justification by faith, this presupposes that the object of our faith is reliable and worthy of such faith.</p>
