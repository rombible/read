<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=70><b>tn</b> The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7984;&#948;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">idontes</font>) has been taken temporally to retain the structure of the passage. Many modern translations, because of the length of the sentence here, translate this participle as a finite verb and break the Greek sentences into several English sentences (NIV, for example, begins new sentences at the beginning of both vv. 8 and 9).</p>
