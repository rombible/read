<A NAME="260"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=108><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has been translated as &#8220;So&#8221; to bring out the connection of the following clauses with the preceding ones. What Paul says here amounts to a result or inference drawn from his co-crucifixion with Christ and the fact that Christ now lives in him. In Greek this is a continuation of the preceding sentence, but the construction is too long and complex for contemporary English style, so a new sentence was started here in the translation.</p>
