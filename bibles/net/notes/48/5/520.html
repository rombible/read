<A NAME="520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=237><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;make eunuchs of themselves&#8221;; <i>Grk</i> &#8220;cut themselves off.&#8221; This statement is rhetorical hyperbole on Paul&#8217;s part. It does strongly suggest, however, that Paul&#8217;s adversaries in this case (&#8220;those agitators&#8221;) were men. Some interpreters (notably Erasmus and the Reformers) have attempted to soften the meaning to a figurative &#8220;separate themselves&#8221; (meaning the opponents would withdraw from fellowship) but such an understanding dramatically weakens the rhetorical force of Paul&#8217;s argument. Although it has been argued that such an act of emasculation would be unthinkable for Paul, it must be noted that Paul&#8217;s statement is one of biting sarcasm, obviously not meant to be taken literally. See further G. Stählin, <i>TDNT</i> 3:853-55.</p>
