J. Wu, &#8220;A Systematic Analysis of the Shorter Readings in the Byzantine Text of the Synoptic Gospels&#8221; [Ph.D. diss., Dallas Theological Seminary, 2002]). On the strength of the alignment of <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup> with the Western and Byzantine texttypes, the shorter reading is preferred. NA<sup>27</sup> includes the word in brackets, indicating doubts as to its authenticity.</p>
