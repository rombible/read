<A NAME="346"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=159><b>tc</b> The reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">tou qeou</font>, &#8220;of God&#8221;) is well attested in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A C D (F G read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> without the article) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 0278 33 1739 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat sy co. However, <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup> B d Ambst lack the words. <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup> and B perhaps should not to be given as much weight as they normally are, since the combination of these two witnesses often produces a secondary shorter reading against all others. In addition, one might expect that if the shorter reading were original other variants would have crept into the textual tradition early on. But 104 (<sc>a.d. 1087) virtually stands alone with the variant <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">tou Cristou</font>, &#8220;of Christ&#8221;). Nevertheless, if <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> were not part of the original text, it is the kind of variant that would be expected to show up early and often, especially in light of Paul&#8217;s usage elsewhere (Rom 4:20; 2 Cor 1:20). A slight preference should be given to the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> over the omission. NA<sup>27</sup> rightly places the words in brackets, indicating doubts as to their authenticity.</p>
