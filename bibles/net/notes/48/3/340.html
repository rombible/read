<A NAME="340"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=153><b>tc</b> For <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#949;&#964;&#941;&#952;&#951;</font> (<font face="Greektl">proseteqh</font>) several Western <sc>mss have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#964;&#941;&#952;&#951;</font> (<font face="Greektl">eteqh</font>, &#8220;it was established&#8221;; so D* F G it Ir<sup>lat</sup> Ambst Spec). The net effect of this reading, in conjunction with the largely Western reading of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#940;&#958;&#949;&#969;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">praxewn</font>) for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#946;&#940;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">parabasewn</font>), seems to be a very positive assessment of the law. But there are compelling reasons for rejecting this reading: (1) externally, it is provincial and relatively late; (2) internally: (a) transcriptionally, there seems to be a much higher transcriptional probability that a scribe would try to smooth over Paul&#8217;s harsh saying here about the law than <i>vice versa</i>; (b) intrinsically: [1] Paul has already argued that the law came after the promise (vv. 15-18), indicating, more than likely, its temporary nature; [2] the verb &#8220;was added&#8221; in v. 19 (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#949;&#964;&#941;&#952;&#951;</font>) is different from the verb in v. 15 (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#948;&#953;&#945;&#964;&#940;&#963;&#963;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;</font>, <font face="Greektl">epidiatassetai</font>); virtually all exegetes recognize this as an intentional linguistic shift on Paul&#8217;s part in order not to contradict his statement in v. 15; [3] the temper of 3:1&#8211;4:7 is decidedly against a positive statement about the Torah&#8217;s role in <i>Heilsgeschichte</i>.</p>
