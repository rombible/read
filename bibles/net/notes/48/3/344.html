<A NAME="344"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=157><b>tn</b> Many modern translations (NASB, NIV, NRSV) render this word (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#949;&#963;&#943;&#964;&#951;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">mesith&quot;</font>; here and in v. 20) as &#8220;mediator,&#8221; but this conveys a wrong impression in contemporary English. If this is referring to Moses, he certainly did not &#8220;mediate&#8221; between God and Israel but was an intermediary on God&#8217;s behalf. Moses was not a mediator, for example, who worked for compromise between opposing parties. He instead was God&#8217;s representative to his people who enabled them to have a relationship, but entirely on God&#8217;s terms.</p>
