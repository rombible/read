<a name="135"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=35><b>tn</b> Although the Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">doulos</font>) is sometimes translated &#8220;servant&#8221; here (so KJV), the word &#8220;slave&#8221; is a much more candid and realistic picture of the relationship between Philemon and Onesimus. In the Greco-Roman world of the 1st century the slave was considered a &#8220;living tool&#8221; of the master. The slave was &#8220;property&#8221; in every sense of the word. This understanding heightens the tense scenario that is in view here. It is likely that Onesimus may have even feared for his life upon returning to Colossae. Undoubtedly Paul has asked this runaway slave to return to what could amount to a potentially severe and life-endangering situation.</p>
