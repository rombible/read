<a name="128"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=28><b>tc</b> There are several variants at this point in the text, most of them involving the addition of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#955;&#945;&#946;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">proslabou</font>, &#8220;receive, accept&#8221;) at various locations in the verse. But all such variants seem to be motivated by the harsh syntax of the verse without this verb. Without the verb, the meaning is that Onesimus is Paul&#8217;s &#8220;very heart,&#8221; though this is an awkward expression especially because of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#965;&#964;&#8127; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">tout</font>&#8217; <font face="Greektl">estin</font>, &#8220;this is, who is&#8221;) in the middle cluttering the construction. Nowhere else in the NT is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#960;&#955;&#940;&#947;&#967;&#957;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">splancna</font>, here translated &#8220;heart&#8221;) used in apposition to people. It is thus natural that scribes would want to fill out the text here, and they did so apparently with a verb that was ready at hand (borrowed from v. 17). With the verb the sentence is converted into an object-complement construction: &#8220;I have sent him back to you; accept him, that is, as my very heart.&#8221; But both the fact that some important witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* A F G 33 <i>pc</i>) lack the verb, and that its location floats in the various constructions that have it, suggest that the original text did not have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#955;&#945;&#946;&#959;&#8166;</font>.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;whom I have sent.&#8221; The Greek sentence was broken up in the English translation for the sake of clarity. Although the tense of the Greek verb here is past (an aorist tense) the reader should understand that Onesimus may well have been standing in the very presence of Paul as he wrote this letter. </p>
