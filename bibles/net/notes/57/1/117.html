<a name="117"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=17><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;that the fellowship of your faith might become effective in the knowledge of everything good that is in us in Christ.&#8221; There are numerous difficulties with the translation and interpretation of this verse: (1) What is the meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969; &#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#969;&#957;&#943;&#945; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#969;&#962; &#963;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jh koinwnia th&quot; pistew&quot; sou</font>, &#8220;the fellowship of your faith&#8221;)? Several suggestions are noted: (a) taking <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#969;&#957;&#943;&#945;</font> as a reference to &#8220;monetary support&#8221; and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8134;&#962; &#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#969;&#962;</font> as a genitive of source, the phrase could refer to Philemon&#8217;s financial giving which he has done according to his faith; (b) taking <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#969;&#957;&#943;&#945;</font> as a reference to &#8220;sharing&#8221; or &#8220;communicating&#8221; and the genitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8134;&#962; &#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#969;&#962;</font> as an objective genitive, then the meaning would be &#8220;sharing the faith&#8221; as a reference to evangelistic activity; (c) taking <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#969;&#957;&#943;&#945;</font> in a distributive sense referring to fellowship with other believers, and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8134;&#962; &#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#969;&#962;</font> as a reference to the common trust all Christians have in Jesus, then the meaning is Christian fellowship centered on faith in Jesus; (d) taking <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#969;&#957;&#943;&#945;</font> as a reference to &#8220;participation&#8221; and the genitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8134;&#962; &#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#969;&#962;</font> as a reference to the thing participated in, the meaning would then be Philemon&#8217;s &#8220;participation in the faith&#8221;; (2) what is the meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#8053;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">energh&quot;</font>; Does it mean &#8220;active&#8221; or &#8220;effective&#8221;?) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#947;&#957;&#8061;&#963;&#949;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">epignwsei</font>; Does it refer to simply understanding? Or &#8220;experiencing&#8221; as well?); (3) what is the meaning of the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">panto&quot; agaqou</font>)? and (4) what is the force of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ei&quot; Criston</font>)? It is difficult to arrive at an interpretation that deals adequately with all these questions, but given the fact that Paul stresses what Philemon has done for the brothers (cf. the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#940;&#961;</font> [<font face="Greektl">gar</font>] in v. 7), it seems that his concern in v. 6 is on Philemon&#8217;s fellowship with other believers and how he has worked hard to refresh them. In this interpretation: (1) the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969; &#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#969;&#957;&#943;&#945; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#969;&#962; &#963;&#959;&#965;</font> is taken to refer to fellowship with other believers; (2) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#8053;&#962;</font> is taken to mean &#8220;effective&#8221; (i.e., <i>more </i>effective) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#947;&#957;&#8061;&#963;&#949;&#953;</font> involves both understanding and experience; (3) the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#959;&#8166;</font> refers to every spiritual blessing and (4) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> carries a locative idea meaning &#8220;in Christ.&#8221; The result is that Paul prays for Philemon that he will be equipped to encourage and love the saints <i>more</i> as he himself is brought to a place of deeper understanding of every spiritual blessing he has in Christ; out of the overflow of his own life, he will minister to others. </p>
