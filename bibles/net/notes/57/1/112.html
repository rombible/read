<a name="112"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=12><b>sn</b> <i>Your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints. </i>In accord with Paul, John also advocates this combination of &#8220;faith in Christ and love for the saints.&#8221; The believers&#8217; invisible faith becomes visible in the demonstration of love for others. This, of course, is not only desired, but commanded (1 John 3:23). Although Paul&#8217;s comment here may appear as a stock expression to the casual reader, praising Philemon for his track record of faithfulness to Christ demonstrated in love for the saints is actually integral to the author&#8217;s argument in this short but pithy letter. Paul will soon ask Philemon to demonstrate this love toward Onesimus, his runaway slave.</p>
