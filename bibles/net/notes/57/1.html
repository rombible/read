Further, the earliest and best witnesses, along with a few others (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A D* F G I P 048 0278 33 81 104 1739 1881 <i>pc</i>), have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#8135;</font> (<font face="Greektl">adelfh</font>, &#8220;sister&#8221;). Thus on internal and external grounds, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#8135;</font> is the strongly preferred reading.</p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=7><b>tn</b> Though the term &#8220;our&#8221; does not appear in the Greek text it is inserted to bring out the sense of the passage. </p>

Rom 1:8, 1 Cor 1:4, Eph 1:16, Col 1:3, 1 Thess 1:2, 2 Thess 1:3). The content of the thanksgiving typically points to the work of God in the salvation of the believers to whom he [Paul] writes.</p>
<a name="110"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=10><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;making remembrance (or &#8220;mention&#8221;) of you in my prayers.&#8221;</p>

<a name="112"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=12><b>sn</b> <i>Your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints. </i>In accord with Paul, John also advocates this combination of &#8220;faith in Christ and love for the saints.&#8221; The believers&#8217; invisible faith becomes visible in the demonstration of love for others. This, of course, is not only desired, but commanded (1 John 3:23). Although Paul&#8217;s comment here may appear as a stock expression to the casual reader, praising Philemon for his track record of faithfulness to Christ demonstrated in love for the saints is actually integral to the author&#8217;s argument in this short but pithy letter. Paul will soon ask Philemon to demonstrate this love toward Onesimus, his runaway slave.</p>
<a name="113"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=13><b>tn</b> The Greek is somewhat awkward here. It appears as though the text reads &#8220;&#8230;the love and faith which you have for the Lord Jesus and for all the saints.&#8221; In other Pauline letters the emphasis seems to be &#8220;faith in Christ Jesus and love for all of the saints.&#8221; Some ancient <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> have altered the wording to produce a smoother reading; scribes changed the wording to resemble the more readable versions in Eph 1:15 and Col 1:4, &#8220;your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have to all the saints.&#8221;</p>
<a name="114"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=14><b>tn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#960;&#969;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">{opw&quot;</font>) refers back to the idea of prayer (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#957;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#957; &#963;&#959;&#965; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#973;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#949;&#965;&#967;&#8182;&#957; &#956;&#959;&#965;</font>, <font face="Greektl">mneian sou poioumeno&quot; epi twn proseucwn mou</font>) in 1:4.

Internally, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</font> could be favored because of second person pronouns surrounding it, making it the harder reading. On the other hand, the last second person <i>plural</i> pronoun was in v. 3, and the next one will not show up until v. 22, a fact which tends to counter the internal argument on behalf of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</font>. Although a decision is difficult, with the internal evidence being capable of favoring either reading, our preference is based on the external evidence; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</font> is thus slightly preferred.</p>
<a name="117"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=17><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;that the fellowship of your faith might become effective in the knowledge of everything good that is in us in Christ.&#8221; There are numerous difficulties with the translation and interpretation of this verse: (1) What is the meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969; &#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#969;&#957;&#943;&#945; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#969;&#962; &#963;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jh koinwnia th&quot; pistew&quot; sou</font>, &#8220;the fellowship of your faith&#8221;)? Several suggestions are noted: (a) taking <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#969;&#957;&#943;&#945;</font> as a reference to &#8220;monetary support&#8221; and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8134;&#962; &#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#969;&#962;</font> as a genitive of source, the phrase could refer to Philemon&#8217;s financial giving which he has done according to his faith; (b) taking <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#969;&#957;&#943;&#945;</font> as a reference to &#8220;sharing&#8221; or &#8220;communicating&#8221; and the genitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8134;&#962; &#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#969;&#962;</font> as an objective genitive, then the meaning would be &#8220;sharing the faith&#8221; as a reference to evangelistic activity; (c) taking <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#969;&#957;&#943;&#945;</font> in a distributive sense referring to fellowship with other believers, and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8134;&#962; &#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#969;&#962;</font> as a reference to the common trust all Christians have in Jesus, then the meaning is Christian fellowship centered on faith in Jesus; (d) taking <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#969;&#957;&#943;&#945;</font> as a reference to &#8220;participation&#8221; and the genitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8134;&#962; &#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#969;&#962;</font> as a reference to the thing participated in, the meaning would then be Philemon&#8217;s &#8220;participation in the faith&#8221;; (2) what is the meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#8053;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">energh&quot;</font>; Does it mean &#8220;active&#8221; or &#8220;effective&#8221;?) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#947;&#957;&#8061;&#963;&#949;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">epignwsei</font>; Does it refer to simply understanding? Or &#8220;experiencing&#8221; as well?); (3) what is the meaning of the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">panto&quot; agaqou</font>)? and (4) what is the force of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ei&quot; Criston</font>)? It is difficult to arrive at an interpretation that deals adequately with all these questions, but given the fact that Paul stresses what Philemon has done for the brothers (cf. the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#940;&#961;</font> [<font face="Greektl">gar</font>] in v. 7), it seems that his concern in v. 6 is on Philemon&#8217;s fellowship with other believers and how he has worked hard to refresh them. In this interpretation: (1) the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969; &#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#969;&#957;&#943;&#945; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#969;&#962; &#963;&#959;&#965;</font> is taken to refer to fellowship with other believers; (2) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#8053;&#962;</font> is taken to mean &#8220;effective&#8221; (i.e., <i>more </i>effective) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#947;&#957;&#8061;&#963;&#949;&#953;</font> involves both understanding and experience; (3) the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#959;&#8166;</font> refers to every spiritual blessing and (4) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> carries a locative idea meaning &#8220;in Christ.&#8221; The result is that Paul prays for Philemon that he will be equipped to encourage and love the saints <i>more</i> as he himself is brought to a place of deeper understanding of every spiritual blessing he has in Christ; out of the overflow of his own life, he will minister to others. </p>

The lack of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> is read by most witnesses, including <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> A C D 0278 1739 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> it.

<a name="128"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=28><b>tc</b> There are several variants at this point in the text, most of them involving the addition of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#955;&#945;&#946;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">proslabou</font>, &#8220;receive, accept&#8221;) at various locations in the verse. But all such variants seem to be motivated by the harsh syntax of the verse without this verb. Without the verb, the meaning is that Onesimus is Paul&#8217;s &#8220;very heart,&#8221; though this is an awkward expression especially because of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#965;&#964;&#8127; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">tout</font>&#8217; <font face="Greektl">estin</font>, &#8220;this is, who is&#8221;) in the middle cluttering the construction.

It is thus natural that scribes would want to fill out the text here, and they did so apparently with a verb that was ready at hand (borrowed from v. 17). With the verb the sentence is converted into an object-complement construction: &#8220;I have sent him back to you; accept him, that is, as my very heart.&#8221; But both the fact that some important witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* A F G 33 <i>pc</i>) lack the verb, and that its location floats in the various constructions that have it, suggest that the original text did not have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#955;&#945;&#946;&#959;&#8166;</font>.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;whom I have sent.&#8221; The Greek sentence was broken up in the English translation for the sake of clarity.

In the Greco-Roman world of the 1st century the slave was considered a &#8220;living tool&#8221; of the master. The slave was &#8220;property&#8221; in every sense of the word. This understanding heightens the tense scenario that is in view here. It is likely that Onesimus may have even feared for his life upon returning to Colossae. Undoubtedly Paul has asked this runaway slave to return to what could amount to a potentially severe and life-endangering situation.</p>
