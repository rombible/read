<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1073><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Behold, I have prepared my dinner.&#8221; In some contexts, however, to translate <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ariston</font>) as &#8220;dinner&#8221; somewhat misses the point. L&amp;N 23.22 here suggests, &#8220;See now, the feast I have prepared (for you is ready).&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1074><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has not been translated.</p>

<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1076><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;he sent his soldiers, destroyed those murderers.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#8061;&#955;&#949;&#963;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">apwlesen</font>) is causative, indicating that the king was the one behind the execution of the murderers. In English the causative idea is not expressed naturally here; either a purpose clause (&#8220;he sent his soldiers to put those murderers to death&#8221;) or a relative clause (&#8220;he sent his soldier who put those murderers to death&#8221;) is preferred. </p>
<A NAME="227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1077><b>tn</b> The Greek text reads here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#972;&#955;&#953;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">polis</font>), which could be translated &#8220;town&#8221; or &#8220;city.&#8221; The prophetic reference is to the city of Jerusalem, so &#8220;city&#8221; is more appropriate here.</p>
<A NAME="228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1078><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;he was silent.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1079><b>sn</b> See the note on <i>Pharisees</i> in 3:7.</p>
<A NAME="2210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1080><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;trap him in word.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1081><b>sn</b> The <i>Herodians</i> are mentioned in the NT only once in Matt (22:16 = Mark 12:13) and twice in Mark (3:6; 12:13; some <sc>mss also read &#8220;Herodians&#8221; instead of &#8220;Herod&#8221; in Mark 8:15). It is generally assumed that as a group the Herodians were Jewish supporters of the Herodian dynasty (or of Herod Antipas in particular). In every instance they are linked with the Pharisees. This probably reflects agreement regarding political objectives (nationalism as opposed to submission to the yoke of Roman oppression) rather than philosophy or religious beliefs.</p>
<A NAME="2212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1082><b>sn</b> <i>Teach the way of God in accordance with the truth.</i> Very few comments are as deceitful as this one; they did not really believe this at all. The question of the Pharisees and Herodians was specifically designed to trap Jesus.</p>
<A NAME="2213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1083><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;And it is not a concern to you about anyone because you do not see the face of men.&#8221;</p>

On the syntax of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#958;&#949;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">exestin</font>) with an infinitive and accusative, see BDF §409.3.</p>
<A NAME="2215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1085><b>tn</b> According to L&amp;N 57.180 the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#8134;&#957;&#963;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">khnso&quot;</font>) was borrowed from Latin and referred to a poll tax, a tax paid by each adult male to the Roman government.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This question concerning <i>taxes</i> was specifically designed to trap Jesus. If he answered yes, then his opponents could publicly discredit him as a sympathizer with Rome. If he answered no, then they could go to the Roman governor and accuse Jesus of rebellion.</p>
<A NAME="2216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1086><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;to the emperor&#8221; (&#8220;Caesar&#8221; is a title for the Roman emperor).</p>
<A NAME="2217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1087><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has been translated as &#8220;so&#8221; to indicate their response to Jesus&#8217; request for a coin.</p>
<A NAME="2218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1088><b>tn</b> Here the specific name of the coin was retained in the translation, because not all coins in circulation in Palestine at the time carried the image of Caesar. In other places <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#951;&#957;&#940;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">dhnarion</font>) has been translated simply as &#8220;silver coin&#8221; with an explanatory note.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> A<i> denarius</i> was a silver coin worth approximately one day&#8217;s wage for a laborer. The fact that they had such a coin showed that they already operated in the economic world of Rome. The <i>denarius</i> would have had a picture of Tiberius Caesar stamped on it.</p>
<A NAME="2219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1089><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;And he&#8221;; the referent (Jesus) has been specified in the translation for clarity.

<A NAME="2220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1090><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;whose likeness.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In this passage Jesus points to the <i>image </i>(<i>Grk</i> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#954;&#8061;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">eikwn</font>) of Caesar on the coin. This same Greek word is used in Gen 1:26 (LXX) to state that humanity is made in the &#8220;image&#8221; of God. Jesus is making a subtle yet powerful contrast: Caesar&#8217;s image is on the denarius, so he can lay claim to money through taxation, but God&#8217;s image is on humanity, so he can lay claim to each individual life.</p>
<A NAME="2221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1091><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;they said to him.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="2223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1093><b>sn</b> Jesus&#8217; answer to <i>give to Caesar the things that are Caesar&#8217;s, and to God the things that are God&#8217;s </i>was a both/and, not the questioners&#8217; either/or. So he slipped out of their trap.</p>
<A NAME="2224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1094><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;they were amazed; they marveled.&#8221; </p>

<A NAME="2226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1096><b>sn</b> This remark is best regarded as a parenthetical note by the author.</p>
<A NAME="2227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1097><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;and asked him, saying.&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">legontes</font>) is redundant in contemporary English and has not been translated.</p>
<A NAME="2228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1098><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;and raise up seed,&#8221; an idiom for fathering children (L&amp;N 23.59).</p>
<A NAME="2229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1099><b>sn</b> A quotation from Deut 25:5. This practice is called levirate marriage (see also Ruth 4:1-12; Mishnah,<i> m. Yevamot; </i>Josephus<i>, Ant. </i>4.8.23 [4.254-256]). The levirate law is described in Deut 25:5-10. The brother of a man who died without a son had an obligation to marry his brother&#8217;s widow. This served several purposes: It provided for the widow in a society where a widow with no children to care for her would be reduced to begging, and it preserved the name of the deceased, who would be regarded as the legal father of the first son produced from that marriage.</p>
<A NAME="2230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1100><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has not been translated.</p>

Whether with or without the article, the reading &#8220;of God&#8221; appears to be motivated as a natural expansion. A few important witnesses lack the adjunct (B D <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> {0233} <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup> 700 {sa}); this coupled with strong internal evidence argues for the shorter reading.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Angels</i> do not die, nor do they eat according to Jewish tradition (<i>1 En.</i> 15:6; 51:4; Wis 5:5; <i>2 Bar.</i> 51:10; 1QH 3.21-23).</p>

<A NAME="2237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1107><b>sn</b> <i>He is not God of the dead but of the living.</i> Jesus&#8217; point was that if God could identify himself as God of the three old patriarchs, then they must still be alive when God spoke to Moses; and so they must be raised.</p>
<A NAME="2238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1108><b>sn</b> See the note on <i>Pharisees</i> in 3:7.</p>

<A NAME="2246"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1116><b>sn</b> A quotation from Deut 6:5. The threefold reference to different parts of the person says, in effect, that one should love God with all one&#8217;s being.</p>

<A NAME="2253"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1123><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Messiah&#8221;; both &#8220;Christ&#8221; (Greek) and &#8220;Messiah&#8221; (Hebrew and Aramaic) mean &#8220;one who has been anointed.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> See the note on <i>Christ</i> in 1:16.</p>
<A NAME="2254"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1124><b>sn</b> It was a common belief in Judaism that Messiah would be <i>the son of David </i>in that he would come from the lineage of David. On this point the Pharisees agreed<i> </i>and were correct. But their understanding was nonetheless incomplete, for Messiah is also David&#8217;s Lord. With this statement Jesus was affirming that, as the Messiah, he is both God and man.</p>
<A NAME="2255"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=1125><b>sn</b> <i>The Lord said to my Lord. </i>With David being the speaker, this indicates his respect for his descendant (referred to as <i>my Lord</i>). Jesus was arguing, as the ancient exposition assumed, that the passage is about the Lord&#8217;s anointed. The passage looks at an enthronement of this figure and a declaration of honor for him as he takes his place at the side of God. In Jerusalem, the king&#8217;s palace was located to the right of the temple to indicate this kind of relationship. Jesus was pressing the language here to get his opponents to reflect on how great Messiah is.</p>
