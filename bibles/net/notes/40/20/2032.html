The same <sc>mss also have the Lord&#8217;s response, &#8220;and you will be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized&#8221; in v. 23, again due to the parallel in Mark 10:39. The shorter reading, in both v. 22 and v. 23, is to be preferred both because it better explains the rise of the other reading and is found in superior witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B D L Z <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> 085 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> <i>pc </i>lat, as well as other versional and patristic authorities).</p>
