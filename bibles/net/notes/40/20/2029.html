<A NAME="2029"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=983><b>tc</b> A majority of witnesses read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">sou</font>, &#8220;your&#8221;) here, perhaps for clarification. At the same time, it is possible that the pronoun dropped out through haplography or was excised because of perceived redundancy (there are two other such pronouns in the verse) by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B. Either way, the translation adds it due to the requirements of English style. NA<sup>27</sup> includes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#959;&#965;</font> here.</p>
