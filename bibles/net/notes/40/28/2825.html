<A NAME="2825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1525><b>tn</b> The Greek text reads here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#7985; &#948;&#8050; &#7952;&#948;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#945;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joi de edistasan</font>). Some scholars argue that the article is functioning like a personal pronoun, thus &#8220;<i>they</i> doubted&#8221; (e.g., D. A. Hagner, <i>Matthew</i> [WBC], 2:884). If so, then all the disciples would be in view. The translation of the text takes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#7985;</font> as an alternative pronoun which has a partitive notion (i.e., some of the disciples doubted, but not all). The difficulty with the personal pronoun view is that there are no examples of it in Matthew in which the same subject immediately precedes with its own verb (as would be the case in &#8220;they worshiped&#8230;they doubted&#8221;). Such, in fact, would be quite awkward, for the article would be unnecessary since the pronominal referent is already embedded in the verb. The only reason for the article here would be to distinguish the subject in some way; but if the same subject is in view, no distinction is being made.</p>
