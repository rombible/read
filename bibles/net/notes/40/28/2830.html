<A NAME="2830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1530><b>sn</b> <i>I am with you</i>.<i> </i>Matthew&#8217;s Gospel begins with the prophecy that the Savior&#8217;s name would be &#8220;Emmanuel, that is, &#8216;God <i>with</i> us,&#8217;&#8221; (1:23, in which the author has linked Isa 7:14 and 8:8, 10 together) and it ends with Jesus&#8217; promise to be <i>with</i> his disciples forever. The Gospel of Matthew thus forms an inclusio about Jesus in his relationship to his people that suggests his deity.</p>
