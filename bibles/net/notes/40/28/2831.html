<A NAME="2831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1531><b>tc</b> Most <sc>mss (A<sup>c </sup><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> it sy) have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">amhn</font>, &#8220;amen&#8221;) at the end of v. 20. Such a conclusion is routinely added by scribes to NT books because a few of these books originally had such an ending (cf. Rom 16:27; Gal 6:18; Jude 25). A majority of Greek witnesses have the concluding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957; </font>in every NT book except Acts, James, and 3 John (and even in these books, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> is found in some witnesses). It is thus a predictable variant. Further, no good reason exists for the omission of the particle in significant and early witnesses such as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A* B D W <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup> 33 <i>al</i> lat sa.</p>
