<A NAME="2828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1528><b>tc</b> Although some scholars have denied that the trinitarian baptismal formula in the Great Commission was a part of the original text of Matthew, there is no ms support for their contention. F. C. Conybeare, &#8220;The Eusebian Form of the Text of Mt. 28:19,&#8221; <i>ZNW </i>2 (1901): 275-88, based his view on a faulty reading of Eusebius&#8217; quotations of this text. The shorter reading has also been accepted, on other grounds, by a few other scholars. For discussion (and refutation of the conjecture that removes this baptismal formula), see B. J. Hubbard, <i>The Matthean Redaction of a Primitive Apostolic Commissioning </i>(SBLDS 19), 163-64, 167-75; and Jane Schaberg, <i>The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit</i> (SBLDS 61), 27-29.</p>
