<A NAME="81"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=279><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;And behold, a leper came.&#8221; The Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7984;&#948;&#959;&#973;</font> (<font face="Greektl">idou</font>) has not been translated because it has no exact English equivalent here, but adds interest and emphasis (BDAG 468 s.v. 1).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The ancient term for leprosy covers a wider array of conditions than what we call leprosy today. A <i>leper </i>was totally ostracized from society until he was declared cured (Lev 13:45-46).</p>
<A NAME="82"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=280><b>tn</b><i> Grk</i> &#8220;a leper approaching, bowed low before him, saying.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="83"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=281><b>tn</b> This is a third class condition. The report portrays the leper making no presumptions about whether Jesus will heal him or not.</p>
<A NAME="84"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=282><b>sn</b> <i>Touched. </i>This touch would have rendered Jesus ceremonially unclean (Lev 14:46; also Mishnah, <i>m. Nega&#8217;im</i> 3.1; 11.1; 12.1; 13.6-12).</p>
<A NAME="85"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=283><b>sn</b> The command for silence was probably meant to last only until the cleansing took place with the priests and sought to prevent Jesus&#8217; healings from becoming the central focus of the people&#8217;s reaction to him. See also 9:30, 12:16, 16:20, and 17:9 for other cases where Jesus asks for silence concerning him and his ministry.</p>
<A NAME="86"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=284><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;gift.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="87"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=285><b>sn</b> On the phrase bring the offering that Moses commanded see Lev 14:1-32.</p>
<A NAME="88"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=286><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;as an indictment against them.&#8221; The pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">autoi&quot;</font>) may be a dative of disadvantage.</p>
<A NAME="89"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=287><b>sn</b> <i>Capernaum </i>was a town on the northwest shore of the Sea of Galilee, 680 ft (204 m) below sea level. It was a major trade and economic center in the North Galilean region.</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map1-D2; Map2-C3; Map3-B2.</p>
<A NAME="810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=288><b>sn</b> A<i> centurion </i>was a noncommissioned officer in the Roman army or one of the auxiliary territorial armies, commanding a <i>centuria</i> of (nominally) 100 men. The responsibilities of centurions were broadly similar to modern junior officers, but there was a wide gap in social status between them and officers, and relatively few were promoted beyond the rank of senior centurion. The Roman troops stationed in Judea were auxiliaries, who would normally be rewarded with Roman citizenship after 25 years of service. Some of the centurions may have served originally in the Roman legions (regular army) and thus gained their citizenship at enlistment. Others may have inherited it, like the apostle Paul did.</p>
<A NAME="811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=289><b>sn</b> While in Matthew&#8217;s account the centurion <i>came to him asking for help</i>, Luke&#8217;s account (7:1-10) mentions that the centurion sent some Jewish elders as emissaries on his behalf.</p>
<A NAME="812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=290><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;and saying, &#8216;Lord.&#8217;&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#969;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">legwn</font>) at the beginning of v. 6 is redundant in English and has not been translated.</p>
<A NAME="813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=291><b>tn</b> The Greek term here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#8150;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pais</font>), often used of a slave who was regarded with some degree of affection, possibly a personal servant (Luke 7:7 uses the more common term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">doulos</font>).

<A NAME="817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=295><b>sn</b> <i>I say to this one &#8216;Go&#8217; and he goes. </i>The illustrations highlight the view of authority the soldier sees in the word of one who has authority. Since the centurion was a commander of a hundred soldiers, he understood what it was both to command others and to be obeyed.</p>
<A NAME="818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=296><b>tn</b> Though <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">doulos</font>) is normally translated &#8220;servant,&#8221; the word does not bear the connotation of a free individual serving another. BDAG notes that &#8220;&#8216;servant&#8217; for &#8216;slave&#8217; is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times&#8230; in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished&#8221; (BDAG 260 s.v. 1). The most accurate translation is &#8220;bondservant&#8221; (sometimes found in the ASV for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font>) in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another. But as this is archaic, few today understand its force.</p>
<A NAME="819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=297><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;it&#8221; is not in the Greek text, but is implied. Direct objects were frequently omitted in Greek when clear from the context.</p>

The word &#8220;banquet&#8221; has been supplied to clarify for the modern reader the festive nature of the imagery. The banquet imagery is a way to describe the fellowship and celebration of being among the people of God at the end.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> 1st century middle eastern meals were not eaten while sitting at a table, but while reclining on one&#8217;s side on the floor with the head closest to the low table and the feet farthest away.</p>

The idiomatic expression &#8220;birds of the sky&#8221; refers to wild birds as opposed to domesticated fowl (cf. BDAG 809 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#949;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#972;&#957;</font>).</p>

<A NAME="841"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=319><b>sn</b> There are several options for the meaning of Jesus&#8217; reply <i>Leave the dead to bury their own dead</i>: (1) Recent research suggests that burial customs in the vicinity of Jerusalem from about 20 <sc>b.c. to <sc>a.d. 70 involved a reinterment of the bones a year after the initial burial, once the flesh had rotted away. At that point the son would have placed his father&#8217;s bones in a special box known as an ossuary to be set into the wall of the tomb. Thus Jesus could well be rebuking the man for wanting to wait around for as much as a year before making a commitment to follow him. In 1st century Jewish culture, to have followed Jesus rather than burying one&#8217;s father would have seriously dishonored one&#8217;s father (cf. Tobit 4:3-4). (2) The remark is an idiom (possibly a proverbial saying) that means, &#8220;The matter in question is not the real issue,&#8221; in which case Jesus was making a wordplay on the wording of the man&#8217;s (literal) request (see L&amp;N 33.137). (3) This remark could be a figurative reference to various kinds of people, meaning, &#8220;Let the spiritually dead bury the dead.&#8221; (4) It could also be literal and designed to shock the hearer by the surprise of the contrast. Whichever option is preferred, it is clear that the most important priority is to <i>follow</i> Jesus.</p>
<A NAME="842"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=320><b>sn</b> A <i>boat</i> that held all the disciples would be of significant size.</p>

At issue is whether (1) only the Twelve were with Jesus in the boat, as opposed to other disciples (cf. v. 23), and (2) whether any of those other disciples would have been women. The issue is complicated further by the parallel in Mark (4:35-41), where the author writes (4:36) that other boats accompanied them on this journey.</p>

B. Green, <i>Luke </i>[NICNT], 337). The region of Gadara extended to the Sea of Galilee and included the town of Sennabris on the southern shore &#8211; the town that the herdsmen most likely entered after the drowning of the pigs.</p>
<A NAME="851"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=329><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;And behold, they cried out, saying.&#8221; The Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7984;&#948;&#959;&#973;</font> (<font face="Greektl">idou</font>) has not been translated because it has no exact English equivalent here, but adds interest and emphasis (BDAG 468 s.v. 1). The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">legontes</font>) is redundant and has not been translated. </p>
<A NAME="852"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=330><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;what to us and to you?&#8221; (an idiom). The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#943; &#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#963;&#959;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ti Jhmin kai soi</font>) is Semitic in origin, though it made its way into colloquial Greek (BDAG 275 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#947;&#8061;</font>). The equivalent Hebrew expression in the OT had two basic meanings: (1) When one person was unjustly bothering another, the injured party could say &#8220;What to me and to you?&#8221; meaning, &#8220;What have I done to you that you should do this to me?&#8221; (Judg 11:12, 2 Chr 35:21, 1 Kgs 17:18). (2) When someone was asked to get involved in a matter he felt was no business of his own, he could say to the one asking him, &#8220;What to me and to you?&#8221; meaning, &#8220;That is your business, how am I involved?&#8221; (2 Kgs 3:13, Hos 14:8). These nuances were apparently expanded in Greek, but the basic notions of defensive hostility (option 1) and indifference or disengagement (option 2) are still present. BDAG suggests the following as glosses for this expression: <i>What have I to do with you? What have we in common? Leave me alone!
