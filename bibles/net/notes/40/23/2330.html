<A NAME="2330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1158><b>tc</b> A very difficult textual problem is found here. The most important Alexandrian and Byzantine, as well as significant Western, witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B C L W 0102 0281 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat co) have &#8220;and the dish&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#968;&#943;&#948;&#959;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">kai th&quot; paroyido&quot;</font>) after &#8220;cup,&#8221; while few important witnesses (D <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup> 700 and some versional and patristic authorities) omit the phrase. On the one hand, scribes sometimes tended to eliminate redundancy; since &#8220;and the dish&#8221; is already present in v. 25, it may have been deleted in v. 26 by well-meaning scribes. On the other hand, as B. M. Metzger notes, the singular pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">autou</font>, &#8220;its&#8221;) with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8056; &#7952;&#954;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">to ekto&quot;</font>, &#8220;the outside&#8221;) in some of the same witnesses that have the longer reading (viz., B* <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> <i>al</i>) hints that their archetype lacked the words (<i>TCGNT</i> 50). Further, scribes would be motivated both to add the phrase from v. 25 <i>and</i> to change <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font> to the plural pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8182;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">aujtwn</font>, &#8220;their&#8221;). Although the external evidence for the shorter reading is not compelling in itself, combined with these two prongs of internal evidence, it is to be slightly preferred.</p>
