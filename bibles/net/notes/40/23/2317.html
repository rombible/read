<A NAME="2317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1145><b>tc</b> The most important <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B D L Z <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup> 33 892* <i>pc</i> and several versional witnesses) do not have <b>23:14</b> &#8220;Woe to you experts in the law and you Pharisees, hypocrites! You devour widows&#8217; property, and as a show you pray long prayers! Therefore you will receive a more severe punishment.&#8221; Part or all of the verse is contained (either after v. 12 or after v. 13) in W 0102 0107 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> and several versions, but it is almost certainly not original. The present translation follows NA<sup>27</sup> in omitting the verse number as well, a procedure also followed by a number of other modern translations. Note also that Mark 12:40 and Luke 20:47 are very similar in wording and are not disputed textually.</p>
