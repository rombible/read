<A NAME="2347"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1175><b>tn</b> Although the opening address (&#8220;Jerusalem, Jerusalem&#8221;) is direct (second person), the remainder of this sentence in the Greek text is third person (&#8220;who kills the prophets and stones those sent to her&#8221;). The following sentences then revert to second person (&#8220;your&#8230; you&#8221;), so to keep all this consistent in English, the third person pronouns in the present verse were translated as second person (&#8220;you who kill&#8230; sent to you&#8221;).</p>
