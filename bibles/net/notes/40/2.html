The singular is typically used of the rising of a star and as such should not normally be translated &#8220;in the east&#8221; (cf. BDAG 74 s.v. 1: &#8220;because of the sg. and the article in contrast to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#7936;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#955;&#8182;&#957;</font>, vs. 1, [it is] prob. not a geograph. expr. like the latter, but rather astronomical&#8230;likew. vs. 9&#8221;).</p>

The people referred to here were recognized experts in the law of Moses and in traditional laws and regulations. Thus &#8220;expert in the law&#8221; comes closer to the meaning for the modern reader.</p>

<A NAME="229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=54><b>tc</b> The LXX of Jer 38:15 (31:15 ET) has &#8220;lamentation, weeping, and loud wailing&#8221;; most later <sc>mss (C D L W 0233 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>) have a quotation in Matthew which conforms to that of the LXX (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#961;&#8134;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#954;&#955;&#945;&#965;&#952;&#956;&#972;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#8000;&#948;&#965;&#961;&#956;&#972;&#962;</font>; <font face="Greektl">qrhno&quot; kai klauqmo&quot; kai odurmo&quot;</font>). But such assimilations were routine among the scribes; as such, they typically should be discounted because they are both predictable and motivated. The shorter reading, without &#8220;lamentation and,&#8221; is thus to be preferred, especially since it cannot easily be accounted for unless it is the original wording here. Further, it is found in the better <sc>mss along with a good cross-section of other witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B Z 0250 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1 </sup><i>pc </i>lat co).</p>

<A NAME="232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=57><b>sn</b> See the note on <i>King Herod</i> in 2:1. When Herod the Great died in 4 <sc>b.c., his kingdom was divided up among his three sons: Archelaus, who ruled over Judea (where Bethlehem was located, v. 22); Philip, who became tetrarch of Iturea and Trachonitis (cf. Luke 3:1); and Antipas, who became tetrarch of Galilee.</p>
<A NAME="233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=58><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;behold, an angel.&#8221; The Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7984;&#948;&#959;&#973;</font> (<font face="Greektl">idou</font>) has not been translated because it has no exact English equivalent here, but adds interest and emphasis (BDAG 468 s.v. 1).</p>

<A NAME="236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=61><b>sn</b> <i>Archelaus</i> took after his father Herod the Great in terms of cruelty and ruthlessness, so Joseph <i>was afraid to go there.</i> After further direction <i>in a dream</i>, he went instead to <i>Galilee.</i></p>

<A NAME="238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=63><b>sn</b> <i>Nazareth</i> was a very small village in the region of <i>Galilee</i> (Galilee lay north of Samaria and Judea). The town was located about 15 mi (25 km) west of the southern edge of the Sea of Galilee. According to Luke 1:26, Mary was living in Nazareth when the birth of Jesus was announced to her.</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map1-D3; Map2-C2; Map3-D5; Map4-C1; Map5-G3.</p>
<A NAME="239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=64><b>tn</b> There is no expressed subject of the third person singular verb here; the pronoun &#8220;he&#8221; is implied. Instead of this pronoun the referent &#8220;Jesus&#8221; has been supplied in the text to clarify to whom this statement refers.</p>
<A NAME="240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=65><b>tn</b> The Greek could be indirect discourse (as in the text), or direct discourse (&#8220;he will be called a Nazarene&#8221;). Judging by the difficulty of finding OT quotations (as implied in the plural &#8220;prophets&#8221;) to match the wording here, it appears that the author was using a current expression of scorn that conceptually (but not verbally) found its roots in the OT.</p>
