<A NAME="85"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=283><b>sn</b> The command for silence was probably meant to last only until the cleansing took place with the priests and sought to prevent Jesus&#8217; healings from becoming the central focus of the people&#8217;s reaction to him. See also 9:30, 12:16, 16:20, and 17:9 for other cases where Jesus asks for silence concerning him and his ministry.</p>
