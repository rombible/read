<A NAME="847"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=325><b>tn</b> It is difficult to know whether <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anqrwpoi</font>) should be translated as &#8220;men&#8221; or &#8220;people&#8221; (in a generic sense) here. At issue is whether (1) only the Twelve were with Jesus in the boat, as opposed to other disciples (cf. v. 23), and (2) whether any of those other disciples would have been women. The issue is complicated further by the parallel in Mark (4:35-41), where the author writes (4:36) that other boats accompanied them on this journey.</p>
