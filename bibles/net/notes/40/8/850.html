<A NAME="850"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=328><b>tc</b> The textual tradition here is quite complicated. A number of <sc>mss (B C [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font>] <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <i>al</i> sy<sup>s,p,h</sup>) read &#8220;Gadarenes,&#8221; which is the better reading here.

The difference between Matthew and Luke may be due to uses of variant regional terms. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The <i>region of the Gadarenes</i> would be in Gentile territory on the southeastern side of the Sea of Galilee across from Galilee. Luke 8:26 and Mark 5:1 record this miracle as occurring &#8220;in the region of the Gerasenes.&#8221; &#8220;Irrespective of how one settles this issue, for the [second and] Third Evangelist the chief concern is that Jesus has crossed over into Gentile territory, &#8216;opposite Galilee&#8217;&#8221; (J. B. Green, <i>Luke </i>[NICNT], 337). The region of Gadara extended to the Sea of Galilee and included the town of Sennabris on the southern shore &#8211; the town that the herdsmen most likely entered after the drowning of the pigs.</p>
