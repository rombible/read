The Pharisees were all in agreement that the OT permitted a man to write <i>a certificate of dismissal and to divorce </i>his wife (not vice-versa) and that remarriage was therefore sanctioned. But the two rabbinic schools of Shammai and Hillel differed on the grounds for divorce. Shammai was much stricter than Hillel and permitted divorce only in the case of sexual immorality. Hillel permitted divorce for almost any reason (cf. the Mishnah, <i>m. Gittin </i>9.10).</p>
