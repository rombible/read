<A NAME="1914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=925><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8016;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#967;&#943;&#950;&#969;</font> occurs twice in this verse, translated the first time as &#8220;made eunuchs&#8221; and the second time as &#8220;became eunuchs.&#8221; The term literally refers to castration. The second occurrence of the word in this verse is most likely figurative, though, referring to those who willingly maintain a life of celibacy for the furtherance of the kingdom (see W. D. Davies and D. C. Allison, <i>Matthew </i>[ICC], 3:23).</p>
