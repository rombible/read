<A NAME="1931"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=942><b>sn</b> The<i> eye of a needle</i> refers to a sewing needle. (The gate in Jerusalem known as &#8220;The Needle&#8217;s Eye&#8221; was built during the middle ages and was not in existence in Jesus&#8217; day.) Jesus was saying rhetorically that it is impossible for a rich person to enter God&#8217;s kingdom, unless God (v. 26) intervenes.</p>
