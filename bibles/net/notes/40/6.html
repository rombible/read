But this reading is suspect because of the obvious literary balance, because of detouring the point of the passage (the focus of vv. 1-4 is not on two kinds of public rewards but on human vs. divine approbation), and because of superior external testimony that lacks this reading (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B D Z <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> 33 <i>al</i>). </p>

It represents how they are to approach God, by acknowledging his uniqueness and their need for his provision and protection.</p>
<A NAME="613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=212><b>sn</b> God is addressed in terms of intimacy (<i>Father</i>). The original Semitic term here was probably <i>Abba</i>. The term is a little unusual in a personal prayer, especially as it lacks qualification. It is not the exact equivalent of &#8220;daddy&#8221; (as is sometimes popularly suggested), but it does suggest a close, familial relationship.</p>

Various suggestions include &#8220;daily,&#8221; &#8220;the coming day,&#8221; and &#8220;for existence.&#8221; See BDAG 376-77 s.v.; L&amp;N 67:183, 206.</p>

The reading without this sentence, though, is attested by generally better witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B D Z 0170 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup> <i>pc</i> lat mae Or). The phrase was probably composed for the liturgy of the early church and most likely was based on 1 Chr 29:11-13; a scribe probably added the phrase at this point in the text for use in public scripture reading (see <i>TCGNT</i> 13-14). Both external and internal evidence argue for the shorter reading.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#957;&#951;&#961;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ponhrou</font>) may be understood as specific and personified, referring to the devil, or possibly as a general reference to evil. It is most likely personified since it is articular (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#960;&#959;&#957;&#951;&#961;&#959;&#8166;</font>, <font face="Greektl">tou ponhrou</font>).

<A NAME="622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=221><b>tn</b> Here the term &#8220;disfigure&#8221; used in a number of translations was not used because it could convey to the modern reader the notion of mutilation. L&amp;N 79.17 states, &#8220;&#8216;to make unsightly, to disfigure, to make ugly.&#8217; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#943;&#950;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#964;&#8048; &#960;&#961;&#972;&#963;&#969;&#960;&#945; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8182;&#957;</font> &#8216;for they make their faces unsightly&#8217; Mt 6:16.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=222><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Truly (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">amhn</font>), I say to you.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="625"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=224><b>tn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#8053;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">shs</font>) refers to moths in general. It is specifically the larvae of moths that destroy clothing by eating holes in it (L&amp;N 4.49; BDAG 922 s.v.). See Jas 5:2, which mentions &#8220;moth-eaten&#8221; clothing.</p>
<A NAME="626"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=225><b>tn</b> The pronouns in this verse are singular while the pronouns in vv. 19-20 are plural. The change to singular emphasizes personal responsibility as opposed to corporate responsibility; even if others do not listen, the one who hears Jesus&#8217; commands should obey.</p>
<A NAME="627"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=226><b>sn</b> Seeking heavenly <i>treasure</i> means serving others and honoring God by doing so.</p>
<A NAME="628"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=227><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;sound&#8221; (so L&amp;N 23.132 and most scholars). A few scholars take this word to mean something like &#8220;generous&#8221; here (L&amp;N 57.107). partly due to the immediate context concerning money, in which case the &#8220;eye&#8221; is a metonymy for the entire person (&#8220;if you are generous&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="629"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=228><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;if your eye is sick&#8221; (L&amp;N 23.149). </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> There may be a slight wordplay here, as this term can also mean &#8220;evil,&#8221; so the figure uses a term that points to the real meaning of being careful as to what one pays attention to or looks at.</p>
<A NAME="630"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=229><b>sn</b> The contrast between <i>hate</i> and <i>love</i> here is rhetorical. The point is that one will choose the favorite if a choice has to be made.</p>
<A NAME="631"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=230><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;and treat [the other] with contempt.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="632"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=231><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;God and mammon.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The term <i>money </i>is used to translate <i>mammon</i>, the Aramaic term for wealth or possessions. The point is not that money is inherently evil, but that it is often misused so that it is a means of evil; see 1 Tim 6:6-10, 17-19. God must be first, not money or possessions.</p>
<A NAME="633"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=232><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;do not be anxious,&#8221; and so throughout the rest of this paragraph.</p>
<A NAME="634"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=233><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the birds of the sky&#8221; or &#8220;the birds of the heaven&#8221;; the Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ouranos</font>) may be translated either &#8220;sky&#8221; or &#8220;heaven,&#8221; depending on the context. The idiomatic expression &#8220;birds of the sky&#8221; refers to wild birds as opposed to domesticated fowl (cf. BDAG 809 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#949;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#972;&#957;</font>).</p>
<A NAME="635"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=234><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;God gives them food to eat.&#8221; L&amp;N 23.6 has both &#8220;to provide food for&#8221; and &#8220;to give food to someone to eat.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="636"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=235><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;of more value.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="637"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=236><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;a cubit to his height.&#8221; A cubit (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#8134;&#967;&#965;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">phcu&quot;</font>) can measure length (normally about 45 cm or 18 inches) or time (a small unit, &#8220;hour&#8221; is usually used [BDAG 812 s.v.] although &#8220;day&#8221; has been suggested [L&amp;N 67.151]). The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969;&#955;&#953;&#954;&#943;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jhlikia</font>) is ambiguous in the same way as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#8134;&#967;&#965;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">phcus</font>). Most scholars take the term to describe age or length of life here, although a few refer it to bodily stature (see BDAG 436 s.v. 3 for discussion). Worry about length of life seems a more natural figure than worry about height. However, the point either way is clear: Worrying adds nothing to life span or height.</p>
<A NAME="638"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=237><b>tn</b> Traditionally, &#8220;lilies.&#8221; According to L&amp;N 3.32, &#8220;Though traditionally <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#961;&#943;&#957;&#959;&#957;</font> has been regarded as a type of lily, scholars have suggested several other possible types of flowers, including an anemone, a poppy, a gladiolus, and a rather inconspicuous type of daisy.&#8221; In view of the uncertainty, the more generic &#8220;flowers&#8221; has been used in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="639"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=238><b>tn</b> Or, traditionally, &#8220;toil.&#8221; Although it might be argued that &#8220;work hard&#8221; would be a more precise translation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#959;&#960;&#953;&#940;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kopiaw</font>) here, the line in English reads better in terms of cadence with a single syllable.</p>
<A NAME="640"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=239><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;grass of the field.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="641"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=240><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;into the oven.&#8221; The expanded translation &#8220;into the fire to heat the oven&#8221; has been used to avoid misunderstanding; most items put into modern ovens are put there to be baked, not burned.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The <i>oven</i> was most likely a rounded clay oven used for baking bread, which was heated by burning wood and dried grass.</p>
<A NAME="642"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=241><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>even more</i> is a typical form of rabbinic argumentation, from the lesser to the greater. If God cares for the little things, surely he will care for the more important things.</p>

On the one hand, there is the possibility of accidental omission on the part of these Alexandrian witnesses, but it seems unlikely that the scribe&#8217;s eye would skip over both words (especially since <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> is bracketed by first declension nouns). Intrinsically, the author generally has a genitive modifier with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#946;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#943;&#945;</font> &#8211; especially <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#8182;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ouranwn</font>) &#8211; but this argument cuts both ways: Although he might be expected to use such an adjunct here, scribes might also be familiar with his practice and would thus naturally insert it if it were missing in their copy of Matthew. Although a decision is difficult, the omission of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> is considered most likely to be original.
