<A NAME="1820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=879><b>tn</b> The Greek term &#8220;brother&#8221; can mean &#8220;fellow believer&#8221; or &#8220;fellow Christian&#8221; (cf. BDAG 18 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#972;&#962;</font> 2.a) whether male or female. It can also refer to siblings, though here it is used in a broader sense to connote familial relationships within the family of God. Therefore, because of the familial connotations, &#8220;brother&#8221; has been retained in the translation here in preference to the more generic &#8220;fellow believer&#8221; (&#8220;fellow Christian&#8221; would be anachronistic in this context).</p>
