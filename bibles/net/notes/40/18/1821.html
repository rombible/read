<A NAME="1821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=880><b>tc</b> &#8225; The earliest and best witnesses lack &#8220;against you&#8221; after &#8220;if your brother sins.&#8221; It is quite possible that the shorter reading in these witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><i> </i>B, as well as 0281 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup> 579 <i>pc </i>sa) occurred when scribes either intentionally changed the text (to make it more universal in application) or unintentionally changed the text (owing to the similar sound of the end of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#8053;&#963;&#8131;</font> [<font face="Greektl">Jamarthsh</font>] and the prepositional phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#963;&#941;</font> [<font face="Greektl">eis se</font>]). However, if the <sc>mss were normally copied by sight rather than by sound, especially in the early centuries of Christianity, such an unintentional change is not as likely for these <sc>mss. And since scribes normally added material rather than deleted it for intentional changes, on balance, the shorter reading appears to be original. NA<sup>27</sup> includes the words in brackets, indicating doubts as to their authenticity.</p>
