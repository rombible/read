<A NAME="1850"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=909><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;handed him over to the torturers,&#8221; referring specifically to guards whose job was to torture prisoners who were being questioned. According to L&amp;N 37.126, it is difficult to know for certain in this instance whether the term actually envisions torture as a part of the punishment or is simply a hyperbole. However, in light of the following verse and Jesus&#8217; other warning statements in Matthew about &#8220;fiery hell,&#8221; &#8220;the outer darkness,&#8221; etc., it is best not to dismiss this as mere imagery.</p>
