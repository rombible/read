<A NAME="1622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=791><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;flesh and blood&#8221; could refer to &#8220;any human being&#8221; (so TEV, NLT; cf. NIV &#8220;man&#8221;), but it could also refer to Peter himself (i.e., his own intuition; cf. CEV &#8220;You didn&#8217;t discover this on your own&#8221;). Because of the ambiguity of the referent, the phrase &#8220;flesh and blood&#8221; has been retained in the translation. </p>
