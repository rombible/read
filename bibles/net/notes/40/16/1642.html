<A NAME="1642"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=811><b>sn</b> Several suggestions have been made as to the referent for the phrase <i>the Son of Man coming in his kingdom</i>: (1) the transfiguration itself, which immediately follows in the narrative; (2) Jesus&#8217; resurrection and ascension; (3) the coming of the Spirit; (4) Christ&#8217;s role in the Church; (5) the destruction of Jerusalem; (6) Jesus&#8217; second coming and the establishment of the kingdom. The reference to <i>six days later</i> in 17:1 seems to indicate that Matthew had the transfiguration in mind insofar as it was a substantial prefiguring of the consummation of the kingdom (although this interpretation is not without its problems). As such, the transfiguration would be a tremendous confirmation to the disciples that even though Jesus had just finished speaking of his death (in vv. 21-23), he was nonetheless the promised Messiah and things were proceeding according to God&#8217;s plan.</p>
