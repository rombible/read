<A NAME="1017"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=423><b>tc</b> The majority of Byzantine minuscules, along with a few other witnesses (C<sup>3</sup> K L <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#915;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> 700* <i>al</i>), lack <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#957;&#949;&#954;&#961;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#7952;&#947;&#949;&#943;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">nekrou&quot; ejgeirete</font>, &#8220;raise the dead&#8221;), most likely because of oversight due to a string of similar endings (-<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#964;&#949;</font> in the second person imperatives, occurring five times in v. 8). The longer version of this verse is found in several diverse and ancient witnesses such as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B C* (D) N 0281<sup>vid</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> 33 565 <i>al</i> lat; P W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font> 348 have a word-order variation, but nevertheless include <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#957;&#949;&#954;&#961;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#7952;&#947;&#949;&#943;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font>. Although some Byzantine-text proponents charge the Alexandrian witnesses with theologically-motivated alterations toward heterodoxy, it is interesting to find a variant such as this in which the charge could be reversed (do the Byzantine scribes have something against the miracle of resurrection?). In reality, such charges of wholesale theologically-motivated changes toward heterodoxy are immediately suspect due to lack of evidence of <i>intentional</i> changes (here the change is evidently due to accidental omission).</p>
