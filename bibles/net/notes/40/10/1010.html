<A NAME="1010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=416><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the Cananean,&#8221; but according to both BDAG 507 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#922;&#945;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#962;</font> and L&amp;N 11.88, this term has no relation at all to the geographical terms for Cana or Canaan, but is derived from the Aramaic term for &#8220;<i>enthusiast, zealot</i>&#8221; (see Luke 6:15; Acts 1:13), possibly because of an earlier affiliation with the party of the Zealots. He may not have been technically a member of the particular Jewish nationalistic party known as &#8220;Zealots&#8221; (since according to some scholars this party had not been organized at that time), but simply someone who was zealous for Jewish independence from Rome, in which case the term would refer to his temperament.</p>
