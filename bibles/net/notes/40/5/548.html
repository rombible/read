<A NAME="548"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=191><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;shirt&#8221; (a long garment worn under the cloak next to the skin). The name for this garment (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#967;&#953;&#964;&#8061;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">citwn</font>) presents some difficulty in translation. Most modern readers would not understand what a &#8220;tunic&#8221; was any more than they would be familiar with a &#8220;<i>chiton</i>.&#8221; On the other hand, attempts to find a modern equivalent are also a problem: &#8220;Shirt&#8221; conveys the idea of a much shorter garment that covers only the upper body, and &#8220;undergarment&#8221; (given the styles of modern underwear) is more misleading still. &#8220;Tunic&#8221; was therefore employed, but with a note to explain its nature.</p>
