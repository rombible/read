Adding &#8220;Pontius,&#8221; however, is a natural expansion on the text, and is in keeping with several other NT and patristic references to the Roman governor (cf. Luke 3:1; Acts 4:27; 1 Tim 6:13; Ign. <i>Magn</i>. 11.1; Ign. <i>Trall</i>. 9.1; Ign. <i>Smyrn</i>.<i> </i>1.2; Justin Martyr, <i>passim</i>). The shorter reading, supported by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B L 0281 33 <i>pc</i> co, is thus strongly preferred.</p>
<A NAME="274"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1395><b>sn</b> The Jews most assuredly wanted to put Jesus to death, but they lacked the authority to do so.

<A NAME="2710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1401><b>tc</b> The problematic citing of Jeremiah for a text which appears to come from Zechariah has prompted certain scribes to alter it. Codex 22 has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#918;&#945;&#967;&#945;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Zacariou</font>, &#8220;Zechariah&#8221;) while <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#934;</font> 33 omit the prophet&#8217;s name altogether. And codex 21 and the Latin ms l change the prophet&#8217;s name to &#8220;Isaiah,&#8221; in accordance with natural scribal proclivities to alter the text toward the most prominent OT prophet. But unquestionably the name Jeremiah is the wording of the original here, because it is supported by virtually all witnesses and because it is the harder reading. See D. A. Carson, &#8220;Matthew,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 8:562-63, for a discussion of the textual and especially hermeneutical problem.</p>
<A NAME="2711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1402><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the sons of Israel,&#8221; an idiom referring to the people of Israel as an ethnic entity (L&amp;N 11.58).</p>
<A NAME="2712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1403><b>sn</b> The source of this citation is debated (see the <b>tc</b> note on <i>Jeremiah</i> in v. 9 above for a related discussion). The quotation is most closely related to Zech 11:12-13, but the reference to Jeremiah in v. 9 as the source leads one to look there as well. There is no exact match for this text in Jeremiah, but there are some conceptual parallels: In Jer 18:2-6 the prophet visits a potter, and in Jer 32:6-15 he buys a field. D. A. Carson argues that Jer 19:1-13 is the source of the quotation augmented with various phrases drawn from Zech 11:12-13 (&#8220;Matthew,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 8:563). W. D. Davies and D. C. Allison argue that the reference to Jeremiah is not meant to refer to one specific text from that prophet, but instead to signal that his writings as a whole are a source from which the quotation is drawn (<i>Matthew </i>[ICC], 3:568-69). Although the exact source of the citation is uncertain, it is reasonable to see texts from the books of Jeremiah and Zechariah both coming into play here.</p>
<A NAME="2713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1404><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has been translated as &#8220;then&#8221; to indicate the implied sequence of events within the narrative.</p>

<A NAME="2715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1406><b>sn</b> &#8220;<i>Are you the king of the Jews?</i>&#8221;<i> </i>Pilate was interested in this charge because of its political implications of sedition against Rome.</p>

<A NAME="2717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1408><b>sn</b> The reply &#8220;<i>You say so</i>&#8221; is somewhat enigmatic, like Jesus&#8217; earlier reply to the Jewish leadership in 26:64.</p>
<A NAME="2718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1409><b>sn</b> The custom of Pilate<i> to release one prisoner </i>is unknown outside the gospels in Jewish writings, but it was a Roman custom at the time and thus probably used in Palestine as well (cf. Matt 27:15; John 18:39).</p>
<A NAME="2719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1410><b>tc</b> Although the external evidence for the inclusion of &#8220;Jesus&#8221; before &#8220;Barabbas&#8221; (in vv. 16 and 17) is rather sparse, being restricted virtually to the Caesarean text (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup> 700* <i>pc</i> sy<sup>s</sup>), the omission of the Lord&#8217;s name in apposition to &#8220;Barabbas&#8221; is such a strongly motivated reading that it can hardly be original. There is no good explanation for a scribe unintentionally adding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Ihsoun</font>) before <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#914;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#946;&#946;&#8118;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Barabban</font>), especially since Barabbas is mentioned first in each verse (thus dittography is ruled out). Further, the addition of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ton legomenon Criston</font>, &#8220;who is called Christ&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#957;</font> in v. 17 makes better sense if Barabbas is also called &#8220;Jesus&#8221; (otherwise, a mere &#8220;Jesus&#8221; would have been a sufficient appellation to distinguish the two).</p>
<A NAME="2720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1411><b>tc</b> Again, as in v. 16, the name &#8220;Jesus&#8221; is supplied before &#8220;Barabbas&#8221; in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup> 700* <i>pc</i> sy<sup>s</sup> Or<sup>mss</sup> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> 700* lack the article <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> [<font face="Greektl">ton</font>] before <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#914;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#946;&#946;&#8118;&#957;</font> [<font face="Greektl">Barabban</font>]). The same argument for accepting the inclusion of &#8220;Jesus&#8221; as original in the previous verse applies here as well.</p>

BDAG 1064 s.v. states, &#8220;<i>flog, scourge,</i> a punishment inflicted on slaves and provincials after a sentence of death had been pronounced on them. So in the case of Jesus before the crucifixion&#8230;Mt 27:26; Mk 15:15.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> A Roman flogging (traditionally, &#8220;scourging&#8221;) was an excruciating punishment. The victim was stripped of his clothes and bound to a post with his hands fastened above him (or sometimes he was thrown to the ground). Guards standing on either side of the victim would incessantly beat him with a whip (<i>flagellum</i>) made out of leather with pieces of lead and bone inserted into its ends. While the Jews only allowed 39 lashes, the Romans had no such limit; many people who received such a beating died as a result. See C. Schneider, <i>TDNT</i>, 515-19.</p>

In placing the crown of <i>thorns </i>on his head, the soldiers were unwittingly symbolizing God&#8217;s curse on humanity (cf. Gen 3:18) being placed on Jesus. Their purpose would have been to mock Jesus&#8217; claim to be a king; the crown of thorns would have represented the &#8220;radiant corona&#8221; portrayed on the heads of rulers on coins and other artifacts in the 1st century.</p>
