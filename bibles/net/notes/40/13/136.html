<A NAME="136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=621><b>tn</b> In Matthew&#8217;s version of this parable, plural pronouns are used to refer to the seed in v. 4 (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7941;</font>&#8230;<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#940;</font> [<font face="Greektl">Ja</font>&#8230;<font face="Greektl">auta</font>]), although the collective singular is used in v. 5 and following (indicated by the singular verbs like <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#960;&#949;&#963;&#949;&#957;</font> [<font face="Greektl">epesen</font>]). For the sake of consistency in English, plural pronouns referring to the seed are used in the translation throughout the Matthean account. In both Mark and Luke the collective singular is used consistently throughout (cf. Mark 4:1-9; Luke 8:4-8).</p>
