<A NAME="1318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=633><b>sn</b> <i>What he has will be taken from him. </i>The meaning is that the one who accepts Jesus&#8217; teaching concerning his person and the kingdom will receive a share in the kingdom now and even more in the future, but for the one who rejects Jesus&#8217; words, the opportunity that that person presently possesses with respect to the kingdom will someday be taken away forever.</p>
