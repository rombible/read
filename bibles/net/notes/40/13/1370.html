<A NAME="1370"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=685><b>sn</b> The reference to Jesus as <i>the carpenter&#8217;s son</i> is probably derogatory, indicating that they knew Jesus only as a common laborer like themselves. The reference to <i>his mother&#8230;Mary</i> (even though Jesus&#8217; father was probably dead by this point) appears to be somewhat derogatory, for a man was not regarded as his mother&#8217;s son in Jewish usage unless an insult was intended (cf. Judg 11:1-2; John 4:41; 8:41; 9:29).</p>
