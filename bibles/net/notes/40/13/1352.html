<A NAME="1352"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=667><b>tc</b> A few important <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> 33) identify the prophet as Isaiah, a reading that is significantly harder than the generic &#8220;prophet&#8221; because the source of this prophecy is not Isaiah but Asaph in Ps 78. Jerome mentioned some <sc>mss that had &#8220;Asaph&#8221; here, though none are known to exist today. This problem is difficult because of the temptation for scribes to delete the reference to Isaiah in order to clear up a discrepancy. Indeed, the vast majority of witnesses have only &#8220;the prophet&#8221; here (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>1</sup> B C D L W 0233 0242 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat sy co). However, as B. M. Metzger points out, &#8220;if no prophet were originally named, more than one scribe might have been prompted to insert the name of the best known prophet &#8211; something which has, in fact, happened elsewhere more than once&#8221; (<i>TCGNT</i> 27). In light of the paucity of evidence for the reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#919;&#963;&#945;&#8147;&#959;&#965;</font>, as well as the proclivity of scribes to add his name, it is probably best to consider the shorter reading as authentic.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;was spoken by the prophet, saying.&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">legontos</font>) is redundant in contemporary English and has not been translated.</p>
