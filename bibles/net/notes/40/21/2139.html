<A NAME="2139"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1040><b>sn</b> Very few questions could have so completely revealed the wicked intentions of the religious leaders. Jesus&#8217; question revealed the motivation of the religious leaders and exposed them for what they really were &#8211; hypocrites. They indicted themselves when they cited only two options and chose neither of them (&#8220;<i>We do not know</i>&#8221;). The point of Matt 21:23-27 is that no matter what Jesus said in response to their question, they were not going to believe it and would in the end use it against him.</p>
