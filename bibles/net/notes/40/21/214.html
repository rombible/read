<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1005><b>sn</b> &#8220;Mountain&#8221; in English generally denotes a higher elevation than it often does in reference to places in Palestine. The <i>Mount of Olives</i> is really a ridge running north to south about 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) long, east of Jerusalem across the Kidron Valley. Its central elevation is about 30 meters (100 ft) higher than Jerusalem. It was named for the large number of olive trees which grew on it.</p>
