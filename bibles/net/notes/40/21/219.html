<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1010><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Tell the daughter of Zion&#8221; (the phrase &#8220;daughter of Zion&#8221; is an idiom for the inhabitants of Jerusalem: &#8220;people of Zion&#8221;). The idiom &#8220;daughter of Zion&#8221; has been translated as &#8220;people of Zion&#8221; because the original idiom, while firmly embedded in the Christian tradition, is not understandable to most modern English readers.</p>
