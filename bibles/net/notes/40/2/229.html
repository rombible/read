<A NAME="229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=54><b>tc</b> The LXX of Jer 38:15 (31:15 ET) has &#8220;lamentation, weeping, and loud wailing&#8221;; most later <sc>mss (C D L W 0233 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>) have a quotation in Matthew which conforms to that of the LXX (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#961;&#8134;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#954;&#955;&#945;&#965;&#952;&#956;&#972;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#8000;&#948;&#965;&#961;&#956;&#972;&#962;</font>; <font face="Greektl">qrhno&quot; kai klauqmo&quot; kai odurmo&quot;</font>). But such assimilations were routine among the scribes; as such, they typically should be discounted because they are both predictable and motivated. The shorter reading, without &#8220;lamentation and,&#8221; is thus to be preferred, especially since it cannot easily be accounted for unless it is the original wording here. Further, it is found in the better <sc>mss along with a good cross-section of other witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B Z 0250 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1 </sup><i>pc </i>lat co).</p>
