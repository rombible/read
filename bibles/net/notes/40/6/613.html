<A NAME="613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=212><b>sn</b> God is addressed in terms of intimacy (<i>Father</i>). The original Semitic term here was probably <i>Abba</i>. The term is a little unusual in a personal prayer, especially as it lacks qualification. It is not the exact equivalent of &#8220;daddy&#8221; (as is sometimes popularly suggested), but it does suggest a close, familial relationship.</p>
