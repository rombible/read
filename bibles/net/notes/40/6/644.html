On the one hand, there is the possibility of accidental omission on the part of these Alexandrian witnesses, but it seems unlikely that the scribe&#8217;s eye would skip over both words (especially since <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> is bracketed by first declension nouns). Intrinsically, the author generally has a genitive modifier with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#946;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#943;&#945;</font> &#8211; especially <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#8182;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ouranwn</font>) &#8211; but this argument cuts both ways: Although he might be expected to use such an adjunct here, scribes might also be familiar with his practice and would thus naturally insert it if it were missing in their copy of Matthew. Although a decision is difficult, the omission of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> is considered most likely to be original.
