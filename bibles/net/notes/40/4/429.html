<A NAME="429"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=130><b>tn</b> The Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anqrwpos</font>) is used here in a generic sense, referring to both men and women, thus &#8220;people.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The kind of fishing envisioned was net &#8211; not line &#8211; fishing (cf. v. 18; cf. also BDAG 55 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#966;&#953;&#946;&#940;&#955;&#955;&#969;</font>, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#966;&#943;&#946;&#955;&#951;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#957;</font>) which involved a circular net that had heavy weights around its perimeter. The occupation of fisherman was labor-intensive. The imagery of using a lure and a line (and waiting for the fish to strike) is thus foreign to this text. Rather, the imagery of a fisherman involved much strain, long hours, and often little results. Jesus&#8217; point may have been one or more of the following: the strenuousness of evangelism, the work ethic that it required, persistence and dedication to the task (often in spite of minimal results), the infinite value of the new &#8220;catch&#8221; (viz., people), and perhaps an eschatological theme of snatching people from judgment (cf. W. L. Lane, <i>Mark</i> [NICNT], 67). If this last motif is in view, then catching people is the opposite of catching fish: The fish would be caught, killed, cooked, and eaten; people would be caught so as to remove them from eternal destruction and to give them new life.</p>
