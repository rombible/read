<A NAME="410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=111><b>sn</b> The <i>highest point of the temple</i> probably refers to the point on the temple&#8217;s southeast corner where it looms directly over a cliff some 450 ft (135 m) high. However, some have suggested the reference could be to the temple&#8217;s high gate.</p>
