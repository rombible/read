<A NAME="439"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=140><b>tn</b> The translation has adopted a different phrase order here than that in the Greek text. The Greek text reads, &#8220;People brought to him all who suffered with various illnesses and afflictions, those possessed by demons, epileptics, and paralytics.&#8221; Even though it is obvious that four separate groups of people are in view here, following the Greek word order could lead to the misconception that certain people were possessed by epileptics and paralytics. The word order adopted in the translation avoids this problem.</p>
