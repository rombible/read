<A NAME="113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=477><b>tc</b> The Western codex D and a few other <sc>mss (0233 1424 <i>al</i>) read &#8220;Jesus&#8221; here instead of &#8220;Christ.&#8221; This is not likely to be original because it is not found in the earliest and most important <sc>mss, nor in the rest of the ms tradition.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Messiah&#8221;; both &#8220;Christ&#8221; (Greek) and &#8220;Messiah&#8221; (Hebrew and Aramaic) mean &#8220;one who has been anointed.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> See the note on <i>Christ </i>in 1:16.</p>
<A NAME="114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=478><b>tc</b> Instead of &#8220;by his disciples&#8221; (see the <b>tn</b> below for the reading of the Greek), the majority of later <sc>mss (C<sup>3</sup> L <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat bo) have &#8220;two of his disciples.&#8221; The difference in Greek, however, is only two letters: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#956;&#945;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#8182;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font> vs. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#973;&#959; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#956;&#945;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#8182;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">dia twn maqhtwn autou</font> vs. <font face="Greektl">duo twn maqhtwn autou</font>). Although an accidental alteration could account for either of these readings, it is more likely that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#973;&#959;</font> is an assimilation to the parallel in Luke 7:18. Further, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#940;</font> is read by a good number of early and excellent witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B C* D P W Z <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> 0233 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> 33 sa), and thus should be considered original.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;sending by his disciples he said to him.&#8221; The words &#8220;a question&#8221; are not in the Greek text, but are implied.</p>
<A NAME="115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=479><b>sn</b> Aspects of Jesus&#8217; ministry may have led John to question whether Jesus was the promised stronger and greater <i>one who is to come </i>that he had preached about in Matt 3:1-12.</p>
<A NAME="116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=480><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;And answering, Jesus said to them.&#8221; This construction is somewhat redundant in English and has been simplified in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=481><b>sn</b> <i>What you hear and see. </i>The following activities all paraphrase various OT descriptions of the time of promised salvation: Isa 35:5-6; 26:19; 29:18-19; 61:1. Jesus is answering not by acknowledging a title, but by pointing to the nature of his works, thus indicating the nature of the time.</p>
<A NAME="118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=482><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;and the,&#8221; but <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has not been translated since English normally uses a coordinating conjunction only between the last two elements in a series of three or more. Two other conjunctions are omitted in this series.</p>
<A NAME="119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=483><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;whoever.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=484><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;desert.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=485><b>tn</b> There is a debate as to whether one should read this figuratively (&#8220;to see someone who is easily blown over?&#8221;) or literally (<i>Grk</i> &#8220;to see the wilderness vegetation?&#8230; No, to see a prophet&#8221;). Either view makes good sense, but the following examples suggest the question should be read literally and understood to point to the fact that a prophet drew them to the desert.</p>
<A NAME="1112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=486><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;But what.&#8221; Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#940;</font> (<font face="Greektl">alla</font>, a strong contrastive in Greek) produces a somewhat awkward sense in English, and has not been translated. The same situation occurs at the beginning of v. 9.</p>
<A NAME="1113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=487><b>sn</b> The reference to <i>fancy clothes</i> makes the point that John was not rich or powerful, in that he did not come from the wealthy classes.</p>
<A NAME="1114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=488><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;palaces.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=489><b>tn</b> John the Baptist is &#8220;more&#8221; because he introduces the one (Jesus) who brings the new era. The term is neuter, but may be understood as masculine in this context (BDAG 806 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#963;&#972;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#962;</font> b).</p>
<A NAME="1116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=490><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;before your face&#8221; (an idiom).</p>
<A NAME="1117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=491><b>sn</b> The quotation is primarily from Mal 3:1 with pronouns from Exod 23:20. Here is the forerunner who points the way to the arrival of God&#8217;s salvation. His job is to prepare and guide the people, as the cloud did for Israel in the desert.</p>
<A NAME="1118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=492><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Truly (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">amhn</font>), I say to you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=493><b>sn</b> After John comes a shift of eras. The new era is so great that the lowest member of it (<i>the one who is least in the kingdom of God</i>) is greater than the greatest one of the previous era.</p>
<A NAME="1120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=494><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has not been translated.</p>
<A NAME="1121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=495><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the kingdom of heaven is forcibly entered and violent people take hold of it.&#8221; For a somewhat different interpretation of this passage, see the note on the phrase &#8220;urged to enter in&#8221; in Luke 16:16.</p>
<A NAME="1122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=496><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;appeared&#8221; is not in the Greek text, but is implied.</p>
<A NAME="1123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=497><b>tn</b> The translation &#8220;had better listen!&#8221; captures the force of the third person imperative more effectively than the traditional &#8220;let him hear,&#8221; which sounds more like a permissive than an imperative to the modern English reader. This was Jesus&#8217; common expression to listen and heed carefully (cf. Matt 13:9, 43; Mark 4:9, 23; Luke 8:8, 14:35).</p>
<A NAME="1124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=498><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has not been translated.</p>
<A NAME="1125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=499><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;who call out to one another, saying.&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">legousin</font>) is redundant in contemporary English and has not been translated.</p>
<A NAME="1126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=500><b>sn</b> &#8216;<i>We played the flute for you, yet you did not dance&#8230;</i>&#8217;<i> </i>The children of this generation were making the complaint (see vv. 18-19) that others were not playing the game according to the way they played the music. John and Jesus did not follow &#8220;their tune.&#8221; Jesus&#8217; complaint was that this generation wanted things their way, not God&#8217;s.</p>
<A NAME="1127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=501><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#952;&#961;&#951;&#957;&#8053;&#963;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">eqrhnhsamen</font>) refers to the loud wailing and lamenting used to mourn the dead in public in 1st century Jewish culture.</p>
<A NAME="1128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=502><b>sn</b> John the Baptist was too separatist and ascetic for some, and so he was accused of not being directed by God, but by a <i>demon</i>.</p>
<A NAME="1129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=503><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;Behold a man.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1130"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=504><b>sn</b> See the note on <i>tax collectors</i> in 5:46.</p>
<A NAME="1131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=505><b>sn</b><i> </i>Neither were they happy with Jesus (the Son of Man), even though he was the opposite of John and associated freely with people like <i>tax collectors and sinners</i>. Either way, God&#8217;s messengers were subject to complaint.</p>
<A NAME="1132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=506><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;shown to be right.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=507><b>tc</b> Most witnesses (B<sup>2</sup> C D L <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup> 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat) have &#8220;children&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#941;&#954;&#957;&#969;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">teknwn</font>) here instead of &#8220;deeds&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#961;&#947;&#969;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">ergwn</font>), but since &#8220;children&#8221; is the reading of the parallel in Luke 7:35, scribes would be motivated to convert the less colorful &#8220;deeds&#8221; into more animate offspring of wisdom. Further, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#961;&#947;&#969;&#957;</font> enjoys support from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B* W (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup>) as well as early versional and patristic support.</p>
<A NAME="1134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=508><b>tn</b> The Greek word here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#972;&#955;&#953;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">polis</font>) which can be translated &#8220;city&#8221; or &#8220;town.&#8221; &#8220;Cities&#8221; was chosen here to emphasize the size of the places Jesus&#8217; mentions in the following verses.</p>
<A NAME="1135"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=509><b>sn</b> <i>Chorazin </i>was a town of Galilee that was probably fairly small in contrast to <i>Bethsaida</i> and is otherwise unattested. Bethsaida was declared a <i>polis</i> by the tetrarch Herod Philip, sometime after <sc>a.d. 30.</p>
<A NAME="1136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=510><b>tn</b> This introduces a second class (contrary to fact) condition in the Greek text.</p>
<A NAME="1137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=511><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;powerful deeds.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1139"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=513><b>sn</b> <i>Tyre and Sidon </i>are two other notorious OT cities (Isa 23; Jer 25:22; 47:4). The remark is a severe rebuke, in effect: &#8220;Even the sinners of the old era would have responded to the proclamation of the kingdom, unlike you!&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map1-A1; JP3-F3; JP4-F3.</p>
<A NAME="1140"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=514><b>sn</b> <i>Capernaum</i> was a town on the northwest shore of the Sea of Galilee, 680 ft (204 m) below sea level. It was a major trade and economic center in the North Galilean region.</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map1-D2; Map2-C3; Map3-B2.</p>
<A NAME="1141"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=515><b>tn</b> The interrogative particle introducing this question expects a negative reply.</p>
<A NAME="1142"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=516><b>sn</b> In the OT, <i>Hades</i> was known as <i>Sheol</i>. It is the place where the unrighteous will reside (Luke 10:15; 16:23; Rev 20:13-14).</p>
<A NAME="1143"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=517><b>sn</b> The allusion to <i>Sodom</i>, the most wicked of OT cities from Gen 19:1-29, shows that to reject the current message is even more serious, and will result in more severe punishment, than the worst sins of the old era. The phrase <i>region of Sodom </i>is in emphatic position in the Greek text.</p>
<A NAME="1144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=518><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;At that time, answering, Jesus said.&#8221; This construction is somewhat redundant in English and has been simplified in the translation.</p>

<A NAME="1146"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=520><b>sn</b> The title <i>Lord</i> is an important name for God, showing his sovereignty, but it is interesting that it comes next to a reference to the <i>Father</i>, a term indicative of God&#8217;s care. The two concepts are often related in the NT; see Eph 1:3-6.</p>
<A NAME="1147"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=521><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;that.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1149"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=523><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;for (to do) thus was well-pleasing before you,&#8221; BDAG 325 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#956;&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#952;&#949;&#957;</font> 1.b.<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;</font>; speaking of something taking place &#8220;before&#8221; God is a reverential way of avoiding direct connection of the action to him.</p>
<A NAME="1150"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=524><b>sn</b> This verse has been noted for its conceptual similarity to teaching in John&#8217;s Gospel (10:15; 17:2). The authority of the <i>Son</i> and the <i>Father</i> are totally intertwined.</p>
<A NAME="1151"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=525><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;wishes&#8221;; or &#8220;intends&#8221;; or &#8220;plans&#8221; (cf.

<A NAME="1152"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=526><b>sn</b> A<i> yoke</i> is a wooden bar or frame that joins two animals like oxen or horses so that they can pull a wagon, plow, etc. together. Here it is used figuratively of the restrictions that a teacher or rabbi would place on his followers.</p>
