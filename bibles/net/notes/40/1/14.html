Although Asaph was a psalmist and Asa was a king, it is doubtful that the author mistook one for the other since other ancient documents have variant spellings on the king&#8217;s name (such as &#8220;Asab,&#8221; &#8220;Asanos,&#8221; and &#8220;Asaph&#8221;). Thus the spelling <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#913;&#963;&#940;&#966;</font> that is almost surely found in the original of Matt 1:7-8 has been translated as &#8220;Asa&#8221; in keeping with the more common spelling of the king&#8217;s name.</p>
