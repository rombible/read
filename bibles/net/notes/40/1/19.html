<a name="19"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=9><b>tc</b> There are three significant variant readings at this point in the text. Some <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> and versional witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> it) read, &#8220;Joseph, to whom the virgin Mary, being betrothed, bore Jesus, who is called Christ.&#8221; This reading makes even more explicit than the feminine pronoun (see <b>sn</b> below) the virginal conception of Jesus and as such seems to be a motivated reading. The Sinaitic Syriac ms alone indicates that Joseph was the father of Jesus (&#8220;Joseph, to whom was betrothed Mary the virgin, fathered Jesus who is called the Christ&#8221;). Although much discussed, this reading has not been found in any Greek witnesses. B. M. Metzger suggests that it was produced by a careless scribe who simply reproduced the set formula of the preceding lines in the genealogy (<i>TCGNT</i> 6). In all likelihood, the two competing variants were thus produced by intentional and unintentional scribal alterations respectively. The reading adopted in the translation has overwhelming support from a variety of witnesses (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">1</font></sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B C L W [<font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup>] 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> co), and therefore should be regarded as authentic. For a detailed discussion of this textual problem, see <i>TCGNT</i> 2-6.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The pronoun <i>whom </i>is feminine gender in the Greek text, referring to Mary.</p>
