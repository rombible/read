The latter reading is an assimilation to the parallel in Mark; the former reading may have been motivated by the clarification needed (especially to give the following <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font> [<font face="Greektl">autou</font>, &#8220;his&#8221;] an antecedent). But a few significant <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* B L <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#915;</font> 579 [700] 1424* <i>pc</i>) have neither noun. As the harder reading, it seems to best explain the rise of the others. NA<sup>27</sup>, however, reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#8061;&#960;&#8179;</font> here.</p>
<A NAME="195"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=916><b>sn</b> The question of the Pharisees was anything but sincere; they were asking it <i>to test him</i>. Jesus was now in the jurisdiction of Herod Antipas (i.e., Judea and beyond the Jordan) and it is likely that the Pharisees were hoping he might answer the question of divorce in a way similar to John the Baptist and so suffer the same fate as John, i.e., death at the hands of Herod (cf. 14:1-12). Jesus answered the question not on the basis of rabbinic custom and the debate over Deut 24:1, but rather from the account of creation and God&#8217;s original design.</p>
<A NAME="196"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=917><b>sn</b> A quotation from Gen 1:27; 5:2.</p>
<A NAME="197"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=918><b>sn</b> A quotation from Gen 2:24.</p>
<A NAME="198"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=919><b>tc</b> &#8225; Although the majority of witnesses (B C W 078 087 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> sy<sup>p,h</sup>) have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8053;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">authn</font>, &#8220;her&#8221;) after the infinitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#955;&#8166;&#963;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">apolusai</font>, &#8220;to divorce&#8221;), a variant lacks the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8053;&#957;</font>. This shorter reading may be due to assimilation to the Markan parallel, but since it is attested in early and diverse witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> D L Z <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup> 579 700 <i>pc</i> lat) and since the parallel verse (Mark 10:4) already departs at many points, the shorter reading seems more likely to be original. The pronoun has been included in the translation, however, for clarity. NA<sup>27</sup> includes the word in brackets, indicating reservations regarding its authenticity.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> A quotation from Deut 24:1. The Pharisees were all in agreement that the OT permitted a man to write <i>a certificate of dismissal and to divorce </i>his wife (not vice-versa) and that remarriage was therefore sanctioned. But the two rabbinic schools of Shammai and Hillel differed on the grounds for divorce. Shammai was much stricter than Hillel and permitted divorce only in the case of sexual immorality. Hillel permitted divorce for almost any reason (cf. the Mishnah, <i>m. Gittin </i>9.10).</p>
<A NAME="199"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=920><b>tc</b> A few important <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#934;</font> <i>pc</i>) have the name &#8220;Jesus&#8221; here, but it is probably not original. Nevertheless, this translation routinely specifies the referents of pronouns to improve clarity, so that has been done here.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;He&#8221;; the referent (Jesus) has been specified in the translation for clarity. </p>
<A NAME="1910"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=921><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;heart&#8221; (a collective singular).</p>
<A NAME="1911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=922><b>tc</b> &#8225; Some significant witnesses, along with the majority of later <sc>mss (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>25</sup> C D L W Z 078 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat sy sa<sup>mss</sup> bo), read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">autou</font>, &#8220;his&#8221;) after <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#945;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">maqhtai</font>, &#8220;disciples&#8221;), but this looks to be a clarifying reading. Other early and important witnesses lack the pronoun (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>71vid</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> e ff<sup>1</sup> g<sup>1</sup> sa<sup>ms</sup> mae), the reading adopted here. NA<sup>27</sup> includes the pronoun in brackets, indicating doubts as to its authenticity.</p>
<A NAME="1912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=923><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has not been translated.</p>
<A NAME="1913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=924><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;from the womb of the mother&#8221; (an idiom).</p>
<A NAME="1914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=925><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8016;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#967;&#943;&#950;&#969;</font> occurs twice in this verse, translated the first time as &#8220;made eunuchs&#8221; and the second time as &#8220;became eunuchs.&#8221; The term literally refers to castration. The second occurrence of the word in this verse is most likely figurative, though, referring to those who willingly maintain a life of celibacy for the furtherance of the kingdom (see W. D. Davies and D. C. Allison, <i>Matthew </i>[ICC], 3:23).</p>
<A NAME="1915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=926><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;people.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=927><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;so that he would lay his hands on them and pray.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1917"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=928><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the disciples scolded them.&#8221; In the translation the referent has been specified as &#8220;those who brought them,&#8221; since otherwise the statement could be understood to mean that the disciples scolded the children rather than their parents who brought them.</p>
<A NAME="1918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=929><b>sn</b> <i>The kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these. </i>Children are a picture of those whose simple trust illustrates what faith is all about. The remark illustrates how everyone is important to God, even those whom others regard as insignificant.</p>
<A NAME="1919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=930><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;went from there.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1920"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=931><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;And behold one came.&#8221; The Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7984;&#948;&#959;&#973;</font> (<font face="Greektl">idou</font>) has not been translated because it has no exact English equivalent here, but adds interest and emphasis (BDAG 468 s.v. 1). Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;now&#8221; to indicate the transition to a new topic.</p>
<A NAME="1921"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=932><b>sn</b> A quotation from Exod 20:12-16; Deut 5:16-20.</p>
<A NAME="1922"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=933><b>sn</b> A quotation from Lev 19:18.</p>
<A NAME="1923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=934><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;kept.&#8221; The implication of this verb is that the man has obeyed the commandments without fail, so the adverb &#8220;wholeheartedly&#8221; has been added to the translation to bring out this nuance.</p>
<A NAME="1924"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=935><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;these things.&#8221; The referent of the pronoun (the laws mentioned by Jesus) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> While the rich man was probably being sincere when he insisted <i>I have wholeheartedly obeyed all these laws</i>, he had confined his righteousness to external obedience. The rich man&#8217;s response to Jesus&#8217; command &#8211; to give away all he had &#8211; revealed that internally he loved money more than God.</p>
<A NAME="1925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=936><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;the money&#8221; are not in the Greek text, but are implied. Direct objects were often omitted in Greek when clear from the context.</p>
<A NAME="1926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=937><b>sn</b> The call for sacrifice comes with a promise of eternal reward: <i>You will have treasure in heaven</i>. Jesus&#8217; call is a test to see how responsive the man is to God&#8217;s direction through him. Will he walk the path God&#8217;s agent calls him to walk? For a rich person who got it right, see Zacchaeus in Luke 19:1-10.</p>
<A NAME="1927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=938><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;he had many possessions.&#8221; This term (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#964;&#8134;&#956;&#945;</font>, <font face="Greektl">kthma</font>) is often used for land as a possession.</p>
<A NAME="1928"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=939><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Truly (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">amhn</font>), I say to you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1929"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=940><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;I say to you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1930"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=941><b>tc</b> A few late witnesses (579 1424 <i>pc</i>) read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#940;&#956;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kamilon</font>, &#8220;rope&#8221;) for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#940;&#956;&#951;&#955;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kamhlon</font>, &#8220;camel&#8221;), either through accidental misreading of the text or intentionally so as to soften Jesus&#8217; words.</p>
<A NAME="1931"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=942><b>sn</b> The<i> eye of a needle</i> refers to a sewing needle. (The gate in Jerusalem known as &#8220;The Needle&#8217;s Eye&#8221; was built during the middle ages and was not in existence in Jesus&#8217; day.) Jesus was saying rhetorically that it is impossible for a rich person to enter God&#8217;s kingdom, unless God (v. 26) intervenes.</p>
<A NAME="1932"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=943><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has not been translated.</p>
<A NAME="1933"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=944><b>sn</b> The assumption is that the rich are blessed, so if they risk exclusion, who is left to <i>be saved</i>?</p>
<A NAME="1934"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=945><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has not been translated.</p>
<A NAME="1935"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=946><b>tn</b> The plural Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anqrwpois</font>) is used here in a generic sense, referring to both men and women (cf. NASB 1995 update, &#8220;people&#8221;). Because of the contrast here between mere mortals and God (&#8220;impossible for <i>men</i>, but for <i>God</i> all things are possible&#8221;) the phrase &#8220;mere humans&#8221; has been used in the translation. There may also be a slight wordplay with &#8220;the Son of Man&#8221; in v. 28.</p>
<A NAME="1936"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=947><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;Then answering, Peter said.&#8221; This construction is somewhat redundant in contemporary English and has been simplified in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="1937"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=948><b>sn</b> Peter wants reassurance that the disciples&#8217; response and sacrifice have been noticed.</p>
<A NAME="1938"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=949><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;We have left everything and followed you.&#8221; Koine Greek often used paratactic structure when hypotactic was implied.</p>
<A NAME="1939"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=950><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has not been translated.</p>
<A NAME="1940"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=951><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Truly (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">amhn</font>), I say to you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1941"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=952><b>sn</b> The Greek term translated <i>the age when all things are renewed</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#955;&#953;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#943;&#945;</font>, <font face="Greektl">palingenesia</font>) is understood as a reference to the Messianic age, the time when all things are renewed and restored (cf. Rev 21:5).</p>
<A NAME="1942"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=953><b>sn</b><i> </i>The statement <i>you&#8230;will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel</i> looks at the future authority the Twelve will have when Jesus returns. They will share in Israel&#8217;s judgment.</p>
<A NAME="1943"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=954><b>sn</b> Jesus reassures his disciples with a promise that (1) much benefit in this life (<i>a hundred times as much</i>) and (2) <i>eternal life</i> will be given.</p>
