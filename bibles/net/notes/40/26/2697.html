<A NAME="2697"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">97</span><note=1390><b>tn</b> It seems most likely that this refers to a real rooster crowing, although a number of scholars have suggested that &#8220;cockcrow&#8221; is a technical term referring to the trumpet call which ended the third watch of the night (from midnight to 3 a.m.). This would then be a reference to the Roman <i>gallicinium</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#959;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#969;&#957;&#943;&#945;</font>, <font face="Greektl">alektorofwnia</font>; the term is used in Mark 13:35 and is found in some <sc>mss [<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>37vid,45</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup>] in Matt 26:34) which would have been sounded at 3 a.m.; in this case Jesus would have prophesied a precise time by which the denials would have taken place. For more details see J. H. Bernard, <i>St. John </i>(ICC), 2:604. However, in light of the fact that Mark mentions the rooster crowing twice (Mark 14:72) and in Luke 22:60 the words are reversed (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#966;&#8061;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#949;&#957; &#7936;&#955;&#941;&#954;&#964;&#969;&#961;</font>, <font face="Greektl">efwnhsen alektwr</font>), it is more probable that a real rooster is in view. In any event natural cockcrow would have occurred at approximately 3 a.m. in Palestine at this time of year (March-April) anyway.</p>
