The shorter reading does not enjoy overwhelming support ([<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>] B D 892 <i>pc</i>, as well as versional witnesses), but it is nevertheless significant; coupled with the internal evidence it should be given preference.</p>

<A NAME="2421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1200><b>sn</b> <i>But the person who endures to the end will be saved.</i> Jesus was not claiming here that salvation is by works. He was simply arguing that genuine faith evidences itself in persistence through even the worst of trials.</p>

<A NAME="2423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1202><b>sn</b> The reference to<i> the abomination of desolation</i> is an allusion to Dan 9:27. Though some have seen the fulfillment of Daniel&#8217;s prophecy in the actions of Antiochus IV (or a representative of his) in 167 <sc>b.c., the words of Jesus seem to indicate that Antiochus was not the final fulfillment, but that there was (from Jesus&#8217; perspective) still another fulfillment yet to come. Some argue that this was realized in <sc>a.d. 70, while others claim that it refers specifically to Antichrist and will not be fully realized until the period of the great tribulation at the end of the age (cf. Mark 13:14, 19, 24; Rev 3:10).</p>
<A NAME="2424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1203><b>sn</b> Fleeing<i> to the mountains </i>is a key OT image: Gen 19:17; Judg 6:2; Isa 15:5; Jer 16:16; Zech 14:5.</p>

<A NAME="2426"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1205><b>sn</b> The swiftness and devastation of the judgment will require a swift escape. There will be no time to <i>come down</i> from the roof and pick up anything from inside one&#8217;s home.</p>

Some refer this event to the destruction of Jerusalem in <sc>a.d. 70. While the events of <sc>a.d. 70 may reflect somewhat the comments Jesus makes here, the reference to the scope and severity of this judgment strongly suggest that much more is in view. Most likely Jesus is referring to the great end-time judgment on Jerusalem in the great tribulation.</p>

The heavens were seen as the abode of heavenly forces, so their shaking indicates distress in the spiritual realm. Although some take <i>the powers</i> as a reference to bodies in the heavens (like stars and planets, &#8220;the heavenly bodies,&#8221; NIV) this is not as likely.</p>

<A NAME="2446"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1225><b>sn</b> An allusion to Dan 7:13. Here is Jesus returning with full authority to judge.</p>
<A NAME="2447"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1226><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;of the sky&#8221;; the Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ouranos</font>) may be translated &#8220;sky&#8221; or &#8220;heaven,&#8221; depending on the context.</p>

<A NAME="2449"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1228><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#953;&#957;&#8061;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ginwskete</font>, &#8220;know&#8221;) can be parsed as either present indicative or present imperative. In this context the imperative fits better, since the movement is from analogy (trees and seasons) to the future (the signs of the coming of the kingdom) and since the emphasis is on preparation for this event.</p>
<A NAME="2450"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1229><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Truly (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">amhn</font>), I say to you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2451"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1230><b>sn</b> This is one of the hardest verses in the gospels to interpret. Various views exist for what <i>generation</i> means. (1) Some take it as meaning &#8220;race&#8221; and thus as an assurance that the Jewish race (nation) will not pass away. But it is very questionable that the Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#949;&#957;&#949;&#940;</font> (<font face="Greektl">genea</font>) can have this meaning. Two other options are possible. (2) <i>Generation</i> might mean &#8220;this type of generation&#8221; and refer to the generation of wicked humanity. Then the point is that humanity will not perish, because God will redeem it. Or (3) <i>generation </i>may refer to &#8220;the generation that sees the signs of the end&#8221; (v. 30), who will also see the end itself. In other words, once the movement to the return of Christ starts, all the events connected with it happen very quickly, in rapid succession.</p>
<A NAME="2452"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=1231><b>sn</b> The<i> words</i> that Jesus predicts here <i>will never pass away</i>. They are more stable and lasting than creation itself. For this kind of image, see Isa 40:8; 55:10-11.</p>
<A NAME="2453"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1232><b>tc</b> &#8225; Some important witnesses, including early Alexandrian and Western <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>*<sup>,2</sup> B D <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13 </sup><i>pc</i> it vg<sup>mss</sup> Ir<sup>lat</sup> Hier<sup>mss</sup>), have the additional words <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016;&#948;&#8050; &#8001; &#965;&#7985;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">oude Jo Juios</font>, &#8220;nor the son&#8221;) here. Although the shorter reading (which lacks this phrase) is suspect in that it seems to soften the prophetic ignorance of Jesus, the final phrase (&#8220;except the Father <i>alone</i>&#8221;) already implies this. Further, the parallel in Mark 13:32 has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016;&#948;&#8050; &#8001; &#965;&#7985;&#972;&#962;</font>, with almost no witnesses lacking the expression. Hence, it is doubtful that the absence of &#8220;neither the Son&#8221; is due to the scribes. In keeping with Matthew&#8217;s general softening of Mark&#8217;s harsh statements throughout his Gospel, it is more likely that the absence of &#8220;neither the Son&#8221; is part of the original text of Matthew, being an intentional change on the part of the author. Further, this shorter reading is supported by the first corrector of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> as well as L W <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup> 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font><i> </i>vg sy co Hier<sup>mss</sup>. Admittedly, the external evidence is not as impressive for the shorter reading, but it best explains the rise of the other reading (in particular, how does one account for virtually no <sc>mss excising <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016;&#948;&#8050; &#8001; &#965;&#7985;&#972;&#962;</font> at Mark 13:32 if such an absence here is due to scribal alteration? Although scribes were hardly consistent, for such a theologically significant issue at least some consistency would be expected on the part of a few scribes). Nevertheless, NA<sup>27</sup> includes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016;&#948;&#8050; &#8001; &#965;&#7985;&#972;&#962;</font> here.</p>
<A NAME="2454"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1233><b>sn</b> Like the <i>days of Noah</i>, the time of the flood in Gen 6:5-8:22, the judgment will come as a surprise as people live their day to day lives.</p>

<A NAME="2458"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=1237><b>sn</b> There is debate among commentators and scholars over the phrase <i>one will be taken and one left</i> about whether one is taken for judgment or for salvation. If the imagery is patterned after the rescue of Noah from the flood, as some suggest, the ones taken are the saved (as Noah was) and those left behind are judged. The imagery, however, is not directly tied to the identification of the two groups. Its primary purpose in context is to picture the sudden, surprising separation of the righteous and the judged (i.e., condemned) at the return of the Son of Man.</p>

<A NAME="2468"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=1247><b>tn</b> In the Greek text this is a third class condition that for all practical purposes is a hypothetical condition (note the translation of the following verb &#8220;should say&#8221;).</p>

<A NAME="2470"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=1249><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#967;&#959;&#964;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">dicotomew</font>) means to cut an object into two parts (L&amp;N 19.19). This is an extremely severe punishment compared to the other two later punishments. To translate it simply as &#8220;punish&#8221; is too mild. If taken literally this servant is dismembered, although it is possible to view the stated punishment as hyperbole (L&amp;N 38.12).</p>
