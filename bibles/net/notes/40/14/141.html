<A NAME="141"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=687><b>sn</b> A <i>tetrarch</i>, a ruler with rank and authority lower than a king, ruled only with the approval of the Roman authorities. This was roughly equivalent to being governor of a region. Several times in the NT, Herod, tetrarch of Galilee, is called a king (Matt 14:9, Mark 6:14-29), reflecting popular usage rather than an official title.</p>
