Although only a few Greek <sc>mss, along with several versional witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* D Z<sup>vid</sup> 579 1424 <i>pc</i> e k sy<sup>s,c,p</sup> sa bo), lack the name of Jesus, the omission does not seem to be either accidental or malicious and is therefore judged to be most likely the original reading. Nevertheless, a decision is difficult. NA<sup>27</sup> has the word in brackets, indicating doubts as to its authenticity.</p>
