<A NAME="1536"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=757><b>tn</b><i> </i>Or &#8220;lap dogs, house dogs,&#8221; as opposed to dogs on the street. The diminutive form originally referred to puppies or little dogs, then to house pets. In some Hellenistic uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kunarion</font>) simply means &#8220;dog.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The term <i>dogs</i> does not refer to wild dogs (scavenging animals roaming around the countryside) in this context, but to small dogs taken in as house pets. It is thus not a derogatory term per se, but is instead intended by Jesus to indicate the privileged position of the Jews (especially his disciples) as the initial recipients of Jesus&#8217; ministry. The woman&#8217;s response of faith and her willingness to accept whatever Jesus would offer pleased him to such an extent that he granted her request.</p>
