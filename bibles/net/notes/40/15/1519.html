There is a distinct possibility of omission due to homoioarcton in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>*; this manuscript has a word order variation which puts the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#965;&#966;&#955;&#959;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">tufloi</font>, &#8220;blind&#8221;) right before the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#965;&#966;&#955;&#8182;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">tuflwn</font>, &#8220;of the blind&#8221;). This does not explain the shorter reading, however, in the other witnesses, of which B and D are quite weighty. Internal considerations suggest that the shorter reading is original: &#8220;of the blind&#8221; was likely added by scribes to balance this phrase with Jesus&#8217; following statement about the blind leading the blind, which clearly has two groups in view. A decision is difficult, but internal considerations here along with the strength of the witnesses argue that the shorter reading is more likely original.
