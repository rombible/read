<A NAME="155"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=726><b>tc</b> &#8225; Although most witnesses read the genitive plural pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8182;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">autwn</font>, &#8220;their&#8221;), it may have been motivated by clarification (as it is in the translation above). Several other authorities do not have the pronoun, however (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font> 073 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup> 579 700 892 1424 <i>pc</i> f g<sup>1</sup>); the lack of an unintentional oversight as the reason for omission strengthens their combined testimony in this shorter reading. NA<sup>27</sup> has the pronoun in brackets, indicating doubts as to its authenticity.</p>
