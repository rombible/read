<A NAME="960"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=399><b>tc</b> Although codex Cantabrigiensis (D), along with a few other Western versional and patristic witnesses, lacks this verse, virtually all other witnesses have it. The Western text&#8217;s reputation for free alterations as well as the heightened climax if v. 33 concludes this pericope explains why these witnesses omitted the verse. </p>
