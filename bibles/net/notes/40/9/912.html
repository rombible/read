<A NAME="912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=351><b>sn</b> The term <i>Son of Man</i>, which is a title in Greek, comes from a pictorial description in Dan 7:13 of one &#8220;like a son of man&#8221; (i.e., a human being). It is Jesus&#8217; favorite way to refer to himself. Jesus did not reveal the background of the term here, which mixes human and divine imagery as the man in Daniel rides a cloud, something only God does. He just used it. It also could be an idiom in Aramaic meaning either &#8220;some person&#8221; or &#8220;me.&#8221; So there is a little ambiguity in its use here, since its origin is not clear at this point. However, the action makes it clear that Jesus used it to refer to himself here.</p>
