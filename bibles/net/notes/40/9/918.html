<A NAME="918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=357><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;people.&#8221; The plural of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anqrwpo&quot;</font>) usually indicates people in general, but the singular is used in the expression &#8220;Son of Man.&#8221; There is thus an ironic allusion to Jesus&#8217; statement in v. 6: His self-designation as &#8220;Son of Man&#8221; is meant to be unique, but the crowd regards it simply as meaning &#8220;human, person.&#8221; To maintain this connection for the English reader the plural <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#8061;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anqrwpoi&quot;</font>) has been translated here as &#8220;men&#8221; rather than as the more generic &#8220;people.&#8221;</p>
