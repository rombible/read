<A NAME="126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=532><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the bread of presentation.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The sacred bread</i> refers to the &#8220;bread of presentation,&#8221; &#8220;showbread,&#8221; or &#8220;bread of the Presence,&#8221; twelve loaves prepared weekly for the tabernacle and later, the temple. See Exod 25:30; 35:13; 39:36; Lev 24:5-9. Each loaf was made from 3 quarts (3.5 liters; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;two tenths of an ephah&#8221;) of fine flour. The loaves were placed on a table in the holy place of the tabernacle, on the north side opposite the lampstand (Exod 26:35). It was the duty of the priest each Sabbath to place fresh bread on the table; the loaves from the previous week were then given to Aaron and his descendants, who ate them in the holy place, because they were considered sacred (Lev 24:9). See also Mark 2:23-28, Luke 6:1-5.</p>
