<A NAME="1234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=560><b>tc</b> The majority of <sc>mss read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jo Ihsous</font>, &#8220;Jesus&#8221;), which clarifies who is the subject of the sentence. Although the shorter text is attested in far fewer witnesses (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>21</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B D 892* sy<sup>s,c</sup> sa bo), both the pedigree of the <sc>mss and the strong internal evidence (viz., scribes were not prone to intentionally delete the name of Jesus) argue for the omission of Jesus&#8217; name. The name has been included in the translation, however, for clarity.</p>
