<A NAME="1270"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=596><b>sn</b> The background for the reference to <i>waterless places</i> is not entirely clear, though some Jewish texts suggest spirits must have a place to dwell, but not with water (Luke 8:29-31; Tob 8:3). Some suggest that the image of the desert or deserted cities as the places demons dwell is where this idea started (Isa 13:21; 34:14).</p>
