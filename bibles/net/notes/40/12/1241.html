<A NAME="1241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=567><b>tn</b> The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#966;&#952;&#945;&#963;&#949;&#957; &#7952;&#966;&#8127; &#8017;&#956;&#8118;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">efqasen ef</font>&#8217;<font face="Greektl"> Juma&quot;</font>) is quite important. Does it mean merely &#8220;approach&#8221; (which would be reflected in a translation like &#8220;has come near to you&#8221;) or actually &#8220;come upon&#8221; (as in the translation given above, &#8220;has already overtaken you,&#8221; which has the added connotation of suddenness)? Is the arrival of the kingdom merely anticipated or already in process? Two factors favor arrival over anticipation here. First, the prepositional phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#966;&#8127; &#8017;&#956;&#8118;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ef</font>&#8217;<font face="Greektl"> Jumas</font>, &#8220;upon you&#8221;) in the Greek text suggests arrival (Dan 4:24, 28 Theodotion). Second, the following illustration in v. 29 looks at the healing as portraying Satan being overrun. So the presence of God&#8217;s authority has arrived. See also L&amp;N 13.123 for the translation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#952;&#940;&#957;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">fqanw</font>) as &#8220;to happen to already, to come upon, to come upon already.&#8221;</p>
