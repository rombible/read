<A NAME="127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=533><b>sn</b> Jesus&#8217; response to the charge that what his disciples were doing was <i>against the law </i>is one of analogy: &#8220;If David did it for his troops in a time of need, then so can I with my disciples.&#8221; Jesus is clear that on the surface there was a violation here. What is not as clear is whether he is arguing a &#8220;greater need&#8221; makes this permissible or that this was within the intention of the law all along.</p>
