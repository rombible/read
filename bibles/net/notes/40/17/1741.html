<A NAME="1741"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=852><b>tn</b> The plural Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#8061;&#960;&#969;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anqrwpwn</font>) is considered by some to be used here in a generic sense, referring to both men and women (cf. NRSV &#8220;into human hands&#8221;; TEV, CEV &#8220;to people&#8221;). However, because this can be taken as a specific reference to the group responsible for Jesus&#8217; arrest, where it is unlikely women were present (cf. Matt 26:47-56; Mark 14:43-52; Luke 22:47-53; John 18:2-12), the word &#8220;men&#8221; has been retained in the translation. There may also be a slight wordplay with &#8220;the Son of Man&#8221; earlier in the verse.</p>
