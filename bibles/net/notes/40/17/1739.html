As B. M. Metzger notes, &#8220;Since there is no satisfactory reason why the passage, if originally present in Matthew, should have been omitted in a wide variety of witnesses, and since copyists frequently inserted material derived from another Gospel, it appears that most manuscripts have been assimilated to the parallel in Mk 9.29&#8221; (<i>TCGNT</i> 35). The present translation follows NA<sup>27</sup> in omitting the verse number as well, a procedure also followed by a number of other modern translations.</p>
