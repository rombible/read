It is clear from the words of the psalm shouted by the crowd that Jesus is being proclaimed as messianic king. See E. Lohse, <i>TDNT</i> 9:682-84.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Hosanna</i> is an Aramaic expression that literally means, &#8220;help, I pray,&#8221; or &#8220;save, I pray.&#8221; By Jesus&#8217; time it had become a strictly liturgical formula of praise, however, and was used as an exclamation of praise to God.</p>

The meaning of Jesus&#8217; statement about making the temple courts <i>a den of robbers</i> probably operates here at two levels. Not only were the religious leaders robbing the people financially, but because of this they had also robbed them spiritually by stealing from them the opportunity to come to know God genuinely. It is possible that these merchants had recently been moved to this location for convenience.</p>

Jesus&#8217; question revealed the motivation of the religious leaders and exposed them for what they really were &#8211; hypocrites. They indicted themselves when they cited only two options and chose neither of them (&#8220;<i>We do not know</i>&#8221;). The point of Matt 21:23-27 is that no matter what Jesus said in response to their question, they were not going to believe it and would in the end use it against him.</p>

<A NAME="2147"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1048><b>tc</b> Verses 29-31 involve a rather complex and difficult textual problem. The variants cluster into three different groups: (1) The first son says &#8220;no&#8221; and later has a change of heart, and the second son says &#8220;yes&#8221; but does not go. The second son is called the one who does his father&#8217;s will. This reading is found in the Western <sc>mss (D it). But the reading is so hard as to be nearly impossible. One can only suspect some tampering with the text, extreme carelessness on the part of the scribe, or possibly a recognition of the importance of not shaming one&#8217;s parent in public. (Any of these reasons is not improbable with this texttype, and with codex D in particular.) The other two major variants are more difficult to assess. Essentially, the responses make sense (the son who does his father&#8217;s will is the one who changes his mind after saying &#8220;no&#8221;): (2) The first son says &#8220;no&#8221; and later has a change of heart, and the second son says &#8220;yes&#8221; but does not go. But here, the first son is called the one who does his father&#8217;s will (unlike the Western reading). This is the reading found in (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>) C L W (Z) 0102 0281 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup> 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> and several versional witnesses. (3) The first son says &#8220;yes&#8221; but does not go, and the second son says &#8220;no&#8221; but later has a change of heart. This is the reading found in B <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13 </sup>700 and several versional witnesses. Both of these latter two readings make good sense and have significantly better textual support than the first reading. The real question, then, is this: Is the first son or the second the obedient one? If one were to argue simply from the parabolic logic, the second son would be seen as the obedient one (hence, the third reading). The first son would represent the Pharisees (or Jews) who claim to obey God, but do not (cf. Matt 23:3). This accords well with the parable of the prodigal son (in which the oldest son represents the unbelieving Jews). Further, the chronological sequence of the second son being obedient fits well with the real scene: Gentiles and tax collectors and prostitutes were not, collectively, God&#8217;s chosen people, but they did repent and come to God, while the Jewish leaders claimed to be obedient to God but did nothing. At the same time, the external evidence is weaker for this reading (though stronger than the first reading), not as widespread, and certainly suspect because of how neatly it fits. One suspects scribal manipulation at this point. Thus the second reading looks to be superior to the other two on both external and transcriptional grounds. But what about intrinsic evidence? One can surmise that Jesus didn&#8217;t always give predictable responses. In this instance, he may well have painted a picture in which the Pharisees saw themselves as the first son, only to stun them with his application (v. 32).</p>
