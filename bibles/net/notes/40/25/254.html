<A NAME="254"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1253><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;extra&#8221; is not in the Greek text but is implied. The point is that the five foolish virgins had only the oil in their lamps, but took along no extra supply from which to replenish them. This is clear from v. 8, where the lamps of the foolish virgins are going out because they are running out of oil.</p>
