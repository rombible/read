<A NAME="2531"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1280><b>sn</b> The one who has nothing has even what he seems to have <i>taken from him</i>, ending up with no reward at all (see also Luke 8:18). The exact force of this is left ambiguous, but there is no comfort here for those who are pictured by the third slave as being totally unmoved by the master. Though not an outright enemy, there is no relationship to the master either.</p>
