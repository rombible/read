<A NAME="1616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=785><b>map</b> For location see Map1-C1; Map2-F4.</p>
<A NAME="1617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=786><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;he asked his disciples, saying.&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#969;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">legwn</font>) is redundant and has been left untranslated.</p>
<A NAME="1618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=787><b>sn</b> The appearance of <i>Elijah</i> would mean that the end time had come. According to 2 Kgs 2:11, Elijah was still alive. In Mal 4:5 it is said that Elijah would be the precursor of Messiah.</p>
<A NAME="1619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=788><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;And answering, Simon Peter said.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=790><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;answering, Jesus said to him.&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#949;&#943;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">apokriqeis</font>) is redundant, but the syntax of this phrase has been modified for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=791><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;flesh and blood&#8221; could refer to &#8220;any human being&#8221; (so TEV, NLT; cf. NIV &#8220;man&#8221;), but it could also refer to Peter himself (i.e., his own intuition; cf. CEV &#8220;You didn&#8217;t discover this on your own&#8221;). Because of the ambiguity of the referent, the phrase &#8220;flesh and blood&#8221; has been retained in the translation. </p>
<A NAME="1623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=792><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;and the power of death&#8221; (taking the reference to the gates of Hades as a metonymy).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In the OT, <i>Hades</i> was known as <i>Sheol</i>. It is the place where the unrighteous will reside (Matt 11:23; Luke 16:23; Rev 20:13-14). Some translations render this by its modern equivalent, &#8220;hell&#8221;; others see it as a reference to the power of death.</p>
<A NAME="1624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=793><b>tc</b> Most <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> C W <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat bo) have &#8220;Jesus, the Christ&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962; &#8001; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Ihsou&quot; Jo Cristo&quot;</font>) here, while D has &#8220;Christ Jesus&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</font>). On the one hand, this is a much harder reading than the mere <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font>, because the name Jesus was already well known for the disciples&#8217; master &#8211; both to them and to others. Whether he was the Messiah is the real focus of the passage. But this is surely too hard a reading: There are no other texts in which the Lord tells his disciples not to disclose his personal name. Further, it is plainly a motivated reading in that scribes had the proclivity to add<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> &#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</font> to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> or to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kurio&quot;</font>, &#8220;Lord&#8221;), regardless of whether such was appropriate to the context. In this instance it clearly is not, and it only reveals that scribes sometimes, if not often, did not think about the larger interpretive consequences of their alterations to the text. Further, the shorter reading is well supported by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* B L <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> 565 700 1424 <i>al</i> it sa.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Messiah&#8221;; both &#8220;Christ&#8221; (Greek) and &#8220;Messiah&#8221; (Hebrew and Aramaic) mean &#8220;one who has been anointed.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> See the note on <i>Christ</i> in 1:16.</p>

<A NAME="1627"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=796><b>sn</b> The necessity that the Son of Man <i>suffer</i> is the particular point that needed emphasis since for many 1st century Jews the Messiah was a glorious and powerful figure, not a suffering one.</p>
<A NAME="1628"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=797><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;and scribes.&#8221; See the note on the phrase &#8220;experts in the law&#8221; in 2:4.</p>
<A NAME="1629"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=798><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;began to rebuke him, saying.&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#969;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">legwn</font>) is redundant in English and has not been translated.</p>
<A NAME="1630"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=799><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;Merciful to you.&#8221; A highly elliptical expression: &#8220;May God be merciful to you in sparing you from having to undergo [some experience]&#8221; (L&amp;N 88.78). A contemporary English equivalent is &#8220;God forbid!&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1631"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=800><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;people.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1632"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=801><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;to come after me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1633"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=802><b>tn</b> This translation better expresses the force of the Greek third person imperative than the traditional &#8220;let him deny,&#8221; which could be understood as merely permissive.</p>
<A NAME="1634"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=803><b>sn</b> To bear the cross means to accept the rejection of the world for turning to Jesus and following him. Discipleship involves a death that is like a crucifixion; see Gal 6:14.</p>
<A NAME="1635"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=804><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;soul&#8221; (throughout vv. 25-26).</p>
<A NAME="1636"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=805><b>sn</b> The point of the saying <i>whoever wants to save his life will lose it</i> is that if one comes to Jesus then rejection by many will certainly follow. If self-protection is a key motivation, then one will not respond to Jesus and will not be saved. One who is willing to risk rejection will respond and find true life.</p>
<A NAME="1637"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=806><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;a man,&#8221; but <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anqrwpo&quot;</font>) is used in a generic sense here to refer to both men and women.</p>
<A NAME="1638"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=807><b>sn</b> An allusion to Pss 28:4; 62:12; cf. Prov 24:12.</p>
<A NAME="1639"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=808><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Truly (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">amhn</font>), I say to you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1640"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=809><b>tn</b> The Greek negative here (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016; &#956;&#8053;</font>, <font face="Greektl">ou mh</font>) is the strongest possible.</p>
<A NAME="1641"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=810><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;will not taste.&#8221; Here the Greek verb does not mean &#8220;sample a small amount&#8221; (as a typical English reader might infer from the word &#8220;taste&#8221;), but &#8220;experience something cognitively or emotionally; come to know something&#8221; (cf. BDAG 195 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#949;&#973;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</font> 2).</p>
<A NAME="1642"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=811><b>sn</b> Several suggestions have been made as to the referent for the phrase <i>the Son of Man coming in his kingdom</i>: (1) the transfiguration itself, which immediately follows in the narrative; (2) Jesus&#8217; resurrection and ascension; (3) the coming of the Spirit; (4) Christ&#8217;s role in the Church; (5) the destruction of Jerusalem; (6) Jesus&#8217; second coming and the establishment of the kingdom. The reference to <i>six days later</i> in 17:1 seems to indicate that Matthew had the transfiguration in mind insofar as it was a substantial prefiguring of the consummation of the kingdom (although this interpretation is not without its problems). As such, the transfiguration would be a tremendous confirmation to the disciples that even though Jesus had just finished speaking of his death (in vv. 21-23), he was nonetheless the promised Messiah and things were proceeding according to God&#8217;s plan.</p>
