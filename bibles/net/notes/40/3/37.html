<A NAME="37"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=72><b>sn</b> John&#8217;s lifestyle was in stark contrast to many of the religious leaders of Jerusalem who lived in relative ease and luxury. While his clothing and diet were indicative of someone who lived in the desert, they also depicted him in his role as God&#8217;s prophet (cf. Zech 13:4); his appearance is similar to the Prophet Elijah (2 Kgs 1:8). <i>Locusts</i> <i>and wild honey</i> were a common diet in desert regions, and locusts (dried insects) are listed in Lev 11:22 among the &#8220;clean&#8221; foods.</p>
