<A NAME="51"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=144><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has not been translated.</p>
<A NAME="52"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=145><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;up a mountain&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#8056; &#8004;&#961;&#959;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">eis to oro&quot;</font>).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The expression <i>up the mountain</i> here may be idiomatic or generic, much like the English &#8220;he went to the hospital&#8221; (cf. 15:29), or even intentionally reminiscent of Exod 24:12 (LXX), since the genre of the Sermon on the Mount seems to be that of a new Moses giving a new law.</p>
<A NAME="53"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=146><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;then&#8221; to indicate the implied sequence of events within the narrative.</p>
<A NAME="54"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=147><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And opening his mouth he taught them, saying.&#8221; The imperfect verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#948;&#943;&#948;&#945;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">edidasken</font>) has been translated ingressively.</p>
<A NAME="55"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=148><b>sn</b> The term <i>Blessed</i> introduces the first of several beatitudes promising blessing to those whom God cares for. They serve as an invitation to come into the grace God offers.</p>
<A NAME="56"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=149><b>sn</b> <i>The poor</i> <i>in spirit </i>is a reference to the &#8220;pious poor&#8221; for whom God especially cares. See Ps 14:6; 22:24; 25:16; 34:6; 40:17; 69:29.</p>
<A NAME="57"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=150><b>sn</b> The present tense (<i>belongs</i>) here is significant. Jesus makes the kingdom and its blessings currently available. This phrase is unlike the others in the list with the possessive pronoun being emphasized.</p>
<A NAME="58"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=151><b>sn</b> The promise <i>they will be comforted </i>is the first of several &#8220;reversals&#8221; noted in these promises. The beatitudes and the reversals that accompany them serve in the sermon as an invitation to enter into God&#8217;s care, because one can know God cares for those who turn to him.</p>
<A NAME="59"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=152><b>sn</b> <i>Those who hunger </i>are people like the poor Jesus has already mentioned. The term has OT roots both in conjunction with the poor (Isa 32:6-7; 58:6-7, 9-10; Ezek 18:7, 16) or by itself (Ps 37:16-19; 107:9).</p>
<A NAME="510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=153><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;sons,&#8221; though traditionally English versions have taken this as a generic reference to both males and females, hence &#8220;children&#8221; (cf. KJV, NAB, NRSV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=154><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;when they insult you.&#8221; The third person pronoun (here implied in the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8000;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#948;&#943;&#963;&#969;&#963;&#953;&#957;</font> [<font face="Greektl">ojneidiswsin</font>]) has no specific referent, but refers to people in general.</p>
<A NAME="512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=155><b>tc</b> Although <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#968;&#949;&#965;&#948;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">yeudomenoi</font>, &#8220;bearing witness falsely&#8221;) could be a motivated reading, clarifying that the disciples are unjustly persecuted, its lack in only D it sy<sup>s</sup> Tert does not help its case. Since the Western text is known for numerous free alterations, without corroborative evidence the shorter reading must be judged as secondary.</p>
<A NAME="513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=156><b>sn</b> <i>Salt</i> was used as seasoning or fertilizer (BDAG 41 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7941;&#955;&#945;&#962;</font> a), or as a preservative. If salt ceased to be useful, it was thrown away. With this illustration Jesus warned about a disciple who ceased to follow him.</p>
<A NAME="514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=157><b>sn</b> The difficulty of this saying is understanding how <i>salt </i>could lose <i>its flavor</i> since its chemical properties cannot change. It is thus often assumed that Jesus was referring to chemically impure salt, perhaps a natural salt which, when exposed to the elements, had all the genuine salt leached out, leaving only the sediment or impurities behind. Others have suggested that the background of the saying is the use of salt blocks by Arab bakers to line the floor of their ovens; under the intense heat these blocks would eventually crystallize and undergo a change in chemical composition, finally being thrown out as unserviceable. A saying in the Talmud (<i>b. Bekhorot</i> 8b) attributed to R. Joshua ben Chananja (ca. <sc>a.d. 90), when asked the question &#8220;When salt loses its flavor, how can it be made salty again?&#8221; is said to have replied, &#8220;By salting it with the afterbirth of a mule.&#8221; He was then asked, &#8220;Then does the mule (being sterile) bear young?&#8221; to which he replied: &#8220;Can salt lose its flavor?&#8221; The point appears to be that both are impossible. The saying, while admittedly late, suggests that culturally the loss of flavor by salt was regarded as an impossibility. Genuine salt can never lose its flavor. In this case the saying by Jesus here may be similar to Matt 19:24, where it is likewise impossible for the camel to go through the eye of a sewing needle.</p>
<A NAME="515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=158><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;Nor do they light.&#8221; The plural in Greek is indefinite, referring to people in general.</p>

<A NAME="517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=160><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;not come to abolish but to fulfill.&#8221; Direct objects (&#8220;these things,&#8221; &#8220;them&#8221;) were frequently omitted in Greek when clear from the context, but have been supplied here to conform to contemporary English style.</p>

<A NAME="525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=168><b>sn</b> A quotation from Exod 20:13; Deut 5:17.</p>
<A NAME="526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=169><b>tc</b> The majority of <sc>mss read the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#954;&#8135;</font> (<font face="Greektl">eikh</font>, &#8220;without cause&#8221;) here after &#8220;brother.&#8221; This insertion has support from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> D L W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> 0233 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13 </sup>33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font><i> </i>it sy co Ir<sup>lat</sup> Or<sup>mss</sup> Cyp Cyr.

The ms evidence favors its exclusion, though there is a remote possibility that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#954;&#8135;</font> could have been accidentally omitted from these witnesses by way of homoioarcton (the next word, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#957;&#959;&#967;&#959;&#962;</font> [<font face="Greektl">enocos</font>, &#8220;guilty&#8221;], begins with the same letter). An intentional change would likely arise from the desire to qualify &#8220;angry,&#8221; especially in light of the absolute tone of Jesus&#8217; words. While &#8220;without cause&#8221; makes good practical sense in this context, and must surely be a true interpretation of Jesus&#8217; meaning (cf. Mark 3:5), it does not commend itself as original.</p>
<A NAME="527"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=170><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;whoever says to his brother &#8216;<i>Raca</i>,&#8217;&#8221; an Aramaic word of contempt or abuse meaning &#8220;fool&#8221; or &#8220;empty head.&#8221;</p>

Most take it to mean, following the Syriac versions, &#8220;you fool,&#8221; although some have argued that it represents a transliteration into Greek of the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">moreh</font>) &#8220;rebel&#8221; (Deut 21:18, 20; cf.

This was the valley along the south side of Jerusalem. In OT times it was used for human sacrifices to the pagan god Molech (cf. Jer 7:31; 19:5-6; 32:35), and it came to be used as a place where human excrement and rubbish were disposed of and burned. In the intertestamental period, it came to be used symbolically as the place of divine punishment (cf. <i>1 En.</i> 27:2, 90:26; <i>4 Ezra </i>7:36).</p>
<A NAME="533"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=176><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;Make friends.&#8221;</p>

The parallel passage in Luke 12:59 mentions the lepton, equal to one-half of a quadrans and thus the smallest coin available.</p>

<A NAME="544"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=187><b>tn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#957;&#951;&#961;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ponhrou</font>) may be understood as specific and personified, referring to the devil, or possibly as a general reference to evil. It is most likely personified, however, since it is articular (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#960;&#959;&#957;&#951;&#961;&#959;&#8166;</font>, <font face="Greektl">tou ponhrou</font>). Cf. also &#8220;the evildoer&#8221; in v. 39, which is the same construction.</p>
<A NAME="545"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=188><b>sn</b> A quotation from Exod 21:24; Lev 24:20.</p>
<A NAME="546"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=189><b>tn</b> The articular <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#957;&#951;&#961;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ponhro&quot;</font>, &#8220;the evildoer&#8221;) cannot be translated simply as &#8220;evil&#8221; for then the command would be &#8220;do not resist evil.&#8221; Every instance of this construction in Matthew is most likely personified, referring either to an evildoer (13:49) or, more often, &#8220;the evil one&#8221; (as in 5:37; 6:13; 13:19, 38).</p>
<A NAME="547"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=190><b>tc</b> &#8225; Many <sc>mss (B D K L <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> 565 579 700 1424 <i>pm</i>) have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">sou</font>) here (&#8220;<i>your </i>right cheek&#8221;), but many others lack the pronoun (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> W <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup><i> </i>33 892 1241 <i>pm</i>). The pronoun was probably added by way of clarification. NA<sup>27</sup> has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#959;&#965;</font> in brackets, indicating doubt as to its authenticity.</p>
<A NAME="548"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=191><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;shirt&#8221; (a long garment worn under the cloak next to the skin). The name for this garment (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#967;&#953;&#964;&#8061;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">citwn</font>) presents some difficulty in translation. Most modern readers would not understand what a &#8220;tunic&#8221; was any more than they would be familiar with a &#8220;<i>chiton</i>.&#8221; On the other hand, attempts to find a modern equivalent are also a problem: &#8220;Shirt&#8221; conveys the idea of a much shorter garment that covers only the upper body, and &#8220;undergarment&#8221; (given the styles of modern underwear) is more misleading still. &#8220;Tunic&#8221; was therefore employed, but with a note to explain its nature.</p>
<A NAME="549"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=192><b>sn</b> <i>If anyone forces you to go one mile.</i> In NT times Roman soldiers had the authority to press civilians into service to carry loads for them.</p>

See L&amp;N 58.26.</p>
