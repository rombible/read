<A NAME="2211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1081><b>sn</b> The <i>Herodians</i> are mentioned in the NT only once in Matt (22:16 = Mark 12:13) and twice in Mark (3:6; 12:13; some <sc>mss also read &#8220;Herodians&#8221; instead of &#8220;Herod&#8221; in Mark 8:15). It is generally assumed that as a group the Herodians were Jewish supporters of the Herodian dynasty (or of Herod Antipas in particular). In every instance they are linked with the Pharisees. This probably reflects agreement regarding political objectives (nationalism as opposed to submission to the yoke of Roman oppression) rather than philosophy or religious beliefs.</p>
