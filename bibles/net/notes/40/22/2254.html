<A NAME="2254"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1124><b>sn</b> It was a common belief in Judaism that Messiah would be <i>the son of David </i>in that he would come from the lineage of David. On this point the Pharisees agreed<i> </i>and were correct. But their understanding was nonetheless incomplete, for Messiah is also David&#8217;s Lord. With this statement Jesus was affirming that, as the Messiah, he is both God and man.</p>
