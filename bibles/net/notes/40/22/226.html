<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1076><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;he sent his soldiers, destroyed those murderers.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#8061;&#955;&#949;&#963;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">apwlesen</font>) is causative, indicating that the king was the one behind the execution of the murderers. In English the causative idea is not expressed naturally here; either a purpose clause (&#8220;he sent his soldiers to put those murderers to death&#8221;) or a relative clause (&#8220;he sent his soldier who put those murderers to death&#8221;) is preferred. </p>
