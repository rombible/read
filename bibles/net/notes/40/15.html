<A NAME="155"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=726><b>tc</b> &#8225; Although most witnesses read the genitive plural pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8182;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">autwn</font>, &#8220;their&#8221;), it may have been motivated by clarification (as it is in the translation above). Several other authorities do not have the pronoun, however (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font> 073 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup> 579 700 892 1424 <i>pc</i> f g<sup>1</sup>); the lack of an unintentional oversight as the reason for omission strengthens their combined testimony in this shorter reading. NA<sup>27</sup> has the pronoun in brackets, indicating doubts as to its authenticity.</p>

<A NAME="158"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=729><b>tc</b> Most <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>*<sup>,2</sup> C L W 0106 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>) have an expanded introduction here; instead of &#8220;For God said,&#8221; they read &#8220;For God commanded, saying&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#952;&#949;&#8056;&#962; &#7952;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#955;&#945;&#964;&#959; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#969;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jo gar qeo&quot; eneteilato legwn</font>). But such expansions are generally motivated readings; in this case, most likely it was due to the wording of the previous verse (&#8220;the commandment of God&#8221;) that caused early scribes to add to the text. Although it is possible that other witnesses reduced the text to the simple <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">eipen</font>, &#8220;[God] said&#8221;) because of perceived redundancy with the statement in v. 3, such is unlikely in light of the great variety and age of these authorities (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>1</sup> B D <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> 073 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13 </sup>579 700 892 <i>pc</i> lat co, as well as other versions and fathers).</p>

<A NAME="1510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=731><b>sn</b> A quotation from Exod 21:17; Lev 20:9.</p>
<A NAME="1511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=732><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;is a gift,&#8221; that is, something dedicated to God.</p>
<A NAME="1512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=733><b>tc</b> The logic of v. 5 would seem to demand that both father and mother are in view in v. 6. Indeed, the majority of <sc>mss (C L W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> 0106 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>) have &#8220;or his mother&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7970; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#956;&#951;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#945; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font>, <font face="Greektl">h thn mhtera autou</font>) after &#8220;honor his father&#8221; here. However, there are significant witnesses that have variations on this theme (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#956;&#951;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#945; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font> [<font face="Greektl">kai thn mhtera autou</font>, &#8220;and his mother&#8221;] in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#934;</font> 565 1241 <i>pc </i>and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7970; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#956;&#951;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#945;</font> [&#8220;or mother&#8221;] in 073 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> 33 579 700 892 <i>pc</i>), which is usually an indication of a predictable addition to the text rather than an authentic reading. Further, the shorter reading (without any mention of &#8220;mother&#8221;) is found in early and important witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B D sa). Although it is possible that the shorter reading came about accidentally (due to the repetition of &#8211;<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#961;&#945;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font>), the evidence more strongly suggests that the longer readings were intentional scribal alterations.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;he will never honor his father.&#8221; Here Jesus is quoting the Pharisees, whose intent is to release the person who is giving his possessions to God from the family obligation of caring for his parents. The verb in this phrase is future tense, and it is negated with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016; &#956;&#8053;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ou mh</font>), the strongest negation possible in Greek. A literal translation of the phrase does not capture the intended sense of the statement; it would actually make the Pharisees sound as if they agreed with Jesus. Instead, a more interpretive translation has been used to focus upon the release from family obligations that the Pharisees allowed in these circumstances.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Here Jesus refers to something that has been set aside as a gift to be given to God at some later date, but which is still in the possession of the owner. According to contemporary Jewish tradition, the person who made this claim was absolved from responsibility to support or assist his parents, a clear violation of the Mosaic law to <i>honor</i> one&#8217;s parents (v. 4).</p>
<A NAME="1513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=734><b>tn</b> The term &#8220;heart&#8221; is a collective singular in the Greek text.</p>

<A NAME="1519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=740><b>tc</b> &#8225; Most <sc>mss, some of which are significant, read &#8220;They are blind guides of the blind&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>1</sup> C L W Z <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat). The shorter reading is read by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>*<sup>,2</sup> B D 0237 Epiph. There is a distinct possibility of omission due to homoioarcton in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>*; this manuscript has a word order variation which puts the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#965;&#966;&#955;&#959;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">tufloi</font>, &#8220;blind&#8221;) right before the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#965;&#966;&#955;&#8182;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">tuflwn</font>, &#8220;of the blind&#8221;). This does not explain the shorter reading, however, in the other witnesses, of which B and D are quite weighty. Internal considerations suggest that the shorter reading is original: &#8220;of the blind&#8221; was likely added by scribes to balance this phrase with Jesus&#8217; following statement about the blind leading the blind, which clearly has two groups in view. A decision is difficult, but internal considerations here along with the strength of the witnesses argue that the shorter reading is more likely original. NA<sup>27</sup> places <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#965;&#966;&#955;&#8182;&#957;</font> in brackets, indicating doubts as to its authenticity.</p>

In some Hellenistic uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kunarion</font>) simply means &#8220;dog.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The term <i>dogs</i> does not refer to wild dogs (scavenging animals roaming around the countryside) in this context, but to small dogs taken in as house pets. It is thus not a derogatory term per se, but is instead intended by Jesus to indicate the privileged position of the Jews (especially his disciples) as the initial recipients of Jesus&#8217; ministry.
