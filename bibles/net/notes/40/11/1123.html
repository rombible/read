<A NAME="1123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=497><b>tn</b> The translation &#8220;had better listen!&#8221; captures the force of the third person imperative more effectively than the traditional &#8220;let him hear,&#8221; which sounds more like a permissive than an imperative to the modern English reader. This was Jesus&#8217; common expression to listen and heed carefully (cf. Matt 13:9, 43; Mark 4:9, 23; Luke 8:8, 14:35).</p>
