The omission is supported by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> C L Z 085 Or. Nevertheless, NA<sup>27</sup> includes the pronoun on the basis of the greater external attestation.</p>
<A NAME="2010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=964><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;each received a denarius.&#8221; See the note on the phrase &#8220;standard wage&#8221; in v. 2.</p>

<A NAME="2018"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=972><b>tc</b> &#8225; Before <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016;&#954;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ouk</font>, &#8220;[am I] not&#8221;) a number of significant witnesses read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7972;</font> (<font face="Greektl">h</font>, &#8220;or&#8221;; e.g., <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> C W 085 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> 33 and most others). Although in later Greek the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#953;</font> in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#959;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">oi </font>in <font face="Greektl">soi</font>) &#8211; the last word of v. 14 &#8211; would have been pronounced like <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7972;</font>, since <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7972;</font> is lacking in early <sc>mss (B D; among later witnesses, note L Z <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> 700) and since <sc>mss were probably copied predominantly by sight rather than by sound, even into the later centuries, the omission of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7972;</font> cannot be accounted for as easily. Thus the shorter reading is most likely original. NA<sup>27</sup> includes the word in brackets, indicating doubts as to its authenticity.</p>
<A NAME="2019"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=973><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;Is your eye evil because I am good?&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="2021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=975><b>tc</b> &#8225; A number of significant witnesses (e.g., B C W 085 33 lat) have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#945;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#940;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">maqhtas</font>, &#8220;disciples&#8221;) after <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#8061;&#948;&#949;&#954;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">dwdeka</font>, &#8220;twelve&#8221;), perhaps by way of clarification, while other important witnesses lack the word (e.g., <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> D L <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup>). The longer reading looks to be a scribal clarification, and hence is considered to be secondary. NA<sup>27</sup> puts the word in brackets to show doubts about its authenticity.</p>
<A NAME="2022"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=976><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;and the scribes.&#8221; See the note on the phrase &#8220;experts in the law&#8221; in 2:4.</p>
<A NAME="2023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=977><b>tn</b> Traditionally, &#8220;scourged&#8221; (the term means to beat severely with a whip, L&amp;N 19.9). BDAG 620 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#947;&#972;&#969;</font> 1.a states, &#8220;The &#8216;verberatio&#8217; is denoted in the passion predictions and explicitly as action by non-Israelites Mt 20:19; Mk 10:34; Lk 18:33&#8221;; the <i>verberatio </i>was the beating given to those condemned to death in the Roman judicial system. Here the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#947;&#972;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">mastigow</font>) has been translated &#8220;flog&#8230;severely&#8221; to distinguish it from the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#955;&#972;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">fragellow</font>) used in Matt 27:26; Mark 15:15.</p>
<A NAME="2024"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=978><b>sn</b> Crucifixion was the cruelest form of punishment practiced by the Romans. Roman citizens could not normally undergo it. It was reserved for the worst crimes, like treason and evasion of due process in a capital case. The Roman historian Cicero called it &#8220;a cruel and disgusting penalty&#8221; (<i>Against Verres</i> 2.5.63-66 §§163-70); Josephus (<i>J. W. </i>7.6.4 [7.203]) called it the worst of deaths.</p>
<A NAME="2025"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=979><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;yet&#8221; to indicate the contrast present in this context.</p>
<A NAME="2026"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=980><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;asked something from him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2027"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=981><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;said to him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2028"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=982><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;Say that.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2029"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=983><b>tc</b> A majority of witnesses read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">sou</font>, &#8220;your&#8221;) here, perhaps for clarification. At the same time, it is possible that the pronoun dropped out through haplography or was excised because of perceived redundancy (there are two other such pronouns in the verse) by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B. Either way, the translation adds it due to the requirements of English style. NA<sup>27</sup> includes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#959;&#965;</font> here.</p>
<A NAME="2030"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=984><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;And answering, Jesus said.&#8221; This is somewhat redundant in English and has been simplified in the translation. Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has not been translated.</p>
<A NAME="2031"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=985><b>tn</b> The verbs in Greek are plural here, indicating that Jesus is not answering the mother but has turned his attention directly to the two disciples.</p>
<A NAME="2032"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=986><b>tc</b> Most <sc>mss (C W 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>, as well as some versional and patristic authorities) in addition have &#8220;or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?&#8221; But this is surely due to a recollection of the fuller version of this dominical saying found in Mark 10:38. The same <sc>mss also have the Lord&#8217;s response, &#8220;and you will be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized&#8221; in v. 23, again due to the parallel in Mark 10:39. The shorter reading, in both v. 22 and v. 23, is to be preferred both because it better explains the rise of the other reading and is found in superior witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B D L Z <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> 085 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> <i>pc </i>lat, as well as other versional and patristic authorities).</p>
<A NAME="2033"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=987><b>sn</b> No more naïve words have ever been spoken as those found here coming from James and John, &#8220;<i>We are able</i>.&#8221; They said it with such confidence and ease, yet they had little clue as to what they were affirming. In the next sentence Jesus confirms that they will indeed suffer for his name.</p>
<A NAME="2034"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=988><b>tc</b> See the <b>tc</b> note on &#8220;about to drink&#8221; in v. 22. </p>
<A NAME="2035"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=989><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;now&#8221; to indicate the transition to a new topic.</p>
<A NAME="2036"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=990><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the ten.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2037"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=991><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;this&#8221; is not in the Greek text, but is supplied. Direct objects were often omitted in Greek when clear from the context.</p>
<A NAME="2038"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=992><b>tn</b> See the note on the word &#8220;slave&#8221; in 8:9.</p>
<A NAME="2039"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=993><b>sn</b> The Greek word for <i>ransom</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#973;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">lutron</font>) is found here and in Mark 10:45 and refers to the payment of a price in order to purchase the freedom of a slave. The idea of Jesus as the &#8220;ransom&#8221; is that he paid the price with his own life by standing in our place as a substitute, enduring the judgment that we deserved for sin.</p>
<A NAME="2040"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=994><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B2; Map6-E1; Map7-E1; Map8-E3; Map10-A2; Map11-A1.</p>
<A NAME="2041"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=995><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;And behold.&#8221; The Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7984;&#948;&#959;&#973;</font> (<font face="Greektl">idou</font>) has not been translated because it has no exact English equivalent here, but adds interest and emphasis (BDAG 468 s.v. 1).</p>
<A NAME="2042"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=996><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;shouted, saying.&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">legontes</font>) is redundant here in contemporary English and has not been translated.</p>
<A NAME="2043"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=997><b>sn</b> <i>Have mercy on us</i> is a request for healing. It is not owed to the men. They simply ask for God&#8217;s kind grace.</p>
<A NAME="2044"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=998><b>sn</b> There was a tradition in Judaism that the Son of David (Solomon) had great powers of healing (Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 8.2.5 [8.42-49]).</p>
<A NAME="2045"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=999><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has not been translated.</p>
<A NAME="2046"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1000><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;rebuked.&#8221; The crowd&#8217;s view was that surely Jesus would not be bothered with someone as unimportant as a blind beggar.</p>
<A NAME="2047"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1001><b>tc</b> &#8225; The majority of <sc>mss (C W <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup> 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> and several versional witnesses) read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kurie</font>, &#8220;Lord&#8221;) after <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#955;&#941;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#957; &#7969;&#956;&#8118;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">elehson Jhma&quot;</font>, &#8220;have mercy on us&#8221;). But since this is the order of words in v. 30 (though that wording is also disputed), and since the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#949;-</font>first reading enjoys widespread and early support (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B D L Z <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> 085 0281 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> 892 <i>pc </i>lat), the latter was considered original. However, the decision was by no means easy. NA<sup>27</sup> has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#949;</font> after <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#955;&#941;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#957; &#7969;&#956;&#8118;&#962;</font> here; a majority of that committee felt that since the placement of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#949;</font> in last place was the nonliturgical order it &#8220;would have been likely to be altered in transcription to the more familiar sequence&#8221; (<i>TCGNT</i> 44).</p>
