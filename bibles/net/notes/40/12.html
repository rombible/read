See Exod 25:30; 35:13; 39:36; Lev 24:5-9. Each loaf was made from 3 quarts (3.5 liters; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;two tenths of an ephah&#8221;) of fine flour. The loaves were placed on a table in the holy place of the tabernacle, on the north side opposite the lampstand (Exod 26:35). It was the duty of the priest each Sabbath to place fresh bread on the table; the loaves from the previous week were then given to Aaron and his descendants, who ate them in the holy place, because they were considered sacred (Lev 24:9). See also Mark 2:23-28, Luke 6:1-5.</p>
<A NAME="127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=533><b>sn</b> Jesus&#8217; response to the charge that what his disciples were doing was <i>against the law </i>is one of analogy: &#8220;If David did it for his troops in a time of need, then so can I with my disciples.&#8221; Jesus is clear that on the surface there was a violation here. What is not as clear is whether he is arguing a &#8220;greater need&#8221; makes this permissible or that this was within the intention of the law all along.</p>

<A NAME="1219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=545><b>sn</b> The background for this is the view that only if life was endangered should one attempt to heal on the Sabbath (see the Mishnah, <i>m. Shabbat </i>6.3; 12.1; 18.3; 19.2; <i>m. Yoma</i> 8.6).</p>

In spite of the good quality of both <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> and B (especially in combination), and the testimony of the Latin witnesses, the longer reading is most likely correct; the shorter readings were probably due to homoioteleuton.</p>

The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">legontos</font>) is redundant and has not been translated.</p>

<A NAME="1234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=560><b>tc</b> The majority of <sc>mss read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jo Ihsous</font>, &#8220;Jesus&#8221;), which clarifies who is the subject of the sentence. Although the shorter text is attested in far fewer witnesses (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>21</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B D 892* sy<sup>s,c</sup> sa bo), both the pedigree of the <sc>mss and the strong internal evidence (viz., scribes were not prone to intentionally delete the name of Jesus) argue for the omission of Jesus&#8217; name. The name has been included in the translation, however, for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=561><b>sn</b> Jesus here demonstrated the absurdity of the thinking of the religious leaders who maintained that he was in league with Satan and that he actually derived his power from the devil. He first teaches (vv. 25-28) that if he casts out demons by the ruler of the demons, then in reality Satan is fighting against himself, with the result that his kingdom has come to an end. He then teaches (v. 29) about tying up the strong man to prove that he does not need to align himself with the devil because he is more powerful. Jesus defeated Satan at his temptation (4:1-11) and by his exorcisms he clearly demonstrated himself to be stronger than the devil. The passage reveals the desperate condition of the religious leaders, who in their hatred for Jesus end up attributing the work of the Holy Spirit to Satan (a position for which they will be held accountable, 12:31-32).</p>
<A NAME="1236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=562><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;is left in ruins.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=563><b>tn</b> This first class condition, the first of three &#8220;if&#8221; clauses in the following verses, presents the example vividly as if it were so. In fact, all three conditions in these verses are first class. The examples are made totally parallel. The expected answer is that Satan&#8217;s kingdom will not stand, so the suggestion makes no sense. Satan would not seek to heal.</p>
<A NAME="1238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=564><b>sn</b> Most read <i>your sons</i> as a reference to Jewish exorcists (cf. &#8220;your followers,&#8221; L&amp;N 9.4), but more likely this is a reference to the disciples of Jesus themselves, who are also Jewish and have been healing as well (R. J. Shirock, &#8220;Whose Exorcists are they? The Referents of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#7985; &#965;&#7985;&#959;&#8054; &#8017;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</font> at Matthew 12:27/Luke 11:19,&#8221; <i>JSNT</i> 46 [1992]: 41-51). If this is a reference to the disciples, then Jesus&#8217; point is that it is not only him, but those associated with him whose power the hearers must assess. The following reference to judging also favors this reading.</p>
<A NAME="1239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=565><b>tn</b> The pronoun &#8220;them&#8221; is not in the Greek text, but is implied. Direct objects were frequently omitted in Greek when clear from the context.</p>
<A NAME="1240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=566><b>sn</b> The<i> kingdom of God</i> is a major theme of Jesus. It is a realm in which Jesus rules and to which those who trust him belong.</p>
<A NAME="1241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=567><b>tn</b> The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#966;&#952;&#945;&#963;&#949;&#957; &#7952;&#966;&#8127; &#8017;&#956;&#8118;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">efqasen ef</font>&#8217;<font face="Greektl"> Juma&quot;</font>) is quite important. Does it mean merely &#8220;approach&#8221; (which would be reflected in a translation like &#8220;has come near to you&#8221;) or actually &#8220;come upon&#8221; (as in the translation given above, &#8220;has already overtaken you,&#8221; which has the added connotation of suddenness)? Is the arrival of the kingdom merely anticipated or already in process? Two factors favor arrival over anticipation here. First, the prepositional phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#966;&#8127; &#8017;&#956;&#8118;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ef</font>&#8217;<font face="Greektl"> Jumas</font>, &#8220;upon you&#8221;) in the Greek text suggests arrival (Dan 4:24, 28 Theodotion). Second, the following illustration in v. 29 looks at the healing as portraying Satan being overrun. So the presence of God&#8217;s authority has arrived. See also L&amp;N 13.123 for the translation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#952;&#940;&#957;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">fqanw</font>) as &#8220;to happen to already, to come upon, to come upon already.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=568><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;Or how can.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=569><b>sn</b> The <i>strong man</i> here pictures Satan.</p>
<A NAME="1244"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=570><b>sn</b> Some see the imagery here as similar to Eph 4:7-10, although no opponents are explicitly named in that passage. Jesus has the victory over Satan. Jesus&#8217; acts of healing mean that the war is being won and the kingdom is coming.</p>
<A NAME="1245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=571><b>sn</b> <i>Whoever is not with me is against me. </i>The call here is to join the victor. Failure to do so means that one is being destructive. Responding to Jesus is the issue.</p>

Three things must be kept in mind: (1) the nature of the sin is to ascribe what is the obvious work of the Holy Spirit (e.g., releasing people from Satan&#8217;s power) to Satan himself; (2) it is not simply a momentary doubt or sinful attitude, but is indeed a settled condition which opposes the Spirit&#8217;s work, as typified by the religious leaders who opposed Jesus; and (3) a person who is concerned about it has probably never committed this sin, for those who commit it here (i.e., the religious leaders) are not in the least concerned about Jesus&#8217; warning.</p>

<A NAME="1270"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=596><b>sn</b> The background for the reference to <i>waterless places</i> is not entirely clear, though some Jewish texts suggest spirits must have a place to dwell, but not with water (Luke 8:29-31; Tob 8:3). Some suggest that the image of the desert or deserted cities as the places demons dwell is where this idea started (Isa 13:21; 34:14).</p>
<A NAME="1271"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=597><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;but&#8221; to indicate the contrast present in this context.</p>
<A NAME="1272"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=598><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;I will return to my house from which I came.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1273"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=599><b>tn</b><i> Grk</i> &#8220;comes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1274"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=600><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;the house&#8221; are not in Greek but are implied.</p>
<A NAME="1275"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">75</span><note=601><b>sn</b> The image of the house <i>empty, swept clean, and put in order</i> refers to the life of the person from whom the demon departed.<i> </i>The key to the example appears to be that no one else has been invited in to dwell. If an exorcism occurs and there is no response to God, then the way is free for the demon to return. Some see the reference to exorcism as more symbolic; thus the story&#8217;s only point is about responding to Jesus. This is possible and certainly is an application of the passage.</p>
<A NAME="1276"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">76</span><note=602><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;so&#8221; to indicate the concluding point of the story.</p>
<A NAME="1277"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=603><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Jesus) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1278"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=604><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;crowds, behold, his mother.&#8221; The Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7984;&#948;&#959;&#973;</font> (<font face="Greektl">idou</font>) has not been translated because it has no exact English equivalent here, but adds interest and emphasis (BDAG 468 s.v. 1).</p>
<A NAME="1279"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">79</span><note=605><b>sn</b> The issue of whether Jesus had <i>brothers </i>(siblings) has had a long history in the church. Epiphanius, in the 4th century, argued that Mary was a perpetual virgin and had no offspring other than Jesus. Others argued that these brothers were really cousins. Nothing in the text suggests any of this. See also John 7:3.</p>
<A NAME="1280"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">80</span><note=606><b>tn</b> &#8220;His mother and brothers came and&#8221; is a translation of &#8220;behold, his mother and brothers came.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1281"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">81</span><note=607><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;seeking.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1282"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">82</span><note=608><b>tc</b> A few ancient <sc>mss and versions lack this verse (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* B L <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#915;</font> <i>pc</i> ff<sup>1</sup> k sy<sup>s,c</sup> sa). The witness of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> and B is especially strong, but internal considerations override this external evidence. Both v. 46 and 47 end with the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#945;&#955;&#8134;&#963;&#945;&#953;</font> (&#8220;to speak&#8221;), so early scribes probably omitted the verse through homoioteleuton. The following verses make little sense without v. 47; its omission is too hard a reading. Thus v. 47 was most likely part of the original text.</p>
<A NAME="1283"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">83</span><note=609><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has not been translated.</p>

<A NAME="1287"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">87</span><note=613><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;extending his hand.&#8221;</p>
