<A NAME="2768"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=1459><b>sn</b> There is rich irony in the statements of those who were passing by, &#8220;s<i>ave yourself!</i>&#8221;<i> </i>and &#8220;<i>come down from the cross!</i>&#8221; In summary, they wanted Jesus to come down from the cross and save his physical life, but it was indeed his staying on the cross and giving his physical life that led to the fact that they could experience a resurrection from death to life.</p>
