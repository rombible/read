<A NAME="2731"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1422><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Him &#8211; be crucified!&#8221; The third person imperative is difficult to translate because English has no corresponding third person form for the imperative. The traditional translation &#8220;Let him be crucified&#8221; sounds as if the crowd is giving consent or permission. &#8220;He must be crucified&#8221; is closer, but it is more natural in English to convert the passive to active and simply say &#8220;Crucify him.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> See the note on <i>crucified </i>in 20:19.</p>
