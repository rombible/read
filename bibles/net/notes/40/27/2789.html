<A NAME="2789"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">89</span><note=1480><b>tn</b> The referent of this term, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#960;&#941;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#956;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">katapetasma</font>), is not entirely clear. It could refer to the curtain separating the holy of holies from the holy place (Josephus, <i>J. W. </i>5.5.5 [5.219]), or it could refer to one at the entrance of the temple court (Josephus, <i>J. W.</i> 5.5.4 [5.212]). Many argue that the inner curtain is meant because another term, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#940;&#955;&#965;&#956;&#956;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kalumma</font>), is also used for the outer curtain. Others see a reference to the outer curtain as more likely because of the public nature of this sign. Either way, the symbolism means that access to God has been opened up. It also pictures a judgment that includes the sacrifices.</p>
