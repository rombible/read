<A NAME="2710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1401><b>tc</b> The problematic citing of Jeremiah for a text which appears to come from Zechariah has prompted certain scribes to alter it. Codex 22 has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#918;&#945;&#967;&#945;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Zacariou</font>, &#8220;Zechariah&#8221;) while <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#934;</font> 33 omit the prophet&#8217;s name altogether. And codex 21 and the Latin ms l change the prophet&#8217;s name to &#8220;Isaiah,&#8221; in accordance with natural scribal proclivities to alter the text toward the most prominent OT prophet. But unquestionably the name Jeremiah is the wording of the original here, because it is supported by virtually all witnesses and because it is the harder reading. See D. A. Carson, &#8220;Matthew,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 8:562-63, for a discussion of the textual and especially hermeneutical problem.</p>
