<A NAME="2470"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=1249><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#967;&#959;&#964;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">dicotomew</font>) means to cut an object into two parts (L&amp;N 19.19). This is an extremely severe punishment compared to the other two later punishments. To translate it simply as &#8220;punish&#8221; is too mild. If taken literally this servant is dismembered, although it is possible to view the stated punishment as hyperbole (L&amp;N 38.12).</p>
