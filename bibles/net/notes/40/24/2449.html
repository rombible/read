<A NAME="2449"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1228><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#953;&#957;&#8061;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ginwskete</font>, &#8220;know&#8221;) can be parsed as either present indicative or present imperative. In this context the imperative fits better, since the movement is from analogy (trees and seasons) to the future (the signs of the coming of the kingdom) and since the emphasis is on preparation for this event.</p>
