<A NAME="2423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1202><b>sn</b> The reference to<i> the abomination of desolation</i> is an allusion to Dan 9:27. Though some have seen the fulfillment of Daniel&#8217;s prophecy in the actions of Antiochus IV (or a representative of his) in 167 <sc>b.c., the words of Jesus seem to indicate that Antiochus was not the final fulfillment, but that there was (from Jesus&#8217; perspective) still another fulfillment yet to come. Some argue that this was realized in <sc>a.d. 70, while others claim that it refers specifically to Antichrist and will not be fully realized until the period of the great tribulation at the end of the age (cf. Mark 13:14, 19, 24; Rev 3:10).</p>
