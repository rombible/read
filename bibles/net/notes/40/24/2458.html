<A NAME="2458"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=1237><b>sn</b> There is debate among commentators and scholars over the phrase <i>one will be taken and one left</i> about whether one is taken for judgment or for salvation. If the imagery is patterned after the rescue of Noah from the flood, as some suggest, the ones taken are the saved (as Noah was) and those left behind are judged. The imagery, however, is not directly tied to the identification of the two groups. Its primary purpose in context is to picture the sudden, surprising separation of the righteous and the judged (i.e., condemned) at the return of the Son of Man.</p>
