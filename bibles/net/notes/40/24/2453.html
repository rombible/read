<A NAME="2453"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1232><b>tc</b> &#8225; Some important witnesses, including early Alexandrian and Western <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>*<sup>,2</sup> B D <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13 </sup><i>pc</i> it vg<sup>mss</sup> Ir<sup>lat</sup> Hier<sup>mss</sup>), have the additional words <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016;&#948;&#8050; &#8001; &#965;&#7985;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">oude Jo Juios</font>, &#8220;nor the son&#8221;) here. Although the shorter reading (which lacks this phrase) is suspect in that it seems to soften the prophetic ignorance of Jesus, the final phrase (&#8220;except the Father <i>alone</i>&#8221;) already implies this. Further, the parallel in Mark 13:32 has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016;&#948;&#8050; &#8001; &#965;&#7985;&#972;&#962;</font>, with almost no witnesses lacking the expression. Hence, it is doubtful that the absence of &#8220;neither the Son&#8221; is due to the scribes. In keeping with Matthew&#8217;s general softening of Mark&#8217;s harsh statements throughout his Gospel, it is more likely that the absence of &#8220;neither the Son&#8221; is part of the original text of Matthew, being an intentional change on the part of the author. Further, this shorter reading is supported by the first corrector of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> as well as L W <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup> 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font><i> </i>vg sy co Hier<sup>mss</sup>. Admittedly, the external evidence is not as impressive for the shorter reading, but it best explains the rise of the other reading (in particular, how does one account for virtually no <sc>mss excising <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016;&#948;&#8050; &#8001; &#965;&#7985;&#972;&#962;</font> at Mark 13:32 if such an absence here is due to scribal alteration? Although scribes were hardly consistent, for such a theologically significant issue at least some consistency would be expected on the part of a few scribes). Nevertheless, NA<sup>27</sup> includes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016;&#948;&#8050; &#8001; &#965;&#7985;&#972;&#962;</font> here.</p>
