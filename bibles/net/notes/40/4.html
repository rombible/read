<A NAME="41"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=102><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;desert.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="42"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=103><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;and having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward he was hungry.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="43"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=104><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;say that these stones should become bread.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="44"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=105><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;answering, he said.&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#949;&#943;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">apokriqeis</font>) is redundant, but the syntax of the phrase has been changed for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="45"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=106><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;a person.&#8221; Greek<i> </i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jo anqrwpo&quot;</font>) is used generically for humanity. The translation &#8220;man&#8221; is used because the emphasis in Jesus&#8217; response seems to be on his dependence on God as a <i>man</i>.</p>
<A NAME="46"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=107><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;will not live.&#8221; The verb in Greek is a future tense, but it is unclear whether it is meant to be taken as a command (also known as an imperatival future) or as a statement of reality (predictive future).</p>
<A NAME="47"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=108><b>sn</b> A quotation from Deut 8:3.</p>
<A NAME="48"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=109><b>sn</b> The order of the second and third temptations differs in Luke&#8217;s account (4:5-12) from the order given in Matthew.</p>
<A NAME="49"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=110><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;and he stood him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=111><b>sn</b> The <i>highest point of the temple</i> probably refers to the point on the temple&#8217;s southeast corner where it looms directly over a cliff some 450 ft (135 m) high. However, some have suggested the reference could be to the temple&#8217;s high gate.</p>
<A NAME="411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=112><b>sn</b> A quotation from Ps 91:11. This was not so much an incorrect citation as a use in a wrong context (a misapplication of the passage).</p>
<A NAME="412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=113><b>sn</b> A quotation from Ps 91:12.</p>
<A NAME="413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=114><b>sn</b> A quotation from Deut 6:16.</p>
<A NAME="414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=115><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;glory.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=116><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;if, falling down, you will worship.&#8221; BDAG 815 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#943;&#960;&#964;&#969;</font> 1.b.<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;</font>.<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;</font> has &#8220;<i>fall down, throw oneself to the ground</i> as a sign of devotion, before high-ranking persons or divine beings.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=117><b>tc</b> The majority of later witnesses (C<sup>2</sup> D L Z 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>) have &#8220;behind me&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8000;&#960;&#943;&#963;&#969; &#956;&#959;&#965;</font>; <font face="Greektl">opisw mou</font>) after &#8220;Go away.&#8221; But since this is the wording in Matt 16:23, where the text is certain, scribes most likely added the words here to conform to the later passage. Further, the shorter reading has superior support (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B C*<sup>vid</sup> K P W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font> 0233 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13 </sup>565 579* 700 <i>al</i>). Thus, both externally and internally, the shorter reading is strongly preferred.</p>
<A NAME="417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=118><b>sn</b> A quotation from Deut 6:13. The word &#8220;only&#8221; is an interpretive expansion not found in either the Hebrew or Greek (LXX) text of the OT.</p>
<A NAME="418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=119><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;and behold, angels.&#8221; The Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7984;&#948;&#959;&#973;</font> (<font face="Greektl">idou</font>) has not been translated because it has no exact English equivalent here, but adds interest and emphasis (BDAG 468 s.v. 1).</p>
<A NAME="419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=120><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;he.&#8221;</p>

It was a major trade and economic center in the North Galilean region, and it became the hub of operations for Jesus&#8217; Galilean ministry.</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map1-D2; Map2-C3; Map3-B2.</p>
<A NAME="423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=124><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;by the lake.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>By the sea </i>refers to the Sea of Galilee.</p>
<A NAME="424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=125><b>tn</b> The redundant participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">legontos</font>) has not been translated here. </p>
<A NAME="425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=126><b>sn</b> A quotation from Isa 9:1.</p>
<A NAME="426"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=127><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;and to say.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="427"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=128><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has not been translated.</p>
<A NAME="428"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=129><b>tn</b> The two phrases in this verse placed in parentheses are explanatory comments by the author, parenthetical in nature.</p>
<A NAME="429"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=130><b>tn</b> The Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anqrwpos</font>) is used here in a generic sense, referring to both men and women, thus &#8220;people.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The kind of fishing envisioned was net &#8211; not line &#8211; fishing (cf. v. 18; cf. also BDAG 55 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#966;&#953;&#946;&#940;&#955;&#955;&#969;</font>, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#966;&#943;&#946;&#955;&#951;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#957;</font>) which involved a circular net that had heavy weights around its perimeter. The occupation of fisherman was labor-intensive. The imagery of using a lure and a line (and waiting for the fish to strike) is thus foreign to this text. Rather, the imagery of a fisherman involved much strain, long hours, and often little results. Jesus&#8217; point may have been one or more of the following: the strenuousness of evangelism, the work ethic that it required, persistence and dedication to the task (often in spite of minimal results), the infinite value of the new &#8220;catch&#8221; (viz., people), and perhaps an eschatological theme of snatching people from judgment (cf. W. L. Lane, <i>Mark</i> [NICNT], 67). If this last motif is in view, then catching people is the opposite of catching fish: The fish would be caught, killed, cooked, and eaten; people would be caught so as to remove them from eternal destruction and to give them new life.</p>
<A NAME="430"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=131><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has not been translated.</p>
<A NAME="431"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=132><b>sn</b> The expression <i>followed him</i> pictures discipleship, which means that to learn from Jesus is to follow him as the guiding priority of one&#8217;s life.</p>
<A NAME="432"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=133><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;their boat.&#8221; The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#960;&#955;&#959;&#943;&#8179;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en tw ploiw</font>) can either refer to a generic boat, some boat (as it seems to do here); or it can refer to &#8220;their&#8221; boat, implying possession. Mark assumes a certain preunderstanding on the part of his readers about the first four disciples and hence the translation &#8220;their boat&#8221; is justified (cf. also v. 20 in which the &#8220;hired men&#8221; indicates that Zebedee&#8217;s family owned the boats), while Matthew does not. </p>
<A NAME="433"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=134><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;then&#8221; to indicate the implied sequence of events within the narrative.</p>
<A NAME="434"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=135><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has not been translated.</p>
<A NAME="435"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=136><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And he.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="436"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=137><b>sn</b> <i>Synagogues</i> were places for Jewish prayer and worship, with recognized leadership (cf. Luke 8:41). Though the origin of the synagogue is not entirely clear, it seems to have arisen in the postexilic community during the intertestamental period. A town could establish a synagogue if there were at least ten men. In normative Judaism of the NT period, the OT scripture was read and discussed in the synagogue by the men who were present (see the Mishnah, <i>m. Megillah</i> 3-4; <i>m. Berakhot</i> 2).</p>
<A NAME="437"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=138><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;And they&#8221;; &#8220;they&#8221; is probably an indefinite plural, referring to people in general rather than to the Syrians (cf. v. 25).</p>
<A NAME="438"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=139><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;those who were moonstruck,&#8221; possibly meaning &#8220;lunatic&#8221; (so NAB), although now the term is generally regarded as referring to some sort of seizure disorder such as epilepsy (L&amp;N 23.169; BDAG 919 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#949;&#955;&#951;&#957;&#953;&#940;&#950;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</font>).</p>
<A NAME="439"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=140><b>tn</b> The translation has adopted a different phrase order here than that in the Greek text. The Greek text reads, &#8220;People brought to him all who suffered with various illnesses and afflictions, those possessed by demons, epileptics, and paralytics.&#8221; Even though it is obvious that four separate groups of people are in view here, following the Greek word order could lead to the misconception that certain people were possessed by epileptics and paralytics. The word order adopted in the translation avoids this problem.</p>
<A NAME="440"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=141><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has not been translated before each of the places in the list, since English normally uses a coordinating conjunction only between the last two elements in a series of three or more.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The Decapolis</i> refers to a league of towns (originally consisting of ten; the Greek name literally means &#8220;ten towns&#8221;) whose region (except for Scythopolis) lay across the Jordan River.</p>
<A NAME="441"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=142><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="442"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=143><b>tn</b> &#8220;River&#8221; is not in the Greek text but is supplied for clarity. The region referred to here is sometimes known as Transjordan (i.e., &#8220;across the Jordan&#8221;).</p>
