<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;the book of the genealogy.&#8221; The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#946;&#943;&#946;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">biblo&quot;</font>), though it is without the article, is to be translated as definite due to Apollonius&#8217; corollary and the normal use of anarthrous nouns in titles.</p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;fathered.&#8221;</p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3><b>sn</b> <i>By the wife of Uriah</i>, i.e., Bathsheba (cf. 2 Sam 11:3).</p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4><b>tc</b> The reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#913;&#963;&#940;&#966;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Asaf</font>), a variant spelling on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#913;&#963;&#940;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Asa</font>), is found in the earliest and most widespread witnesses (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>1vid</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B C [D<sup>luc</sup>] <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> 700 <i>pc</i> it co). Although Asaph was a psalmist and Asa was a king, it is doubtful that the author mistook one for the other since other ancient documents have variant spellings on the king&#8217;s name (such as &#8220;Asab,&#8221; &#8220;Asanos,&#8221; and &#8220;Asaph&#8221;). Thus the spelling <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#913;&#963;&#940;&#966;</font> that is almost surely found in the original of Matt 1:7-8 has been translated as &#8220;Asa&#8221; in keeping with the more common spelling of the king&#8217;s name.</p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>tc</b> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#913;&#956;&#8061;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Amws</font>) is the reading found in the earliest and best witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B C [D<sup>luc</sup>] <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup> 33 <i>pc</i> it sa bo), and as such is most likely original, but this is a variant spelling of the name <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#913;&#956;&#8061;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Amwn</font>). The translation uses the more well-known spelling &#8220;Amon&#8221; found in the Hebrew MT and the majority of LXX <span class="smallcaps">mss</span>. See also the textual discussion of &#8220;Asa&#8221;<i> </i>versus &#8220;Asaph&#8221; (vv. 7-8); the situation is similar.</p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=6><b>sn</b> Before the mention of <i>Jeconiah</i>, several medieval <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> add Jehoiakim, in conformity with the genealogy in 1 Chr 3:15-16. But this alters the count of fourteen generations (v. 17). It is evident that the author is selective in his genealogy for a theological purpose.</p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=7><b>tn</b> Because of the difference between Greek style, which usually begins a sentence with a conjunction, and English style, which generally does not, the conjunction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has not been translated here.</p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=8><b>sn</b> The Greek text and the KJV read <i>Salathiel.</i> Most modern English translations use the OT form of the name (cf. Ezra 3:2).</p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=9><b>tc</b> There are three significant variant readings at this point in the text. Some <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> and versional witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> it) read, &#8220;Joseph, to whom the virgin Mary, being betrothed, bore Jesus, who is called Christ.&#8221; This reading makes even more explicit than the feminine pronoun (see <b>sn</b> below) the virginal conception of Jesus and as such seems to be a motivated reading. The Sinaitic Syriac ms alone indicates that Joseph was the father of Jesus (&#8220;Joseph, to whom was betrothed Mary the virgin, fathered Jesus who is called the Christ&#8221;). Although much discussed, this reading has not been found in any Greek witnesses. B. M. Metzger suggests that it was produced by a careless scribe who simply reproduced the set formula of the preceding lines in the genealogy (<i>TCGNT</i> 6). In all likelihood, the two competing variants were thus produced by intentional and unintentional scribal alterations respectively. The reading adopted in the translation has overwhelming support from a variety of witnesses (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">1</font></sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B C L W [<font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup>] 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> co), and therefore should be regarded as authentic. For a detailed discussion of this textual problem, see <i>TCGNT</i> 2-6.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The pronoun <i>whom </i>is feminine gender in the Greek text, referring to Mary.</p>
<a name="110"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=10><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Messiah&#8221;; both &#8220;Christ&#8221; (Greek) and &#8220;Messiah&#8221; (Hebrew and Aramaic) mean &#8220;one who has been anointed.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#967;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">cristos</font>) was originally an adjective (&#8220;anointed&#8221;), developing in LXX into a substantive (&#8220;an anointed one&#8221;), then developing still further into a technical generic term (&#8220;the anointed one&#8221;). In the intertestamental period it developed further into a technical term referring to the hoped-for anointed one, that is, a specific individual. In the NT the development starts there (technical-specific), is so used in the gospels, and then develops in Paul to mean virtually Jesus&#8217; last name.</p>
<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Messiah&#8221;; both &#8220;Christ&#8221; (Greek) and &#8220;Messiah&#8221; (Hebrew and Aramaic) mean &#8220;one who has been anointed.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> See the note on <i>Christ </i>in 1:16.</p>
<a name="112"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=12><b>tn</b> The connotation of the Greek is &#8220;before they came together in marital and domestic union&#8221; (so BDAG 970 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#967;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</font> 3). </p>

<a name="114"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=14><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;send her away.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In the Jewish context, &#8220;full betrothal was so binding that its breaking required a certificate of divorce, and the death of one party made the other a widow or widower (<i>m. Ketub.</i> 1:2; <i>m. Sota</i> 1:5; <i>m. Git.</i> passim&#8230;)&#8221; (R. H. Gundry, <i>Matthew: A Commentary on his Literary and Theological Art</i>, 21).</p>
<a name="115"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=15><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;behold, an angel.&#8221; The Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7984;&#948;&#959;&#973;</font> (<font face="Greektl">idou</font>) has not been translated because it has no exact English equivalent here, but adds interest and emphasis (BDAG 468 s.v. 1).</p>
<a name="116"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=16><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the angel of the Lord.&#8221; Linguistically, &#8220;angel of the Lord&#8221; is the same in both testaments (and thus, he is either &#8220;an angel of the Lord&#8221; or &#8220;the angel of the Lord&#8221; in both testaments). For arguments and implications, see <i>ExSyn</i> 252; M. J. Davidson, &#8220;Angels,&#8221; <i>DJG</i>, 9; W. G. MacDonald argues for &#8220;an angel&#8221; in both testaments: &#8220;Christology and &#8216;The Angel of the Lord&#8217;,&#8221; <i>Current Issues in Biblical and Patristic Interpretation</i>, 324-35.</p>
<a name="117"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=17><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;you will call his name.&#8221;</p>
<a name="118"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=18><b>sn</b> The Greek form of the name <font face="Greektl">Ihsous</font>, which was translated into Latin as <i>Jesus</i>, is the same as the Hebrew <font face="Scholar">Yeshua</font> (Joshua), which means &#8220;Yahweh saves&#8221; (Yahweh is typically rendered as &#8220;Lord&#8221; in the OT). It was a fairly common name among Jews in 1st century Palestine, as references to a number of people by this name in the LXX and Josephus indicate.</p>
<a name="119"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=19><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;they will call his name.&#8221;</p>
<a name="120"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=20><b>sn</b> A quotation from Isa 7:14.</p>
<a name="121"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=21><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;is translated.&#8221;</p>
<a name="122"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=22><b>sn</b> An allusion to Isa 8:8, 10 (LXX).</p>
<a name="123"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=23><b>tn</b> See the note on the word &#8220;Lord&#8221; in 1:20. Here the translation &#8220;the angel of the Lord&#8221; is used because the Greek article (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jo</font>) which precedes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">angelos</font>) is taken as an anaphoric article (<i>ExSyn</i> 217-19) referring back to the angel mentioned in v. 20.</p>
<a name="124"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=24><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;did not have sexual relations&#8221;; <i>Grk </i>&#8220;was not knowing her.&#8221; The verb &#8220;know&#8221; (in both Hebrew and Greek) is a frequent biblical euphemism for sexual relations. However, a translation like &#8220;did not have sexual relations with her&#8221; is too graphic in light of the popularity and wide use of Matthew&#8217;s infancy narrative. Thus the somewhat more subdued but still clear &#8220;did not have marital relations&#8221; was selected.</p>
<a name="125"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=25><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;and he called his name Jesus.&#8221; The coordinate clause has been translated as a relative clause in English for stylistic reasons.</p>
