<a name="149"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=49><b>tn</b> There is a wordplay in Hebrew here with the word used for &#8220;destruction&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shod</font>) and the term used for God (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shadday</font>). The exact meaning of &#8220;Shaddai&#8221; in the OT is somewhat uncertain, although the ancient versions and many modern English versions tend to translate it as &#8220;Almighty&#8221; (e.g., Greek <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#961;</font> [<font face="Greektl">pantokratwr</font>], Latin <font face="Scholar">omnipotens</font>). Here it might be rendered &#8220;Destroyer,&#8221; with the thought being that &#8220;destruction will come from the Divine Destroyer,&#8221; which should not be misunderstood as a reference to the destroying angel. The name &#8220;Shaddai&#8221; (outside Genesis and without the element &#8220;El&#8221; [&#8220;God&#8221;]) is normally used when God is viewed as the sovereign king who blesses/protects or curses/brings judgment. The name appears in the introduction to two of Balaam&#8217;s oracles (Num 24:4, 16) of blessing upon Israel. Naomi employs the name when accusing the Lord of treating her bitterly by taking the lives of her husband and sons (Ruth 1:20-21). In Ps 68:14, Isa 13:6, and the present passage, Shaddai judges his enemies through warfare, while Ps 91:1 depicts him as the protector of his people. In Ezek 1:24 and 10:5 the sound of the cherubs&#8217; wings is compared to Shaddai&#8217;s powerful voice. The reference may be to the mighty divine warrior&#8217;s battle cry which accompanies his angry judgment.</p>
