<a name="113"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=13><b>tn</b> The four Hebrew terms used in this verse are of uncertain meaning. English translations show a great deal of variation in dealing with these: (1) For <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1464;&#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gazam</font>) KJV has &#8220;palmerworm,&#8221; NEB &#8220;locust,&#8221; NAB &#8220;cutter&#8221;, NASB &#8220;gnawing locust,&#8221; NIV &#8220;locust swarm,&#8221; NKJV &#8220;chewing locust,&#8221; NRSV, NLT &#8220;cutting locust(s),&#8221; NIrV &#8220;giant locusts&#8221;; (2) for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arbeh</font>) KJV has &#8220;locust,&#8221; NEB &#8220;swarm,&#8221; NAB &#8220;locust swarm,&#8221; NASB, NKJV, NRSV, NLT &#8220;swarming locust(s),&#8221; NIV &#8220;great locusts,&#8221; NIrV &#8220;common locusts&#8221;; (3) for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yeleq</font>) KJV has &#8220;cankerworm,&#8221; NEB &#8220;hopper,&#8221; NAB &#8220;grasshopper,&#8221; NASB &#8220;creeping locust,&#8221; NIV, NIrV &#8220;young locusts,&#8221; NKJV &#8220;crawling locust,&#8221; NRSV, NLT &#8220;hopping locust(s)&#8221;; (4) for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1505;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khasil</font>) KJV has &#8220;caterpillar,&#8221; NEB &#8220;grub,&#8221; NAB &#8220;devourer,&#8221; NASB, NLT &#8220;stripping locust(s),&#8221; NIV, NIrV &#8220;other locusts,&#8221; NKJV &#8220;consuming locust,&#8221; NRSV &#8220;destroying locust.&#8221; It is debated whether the Hebrew terms describe different species of locusts or similar insects or different developmental stages of the same species, or are virtual synonyms. While the last seems more likely, given the uncertainty over their exact meaning, the present translation has transliterated the Hebrew terms in combination with the word &#8220;locust.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Four different words for &#8220;locust&#8221; are used in this verse. Whether these words represent different life-stages of the locusts, or whether virtual synonyms are being used to underscore the severity of damage caused by the relentless waves of locust invasion, is not entirely certain. The latter seems more likely. Many interpreters have understood the locust plagues described here to be symbolic of invading armies that will devastate the land, but the symbolism could also work the other way, with real plagues of locusts described in the following verses as an invading army.</p>
