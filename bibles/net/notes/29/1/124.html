The language is clearly hyperbolic. Neither locusts nor human invaders literally have teeth of this size. The prophet is using exaggerated and picturesque language to portray in vivid terms the enormity of the calamity. English versions vary greatly on the specifics: KJV &#8220;cheek teeth&#8221;; ASV &#8220;jaw-teeth&#8221;; NAB &#8220;molars&#8221;; NASB, NIV, NRSV &#8220;fangs.&#8221;</p>
