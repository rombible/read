<a name="144"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=44><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;put on.&#8221; There is no object present in the Hebrew text, but many translations assume &#8220;sackcloth&#8221; to be the understood object of the verb &#8220;put on.&#8221; Its absence in the Hebrew text of v. 13 is probably due to metrical considerations. The meter here is 3 + 3, and that has probably influenced the prophet&#8217;s choice of words.</p>
