The MT reads &#8220;the seed shrivels in their shovels/clods.&#8221; One Qumran manuscript (4QXXII<sup>c</sup>) reads &#8220;the heifers decay in [their] s[talls].&#8221; LXX reads &#8220;the heifers leap in their stalls.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> These two lines of v. 17 comprise only four words in the Hebrew; three of the four are found only here in the OT. The translation and meaning are rather uncertain. A number of English versions render the word translated &#8220;shovels&#8221; as &#8220;clods,&#8221; referring to lumps of soil (e.g., KJV, NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV).</p>
