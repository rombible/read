<A NAME="21"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=66><b>tn</b> The word translated &#8220;trumpet&#8221; here (so most English versions) is the Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1465;&#1508;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shofar</font>). The shophar was a wind instrument made from a cow or ram&#8217;s horn and used as a military instrument for calling people to attention in the face of danger or as a religious instrument for calling people to occasions of communal celebration.</p>

<A NAME="23"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=68><b>sn</b> The interpretation of 2:1-11 is very difficult. Four views may be mentioned here. (1) Some commentators understand this section to be describing a human invasion of Judah on the part of an ancient army. The exact identity of this army (e.g., Assyrian or Babylonian) varies among interpreters depending upon issues of dating for the book of Joel. (2) Some commentators take the section to describe an eschatological scene in which the army according to some is human, or according to others is nonhuman (i.e., angelic). (3) Some interpreters argue for taking the section to refer to the potential advent in the fall season of a severe east wind (i.e., Sirocco) that would further exacerbate the conditions of the land described in chapter one. (4) Finally, some interpreters understand the section to continue the discussion of locust invasion and drought described in chapter one, partly on the basis that there is no clear exegetical evidence in 2:1-11 to suggest a shift of referent from that of chapter one.</p>
<A NAME="24"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=69><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;It will be&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew, but is supplied in the translation for the sake of smoothness and style.</p>
<A NAME="25"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=70><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;darkness and gloom.&#8221; These two terms probably form a hendiadys here. This picture recalls the imagery of the supernatural darkness in Egypt during the judgments of the exodus (Exod 10:22). These terms are also frequently used as figures (metonymy of association) for calamity and divine judgment (Isa 8:22; 59:9; Jer 23:12; Zeph 1:15). Darkness is often a figure (metonymy of association) for death, dread, distress and judgment (BDB 365 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> 3).</p>
<A NAME="26"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=71><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;a day of cloud and darkness.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="27"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=72><b>tc</b> The present translation here follows the proposed reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1495;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿkhor</font>, &#8220;blackness&#8221;) rather than the MT <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shakhar</font>, &#8220;morning&#8221;). The change affects only the vocalization; the Hebrew consonants remain unchanged. Here the context calls for a word describing darkness. The idea of morning or dawn speaks instead of approaching light, which does not seem to fit here. The other words in the verse (e.g., &#8220;darkness,&#8221; &#8220;gloominess,&#8221; &#8220;cloud,&#8221; &#8220;heavy overcast&#8221;) all emphasize the negative aspects of the matter at hand and lead the reader to expect a word like &#8220;blackness&#8221; rather than &#8220;dawn.&#8221; However, NIrV paraphrases the MT nicely: &#8220;A huge army of locusts is coming. They will spread across the mountains like the sun when it rises.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="28"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=73><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;A huge and powerful people&#8221;; KJV, ASV &#8220;a great people and a strong.&#8221; Many interpreters understand Joel 2 to describe an invasion of human armies, either in past history (e.g., the Babylonian invasion of Palestine in the sixth century <sc>b.c.) or in an eschatological setting. More probably, however, the language of this chapter referring to &#8220;people&#8221; and &#8220;armies&#8221; is a hypocatastic description of the locusts of chapter one. Cf. TEV &#8220;The great army of locusts advances like darkness.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="29"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=74><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;it will not be repeated for years of generation and generation.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=76><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;like the garden of Eden, the land is before them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=77><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and surely a survivor there is not for it.&#8221; The antecedent of the pronoun &#8220;it&#8221; is apparently <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">am</font>, &#8220;people&#8221;) of v. 2, which seems to be a figurative way of referring to the locusts. K&amp;D 26:191-92 thought that the antecedent of this pronoun was &#8220;land,&#8221; but the masculine gender of the pronoun does not support this.</p>
<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=78><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Like the appearance of horses [is] its appearance.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The fact that a locust&#8217;s head resembles a miniature replica of a horse&#8217;s head has often been noticed. For example, the German word for locust (<font face="Scholar">Heupferd</font>, &#8220;hay horse&#8221;) and the Italian word as well (<font face="Scholar">cavaletta</font>, &#8220;little horse&#8221;) are based on this similarity in appearance.</p>
<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=79><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;like the sound of.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The repetition of the word of comparison (&#8220;like&#8221;) in vv. 4-7 should not go unnoticed. The author is comparing the locust invasion to familiar aspects of human invasion. If the preposition has its normal force here, it is <i>similarity</i> and not <i>identity</i> that is intended. In other words, locusts are being likened to human armies, but human armies are not actually present. On the other hand, this Hebrew preposition is also on occasion used to indicate exactitude, a function described by grammarians as <font face="Scholar">kaph veritatis</font>. </p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=80><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;jostling&#8221; or &#8220;leaping.&#8221; There is question whether this pictures chariots rumbling over the mountains (e.g., 2 Sam 6:14,16; 1 Chr 15:29; Nah 3:2) or the locusts flying &#8211; or &#8220;leaping&#8221; &#8211; over the mountains (e.g., Job 21:11); see BDB 955 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font>.</p>

<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=82><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;the noise of&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew, but is implied by the parallelism, so it has been supplied in the translation for the sake of clarity.</p>
<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=83><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;people.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=87><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all faces gather beauty&#8221;; or &#8220;all faces gather a glow.&#8221; The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pa</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">rur</font>) is found in the OT only here and in Nah 2:11. Its meaning is very uncertain. Some scholars associate it with a root that signifies &#8220;glowing&#8221;; hence &#8220;all faces gather a glow of dread.&#8221; Others associate the word with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">parur</font>, &#8220;pot&#8221;); hence &#8220;all faces gather blackness.&#8221; Still others take the root to signify &#8220;beauty&#8221;; hence &#8220;all faces gather in their beauty&#8221; in the sense of growing pale due to fear. This is the view assumed here.</p>
<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=88><b>sn</b> Since the invaders are compared to warriors, this suggests that they are not actually human, but instead an army of locusts.</p>

The verb found in MT (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1496;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">avat</font>) means &#8220;take or give a pledge&#8221; (cf. Deut 15:6, 8; 24:10) and does not fit the context. Some scholars have proposed various emendations: (1) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1493;&#1468;&#1456;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avvÿtun</font>, &#8220;they make crooked&#8221;); (2) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yattun</font>, &#8220;they turn aside&#8221;); (3) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1493;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avvun</font>, &#8220;they err&#8221;); and (4) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font> (adopted in the present translation) from the root I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avat</font>, &#8220;to twist, pervert&#8221;) or II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avat</font>, &#8220;to change, abandon&#8221;). KBL adopt the latter option, but the only biblical evidence for this is the problematic reference in Joel 2:7. Another option is to view it as a variant of the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1489;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khavat</font>, &#8220;turn aside from&#8221;), a meaning attested for the Arabic cognate. The difference in spelling would be due to the interchange of the guttural letters <font face="Scholar">khet</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;</font>) and <font face="Scholar">ayin </font>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;</font>).

<A NAME="229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=94><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;they fall upon.&#8221; This line has been interpreted in two different ways: (1) although they fall upon the sword, they shall not be wounded (KJV), or (2) when they &#8220;burst through&#8221; the city&#8217;s defenses, they will not break ranks (RSV, NASB, NIV, NIrV). </p>

While the consonantal Hebrew text permits either, the context suggests that the concern here is more one of not wanting to appear abandoned by God to ongoing economic depression rather than one of concern over potential political subjection of Israel (cf. v. 19). The possibility that the form in the MT is an infinitive construct of the denominative verb II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mashal</font>, &#8220;to utter a proverb&#8221;) does not seem likely because of the following preposition (Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font> [<font face="Scholar">bÿ</font>], rather than <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>]).</p>

<A NAME="255"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=120><b>tn</b> The time-frame entertained by the verbs of v.18 constitutes a <i>crux interpretum</i> in this chapter. The Hebrew verb forms used here are preterites with <i>vav</i> consecutive and are most naturally understood as describing a <i>past</i> situation. However, some modern English versions render these verbs as futures (e.g., NIV, NASV), apparently concluding that the context requires a future reference. According to Joüon 2:363 §112.h, n.1 Ibn Ezra explained the verbs of Joel 2:18 as an extension of the so-called prophetic perfect; as such, a future fulfillment was described with a past tense as a rhetorical device lending certainty to the fulfillment. But this lacks adequate precedent and is very unlikely from a syntactical standpoint. It seems better to take the verbs in the normal past sense of the preterite. This would require a vantage point for the prophet at some time <i>after</i> the people had responded favorably to the Lord&#8217;s call for repentance and <i>after</i> the Lord had shown compassion and forgiveness toward his people, but <i>before </i>the full realization of God&#8217;s promises to restore productivity to the land. In other words, it appears from the verbs of vv. 18-19 that at the time of Joel&#8217;s writing this book the events of successive waves of locust invasion and conditions of drought had almost run their course and the people had now begun to turn to the Lord. </p>

The Hebrew word for &#8220;foul smell&#8221; is found only here in the Old Testament. The Hebrew word for &#8220;stench&#8221; appears only here and in Isa 34:3 and Amos 4:10. In the latter references it refers to the stench of dead corpses on a field of battle.</p>

<A NAME="270"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=135><b>sn</b> For half the year Palestine is generally dry. The rainy season begins with the early rains usually in late October to early December, followed by the latter rains in March and April. Without these rains productive farming would not be possible, as Joel&#8217;s original readers knew only too well.</p>
<A NAME="271"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=136><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;I will restore to you the years.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The plural <i>years</i> suggests that the plague to which Joel refers was not limited to a single season. Apparently the locusts were a major problem over several successive years. One season of drought and locust invasion would have been bad enough. Several such years would have been devastating.</p>
<A NAME="272"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=137><b>sn</b> The same four terms for locust are used here as in 1:4, but in a different order. This fact creates some difficulty for the notion that the four words refer to four distinct stages of locust development.</p>
<A NAME="273"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=138><b>tn</b> The term &#8220;your crops&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew, but has been supplied in the translation for the sake of clarity and smoothness.</p>
<A NAME="274"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=139><b>sn</b> Here Joel employs military language to describe the locusts. In the prophet&#8217;s thinking this invasion was far from being a freak accident. Rather, the Lord is pictured here as a divine warrior who leads his army into the land as a punishment for past sin and as a means of bringing about spiritual renewal on the part of the people.</p>

<A NAME="277"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=142><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Now it will be after this.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="278"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=143><b>sn</b> This passage plays a key role in the apostolic explanation of the coming of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost recorded in Acts 2:17-21. Peter introduces his quotation of this passage with &#8220;this is that spoken by the prophet Joel&#8221; (Acts 2:16; cf. the similar <font face="Scholar">pesher</font> formula used at Qumran). The New Testament experience at Pentecost is thus seen in some sense as a fulfillment of this Old Testament passage, even though that experience did not exhaustively fulfill Joel&#8217;s words. Some portions of Joel&#8217;s prophecy have no precise counterpart in that experience. For example, there is nothing in the experience recorded in Acts 2 that exactly corresponds to the earthly and heavenly signs described in Joel 3:3-4. But inasmuch as the messianic age had already begun and the &#8220;last days&#8221; had already commenced with the coming of the Messiah (cf. Heb 1:1-2), Peter was able to point to Joel 3:1-5 as a text that was relevant to the advent of Jesus and the bestowal of the Spirit. The equative language that Peter employs (&#8220;this is that&#8221;) stresses an incipient fulfillment of the Joel passage without precluding or minimizing a yet future and more exhaustive fulfillment in events associated with the return of Christ.</p>
