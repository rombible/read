<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1><b>sn</b> The dating of the book of Joel is a matter of dispute. Some scholars date the book as early as the ninth century <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span>, during the reign of the boy-king Joash. This view is largely based on the following factors: an argument from silence (e.g., the book of Joel does not mention a king, perhaps because other officials <i>de facto</i> carried out his responsibilities, and there is no direct mention in the book of such later Israelite enemies as the Assyrians, Babylonians, and Persians); inconclusive literary assumptions (e.g., the eighth-century prophet Amos in Amos 9:13 alludes to Joel 3:18); the canonical position of the book (i.e., it is the second book of the Minor Prophets); and literary style (i.e., the book is thought to differ in style from the postexilic prophetic writings). While such an early date for the book is not impossible, none of the arguments used to support it is compelling. Later dates for the book that have been defended by various scholars are, for example, the late seventh century or early sixth century or sometime in the postexilic period (anytime from late sixth century to late fourth century). Most modern scholars seem to date the book of Joel sometime between 400 and 350 <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span> For a helpful discussion of date see J. A. Thompson, &#8220;The Date of the Book of Joel,&#8221; <i>A Light unto My Path</i>, 453-64. Related to the question of date is a major exegetical issue: Is the army of chapter two to be understood figuratively as describing the locust invasion of chapter one, or is the topic of chapter two an invasion of <i>human</i> armies, either the Babylonians or an eschatological foe? If the enemy could be conclusively identified as the Babylonians, for example, this would support a sixth-century date for the book.</p>

<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>sn</b> The circumstances that precipitated the book of Joel surrounded a locust invasion in Palestine that was of unprecedented proportions. The locusts had devastated the country&#8217;s agrarian economy, with the unwelcome consequences extending to every important aspect of commercial, religious, and national life. To further complicate matters, a severe drought had exhausted water supplies, causing life-threatening shortages for animal and human life (cf. v. 20). Locust invasions occasionally present significant problems in Palestine in modern times. The year 1865 was commonly known among Arabic-speaking peoples of the Near East as <font face="Scholar">sent el jarad</font>, &#8220;year of the locust.&#8221; The years 1892, 1899, and 1904 witnessed significant locust invasions in Palestine. But in modern times there has been nothing equal in magnitude to the great locust invasion that began in Palestine in February of 1915. This modern parallel provides valuable insight into the locust plague the prophet Joel points to as a foreshadowing of the day of the Lord. For an eyewitness account of the 1915 locust invasion of Palestine see J. D. Whiting, &#8220;Jerusalem&#8217;s Locust Plague,&#8221; <i>National Geographic </i>28 (December 1915): 511-50.</p>

<a name="113"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=13><b>tn</b> The four Hebrew terms used in this verse are of uncertain meaning. English translations show a great deal of variation in dealing with these: (1) For <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1464;&#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gazam</font>) KJV has &#8220;palmerworm,&#8221; NEB &#8220;locust,&#8221; NAB &#8220;cutter&#8221;, NASB &#8220;gnawing locust,&#8221; NIV &#8220;locust swarm,&#8221; NKJV &#8220;chewing locust,&#8221; NRSV, NLT &#8220;cutting locust(s),&#8221; NIrV &#8220;giant locusts&#8221;; (2) for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arbeh</font>) KJV has &#8220;locust,&#8221; NEB &#8220;swarm,&#8221; NAB &#8220;locust swarm,&#8221; NASB, NKJV, NRSV, NLT &#8220;swarming locust(s),&#8221; NIV &#8220;great locusts,&#8221; NIrV &#8220;common locusts&#8221;; (3) for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yeleq</font>) KJV has &#8220;cankerworm,&#8221; NEB &#8220;hopper,&#8221; NAB &#8220;grasshopper,&#8221; NASB &#8220;creeping locust,&#8221; NIV, NIrV &#8220;young locusts,&#8221; NKJV &#8220;crawling locust,&#8221; NRSV, NLT &#8220;hopping locust(s)&#8221;; (4) for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1505;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khasil</font>) KJV has &#8220;caterpillar,&#8221; NEB &#8220;grub,&#8221; NAB &#8220;devourer,&#8221; NASB, NLT &#8220;stripping locust(s),&#8221; NIV, NIrV &#8220;other locusts,&#8221; NKJV &#8220;consuming locust,&#8221; NRSV &#8220;destroying locust.&#8221; It is debated whether the Hebrew terms describe different species of locusts or similar insects or different developmental stages of the same species, or are virtual synonyms. While the last seems more likely, given the uncertainty over their exact meaning, the present translation has transliterated the Hebrew terms in combination with the word &#8220;locust.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Four different words for &#8220;locust&#8221; are used in this verse. Whether these words represent different life-stages of the locusts, or whether virtual synonyms are being used to underscore the severity of damage caused by the relentless waves of locust invasion, is not entirely certain. The latter seems more likely. Many interpreters have understood the locust plagues described here to be symbolic of invading armies that will devastate the land, but the symbolism could also work the other way, with real plagues of locusts described in the following verses as an invading army.</p>
<a name="114"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=14><b>sn</b> The word <i>drunkards</i> has a double edge here. Those accustomed to drinking too much must now lament the unavailability of wine. It also may hint that the people in general have become religiously inebriated and are unresponsive to the Lord. They are, as it were, drunkards from a spiritual standpoint.</p>
<a name="115"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=15><b>sn</b> Joel addresses the first of three groups particularly affected by the locust plague. In v. 5 he describes the effects on the drunkards, who no longer have a ready supply of intoxicating wine; in vv. 11-12 he describes the effects on the farmers, who have watched their labors come to naught because of the insect infestation; and in vv. 13-14 he describes the effects on the priests, who are no longer able to offer grain sacrifices and libations in the temple.</p>
<a name="116"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=16><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;over the sweet wine, because it.&#8221; Cf. KJV, NIV, TEV, NLT &#8220;new wine.&#8221;</p>

<a name="119"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=19><b>sn</b> As becomes increasingly clear in what follows, this <i>nation</i> is to be understood figuratively. It refers to the locust invasion as viewed from the standpoint of its methodical, destructive advance across the land (BDB 156 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497;</font> 2). This term is used figuratively to refer to animals one other time (Zeph 2:14).</p>

<a name="121"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=21><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;my.&#8221;</p>
<a name="122"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=22><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[It] is huge and there is not number.&#8221;</p>

<a name="124"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=24><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;its incisors are those of a lioness.&#8221; The sharp, cutting teeth are metonymical for the action of tearing apart and eating prey. The language is clearly hyperbolic. Neither locusts nor human invaders literally have teeth of this size. The prophet is using exaggerated and picturesque language to portray in vivid terms the enormity of the calamity. English versions vary greatly on the specifics: KJV &#8220;cheek teeth&#8221;; ASV &#8220;jaw-teeth&#8221;; NAB &#8220;molars&#8221;; NASB, NIV, NRSV &#8220;fangs.&#8221;</p>
<a name="125"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=25><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;it.&#8221; Throughout vv. 6-7 the Hebrew uses singular forms to describe the locust swarm, but the translation uses plural forms because several details of the text make more sense in English as if they are describing the appearance and effects of individual locusts.</p>
<a name="126"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=26><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;my.&#8221;</p>

It is apparently this whitened condition of limbs that Joel is referring to here.</p>
<a name="132"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=32><b>sn</b> The verb is feminine singular, raising a question concerning its intended antecedent. A plural verb would be expected here, the idea being that all the inhabitants of the land should grieve. Perhaps Joel is thinking specifically of the city of Jerusalem, albeit in a representative sense. The choice of the feminine singular verb form has probably been influenced to some extent by the allusion to the young widow in the simile of v. 8.</p>

The meter here is 3 + 3, and that has probably influenced the prophet&#8217;s choice of words.</p>

<a name="149"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=49><b>tn</b> There is a wordplay in Hebrew here with the word used for &#8220;destruction&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shod</font>) and the term used for God (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shadday</font>). The exact meaning of &#8220;Shaddai&#8221; in the OT is somewhat uncertain, although the ancient versions and many modern English versions tend to translate it as &#8220;Almighty&#8221; (e.g., Greek <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#961;</font> [<font face="Greektl">pantokratwr</font>], Latin <font face="Scholar">omnipotens</font>). Here it might be rendered &#8220;Destroyer,&#8221; with the thought being that &#8220;destruction will come from the Divine Destroyer,&#8221; which should not be misunderstood as a reference to the destroying angel. The name &#8220;Shaddai&#8221; (outside Genesis and without the element &#8220;El&#8221; [&#8220;God&#8221;]) is normally used when God is viewed as the sovereign king who blesses/protects or curses/brings judgment. The name appears in the introduction to two of Balaam&#8217;s oracles (Num 24:4, 16) of blessing upon Israel. Naomi employs the name when accusing the Lord of treating her bitterly by taking the lives of her husband and sons (Ruth 1:20-21). In Ps 68:14, Isa 13:6, and the present passage, Shaddai judges his enemies through warfare, while Ps 91:1 depicts him as the protector of his people. In Ezek 1:24 and 10:5 the sound of the cherubs&#8217; wings is compared to Shaddai&#8217;s powerful voice. The reference may be to the mighty divine warrior&#8217;s battle cry which accompanies his angry judgment.</p>
