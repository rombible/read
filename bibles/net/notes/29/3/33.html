<A NAME="33"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=155><b>tc</b> The <i>Kethib</i> reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ashiv</font>, &#8220;return the captivity [captives]), while the <i>Qere</i> is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ashuv</font>, &#8220;restore the fortunes&#8221;). Many modern English versions follow the <i>Qere</i> reading. Either reading seems to fit the context. Joel refers to an exile of the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem in 3:2-6 and their return from exile in 3:7. On the other hand, 2:25-26 describes the reversal of judgment and restoration of the covenant blessings. However, the former seems to be the concern of the immediate context.</p>
