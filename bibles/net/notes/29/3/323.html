<A NAME="323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=175><b>sn</b> The &#8220;weak&#8221; individual mentioned here is apparently the farmer who has little or no military prowess or prior fighting experience. Under ordinary circumstances such a person would be ill-prepared for assuming the role of a soldier. However, in the scene that Joel is describing here even the most unlikely candidate will become a participant to be reckoned with in this final conflict.</p>
