<A NAME="345"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=197><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;violence of the sons of Judah.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;of the sons of Judah&#8221; is an objective genitive (cf. KJV &#8220;the violence against the children of Judah&#8221;; NAB, NIV, NRSV &#8220;violence done to the people of Judah&#8221;). It refers to injustices committed against the Judeans, not violence that the Judeans themselves had committed against others.</p>
