<A NAME="329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=181><b>sn</b> The immediacy of judgment upon wickedness is likened to the urgency required for a harvest that has reached its pinnacle of development. When the harvest is completely ripe, there can be no delay by the reapers in gathering the harvest. In a similar way, Joel envisions a time when human wickedness will reach such a heightened degree that there can be no further stay of divine judgment (cf. the &#8220;fullness of time&#8221; language in Gal 4:4).</p>
