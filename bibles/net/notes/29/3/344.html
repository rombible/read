<A NAME="344"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=196><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;valley of Shittim.&#8221; The exact location of <i>the Valley of Acacia Trees</i> is uncertain. The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1496;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shittim</font>) refers to a place where the acacia trees grow, which would be a very arid and dry place. The acacia tree can survive in such locations, whereas most other trees require more advantageous conditions. Joel&#8217;s point is that the stream that has been mentioned will proceed to the most dry and barren of locations in the vicinity of Jerusalem.</p>
