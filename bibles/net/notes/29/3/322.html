<A NAME="322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=174><b>sn</b> This conversion of farming instruments to instruments of war is the reverse of Isa 2:4 (cf. Mic 4:3), where military weapons are transformed into tools for farming. Isaiah describes a time of kingdom blessing and prosperity, whereas Joel describes a time of eschatological conflict and judgment.</p>
