<A NAME="263"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=128><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text does not have &#8220;the <sc>Lord.&#8221; Two interpretations are possible. This clause may refer to the enemy described in the immediately preceding verses, in which case it would have a negative sense: &#8220;he has acted in a high-handed manner.&#8221; Or it may refer to the <sc>Lord, in which case it would have a positive sense: &#8220;the <sc>Lord has acted in a marvelous manner.&#8221; This is clearly the sense of the same expression in v. 21, where in fact &#8220;the <sc>Lord&#8221; appears as the subject of the verb. It seems best to understand the clause the same way in both verses.</p>
