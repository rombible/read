<A NAME="27"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=72><b>tc</b> The present translation here follows the proposed reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1495;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿkhor</font>, &#8220;blackness&#8221;) rather than the MT <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shakhar</font>, &#8220;morning&#8221;). The change affects only the vocalization; the Hebrew consonants remain unchanged. Here the context calls for a word describing darkness. The idea of morning or dawn speaks instead of approaching light, which does not seem to fit here. The other words in the verse (e.g., &#8220;darkness,&#8221; &#8220;gloominess,&#8221; &#8220;cloud,&#8221; &#8220;heavy overcast&#8221;) all emphasize the negative aspects of the matter at hand and lead the reader to expect a word like &#8220;blackness&#8221; rather than &#8220;dawn.&#8221; However, NIrV paraphrases the MT nicely: &#8220;A huge army of locusts is coming. They will spread across the mountains like the sun when it rises.&#8221;</p>
