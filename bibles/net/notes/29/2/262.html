<A NAME="262"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=127><b>sn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and his foul smell will ascend.&#8221; The <i>foul smell</i> probably refers to the unpleasant odor of decayed masses of dead locusts. The Hebrew word for &#8220;foul smell&#8221; is found only here in the Old Testament. The Hebrew word for &#8220;stench&#8221; appears only here and in Isa 34:3 and Amos 4:10. In the latter references it refers to the stench of dead corpses on a field of battle.</p>
