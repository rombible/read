<A NAME="255"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=120><b>tn</b> The time-frame entertained by the verbs of v.18 constitutes a <i>crux interpretum</i> in this chapter. The Hebrew verb forms used here are preterites with <i>vav</i> consecutive and are most naturally understood as describing a <i>past</i> situation. However, some modern English versions render these verbs as futures (e.g., NIV, NASV), apparently concluding that the context requires a future reference. According to Joüon 2:363 §112.h, n.1 Ibn Ezra explained the verbs of Joel 2:18 as an extension of the so-called prophetic perfect; as such, a future fulfillment was described with a past tense as a rhetorical device lending certainty to the fulfillment. But this lacks adequate precedent and is very unlikely from a syntactical standpoint. It seems better to take the verbs in the normal past sense of the preterite. This would require a vantage point for the prophet at some time <i>after</i> the people had responded favorably to the Lord&#8217;s call for repentance and <i>after</i> the Lord had shown compassion and forgiveness toward his people, but <i>before </i>the full realization of God&#8217;s promises to restore productivity to the land. In other words, it appears from the verbs of vv. 18-19 that at the time of Joel&#8217;s writing this book the events of successive waves of locust invasion and conditions of drought had almost run their course and the people had now begun to turn to the Lord. </p>
