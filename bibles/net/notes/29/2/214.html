The author is comparing the locust invasion to familiar aspects of human invasion. If the preposition has its normal force here, it is <i>similarity</i> and not <i>identity</i> that is intended. In other words, locusts are being likened to human armies, but human armies are not actually present. On the other hand, this Hebrew preposition is also on occasion used to indicate exactitude, a function described by grammarians as <font face="Scholar">kaph veritatis</font>. </p>
