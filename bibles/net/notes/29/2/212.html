<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=77><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and surely a survivor there is not for it.&#8221; The antecedent of the pronoun &#8220;it&#8221; is apparently <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">am</font>, &#8220;people&#8221;) of v. 2, which seems to be a figurative way of referring to the locusts. K&amp;D 26:191-92 thought that the antecedent of this pronoun was &#8220;land,&#8221; but the masculine gender of the pronoun does not support this.</p>
