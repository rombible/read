<A NAME="230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=95><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;missile&#8221; or &#8220;javelin.&#8221; This term appears to function as a synecdoche for the city&#8217;s defenses as a whole (cf. NASB, NIV, TEV). Some scholars instead understand the reference to be an aqueduct by which the locusts (or armies) entered the city.</p>
