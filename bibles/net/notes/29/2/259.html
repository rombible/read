<A NAME="259"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=124><b>sn</b> The allusion to <i>the one from the north</i> is best understood as having locusts in view. It is not correct to say that this reference to the enemy who came form the north excludes the possibility of a reference to locusts and must be understood as human armies. Although locust plagues usually approached Palestine from the east or southeast, the severe plague of 1915, for example, came from the northeast. </p>
