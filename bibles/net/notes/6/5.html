<A NAME="51"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=144><b>tc</b> Another textual tradition has, &#8220;while we crossed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="52"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=145><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;their heart[s] melted and there was no longer in them breathe because of the sons of Israel.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="53"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=146><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;return, circumcise the sons of Israel a second time.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shuv</font>, &#8220;return&#8221;) is used here in an adverbial sense to indicate the repetition of an action.</p>
<A NAME="54"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=147><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Gibeath Haaraloth.&#8221; This name means &#8220;Hill of the Foreskins.&#8221; Many modern translations simply give the Hebrew name, although an explanatory note giving the meaning of the name is often included.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The name given to the place, <i>Hill of the Foreskins </i>was an obvious reminder of this important event.</p>
<A NAME="55"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=148><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;All the people who went out from Egypt, the males, all the men of war, died in the desert in the way when they went out from Egypt.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="56"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=149><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;indeed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="57"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=150><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;people.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="58"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=151><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all the people.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="59"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=152><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all the nation, the men of war who went out from Egypt, who did not listen to the voice of the <sc>Lord, came to an end.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=153><b>tn</b> Some Hebrew <sc>mss, as well as the Syriac version, support this reading. Most ancient witnesses read &#8220;us.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=154><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;flowing with.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The word picture <i>a land rich in milk and honey</i> depicts the land as containing many grazing areas (which would produce <i>milk</i>) and flowering plants (which would support the bees that produced <i>honey</i>).</p>
<A NAME="512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=155><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;their sons he raised up in their place.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=156><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;nation.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=157><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;rolled away.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=158><b>sn</b> One might take <i>the disgrace of Egypt</i> as a reference to their uncircumcised condition (see Gen 34:14), but the generation that left Egypt was circumcised (see v. 5). It more likely refers to the disgrace they experienced in Egyptian slavery. When this new generation reached the promised land and renewed their covenantal commitment to the Lord by submitting to the rite of circumcision, the <sc>Lord&#8217;s deliverance of his people from slavery, which had begun with the plagues and the crossing of the Red Sea, reached its climax. See T. C. Butler, <i>Joshua</i> (WBC), 59.</p>
<A NAME="516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=159><b>sn</b> The name <i>Gilgal</i> sounds like the Hebrew verb &#8220;roll away&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">galal</font>).</p>
<A NAME="517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=160><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B2; Map6-E1; Map7-E1; Map8-E3; Map10-A2; Map11-A1.</p>
<A NAME="518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=161><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text adds, &#8220;on this same day.&#8221; This is somewhat redundant in English and has not been translated.</p>
<A NAME="519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=162><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the day after, when they ate.&#8221; The present translation assumes this means the day after the Passover, though it is possible it refers to the day after they began eating the land&#8217;s produce.</p>
<A NAME="520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=163><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the sons of Israel had no more manna.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=164><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="522"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=165><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B2; Map6-E1; Map7-E1; Map8-E3; Map10-A2; Map11-A1.</p>
<A NAME="523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=166><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he lifted up his eyes and looked. And look, a man was standing in front of him, and his sword was drawn in his hand.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>, &#8220;look&#8221;) invites the reader to view the scene through Joshua&#8217;s eyes. By calling the stranger &#8220;a man,&#8221; the author reflects Joshua&#8217;s perspective. The text shortly reveals his true identity (vv. 14-15).</p>
<A NAME="524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=167><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Are you for us or for our enemies?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=168><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;He said, &#8220;Neither.&#8221; An alternative reading is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>, &#8220;[He said] to him&#8221;; cf. NEB). This reading is supported by many Hebrew <sc>mss, as well as the LXX and Syriac versions. The traditional reading of the MT (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;, &#8220;no, neither&#8221;) is probably the product of aural confusion (the two variant readings sound the same in Hebrew). Although followed by a number of modern translations (cf. NIV, NRSV), this reading is problematic, for the commander of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s army would hardly have declared himself neutral.</p>
<A NAME="526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=169><b>sn</b> The Lord&#8217;s heavenly army, like an earthly army, has a <i>commander</i> who leads the troops. For the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1463;&#1512;&#1470;&#1510;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sar-tsÿva</font>&#8217;, &#8220;army commander&#8221;) in the human sphere, see among many other references Gen 21:22, 32; 26:26; Judg 4:2, 7; 1 Sam 12:9. </p>
<A NAME="527"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=170><b>sn</b> The commander&#8217;s appearance seems to be for Joshua&#8217;s encouragement. Joshua could now lead Israel into battle knowing that the <sc>Lord&#8217;s invisible army would ensure victory.</p>
<A NAME="528"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=171><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Joshua fell on his face to the ground and bowed down.&#8221;</p>
