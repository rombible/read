<A NAME="2478"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=923><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and they became for the sons of Joseph an inheritance.&#8221; One might think &#8220;bones&#8221; is the subject of the verb &#8220;they became,&#8221; but the verb is masculine, while &#8220;bones&#8221; is feminine. The translation follows the emendation suggested in the <i>BHS </i>note, which appeals to the Syriac and Vulgate for support. The emended reading understands &#8220;the part (of the field)&#8221; as the subject of the verb &#8220;became.&#8221; The emended verb is feminine singular; this agrees with &#8220;the part&#8221; (of the field), which is feminine in Hebrew.</p>
