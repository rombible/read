The verbal form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1514;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nÿtattiv</font>, &#8220;I have given it&#8221;) is probably a perfect of certitude, emphasizing the certainty of the action. Another option is to translate, &#8220;I have already assigned it.&#8221; In this case the verb would probably refer to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s decree to Abraham that he would give this land to his descendants.</p>
