<A NAME="64"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=175><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I have given into your hand Jericho.&#8221; The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">natatti</font>, &#8220;I have given&#8221;) is probably best understood as a perfect of certitude, indicating the certainty of the action. The Hebrew pronominal suffix &#8220;your&#8221; is singular, being addressed to Joshua as the leader and representative of the nation. To convey to the modern reader what is about to happen and who is doing it, the translation &#8220;I am about to defeat Jericho for you&#8221; has been used.</p>
