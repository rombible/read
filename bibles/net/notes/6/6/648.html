<A NAME="648"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=219><b>tn</b> Normally the Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shava</font>&#8217;) has a causative sense (&#8220;make [someone] take an oath&#8221;; see Josh 2:17, 20), but here (see also Josh 23:7) no object is stated or implied. If Joshua is calling divine judgment down upon the one who attempts to rebuild Jericho, then &#8220;make a solemn appeal [to God as judge]&#8221; or &#8220;pronounce a curse&#8221; would be an appropriate translation. However, the tone seems stronger. Joshua appears to be announcing the certain punishment of the violator. 1 Kgs 16:34, which records the fulfillment of Joshua&#8217;s prediction, supports this. Casting Joshua in a prophetic role, it refers to Joshua&#8217;s statement as the &#8220;word of the <sc>Lord&#8221; spoken through Joshua.</p>
