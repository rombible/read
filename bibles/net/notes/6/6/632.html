<A NAME="632"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=203><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the people shouted and they blew the rams&#8217; horns.&#8221; The initial statement (&#8220;and the people shouted&#8221;) seems premature, since the verse goes on to explain that the battle cry followed the blowing of the horns. The statement has probably been accidentally duplicated from what follows. It is omitted in the LXX.</p>
