<A NAME="67"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=178><b>tn</b> Heb &#8220;and it will be at the sounding of the horn, the ram&#8217;s horn, when you hear the sound of the ram&#8217;s horn.&#8221; The text of Josh 6:5 seems to be unduly repetitive, so for the sake of English style and readability, it is best to streamline the text here. The reading in the Hebrew looks like a conflation of variant readings, with the second (&#8220;when you hear the sound of the ram&#8217;s horn&#8221;) being an interpolation that assimilates the text to verse 20 (&#8220;when the army heard the sound of the horn&#8221;). Note that the words &#8220;when you hear the sound of the ram's horn&#8221; do not appear in the LXX of verse 5.</p>
