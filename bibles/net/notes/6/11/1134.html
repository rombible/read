<A NAME="1134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=479><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;according to all which the <sc>Lord said to Moses.&#8221; The translation assumes this refers to the promise of the land (see 1:3). Another possibility is that it refers to the Lord&#8217;s instructions, in which case the phrase could be translated, &#8220;just as the <sc>Lord had instructed Moses&#8221; (so NLT; cf. also NIV &#8220;had directed Moses&#8221;).</p>
