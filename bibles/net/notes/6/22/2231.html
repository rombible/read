<A NAME="2231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=770><b>sn</b> The western tribes here imagine a possible motive for the action of the eastern tribes. T. C. Butler explains the significance of the land&#8217;s &#8220;impurity&#8221;: &#8220;East Jordan is impure because it is not Yahweh&#8217;s possession. Rather it is simply &#8216;your possession.&#8217; That means it is land where Yahweh does not live, land which his presence has not sanctified and purified&#8221; (<i>Joshua</i> [WBC], 247).</p>
