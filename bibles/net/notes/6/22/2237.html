<A NAME="2237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=776><b>tn</b> The second half of the verse reads literally, &#8220;and he [was] one man, he did not die for his sin.&#8221; There are at least two possible ways to explain this statement: (1) One might interpret the statement to mean that Achan was not the only person who died for his sin. In this case it could be translated, &#8220;and he was not the only one to die because of his sin.&#8221; (2) Another option, the one reflected in the translation, is to take the words <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿhu</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ish </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ekhad</font>, &#8220;and he [was] one man&#8221;) as a concessive clause and join it with what precedes. The remaining words (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488; &#1490;&#1464;&#1493;&#1463;&#1506; &#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;</font>, <font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> gava</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avono</font>) must then be taken as a rhetorical question (&#8220;Did he not die for his sin?&#8221;). Taking the last sentence as interrogative is consistent with the first part of the verse, a rhetorical question introduced with the interrogative particle. The present translation has converted these rhetorical questions into affirmative statements to bring out more clearly the points they are emphasizing. For further discussion, see T. C. Butler, <i>Joshua</i> (WBC), 240.</p>
