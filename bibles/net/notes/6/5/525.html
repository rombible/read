<A NAME="525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=168><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;He said, &#8220;Neither.&#8221; An alternative reading is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>, &#8220;[He said] to him&#8221;; cf. NEB). This reading is supported by many Hebrew <sc>mss, as well as the LXX and Syriac versions. The traditional reading of the MT (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;, &#8220;no, neither&#8221;) is probably the product of aural confusion (the two variant readings sound the same in Hebrew). Although followed by a number of modern translations (cf. NIV, NRSV), this reading is problematic, for the commander of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s army would hardly have declared himself neutral.</p>
