<A NAME="1033"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=410><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;no man sharpened [or perhaps, &#8220;pointed&#8221;] his tongue against the sons of Israel.&#8221; Cf. NEB &#8220;not a man of the Israelites suffered so much as a scratch on his tongue,&#8221; which understands &#8220;sharpened&#8221; as &#8220;scratched&#8221; (referring to a minor wound). Most modern translations understand the Hebrew expression &#8220;sharpened his tongue&#8221; figuratively for opposition or threats against the Israelites.</p>
