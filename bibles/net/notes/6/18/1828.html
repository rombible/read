<A NAME="1828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=668><b>tn</b> The structure of this list presents problems. In v. 28 no conjunction appears before &#8220;Haeleph&#8221; or &#8220;Kiriath&#8221; in the Hebrew text. This suggests they should be compounded with the preceding names, yielding &#8220;Zelah Haeleph&#8221; and &#8220;Gibeah Kiriath&#8221; respectively. This results in a list of only twelve cities, however, while the summary statement (v. 28) gives the number fourteen. One should note, however, that the city lists in chap. 15 do not consistently use the conjunction before the name of each city. See also Josh 19:7, where no conjunction appears before &#8220;Rimmon,&#8221; but the summary assumes that Ain and Rimmon are distinct.</p>
