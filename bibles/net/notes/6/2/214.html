<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=46><b>tn</b> Another way to translate vv. 6-7 would be, &#8220;While she took them up to the roof and hid them&#8230;, the king&#8217;s men tried to find them&#8230;.&#8221; Both of the main clauses have the subject prior to the predicate, perhaps indicating simultaneous action. (On the grammatical point, see R. J. Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 42, §235.) In this case Rahab moves the Israelite spies from the hiding place referred to in v. 4 to a safer and less accessible hiding place.</p>
