<A NAME="193"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=672><b>tc</b> The MT has &#8220;and Sheba&#8221; listed after &#8220;Beer Sheba.&#8221; The LXX suggests &#8220;Shema.&#8221; The Hebrew text appears to be corrupt, since the form &#8220;Sheba&#8221; duplicates the latter part of the preceding name. If Sheba (or Shema) is retained, the list numbers fourteen, one more than the number given in the concluding summary (v. 6).</p>
