<A NAME="711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=235><b>tn</b> The meaning and correct translation of the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿvarim</font>) is uncertain. The translation &#8220;fissures&#8221; is based on usage of the plural form of the noun in Ps 60:4 HT (60:2 ET), where it appears to refer to cracks in the earth caused by an earthquake. Perhaps deep ravines or gorges are in view, or the word is a proper noun (&#8220;all the way to Shebarim&#8221;).</p>
