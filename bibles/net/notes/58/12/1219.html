<A NAME="1219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=356><b>sn</b> The references to <i>peace</i> and <i>holiness</i> show the close connection between this paragraph and the previous one. The pathway toward &#8220;holiness&#8221; and the need for it is cited in Heb 12:10 and 14. More importantly Prov 4:26-27 sets up the transition from one paragraph to the next: It urges people to stay on godly paths (Prov 4:26, quoted here in v. 13) and promises that God will lead them in peace if they do so (Prov 4:27 [LXX], quoted in v. 14).</p>
