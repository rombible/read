<A NAME="1225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=362><b>tn</b> This describes the nation of Israel approaching God on Mt. Sinai (Exod 19). There is a clear contrast with the reference to Mount Zion in v. 22, so this could be translated &#8220;a mountain that can be touched.&#8221; But the word &#8220;mountain&#8221; does not occur here and the more vague description seems to be deliberate.</p>
