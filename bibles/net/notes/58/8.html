<A NAME="81"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=184><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the main point of the things being said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="82"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=185><b>sn</b> An allusion to Ps 110:1; see Heb 1:3, 13.</p>
<A NAME="83"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=186><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;there are those who offer.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="84"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=187><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;who serve in,&#8221; referring to the Levitical priests, but focusing on the provisional and typological nature of the tabernacle in which they served.</p>
<A NAME="85"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=188><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;prototype,&#8221; &#8220;outline.&#8221; The Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#960;&#972;&#948;&#949;&#953;&#947;&#956;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jupodeigma</font>) does not mean &#8220;copy,&#8221; as it is often translated; it means &#8220;something to be copied,&#8221; a basis for imitation. BDAG 1037 s.v. 2 lists both Heb 8:5 and 9:23 under the second category of usage, &#8220;an indication of someth. that appears at a subsequent time,&#8221; emphasizing the temporal progression between the earthly and heavenly sanctuaries.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> There are two main options for understanding the conceptual background of the heavenly sanctuary imagery. The first is to understand the imagery to be functioning on a vertical plane. This background is Hellenistic, philosophical, and spatial in orientation and sees the earthly sanctuary as a copy of the heavenly reality. The other option is to see the imagery functioning on a horizontal plane. This background is Jewish, eschatological, and temporal and sees the heavenly sanctuary as the fulfillment and true form of the earthly sanctuary which preceded it. The second option is preferred, both for lexical reasons (see <b>tn</b> above) and because it fits the Jewish context of the book (although many scholars prefer to emphasize the relationship the book has to Hellenistic thought).</p>
<A NAME="86"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=189><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#973;&#960;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">tupos</font>) here has the meaning &#8220;an archetype serving as a model, <i>type, pattern, model</i>&#8221; (BDAG 1020 s.v. 6.a). This is in keeping with the horizontal imagery accepted for this verse (see <b>sn</b> on &#8220;sketch&#8221; earlier in the verse). Here Moses was shown the future heavenly sanctuary which, though it did not yet exist, became the outline for the earthly sanctuary.</p>
<A NAME="87"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=190><b>sn</b> A quotation from Exod 25:40.</p>
<A NAME="88"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=191><b>sn</b> The Greek text indicates a contrast between vv. 4-5 and v. 6 that is difficult to render in English: Jesus&#8217; status in the old order of priests (vv. 4-5) versus his superior ministry (v. 6).</p>
<A NAME="89"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=192><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; in the translation the referent (Jesus) has been specified for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=193><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;to the degree that.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=194><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;which is enacted.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=195><b>sn</b> This linkage of the change in priesthood with a change in the law or the covenant goes back to Heb 7:12, 22 and is picked up again in Heb 9:6-15 and 10:1-18.</p>
<A NAME="813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=196><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;no occasion for a second one would have been sought.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=197><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;for,&#8221; but providing an explanation of the God-intended limitation of the first covenant from v. 7.</p>
<A NAME="815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=198><b>sn</b> The &#8220;fault&#8221; or limitation in the <i>first covenant</i> was not in its inherent righteousness, but in its design from God himself. It was never intended to be his final revelation or provision for mankind; it was provisional, always pointing toward the fulfillment to come in Christ.</p>
<A NAME="816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=199><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (God) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=200><b>tc</b> &#8225; Several witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* A D* I K P <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 33 81 326 365 1505 2464 <i>al </i>latt co Cyr) have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#973;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">autous</font>) here, &#8220;[in finding fault with] them, [he says],&#8221; alluding to Israel&#8217;s failings mentioned in v. 9b. (The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#956;&#966;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</font> [<font face="Greektl">memfomai</font>, &#8220;to find fault with&#8221;] can take an accusative or dative direct object.) The reading behind the text above (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#943;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">autoi&quot;</font>), supported by <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> B D<sup>2</sup> 0278 1739 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>, is perhaps a harder reading theologically, and is more ambiguous in meaning. If <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#943;&#962;</font> goes with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#949;&#956;&#966;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">memfomeno&quot;</font>, here translated &#8220;showing its fault&#8221;), the clause could be translated &#8220;in finding fault with them&#8221; or &#8220;in showing [its] faults to them.&#8221; If <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#943;&#962;</font> goes with the following <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">legei</font>, &#8220;he says&#8221;), the clause is best translated, &#8220;in finding/showing [its] faults, he says to them.&#8221; The accusative pronoun suffers no such ambiguity, for it must be the object of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#949;&#956;&#966;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> rather than <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953;</font>. Although a decision is difficult, the dative form of the pronoun best explains the rise of the other reading and is thus more likely to be original.</p>
<A NAME="818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=201><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;not like the covenant,&#8221; continuing the description of v. 8b.</p>
