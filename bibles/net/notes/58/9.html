<A NAME="97"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=216><b>sn</b> <i>The cherubim </i>(pl.) were an order of angels mentioned repeatedly in the OT but only here in the NT. They were associated with God&#8217;s presence, glory, and holiness. Their images that sat on top of the <i>ark</i> of the covenant are described in Exod 25:18-20.</p>
<A NAME="98"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=217><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the first tent.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="910"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=219><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;the unintentional sins of the people&#8221;; <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the ignorances of the people.&#8221; Cf. BDAG 13 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#957;&#972;&#951;&#956;&#945;</font>, &#8220;<i>sin committed in ignorance</i>/<i>unintentionally</i>.&#8221; This term seems to be simply a synonym for &#8220;sins&#8221; (cf. Heb 5:2) and does not pick up the distinction made in Num 15:22-31 between unwitting sin and &#8220;high-handed&#8221; sin. The Day of Atonement ritual in Lev 16 covered all the sins of the people, not just the unwitting ones.</p>
<A NAME="911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=220><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the first tent.&#8221; The literal phrase &#8220;the first tent&#8221; refers to either (1) the outer chamber of the tabernacle in the wilderness (as in vv. 2, 6) or (2) the entire tabernacle as a symbol of the OT system of approaching God. The second is more likely given the contrast that follows in vv. 11-12.</p>
<A NAME="912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=221><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;only for foods and drinks.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=222><b>tc</b> Most witnesses (D<sup>1</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>) have &#8220;various washings, and external regulations&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#946;&#945;&#960;&#964;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#948;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#8061;&#956;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">baptismoi&quot; kai dikaiwmasin</font>), with both nouns in the dative. The translation &#8220;washings; they are&#8230; regulations&#8221; renders <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#946;&#945;&#960;&#964;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</font>,<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> &#948;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#8061;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">baptismoi&quot;, dikaiwmata</font>; found in such important <sc>mss as <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46 </sup><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* A I P 0278 33 1739 1881 <i>al</i> sa) in which case <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#8061;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</font> is taken as the nominative subject of the participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">epikeimena</font>). It seems far more likely that scribes would conform <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#8061;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</font> to the immediately preceding datives and join it to them by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> than they would to the following nominative participle. Both on external and internal evidence the text is thus secure as reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#946;&#945;&#960;&#964;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</font>,<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> &#948;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#8061;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</font>.</p>
<A NAME="914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=223><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;until the time of setting things right.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=224><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;But Christ, when he came,&#8221; introducing a sentence that includes all of Heb 9:11-12. The main construction is &#8220;Christ, having come&#8230;, entered&#8230;, having secured&#8230;,&#8221; and everything else describes his entrance.</p>
<A NAME="916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=225><b>tn</b> This verb occurs in the Greek middle voice, which here intensifies the role of the subject, Christ, in accomplishing the action: &#8220;he alone secured&#8221;; &#8220;he and no other secured.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="917"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=226><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;for the purifying of the flesh.&#8221; The &#8220;flesh&#8221; here is symbolic of outward or ritual purity in contrast to inner purity, that of the conscience (cf. Heb 9:9).</p>
<A NAME="918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=227><b>tc</b> The reading adopted by the translation is attested by many authorities (A D* K P 365 1739* <i>al</i>). But many others (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> D<sup>2</sup> 0278 33 1739<sup>c</sup> 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font><i> </i>lat sa) read &#8220;your&#8221; instead of &#8220;our.&#8221; The diversity of evidence makes this a difficult case to decide from external evidence alone. The first and second person pronouns differ by only one letter in Greek, as in English, also making this problem difficult to decide based on internal evidence and transcriptional probability. In the context, the author&#8217;s description of sacrificial activities seems to invite the reader to compare his own possible participation in OT liturgy as over against the completed work of Christ, so the second person pronoun &#8220;your&#8221; might make more sense. On the other hand, <i>TCGNT</i> 599 argues that &#8220;our&#8221; is preferable because the author of Hebrews uses direct address (i.e., the second person) only in the hortatory sections. What is more, the author seems to prefer the first person in explanatory remarks or when giving the logical grounds for an assertion (cf. Heb 4:15; 7:14). It is hard to reach a definitive conclusion in this case, but the data lean slightly in favor of the first person pronoun.</p>
<A NAME="919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=228><b>tn</b> The Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#949;&#963;&#943;&#964;&#951;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">mesith&quot;</font>, &#8220;mediator&#8221;) in this context does not imply that Jesus was a mediator in the contemporary sense of the word, i.e., he worked for compromise between opposing parties. Here the term describes his function as the one who was used by God to enact a new covenant which established a new relationship between God and his people, but entirely on God&#8217;s terms.</p>
<A NAME="920"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=229><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the promise of the eternal inheritance.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="921"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=230><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;a death having occurred.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="922"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=231><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;there is a necessity for the death of the one who made it to be proven.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=232><b>sn</b> The Greek text reinforces this by negating the opposite (&#8220;not even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood&#8221;), but this double negation is not used in contemporary English.</p>
<A NAME="924"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=233><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;which God commanded for you (or in your case).&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> A quotation from Exod 24:8.</p>
<A NAME="925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=234><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;prototypes,&#8221; &#8220;outlines,&#8221; referring to the earthly sanctuary. See Heb 8:5 above for the prior use of this term.</p>
<A NAME="926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=235><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;with these&#8221;; in the translation the referent (sacrifices) has been specified for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=236><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="928"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=237><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;prefiguration.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="929"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=238><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;sanctuary&#8221; is not in the Greek text at this point, but has been supplied for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="930"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=239><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;and not that he might offer,&#8221; continuing the previous construction.</p>
<A NAME="931"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=240><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#8061;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anqrwpoi&quot;</font>) has been translated as a generic noun (&#8220;people&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="932"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=241><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;and after this &#8211; judgment.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="933"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=242><b>sn</b> An allusion to Isa 53:12.</p>
<A NAME="934"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=243><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;without sin,&#8221; but in context this does not refer to Christ&#8217;s sinlessness (as in Heb 4:15) but to the fact that sin is already dealt with by his first coming.</p>
<A NAME="935"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=244><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;for salvation.&#8221; This may be construed with the verb &#8220;await&#8221; (those who wait for him to bring them salvation), but the connection with &#8220;appear&#8221; (as in the translation) is more likely.</p>
