<A NAME="1320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=392><b>tc</b> Most witnesses, including several important ones (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> A C D H <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 0243 1739 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat sy bo), conclude the letter with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">amhn</font>, &#8220;amen&#8221;). Such a conclusion is routinely added by scribes to NT books because a few of these books originally had such an ending (cf. Rom 16:27; Gal 6:18; Jude 25). A majority of Greek witnesses have the concluding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> in every NT book except Acts, James, and 3 John (and even in these books, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> is found in some witnesses). It is thus a predictable variant. Further, there is sufficient testimony (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* I<sup>vid</sup> 6 33 sa) for the lack of the particle, rendering its omission the preferred reading. </p>
