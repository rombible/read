The name &#8220;Abraham&#8221; has been repeated in the translation at this point (cf. v. 9) in order to clarify the referent (i.e., what ancestor was in view).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The point of the phrase <i>still in his ancestor&#8217;s loins</i> is that Levi was as yet unborn, still in his ancestor Abraham&#8217;s body. Thus Levi participated in Abraham&#8217;s action when Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek.</p>
