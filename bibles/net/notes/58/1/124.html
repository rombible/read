<a name="124"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=24><b>tn</b> Or possibly, &#8220;Your throne is God forever and ever.&#8221; This translation is quite doubtful, however, since (1) in the context the Son is being contrasted to the angels and is presented as far better than they. The imagery of God being the Son&#8217;s throne would seem to be of God being his authority. If so, in what sense could this <i>not</i> be said of the angels? In what sense is the Son thus contrasted with the angels? (2) The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;</font>&#8230;<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">men</font>&#8230;<font face="Greektl">de</font>) construction that connects v. 7 with v. 8 clearly lays out this contrast: &#8220;On the one hand, he says of the angels&#8230;on the other hand, he says of the Son.&#8221; Thus, although it is grammatically <i>possible</i> that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">qeos</font>) in v. 8 should be taken as a predicate nominative, the context and the correlative conjunctions are decidedly against it. Hebrews 1:8 is thus a strong affirmation of the deity of Christ.</p>
