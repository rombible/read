<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;parts.&#8221; The idea is that God&#8217;s previous revelation came in many parts and was therefore fragmentary or partial (L&amp;N 63.19), in comparison with the final and complete revelation contained in God&#8217;s Son. However, some interpret <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#965;&#956;&#949;&#961;&#8182;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">polumerw&quot;</font>) in Heb 1:1 to mean &#8220;on many different occasions&#8221; and would thus translate &#8220;many times&#8221; (L&amp;N 67.11). This is the option followed by the NIV: &#8220;at many times and in various ways.&#8221; Finally, this word is also understood to refer to the different manners in which something may be done, and would then be translated &#8220;in many different ways&#8221; (L&amp;N 89.81). In this last case, the two words <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#965;&#956;&#949;&#961;&#8182;&#962;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#965;&#964;&#961;&#972;&#960;&#969;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">polutropw&quot;</font>) mutually reinforce one another (&#8220;in many and various ways,&#8221; NRSV).</p>
