<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>tn</b> The Greek puts an emphasis on the quality of God&#8217;s final revelation. As such, it is more than an indefinite notion (&#8220;a son&#8221;) though less than a definite one (&#8220;the son&#8221;), for this final revelation is not just through <i>any </i>son of God, nor is the emphasis specifically on the person himself. Rather, the focus here is on the <i>nature</i> of the vehicle of God&#8217;s revelation: He is no mere spokesman (or prophet) for God, nor is he merely a heavenly messenger (or angel); instead, this final revelation comes through one who is intimately acquainted with the heavenly Father in a way that only a family member could be. There is, however, no exact equivalent in English (&#8220;in son&#8221; is hardly good English style).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>in a son</i> is the fulcrum of Heb 1:1-4. It concludes the contrast of God&#8217;s old and new revelation and introduces a series of seven descriptions of the Son. These descriptions show why he is the ultimate revelation of God.</p>
