<a name="117"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=17><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;And again when he brings.&#8221; The translation adopted in the text looks forward to Christ&#8217;s second coming to earth. Some take &#8220;again&#8221; to introduce the quotation (as in 1:5) and understand this as Christ&#8217;s first coming, but this view does not fit well with Heb 2:7. Others understand it as his exaltation/ascension to heaven, but this takes the phrase &#8220;into the world&#8221; in an unlikely way.</p>
