Although it is possible that longer reading was produced by overzealous scribes who wanted to underscore the frailty of creation, it is much more likely that the shorter reading was produced by scribes who wanted to conform the wording to that of Ps 102:26 (101:27 LXX), which here lacks the second &#8220;like a garment.&#8221; Both external and internal considerations decidedly favor the longer reading, and point to the author of Hebrews as the one underscoring the difference between the Son and creation.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>like a garment </i>here is not part of the original OT text (see <b>tc</b> note above); for this reason it has been printed in normal type.</p>
