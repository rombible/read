<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>tn</b> Most modern English translations attempt to make the comparison somewhat smoother by treating &#8220;name&#8221; as if it were the subject of the second element: &#8220;as the name he has inherited is superior to theirs&#8221; (cf. NAB, NIV, NRSV, CEV). However, the Son is the subject of both the first and second elements: &#8220;he became so far better&#8221;; &#8220;he has inherited a name.&#8221; The present translation maintains this parallelism even though it results in a somewhat more awkward rendering.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b><i> </i>This comparison is somewhat awkward to express in English, but it reflects an important element in the argument of Hebrews: the superiority of Jesus Christ.</p>
