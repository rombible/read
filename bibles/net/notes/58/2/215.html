<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=48><b>sn</b> The Greek word translated <i>pioneer</i> is used of a &#8220;prince&#8221; or leader, the representative head of a family. It also carries nuances of &#8220;trailblazer,&#8221; one who breaks through to new ground for those who follow him. It is used some thirty-five times in the Greek OT and four times in the NT, always of Christ (Acts 3:15; 5:31; Heb 2:10; 12:2).</p>
