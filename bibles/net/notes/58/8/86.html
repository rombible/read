<A NAME="86"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=189><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#973;&#960;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">tupos</font>) here has the meaning &#8220;an archetype serving as a model, <i>type, pattern, model</i>&#8221; (BDAG 1020 s.v. 6.a). This is in keeping with the horizontal imagery accepted for this verse (see <b>sn</b> on &#8220;sketch&#8221; earlier in the verse). Here Moses was shown the future heavenly sanctuary which, though it did not yet exist, became the outline for the earthly sanctuary.</p>
