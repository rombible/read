<A NAME="918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=227><b>tc</b> The reading adopted by the translation is attested by many authorities (A D* K P 365 1739* <i>al</i>). But many others (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> D<sup>2</sup> 0278 33 1739<sup>c</sup> 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font><i> </i>lat sa) read &#8220;your&#8221; instead of &#8220;our.&#8221; The diversity of evidence makes this a difficult case to decide from external evidence alone. The first and second person pronouns differ by only one letter in Greek, as in English, also making this problem difficult to decide based on internal evidence and transcriptional probability. In the context, the author&#8217;s description of sacrificial activities seems to invite the reader to compare his own possible participation in OT liturgy as over against the completed work of Christ, so the second person pronoun &#8220;your&#8221; might make more sense. On the other hand, <i>TCGNT</i> 599 argues that &#8220;our&#8221; is preferable because the author of Hebrews uses direct address (i.e., the second person) only in the hortatory sections. What is more, the author seems to prefer the first person in explanatory remarks or when giving the logical grounds for an assertion (cf. Heb 4:15; 7:14). It is hard to reach a definitive conclusion in this case, but the data lean slightly in favor of the first person pronoun.</p>
