<A NAME="910"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=219><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;the unintentional sins of the people&#8221;; <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the ignorances of the people.&#8221; Cf. BDAG 13 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#957;&#972;&#951;&#956;&#945;</font>, &#8220;<i>sin committed in ignorance</i>/<i>unintentionally</i>.&#8221; This term seems to be simply a synonym for &#8220;sins&#8221; (cf. Heb 5:2) and does not pick up the distinction made in Num 15:22-31 between unwitting sin and &#8220;high-handed&#8221; sin. The Day of Atonement ritual in Lev 16 covered all the sins of the people, not just the unwitting ones.</p>
