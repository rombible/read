<A NAME="911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=220><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the first tent.&#8221; The literal phrase &#8220;the first tent&#8221; refers to either (1) the outer chamber of the tabernacle in the wilderness (as in vv. 2, 6) or (2) the entire tabernacle as a symbol of the OT system of approaching God. The second is more likely given the contrast that follows in vv. 11-12.</p>
