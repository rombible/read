<A NAME="1023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=267><b>sn</b> <i>Through his flesh. </i>In a bold shift the writer changes from a spatial phrase (Christ opened the way <i>through the curtain</i> into the inner sanctuary) to an instrumental phrase (he did this <i>through</i> [by means of] <i>his flesh</i> in his sacrifice of himself), associating the two in an allusion to the splitting of the curtain in the temple from top to bottom (Matt 27:51; Mark 15:38; Luke 23:45). Just as the curtain was split, so Christ&#8217;s body was broken for us, to give us access into God&#8217;s presence.</p>
