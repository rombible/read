<a name="120"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=20><b>sn</b> <i>Diotrephes</i> appears to be an influential person (perhaps the leader) in a local church known to Gaius, but to which Gaius himself does not belong. The description of Diotrephes as one <i>who loves to be first</i> suggests he is arrogant, and his behavior displays this: He refuses to <i>acknowledge</i> the written communication mentioned by the author at the beginning of v. 9 (and thus did not recognize the author&#8217;s apostolic authority), and furthermore (v. 10) <i>refuses</i> to show any hospitality to the traveling missionaries (<i>welcome the brothers</i>) already mentioned by the author. It has been suggested that the description &#8220;loves to be first&#8221; only indicates that Diotrephes sought prominence or position in this church, and had not yet attained any real authority. But his actions here suggest otherwise: He is able to refuse or ignore the author&#8217;s previous written instructions (v. 9), and he is able to have other people put out of the church for showing hospitality to the traveling missionaries (v. 10).</p>
