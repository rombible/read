<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#968;&#965;&#967;&#8053;</font> (<font face="Greektl">yuch</font>) is used 10 times in the Gospel of John and 2 times in 1 John; of these 6 of the uses in John and both in 1 John refer to a person&#8217;s &#8220;life&#8221; (as something that can be laid down). In John 10:24 and 12:27 the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#968;&#965;&#967;&#8053;</font> is that part of a person where emotions are experienced; one&#8217;s <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#968;&#965;&#967;&#8053;</font> is held in suspense or deeply troubled. This is, in other words, the immaterial part of a person as opposed to his physical existence. A close parallel is found in Philo, <i>Heir</i> 58 (285): &#8220;nourished with peace, he will depart, having gained a calm, unclouded life&#8230;welfare in the body, welfare in the soul (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#968;&#965;&#967;&#8053;</font>)&#8230;health and strength&#8230;delight in virtues.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Just as it is well with your soul. </i>The equivalent contemporary idiom would be to speak of &#8216;spiritual&#8217; health as opposed to physical health. The author affirms that Gaius is indeed well off spiritually, and he prays that Gaius&#8217; physical health would match his spiritual health, i.e., that Gaius would be as well off physically as he is spiritually. It is the spiritual health which is to be the standard by which one&#8217;s physical health is measured, not the other way round.</p>
