<a name="121"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=21><b>tn</b> Since the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#948;&#941;&#967;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">epidecomai</font>) can mean &#8220;receive into one&#8217;s presence&#8221; (BDAG 370 s.v. 1; it is used with this meaning in the next verse) it has been suggested that the author himself attempted a previous visit to Diotrephes&#8217; church but was turned away. There is nothing in the context to suggest an unsuccessful prior visit by the author, however; in 3 John 9 he explicitly indicates a prior <i>written</i> communication which Diotrephes apparently ignored or suppressed. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#948;&#941;&#967;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</font> can also mean &#8220;accept&#8221; in the sense of &#8220;acknowledge someone&#8217;s authority&#8221; (BDAG 370 s.v. 2) and such a meaning better fits the context here: Diotrephes has not accepted but instead rejected the authority of the author to intervene in the situation of the traveling missionaries (perhaps because Diotrephes believed the author had no local jurisdiction in the matter).</p>
