<a name="126"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=26><b>sn</b> <i>Demetrius </i>is apparently someone Gaius would have heard about, but whose character was not known to him. Thus the author is writing to Gaius to attest to Demetrius&#8217; good character. It appears that Demetrius is coming to Gaius&#8217; church and needs hospitality and assistance, so the author is writing to commend him to Gaius and vouch for him. It is difficult to know more about Demetrius with any certainty, but the author is willing to give him a powerful personal endorsement (<i>We testify to him too</i>). Demetrius may well have been the leader of a delegation of traveling missionaries, and may even have been the bearer of this letter to Gaius. The writing of letters of introduction to be carried along by representatives or missionaries in NT times is also attested in Paul&#8217;s writings (1 Cor 16:3).</p>
