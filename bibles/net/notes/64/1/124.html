<a name="124"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=24><b>sn</b> The exhortation <i>do not imitate what is bad but what is good</i> is clearly a reference to Diotrephes&#8217; evil behavior. The author exhorts Gaius (whom he wishes to continue assisting the missionaries) not to follow the negative example of Diotrephes, but to do what is right. Implicitly there may be a contrast between the bad behavior of Diotrephes and the good reputation of Demetrius (mentioned in the following verse); but it seems more likely that Demetrius is himself one of the traveling missionaries (perhaps their leader), rather than the leader of a local congregation who, unlike Diotrephes, has supported the missionaries himself.</p>
