<a name="115"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=15><b>sn</b> Three possibilities for the identification of <i>&#8216;The Name&#8217;</i> have been suggested: (1) the name of God, suggested by the unqualified noun with the Greek article. In Rabbinic literature &#8220;the Name&#8221; is a frequent substitute for the Tetragrammaton YHWH, the name of God, which was too sacred to be pronounced. This would make good logical sense in 3 John, because in the previous verse the author has instructed Gaius to send the missionaries on their way &#8220;in a manner worthy of God.&#8221; (2) Some have understood &#8220;the Name&#8221; as the self-designation of the Johannine community, or as a reference to the Christian cause at large, or as a way of designating Christians before the title &#8220;Christian&#8221; came into common usage. (3) The interpretation favored by most commentators is that this is a reference to Jesus&#8217; name. Paul uses a similar phrase in Rom 1:5, and in 1 John 2:12 the author wrote, &#8220;your sins are forgiven on account of His (Christ&#8217;s) name.&#8221; John&#8217;s Gospel also makes reference to believing &#8220;in the name of Jesus&#8221; (John 1:12, 3:18).</p>
