<a name="14"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4><b>tn</b> The prepositional phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#949;&#943;&#8115; </font>(<font face="Greektl">en alhqeia</font>) in 3 John 1 is similar to 2 John 1, although it is not qualified here as it is there (see 2 John 1). This is not merely the equivalent of an adverb (&#8220;truly&#8221;), but is a theological statement affirming the orthodoxy of Gaius, to whom the letter is addressed. &#8220;Truth&#8221; is the author&#8217;s way of alluding to theological orthodoxy in the face of the challenge by the opponents (see 1 John 3:19).</p>
