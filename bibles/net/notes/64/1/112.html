<a name="112"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=12><b>sn</b> Which <i>church</i> does the author refer to here? The church where Gaius is, the church where the author is, a different local church where the &#8220;brothers&#8221; are, or the &#8216;universal&#8217; church, the church at large? Since the suggestion in 3 John 3 is that the &#8220;<i>brothers</i>&#8221; have come and testified in the author&#8217;s church about what Gaius has done for them, it seems most likely that the &#8220;<i>church</i>&#8221; mentioned here is also the author&#8217;s church, where he is currently located. Other possibilities cannot be ruled out, but seem unnecessarily complicated.</p>
