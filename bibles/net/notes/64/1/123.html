<a name="123"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=23><b>sn</b> Because Diotrephes did not recognize the authority of the author, the author will expose his behavior for what it is (<i>call attention to the deeds he is doing</i>) if he comes for a visit. These are the charges the author will make against Diotrephes before the church: (1) Diotrephes is engaged in spreading <i>unjustified charges</i> against the author with <i>evil words</i>; (2) Diotrephes refuses to <i>welcome the brothers</i> (the traveling missionaries) himself; (3) Diotrephes <i>hinders</i> the others in the church who wish to help the missionaries; and (4) Diotrephes expels from the church (<i>throws them out</i>) people who aid the missionaries. (Diotrephes himself may not have had supreme authority in the local church to expel these people, but may have been responsible for instigating collective action against them.)</p>
