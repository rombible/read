<a name="117"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=17><b>sn</b> Clearly the author does not refer to himself alone by the use of the first person plural pronoun <i>we</i> here, since the issue is support for the traveling missionaries. It stands in contrast to <i>the pagans</i> mentioned in the previous verse, and is thus to be understood as inclusive of <i>all</i> true Christians: the author, Gaius, and all true Christians. All true Christians ought to support the endeavors of these traveling missionaries in their efforts to counteract the heretical teaching of the opponents.</p>
