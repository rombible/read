<a name="125"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=25><b>sn</b> The statement <i>The one who does what is bad has not seen God</i> is asyndetic; its abrupt introduction adds emphasis. The statement reiterates the common Johannine theme of behavior as an indication of genuine faith, found in 1 John in 3:6, 10; 4:7, 20; and in the Gospel of John in 3:17-21. By implication, the genuineness of Diotrephes&#8217; faith is called into question, because he has obviously done <i>what is bad</i> (v. 11b; cf. vv. 9-10). In John&#8217;s terminology it is clear that the phrase <i>has not seen God</i> is equivalent to &#8220;is not a genuine Christian&#8221; (see John 3:17-21 and 1 John 3:6, 10; 4:7, 20).</p>
