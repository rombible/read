<a name="113"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=13><b>sn</b> Now the author, after commending Gaius for his faithful service to the traveling missionaries in the past (see 3 John 5), now requests additional assistance at the present time (<i>send them on their way in a manner worthy of God</i>). Apparently the missionaries are on their way to visit the area where Gaius&#8217; church is located a second time. They had been there once already and had returned with a good report of how Gaius had assisted them. It is entirely possible that they themselves carry with them the present letter as a letter of introduction. Along these lines it has been suggested that <i>Demetrius</i> (see 3 John 12) is one of these traveling missionaries, perhaps the leader of the delegation, and the author is formally introducing him to Gaius, since when he was there the last time he was a <i>stranger</i> (v. 5) but Gaius assisted him anyway.</p>
