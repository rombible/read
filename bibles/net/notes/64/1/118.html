<a name="118"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=18><b>tn</b> The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945; </font>(<font face="Greektl">Jina</font>) clause indicates the result of such support for the traveling missionaries: The Christian who helps to support them in their efforts thus becomes a coworker in cooperation with the truth. Although the dative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8135; &#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#949;&#943;&#8115;</font> (<font face="Greektl">th alhqeia</font>) is somewhat difficult to specify, it would appear (corresponding to the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#973;&#957;</font>- [<font face="Greektl">sun-</font>] prefix of the noun modified) to indicate a sense of cooperation with &#8220;the truth&#8221; which is at work through the missionaries. There is precedent in the Johannine literature for understanding &#8220;truth&#8221; as personified (John 8:32, &#8220;the truth will make you free&#8221;; possibly also 1 John 3:19). More explicitly, 1 John 4:6 identifies the Holy Spirit as &#8220;the Spirit of Truth,&#8221; a characterization repeated in 1 John 5:6. Thus it seems likely that the &#8220;truth&#8221; at work through the missionaries here is ultimately the Holy Spirit, who works through their efforts. The Christian who supports them thus becomes a coworker with the Spirit of God himself.</p>
