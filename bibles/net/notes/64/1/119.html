<a name="119"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=19><b>sn</b> The <i>church</i> mentioned here, which the author says he may visit (3 John 10) is not the same as the one mentioned in 3 John 6, to which the author apparently belongs (or of which he is in charge). But what is the relationship of this church in v. 9 to Gaius, to whom the letter is addressed? It is sometimes suggested that Gaius belongs to this church, but that seems unlikely, because the author uses a third-person pronoun to refer to the other members of the church (<i>among</i> <i>them</i>). If Gaius were one of these it would have been much more natural to use a second-person pronoun: &#8220;Diotrephes, who loves to be first <i>among</i> <i>you</i>.&#8221; Thus it seems probable that Gaius belongs to (or is in charge of) one local church while Diotrephes is in another, a church known to Gaius but to which he does not belong.</p>
