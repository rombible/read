<a name="116"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=16><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#952;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">eqniko&quot;</font>) occurs only 4 times in the NT (the other three are in Matt 5:47; 6:7; and 18:17). It is virtually synonymous here with the far more common <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#952;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">eqno&quot;</font>, used some 162 times in the NT). Both refer to the Gentiles (that is, pagans).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Since the issue here is support for the traveling missionaries, and there is no indication that the author would want to forbid receiving support from Gentile converts to Christianity, the word <i>pagans</i> must refer to Gentile unbelievers, i.e., pagans. The traveling missionaries sent out to combat the false teaching of the secessionist opponents have been accepting nothing by way of support from non-Christians.</p>
