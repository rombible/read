<a name="133"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=33><b>sn</b> It is possible that the designation <i>friends</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#943;&#955;&#959;&#953;</font>, <font face="Greektl">filoi</font>) indicates that these are personal friends of Gaius who send their greetings, but if this is the case it is somewhat surprising that their names are not mentioned, especially when the author instructs Gaius, <i>Greet the friends there by name</i>. More likely this is an alternative to &#8220;brothers&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#959;&#943;</font>, <font face="Greektl">adelfoi</font>) as an early Christian self-designation, especially within the Johannine community. It may have arisen in the Johannine community from Jesus&#8217; teaching in John 15:13-15, &#8220;you are my <i>friends</i> if you do what I command you.&#8221;</p>
