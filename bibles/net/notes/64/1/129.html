The author tells Gaius that he has more to say, but does not wish to do so in writing; he would rather talk in person (3 John 14). It appears that the author anticipates a personal visit to Gaius&#8217; church in the very near future. This may be the same visit mentioned in connection with Diotrephes in v. 10. Gaius&#8217; church and Diotrephes&#8217; church may have been in the same city, or in neighboring towns, so that the author anticipates visiting both on the same journey.</p>
