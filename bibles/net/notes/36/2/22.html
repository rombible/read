<A NAME="22"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=57><b>tn</b> Some relate this word to an Aramaic cognate meaning &#8220;to be ashamed.&#8221; With the negative particle it would then mean &#8220;unashamed&#8221; (cf. NIV &#8220;shameful&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;shameless&#8221;). However, elsewhere in biblical Hebrew the verb means &#8220;to desire,&#8221; or with the negative particle &#8220;undesirable.&#8221; Cf. also NEB &#8220;unruly.&#8221;</p>
