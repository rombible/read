<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=77><b>tn</b> The NIV here supplies the phrase &#8220;where the Kerethites dwell&#8221; (&#8220;Kerethites&#8221; is translated in v. 5 as &#8220;the people who came from Crete&#8221;) as an interpretive gloss, but this phrase is not in the MT. The NAB likewise reads &#8220;the coastland of the Cretans,&#8221; supplying &#8220;Cretans&#8221; here.</p>
