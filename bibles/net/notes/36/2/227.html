<A NAME="227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=82><b>tn</b> The referent of the pronominal subject (&#8220;they&#8221;) is unclear. It may refer (1) to the shepherds (in which case the first verb should be translated, &#8220;pasture their sheep,&#8221; cf. NEB), or (2) to the Judahites occupying the area, who are being compared to sheep (cf. NIV, &#8220;there they will find pasture&#8221;).</p>
