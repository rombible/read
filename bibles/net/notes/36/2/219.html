<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=74><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Woe, inhabitants of the coast of the sea, nation of Kerethites.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hoy</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;ah, woe&#8221;), is used to mourn the dead and express outwardly one&#8217;s sorrow (see 1 Kgs 13:30; Jer 22:18; 34:5). By using it here the prophet mourns in advance the downfall of the Philistines, thereby emphasizing the certainty of their demise (&#8220;as good as dead&#8221;). Some argue the word does not have its earlier connotation here and is simply an attention-getting interjection, equivalent to &#8220;Hey!&#8221;</p>
