This can be translated literally, &#8220;Sweeping away, I will bring to an end.&#8221; Some prefer to emend the text so that the infinitive and finite form of the verb are from the same root (&#8220;I will certainly sweep away,&#8221; if from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1507;</font> [cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV]; &#8220;I will certainly bring to an end,&#8221; if from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;</font>). For a discussion of proposals see J. J. M.

The present translation assumes the &#8220;stumbling blocks&#8221; are idolatrous images of animals, birds, and fish. See J. J. M. Roberts, <i>Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah </i>(OTL), 167, and Adele Berlin, <i>Zephaniah </i>(AB), 73-74.</p>

<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;of the pagan priests and priests.&#8221; The first word (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kÿmarim</font>) refers to idolatrous priests in its two other appearances in the OT (2 Kgs 23:5, Hos 10:5), while the second word (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kohanim</font>) is the normal term for &#8220;priest&#8221; and is used of both legitimate and illegitimate priests in the OT. It is likely that the second term, which is omitted in the LXX, is a later scribal addition to the Hebrew text, defining the extremely rare word that precedes (see J. J. M. Roberts, <i>Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah </i>[OTL], 167-68; cf. also NEB, NRSV). Some argue that both words are original; among the modern English versions that include both are NASB and NIV. Possibly the first word refers to outright pagan priests, while the second has in view once-legitimate priests of the Lord who had drifted into idolatrous practices. Another option is found in Adele Berlin, who translates, &#8220;the idolatrous priests among the priests,&#8221; understanding the second word as giving the general category of which the idolatrous priests are a part (<i>Zephaniah </i>[AB 25A], 75).</p>
<a name="112"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=12><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;I will remove&#8221; are repeated from v. 4b for stylistic reasons. In the Hebrew text vv. 4b-6 contain a long list of objects for the verb &#8220;I will remove&#8221; in v. 4b. In the present translation a new sentence was begun at the beginning of v. 5 in keeping with the tendency of contemporary English to use shorter sentences.</p>
<a name="113"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=13><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;those who worship on their roofs the host of heaven.&#8221; The &#8220;host of heaven&#8221; included the sun, moon, planets, and stars, all of which were deified in the ancient Near East.</p>
<a name="114"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=14><b>tc</b> The MT reads, &#8220;those who worship, those who swear allegiance to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.&#8221; The original form of the LXX omits the phrase &#8220;those who worship&#8221;; it may have been accidentally repeated from the preceding line. J. J. M. Roberts prefers to delete as secondary the phrase &#8220;those who swear allegiance&#8221; (J. J. M. Roberts, <i>Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah</i> [OTL], 168).</p>
<a name="115"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=15><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;those who swear by.&#8221;</p>
<a name="116"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=16><b>tn</b> The referent of &#8220;their king&#8221; is unclear. It may refer sarcastically to a pagan god (perhaps Baal) worshiped by the people. Some English versions (cf. NEB, NASB, NRSV) prefer to emend the text to &#8220;Milcom,&#8221; the name of an Ammonite god (following some LXX <span class="smallcaps">mss</span>, Syriac, and Vulgate) or &#8220;Molech,&#8221; a god to whom the Israelites offered their children (cf. NIV, NLT). For a discussion of the options, see Adele Berlin, <i>Zephaniah</i> (AB 25A), 75-77.</p>

Note the usage of the two verbs in 2 Chr 20:3-4. </p>
<a name="119"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=19><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;Lord <span class="smallcaps">Lord.</span>&#8221; The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497; &#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1460;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">adonai yÿhvih)</font> is customarily rendered by Jewish tradition as &#8220;Lord <span class="smallcaps">God</span>.&#8221;</p>
<a name="120"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=20><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the day of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The origin of the concept of &#8220;the day of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221; is uncertain. It may have originated in the ancient Near Eastern idea of the sovereign&#8217;s day of conquest, where a king would boast that he had concluded an entire military campaign in a single day (see D. Stuart, &#8220;The Sovereign&#8217;s Day of Conquest,&#8221; <i>BASOR</i> 221 [1976]: 159-64). In the OT the expression is applied to several acts of divine judgment, some historical and others still future (see A. J. Everson, &#8220;The Days of Yahweh,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 93 [1974]: 329-37). In the OT the phrase first appears in Amos (assuming that Amos predates Joel and Obadiah), where it seems to refer to a belief on the part of the northern kingdom that God would intervene on Israel&#8217;s behalf and judge the nation&#8217;s enemies. Amos affirms that the Lord&#8217;s day of judgment is indeed approaching, but he declares that it will be a day of disaster, not deliverance, for Israel. Here in Zephaniah, the &#8220;day of the Lord&#8221; includes God&#8217;s coming judgment of Judah, as well as a more universal outpouring of divine anger.</p>

<a name="126"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=26><b>sn</b> The point of the statement <i>all who hop over the threshold</i> is unclear. A ritual or superstition associated with the Philistine god Dagon may be in view (see 1 Sam 5:5).</p>

<a name="138"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=38><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;who thicken on their sediment.&#8221; The imagery comes from wine making, where the wine, if allowed to remain on the sediment too long, will thicken into syrup. The image suggests that the people described here were complacent in their sinful behavior and interpreted the delay in judgment as divine apathy. </p>

<a name="145"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=45><b>sn</b> This description of the day of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> consists of an initial reference to <i>anger</i>, followed by four pairs of synonyms. The joining of synonyms in this way emphasizes the degree of the characteristic being described. The first two pairs focus on the <i>distress</i> and <i>ruin</i> that judgment will bring; the second two pairs picture this day of judgment as being very dark (<i>darkness</i>) and exceedingly overcast (<i>gloom</i>). The description concludes with the pairing of two familiar battle sounds, the blast on the ram&#8217;s horn (<i>trumpet blasts</i>) and the war cries of the warriors (<i>battle cries</i>).</p>
