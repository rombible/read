<a name="116"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=16><b>tn</b> The referent of &#8220;their king&#8221; is unclear. It may refer sarcastically to a pagan god (perhaps Baal) worshiped by the people. Some English versions (cf. NEB, NASB, NRSV) prefer to emend the text to &#8220;Milcom,&#8221; the name of an Ammonite god (following some LXX <span class="smallcaps">mss</span>, Syriac, and Vulgate) or &#8220;Molech,&#8221; a god to whom the Israelites offered their children (cf. NIV, NLT). For a discussion of the options, see Adele Berlin, <i>Zephaniah</i> (AB 25A), 75-77.</p>
