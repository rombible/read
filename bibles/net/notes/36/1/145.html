<a name="145"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=45><b>sn</b> This description of the day of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> consists of an initial reference to <i>anger</i>, followed by four pairs of synonyms. The joining of synonyms in this way emphasizes the degree of the characteristic being described. The first two pairs focus on the <i>distress</i> and <i>ruin</i> that judgment will bring; the second two pairs picture this day of judgment as being very dark (<i>darkness</i>) and exceedingly overcast (<i>gloom</i>). The description concludes with the pairing of two familiar battle sounds, the blast on the ram&#8217;s horn (<i>trumpet blasts</i>) and the war cries of the warriors (<i>battle cries</i>).</p>
