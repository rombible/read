<a name="112"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=12><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;I will remove&#8221; are repeated from v. 4b for stylistic reasons. In the Hebrew text vv. 4b-6 contain a long list of objects for the verb &#8220;I will remove&#8221; in v. 4b. In the present translation a new sentence was begun at the beginning of v. 5 in keeping with the tendency of contemporary English to use shorter sentences.</p>
