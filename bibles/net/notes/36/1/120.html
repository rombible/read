It may have originated in the ancient Near Eastern idea of the sovereign&#8217;s day of conquest, where a king would boast that he had concluded an entire military campaign in a single day (see D. Stuart, &#8220;The Sovereign&#8217;s Day of Conquest,&#8221; <i>BASOR</i> 221 [1976]: 159-64). In the OT the expression is applied to several acts of divine judgment, some historical and others still future (see A. J. Everson, &#8220;The Days of Yahweh,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 93 [1974]: 329-37). In the OT the phrase first appears in Amos (assuming that Amos predates Joel and Obadiah), where it seems to refer to a belief on the part of the northern kingdom that God would intervene on Israel&#8217;s behalf and judge the nation&#8217;s enemies. Amos affirms that the Lord&#8217;s day of judgment is indeed approaching, but he declares that it will be a day of disaster, not deliverance, for Israel. Here in Zephaniah, the &#8220;day of the Lord&#8221; includes God&#8217;s coming judgment of Judah, as well as a more universal outpouring of divine anger.</p>
