<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;of the pagan priests and priests.&#8221; The first word (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kÿmarim</font>) refers to idolatrous priests in its two other appearances in the OT (2 Kgs 23:5, Hos 10:5), while the second word (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kohanim</font>) is the normal term for &#8220;priest&#8221; and is used of both legitimate and illegitimate priests in the OT. It is likely that the second term, which is omitted in the LXX, is a later scribal addition to the Hebrew text, defining the extremely rare word that precedes (see J. J. M. Roberts, <i>Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah </i>[OTL], 167-68; cf. also NEB, NRSV). Some argue that both words are original; among the modern English versions that include both are NASB and NIV. Possibly the first word refers to outright pagan priests, while the second has in view once-legitimate priests of the Lord who had drifted into idolatrous practices. Another option is found in Adele Berlin, who translates, &#8220;the idolatrous priests among the priests,&#8221; understanding the second word as giving the general category of which the idolatrous priests are a part (<i>Zephaniah </i>[AB 25A], 75).</p>
