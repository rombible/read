<a name="114"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=14><b>tc</b> The MT reads, &#8220;those who worship, those who swear allegiance to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.&#8221; The original form of the LXX omits the phrase &#8220;those who worship&#8221;; it may have been accidentally repeated from the preceding line. J. J. M. Roberts prefers to delete as secondary the phrase &#8220;those who swear allegiance&#8221; (J. J. M. Roberts, <i>Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah</i> [OTL], 168).</p>
