<A NAME="31"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=117><b>tn</b> The present translation assumes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1465;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mor</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>) is derived from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1465;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ro</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">i</font>,&#8220;excrement&#8221;; see Jastrow 1436 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1459;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;</font>). The following participle, &#8220;stained,&#8221; supports this interpretation (cf. NEB &#8220;filthy and foul&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;soiled, defiled&#8221;). Another option is to derive the form from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">marah</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;to rebel&#8221;); in this case the term should be translated &#8220;rebellious&#8221; (cf. NASB, NIV &#8220;rebellious and defiled&#8221;). This idea is supported by v. 2. For discussion of the two options, see <i>HALOT</i> 630 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1512;&#1488;</font> and J. J. M. Roberts, <i>Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah </i>(OTL), 206.</p>

On the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hoy</font>, &#8220;ah, woe&#8221;), see the note on the word &#8220;dead&#8221; in 2:5.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The following verses show that Jerusalem, personified as a woman (&#8220;she&#8221;), is the referent.</p>
<A NAME="33"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=119><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;she does not hear a voice&#8221; Refusing to listen is equated with disobedience. </p>
<A NAME="34"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=120><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;she does not receive correction.&#8221; The Hebrew phrase, when negated, refers elsewhere to rejecting verbal advice (Jer 17:23; 32:33; 35:13) and refusing to learn from experience (Jer 2:30; 5:3). </p>
<A NAME="35"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=121><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;draw near to.&#8221; The present translation assumes that the expression &#8220;draw near to&#8221; refers to seeking God&#8217;s will (see 1 Sam 14:36). </p>
<A NAME="36"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=122><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;officials.&#8221;</p>

For a discussion of this and other options, see Adele Berlin, <i>Zephaniah </i>(AB 25A), 128. The metaphor has been translated as a simile (&#8220;as hungry as&#8221;) for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=126><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;they do not gnaw [a bone] at morning.&#8221; The precise meaning of the line is unclear. The statement may mean these wolves devour their prey so completely that not even a bone is left to gnaw by the time morning arrives. For a discussion of this and other options, see Adele Berlin, <i>Zephaniah </i>(AB 25A), 129.</p>
<A NAME="311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=127><b>sn</b> Applied to prophets, the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1465;&#1495;&#1458;&#1494;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pokhazim</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;proud&#8221;) probably refers to their audacity in passing off their own words as genuine prophecies from the <sc>Lord (see Jer 23:32).</p>
<A NAME="312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=128><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;defile the temple.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> These priests<i> defile what is holy</i> by not observing the proper distinctions between what is ritually clean and unclean (see Ezek 22:26). </p>

<A NAME="320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=136><b>tn</b> This Hebrew verb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tsadah</font>) occurs only here in the OT, but its meaning is established from the context and from an Aramaic cognate.</p>
<A NAME="321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=137><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;so that there is no man, without inhabitant.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=140><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;dwelling place.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=142><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;all which I have punished her.&#8221; The precise meaning of this statement and its relationship to what precedes are unclear. </p>
<A NAME="327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=143><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;But they got up early, they made corrupt all their actions.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;they got up early&#8221; probably refers to their eagerness to engage in sinful activities.</p>
<A NAME="328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=144><b>tn</b> The second person verb form (&#8220;you must wait patiently&#8221;) is masculine plural, indicating that a group is being addressed. Perhaps the humble individuals addressed earlier (see 2:3) are in view. Because of Jerusalem&#8217;s sin, they must patiently wait for judgment to pass before their vindication arrives.</p>
<A NAME="329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=145><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;when I arise for plunder.&#8221; The present translation takes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ad</font>) as &#8220;plunder.&#8221; Some, following the LXX, repoint the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1491;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ed)</font> and translate, &#8220;as a witness&#8221; (cf. NASB, NIV, NRSV). In this case the Lord uses a legal metaphor to picture himself as testifying against his enemies. Adele Berlin takes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ad)</font> in a temporal sense (&#8220;forever&#8221;) and translates &#8220;once and for all&#8221; (<i>Zephaniah </i>[AB 25A], 133).</p>
<A NAME="330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=146><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;for my decision is.&#8221;</p>

This apparently refers to a time when the nations will reject their false idol-gods and offer genuine praise to the one true God.</p>
<A NAME="333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=149><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;so that all of them will call on the name of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; </p>

<A NAME="335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=151><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Nubia&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Cush.&#8221; &#8220;Cush&#8221; is traditionally assumed to refer to the region south of Egypt, i.e. Nubia or northern Sudan, referred to as &#8220;Ethiopia&#8221; by classical authors (not the more recent Abyssinia).</p>
<A NAME="336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=152><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;those who pray to me, the daughter of my dispersed ones.&#8221; The meaning of the phrase is unclear. Perhaps the text is corrupt at this point or a proper name should be understood. For a discussion of various options see Adele Berlin, <i>Zephaniah </i>(AB 25A), 134-35.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> It is not certain if <i>those who pray to me</i> refers to the converted nations or to God&#8217;s exiled covenant people.</p>
<A NAME="337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=153><b>sn</b> The second person verbs and pronouns are feminine singular, indicating that personified Jerusalem is addressed here.</p>
<A NAME="338"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=154><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;In that day you not be ashamed because of all your actions, [in] which you rebelled against me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=155><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the arrogant ones of your pride.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="340"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=156><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;needy and poor people.&#8221; The terms often refer to a socioeconomic group, but here they may refer to those who are humble in a spiritual sense.</p>
<A NAME="341"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=157><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and they will take refuge in the name of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Safety in the <sc>Lord&#8217;s presence</i>. From the time the <sc>Lord introduced his special covenant name (Yahweh) to Moses, it served as a reminder of his protective presence as Israel&#8217;s faithful deliverer. </p>
<A NAME="342"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=158><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the remnant of Israel.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="343"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=159><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;peacefully like sheep&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarification.</p>
<A NAME="344"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=160><b>sn</b> This phrase is used as an epithet for the city and the nation. &#8220;Daughter&#8221; may seem extraneous in English but consciously joins the various epithets and metaphors of Israel and Jerusalem as a woman, a device used to evoke sympathy from the reader.</p>
<A NAME="345"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=161><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;your judgments,&#8221; that is, &#8220;the judgments directed against you.&#8221; The translation reflects the implications of the parallelism.</p>
<A NAME="346"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=162><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;it will be said.&#8221; The passive construction has been translated as active for stylistic reasons.</p>

<A NAME="348"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=164><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;he rejoices over you with joy.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="349"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=165><b>tc</b> The MT reads, &#8220;he is silent in his love,&#8221; but this makes no sense in light of the immediately preceding and following lines. Some take the Hiphil verb form as causative (see Job 11:3) rather than intransitive and translate, &#8220;he causes [you] to be silent by his love,&#8221; that is, &#8220;he soothes [you] by his love.&#8221; The present translation follows the LXX and assumes an original reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿkhaddesh</font>, &#8220;he renews&#8221;) with ellipsis of the object (&#8220;you&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="350"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=166><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;he rejoices over you with a shout of joy.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="351"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=167><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The ones grieving from an assembly I gathered from you they were, tribute upon her, a reproach.&#8221; Any translation of this difficult verse must be provisional at best. The present translation assumes three things: (1) The preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">min)</font> prefixed to &#8220;assembly&#8221; is causal (the individuals are sorrowing because of the assemblies or festivals they are no longer able to hold). (2) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mas</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et) </font>means &#8220;tribute&#8221; and refers to the exiled people being treated as the spoils of warfare (see R. D. Patterson, <i>Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah </i>[WEC], 385-86). (3) The third feminine singular suffix refers to personified Jerusalem, which is addressed earlier in the verse (the pronominal suffix in &#8220;from you&#8221; is second feminine singular). For other interpretive options see Adele Berlin, <i>Zephaniah </i>(AB 25A), 146.</p>
<A NAME="352"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=168><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;sheep&#8221; is supplied for clarification. As in Mic 4:6-7, the exiles are here pictured as injured and scattered sheep whom the divine shepherd rescues from danger. </p>
<A NAME="353"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=169><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will make them into praise and a name, in all the earth, their shame.&#8221; The present translation assumes that &#8220;their shame&#8221; specifies &#8220;them&#8221; and that &#8220;name&#8221; stands here for a good reputation.</p>
<A NAME="354"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=170><b>tn</b> In this line the second person pronoun is masculine plural, indicating that the exiles are addressed.</p>
<A NAME="355"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=171><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;for.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="356"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=172><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;I will make you into a name and praise among all the peoples of the earth.&#8221; Here the word &#8220;name&#8221; carries the nuance of &#8220;good reputation.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="357"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=173><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;when I restore your fortunes to your eyes.&#8221; See the note on the phrase &#8220;restore them&#8221; in 2:7.</p>
