<A NAME="349"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=165><b>tc</b> The MT reads, &#8220;he is silent in his love,&#8221; but this makes no sense in light of the immediately preceding and following lines. Some take the Hiphil verb form as causative (see Job 11:3) rather than intransitive and translate, &#8220;he causes [you] to be silent by his love,&#8221; that is, &#8220;he soothes [you] by his love.&#8221; The present translation follows the LXX and assumes an original reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿkhaddesh</font>, &#8220;he renews&#8221;) with ellipsis of the object (&#8220;you&#8221;).</p>
