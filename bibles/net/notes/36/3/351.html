<A NAME="351"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=167><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The ones grieving from an assembly I gathered from you they were, tribute upon her, a reproach.&#8221; Any translation of this difficult verse must be provisional at best. The present translation assumes three things: (1) The preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">min)</font> prefixed to &#8220;assembly&#8221; is causal (the individuals are sorrowing because of the assemblies or festivals they are no longer able to hold). (2) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mas</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et) </font>means &#8220;tribute&#8221; and refers to the exiled people being treated as the spoils of warfare (see R. D. Patterson, <i>Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah </i>[WEC], 385-86). (3) The third feminine singular suffix refers to personified Jerusalem, which is addressed earlier in the verse (the pronominal suffix in &#8220;from you&#8221; is second feminine singular). For other interpretive options see Adele Berlin, <i>Zephaniah </i>(AB 25A), 146.</p>
