<A NAME="328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=144><b>tn</b> The second person verb form (&#8220;you must wait patiently&#8221;) is masculine plural, indicating that a group is being addressed. Perhaps the humble individuals addressed earlier (see 2:3) are in view. Because of Jerusalem&#8217;s sin, they must patiently wait for judgment to pass before their vindication arrives.</p>
