<A NAME="416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=79><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#959;&#953;&#956;&#940;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">koimaw</font>) literally means &#8220;sleep,&#8221; but it is often used in the Bible as a euphemism for death when speaking of believers. This metaphorical usage by its very nature emphasizes the hope of resurrection: Believers will one day &#8220;wake up&#8221; out of death. Here the term refers to death, but &#8220;sleep&#8221; was used in the translation to emphasize the metaphorical, rhetorical usage of the term. This word also occurs in vv. 14 and 15. </p>
