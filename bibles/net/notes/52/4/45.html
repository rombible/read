<A NAME="45"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=68><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;to gain [or possess] his own vessel.&#8221; &#8220;Vessel&#8221; is most likely used figuratively for &#8220;body&#8221; (cf. 2 Cor 4:7). Some take it to mean &#8220;wife&#8221; (thus, &#8220;to take a wife for himself&#8221; or &#8220;to live with his wife&#8221;), but this is less likely. See J. Smith, &#8220;1 Thess 4:4 &#8211; Breaking the Impasse,&#8221; <i>BBR</i> 10 (Fall 2000), who argues that &#8220;vessel&#8221; in this context is very likely a euphemism for the sexual organs.</p>
