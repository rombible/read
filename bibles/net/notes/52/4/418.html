<A NAME="418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=81><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;those who have fallen asleep through Jesus.&#8221; It is possible that &#8220;through Jesus&#8221; describes &#8220;bring,&#8221; but this gives the unlikely double reference, &#8220;through Jesus God will bring them with Jesus.&#8221; Instead it describes their &#8220;falling sleep,&#8221; since through him their death is only sleep and not the threat it once was. Also Christians are those whose total existence &#8211; life and death &#8211; is in and through and for Christ (1 Cor 8:6).</p>
