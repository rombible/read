<A NAME="51"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=87><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;concerning the times and the seasons,&#8221; a reference to future periods of eschatological fulfillment (cf. Acts 1:7). </p>

<A NAME="53"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=89><b>sn</b> The<i> day of the Lord</i> is the period of time in the future when the Lord will intervene in the events of this earth to consummate his redemption and his judgment (Isa 2:11-12; 13:6-13; Ezek 30:3; Joel 1:15; 2:32; 3:18; Amos 5:18-20; Obad 15-17; Zeph 1:7-18; 2:2-3; Zech 14:1, 13, 20-21; Mal 4:1, 5; 1 Cor 1:8; 5:5; 2 Cor 1:14; 2 Thess 2:2; 2 Pet 3:10). It includes both blessings and curses, though the latter is emphasized here.</p>
<A NAME="54"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=90><b>sn</b> Jesus used a <i>thief</i> coming at <i>night</i> as an illustration of the unexpected and hostile nature of the coming of God&#8217;s judgment in the future. This is repeated in various ways in v. 4; 2 Pet 3:10; Rev 3:3; 16:15.</p>
<A NAME="55"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=91><b>tc</b> &#8225; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>, &#8220;now&#8221;) is found in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2 </sup>B D 0226 6 1505 1739 1881 <i>al</i>, but lacking in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* A F G 33 it. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#940;&#961;</font> (<font face="Greektl">gar</font>, &#8220;for&#8221;) is the reading of the Byzantine text and a few other witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 0278 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>). Although normally the shorter reading is to be preferred, the external evidence is superior for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (being found in the somewhat better Alexandrian and Western witnesses). What, then, is to explain the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#940;&#961;</font>? Scribes were prone to replace <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#940;&#961;</font>, especially in sentences suggesting a causal or explanatory idea, thus making the point more explicit. Internally, the omission of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> looks unintentional, a case of homoioarcton (<font face="Greek Uncials">otandelegwsin</font>). Although a decision is difficult, in this instance <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> has the best credentials for authenticity.</p>
<A NAME="56"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=92><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;peace and security,&#8221; with &#8220;there is&#8221; understood in the Greek construction.</p>

<A NAME="510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=96><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;hope of salvation&#8221; (&#8220;a helmet&#8230;for salvation&#8221; is an allusion to Isa 59:17).</p>
<A NAME="511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=97><b>sn</b> <i>God did not destine us for wrath. </i>In context this refers to the outpouring of God&#8217;s <i>wrath</i> on the earth in the day of the Lord (1 Thess 5:2-4).</p>
<A NAME="512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=98><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the one who died,&#8221; describing Jesus Christ (1 Thess 5:9). Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started at the beginning of v. 10 in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=99><b>sn</b> The phrases<i> alert or asleep</i> may be understood (1) of moral alertness (living in faith, love, and hope as vv. 6, 8 call for, versus being unresponsive to God) or (2) of physical life and death (whether alive or dead). The first fits better with the context of 5:1-9, while the second returns to the point Paul started with in 4:13-18 (no disadvantage for the believing dead).</p>
<A NAME="514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=100><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;brothers.&#8221; See note on the phrase &#8220;brothers and sisters&#8221; in 1:4.</p>

<A NAME="520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=106><b>tc</b> Most witnesses, including some important ones (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> A <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> [33] 1739 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> ar vg sy bo), read &#8220;holy&#8221; before &#8220;brothers [and sisters]&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#947;&#943;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#7936;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jagioi&quot; adelfoi&quot;</font>). It is possible that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#947;&#943;&#959;&#953;&#962;</font> dropped out by way of homoioteleuton (in uncial script the words would be written <font face="Greek Uncials">agioisadelfois</font>), but it is equally possible that the adjective was added because of the influence of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#947;&#943;&#8179;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jagiw</font>) in v. 26. Another internal consideration is that the expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7941;&#947;&#953;&#959;&#953; &#7936;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#959;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">{agioi adelfoi</font>, &#8220;holy brothers&#8221;) is not found elsewhere in the <i>corpus Paulinum</i>, though Col 1:2 comes close. But this fact could be argued either way: It may suggest that such an expression is not Pauline; on the other hand, the unusualness of the expression could have resulted in an alteration by some scribes. At the same time, since 1 Thessalonians is one of the earliest of Paul&#8217;s letters, and written well before he addresses Christians as <i>saints</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7941;&#947;&#953;&#959;&#953;</font>) in 1 Corinthians for the first time, one might argue that Paul&#8217;s own forms of expression were going through something of a metamorphosis. Scribes insensitive to this fact could well impute later Pauline collocations onto his earlier letters. The internal evidence seems to support, albeit slightly, the omission of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#947;&#943;&#959;&#953;&#962;</font> here. Externally, most of the better witnesses of the Alexandrian and Western texts (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* B D F G 0278 it sa) combine in having the shorter reading. Although the rating of &#8220;A&#8221; in UBS<sup>4</sup> for the omission seems too generous, this reading is still to be preferred.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;brothers.&#8221; See note on the phrase &#8220;brothers and sisters&#8221; in 1:4.</p>
<A NAME="521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=107><b>tc</b> Most witnesses, including a few important ones (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A D<sup>1</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 1739<sup>c</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> lat sy bo), conclude this letter with &#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">amhn</font>, &#8220;amen&#8221;). Such a conclusion is routinely added by scribes to NT books because a few of these books originally had such an ending (cf. Rom 16:27; Gal 6:18; Jude 25). A majority of Greek witnesses have the concluding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> in every NT book except Acts, James, and 3 John (and even in these books, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> is found in some witnesses). It is thus a predictable variant. Further, the witnesses for the omission are sufficiently early and diffuse (B D* F G 0278 6 33 1739* 1881 it sa) to render the verdict against the particle here. </p>
