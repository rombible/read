A decision is difficult, but in light of Paul&#8217;s habit of adding the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> to his notes of praise, even in the middle of his letters (cf. Rom 9:5; 11:36; 15:33; Gal 1:5), one might expect scribes to emulate this practice. Although a decision is difficult, it is probably best to follow the shorter reading. NA<sup>27</sup> has the particle in brackets, indicating some doubts as to its authenticity.</p>
