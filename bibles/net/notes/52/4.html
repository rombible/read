<A NAME="41"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=64><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;brothers.&#8221; See note on the phrase &#8220;brothers and sisters&#8221; in 1:4.</p>
<A NAME="42"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=65><b>sn</b> <i>As you received instruction from us about how </i>(<i>Grk</i> &#8220;as you received from us how&#8221;). The Greek word translated <i>received</i> is used for accepting instructions passed on as fixed traditions from teacher to follower. Paul speaks in these terms about doctrinal traditions as well as ethical instruction that he passes on to his converts and expects them to keep (cf. 1 Cor 11:2, 23; 15:1-3; Gal 1:9; Phil 4:9; 2 Thess 2:15; 3:6).</p>
<A NAME="43"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=66><b>tc</b> This parenthetical clause is absent in several later witnesses (D<sup>2</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>), but it may have been expunged for sounding redundant. The longer text, in this instance, is solidly supported by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A B D* F G 0183<sup>vid</sup> 0278 33 81 104 326 365 629 <i>al</i> co and should be unquestionably preferred.</p>
<A NAME="44"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=67><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;your sanctification.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="45"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=68><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;to gain [or possess] his own vessel.&#8221; &#8220;Vessel&#8221; is most likely used figuratively for &#8220;body&#8221; (cf. 2 Cor 4:7). Some take it to mean &#8220;wife&#8221; (thus, &#8220;to take a wife for himself&#8221; or &#8220;to live with his wife&#8221;), but this is less likely. See J. Smith, &#8220;1 Thess 4:4 &#8211; Breaking the Impasse,&#8221; <i>BBR</i> 10 (Fall 2000), who argues that &#8220;vessel&#8221; in this context is very likely a euphemism for the sexual organs.</p>
<A NAME="46"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=69><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;not to transgress against or defraud his brother in the matter,&#8221; continuing the sentence of vv. 3-5.</p>
<A NAME="47"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=70><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;concerning all these things.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="48"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=71><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;rejecting man.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="49"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=72><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;concerning brotherly love.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=73><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;brothers&#8221;; this applies to the second occurrence as well. See note on the phrase &#8220;brothers and sisters&#8221; in 1:4.</p>
<A NAME="411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=74><b>sn</b> To do so more and more. See 1 Thess 4:1.</p>
<A NAME="412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=75><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;that you may live,&#8221; continuing the sentence of 4:10b-11.</p>
<A NAME="413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=76><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;not be dependent on anyone&#8221;; <i>Grk</i> &#8220;and have need of nothing,&#8221; &#8220;of no one.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=77><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;ignorant.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=78><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;brothers.&#8221; See note on the phrase &#8220;brothers and sisters&#8221; in 1:4.</p>
<A NAME="416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=79><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#959;&#953;&#956;&#940;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">koimaw</font>) literally means &#8220;sleep,&#8221; but it is often used in the Bible as a euphemism for death when speaking of believers. This metaphorical usage by its very nature emphasizes the hope of resurrection: Believers will one day &#8220;wake up&#8221; out of death. Here the term refers to death, but &#8220;sleep&#8221; was used in the translation to emphasize the metaphorical, rhetorical usage of the term. This word also occurs in vv. 14 and 15. </p>
<A NAME="417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=80><b>tn</b> &#8220;we believe that&#8221; is understood from the first clause of the verse, which is parallel. <i>Grk</i> &#8220;so also God will bring.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=81><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;those who have fallen asleep through Jesus.&#8221; It is possible that &#8220;through Jesus&#8221; describes &#8220;bring,&#8221; but this gives the unlikely double reference, &#8220;through Jesus God will bring them with Jesus.&#8221; Instead it describes their &#8220;falling sleep,&#8221; since through him their death is only sleep and not the threat it once was. Also Christians are those whose total existence &#8211; life and death &#8211; is in and through and for Christ (1 Cor 8:6).</p>
<A NAME="419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=82><b>sn</b> <i>The word of the Lord </i>is a technical expression in OT literature, often referring to a divine prophetic utterance (e.g., Gen 15:1, Isa 1:10, Jonah 1:1). In the NT it occurs 15 times: 3 times as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8165;&#8134;&#956;&#945; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#954;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">rJhma tou kuriou</font>; Luke 22:61, Acts 11:16, 1 Pet 1:25) and 12 times as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#954;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">logo&quot; tou kuriou</font>; here and in Acts 8:25; 13:44, 48, 49; 15:35, 36; 16:32; 19:10, 20; 1 Thess 1:8; 2 Thess 3:1). As in the OT, this phrase focuses on the prophetic nature and divine origin of what has been said.</p>
<A NAME="420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=83><b>tn</b> Neither noun in this phrase (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#966;&#969;&#957;&#8135; &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#941;&#955;&#959;&#965;</font>, <font face="Greektl">ejn fwnh ajrcangelou</font>, &#8220;with the voice of the archangel&#8221;) has the article in keeping with Apollonius&#8217; Canon. Since <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#940;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ajrcangelo&quot;</font>) is most likely monadic, both nouns are translated as definite in keeping with Apollonius&#8217; Corollary (see <i>ExSyn</i> 250-51).</p>
<A NAME="421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=84><b>tc</b> The words <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#7985; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#960;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joi perileipomenoi</font>, &#8220;[the ones] who are left&#8221;) are lacking in F G {0226<sup>vid</sup>} ar b as well as a few fathers, but the rest of the textual tradition has the words. Most likely, the Western <sc>mss omitted the words because of perceived redundancy with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#7985; &#950;&#8182;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joi zwnte&quot;</font>, &#8220;[the ones] who are alive&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=85><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;snatched up.&#8221; The Greek verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#961;&#960;&#940;&#950;&#969;</font> implies that the action is quick or forceful, so the translation supplied the adverb &#8220;suddenly&#8221; to make this implicit notion clear.</p>
<A NAME="423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=86><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;simultaneously,&#8221; but this meaning does not fit as well in the parallel in 5:10.</p>
