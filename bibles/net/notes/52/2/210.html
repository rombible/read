<A NAME="210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=30><b>tc</b> The variant <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7972;&#960;&#953;&#959;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">hpioi</font>, &#8220;gentle&#8221;) has fair support (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2 </sup>A C<sup>2 </sup>D<sup>2 </sup><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font><sup>c </sup>0278 33 1739 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>), but <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#957;&#8053;&#960;&#953;&#959;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">nhpioi</font>, &#8220;little children&#8221;) has significantly stronger backing (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>65</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* B C* D* F G I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font>* <i>pc </i>it bo). It is not insignificant that the earliest Alexandrian and Western witnesses in support of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7972;&#960;&#953;&#959;&#953;</font> are actually not Alexandrian or Western; they are the <i>second</i> correctors of Alexandrian and Western <sc>mss. Such correctors generally follow a Byzantine <i>Vorlage</i>. The reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#957;&#8053;&#960;&#953;&#959;&#953;</font> is thus superior externally. Further, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#957;&#8053;&#960;&#953;&#959;&#953;</font> is much harder in this context, for Paul mixes his metaphors (&#8220;we became little children in your midst&#8230;Like a nursing mother&#8230;&#8221;). Thus, the scribes would naturally alter this reading to the softer <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7972;&#960;&#953;&#959;&#953;</font> (&#8220;we became gentle&#8230;&#8221;). Paul is not known for his consistency of figures, however (cf., e.g., Gal 4:19); hence, the intrinsic evidence points to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#957;&#8053;&#960;&#953;&#959;&#953;</font> as original. On the other hand, it is possible that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#957;&#8053;&#960;&#953;&#959;&#953;</font> was caused by dittography with the preceding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">-&#956;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">-men</font>). It is even possible that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#957;&#8053;&#960;&#953;&#959;&#953;</font> was caused by an error of hearing right from the beginning: The amanuensis could have heard the apostle incorrectly. But such a supposition cuts both ways; further, Paul would no doubt have corrected the reading in the ms before it was sent out. If so, one would surely have expected both earlier witnesses on the side of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7972;&#960;&#953;&#959;&#953;</font> and perhaps a few first correctors to have this reading. The reading &#8220;little children&#8221; thus stands as most probably original. (For an extended discussion of this problem, see J. A. D. Weima, &#8220;&#8216;But We Became Infants Among You&#8217;: The Case for NHPIOI in 1 Thess 2.7,&#8221; <i>NTS</i> 46 [2000]: 547-64; T. B.
