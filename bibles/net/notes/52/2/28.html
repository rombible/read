<A NAME="28"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=28><b>tn</b> Punctuating vv. 6 and 7 is difficult. One must consider the difficult textual problem of v. 7 (see <b>tc</b> note on the word &#8220;children&#8221; in that verse) as well as the grammar of the verse. In the translation above, &#8220;little children&#8221; is understood to be a predicate nominative connected to the verb &#8220;became.&#8221; This allows a full stop to be placed at the end of v. 6 and before the phrase &#8220;like a nursing mother&#8221; in v. 7. This separates the two metaphors which impact the textual problem and allows for greater clarity in the way the sentence is read.</p>
