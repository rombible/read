<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2><b>map</b> For the location of Thessalonica see JP1-C1; JP2-C1; JP3-C1; JP4-C1.</p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3><b>tc</b> The majority of witnesses, including several early and important ones (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A [D] I 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> bo), have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166; &#960;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#7969;&#956;&#8182;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#954;&#965;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#8166; &#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">apo qeou patro&quot; Jhmwn kai kuriou Ihsou Cristou</font>, &#8220;from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ&#8221;) at the end of v. 1. The more abrupt reading (&#8220;Grace and peace to you&#8221;) without this addition is supported by B F G <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 0278 629 1739 1881 <i>pc </i>lat sa. Apart from a desire to omit the redundancy of the mention of God and Christ in this verse, there is no good reason why scribes would have omitted the characteristically Pauline greeting. (Further, if this were the case, why did these same scribes overlook such an opportunity in 2 Thess 1:1-2?) On the other hand, since 1 Thessalonians is one of Paul&#8217;s earliest letters, what would become characteristic of his greetings seems to have been still in embryonic form (e.g., he does not yet call his audience &#8220;saints&#8221; [which will first be used in his address to the Corinthians], nor does he use <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en</font>) plus the dative to refer to the location of the church). Thus, the internal evidence is overwhelming in support of the shorter reading, for scribes would have been strongly motivated to rework this salutation in light of Paul&#8217;s style elsewhere. And the external evidence, though not overwhelming, is supportive of this shorter reading, found as it is in some of the best witnesses of the Alexandrian and Western texttypes.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Grace to you and peace.&#8221; </p>

With <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#956;&#8118;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jumas</font>, &#8220;you&#8221;) immediately preceding, the plural form looks motivated: Scribes would be expected to change the singular to the plural here. Although the external evidence for the singular reading is not overwhelming, the internal evidence for it is compelling. </p>
<a name="116"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=16><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the word of the Lord.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> &#8220;The word of the Lord&#8221; is a technical expression in OT literature, often referring to a divine prophetic utterance (e.g., Gen 15:1, Isa 1:10, Jonah 1:1). In the NT it occurs 15 times: 3 times as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8165;&#8134;&#956;&#945; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#954;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">rJhma tou kuriou</font>; Luke 22:61, Acts 11:16, 1 Pet 1:25) and 12 times as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#954;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">logo&quot; tou kuriou</font>; here and in Acts 8:25; 13:44, 48, 49; 15:35, 36; 16:32; 19:10, 20; 1 Thess 4:15; 2 Thess 3:1). As in the OT, this phrase focuses on the prophetic nature and divine origin of what has been said. Here the phrase has been translated &#8220;the message of the Lord&#8221; because of the focus upon the spread of the gospel evident in the passage.</p>
