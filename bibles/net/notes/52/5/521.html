<A NAME="521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=107><b>tc</b> Most witnesses, including a few important ones (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A D<sup>1</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 1739<sup>c</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> lat sy bo), conclude this letter with &#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">amhn</font>, &#8220;amen&#8221;). Such a conclusion is routinely added by scribes to NT books because a few of these books originally had such an ending (cf. Rom 16:27; Gal 6:18; Jude 25). A majority of Greek witnesses have the concluding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> in every NT book except Acts, James, and 3 John (and even in these books, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> is found in some witnesses). It is thus a predictable variant. Further, the witnesses for the omission are sufficiently early and diffuse (B D* F G 0278 6 33 1739* 1881 it sa) to render the verdict against the particle here. </p>
