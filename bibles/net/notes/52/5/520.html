It is possible that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#947;&#943;&#959;&#953;&#962;</font> dropped out by way of homoioteleuton (in uncial script the words would be written <font face="Greek Uncials">agioisadelfois</font>), but it is equally possible that the adjective was added because of the influence of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#947;&#943;&#8179;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jagiw</font>) in v. 26. Another internal consideration is that the expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7941;&#947;&#953;&#959;&#953; &#7936;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#959;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">{agioi adelfoi</font>, &#8220;holy brothers&#8221;) is not found elsewhere in the <i>corpus Paulinum</i>, though Col 1:2 comes close. But this fact could be argued either way: It may suggest that such an expression is not Pauline; on the other hand, the unusualness of the expression could have resulted in an alteration by some scribes. At the same time, since 1 Thessalonians is one of the earliest of Paul&#8217;s letters, and written well before he addresses Christians as <i>saints</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7941;&#947;&#953;&#959;&#953;</font>) in 1 Corinthians for the first time, one might argue that Paul&#8217;s own forms of expression were going through something of a metamorphosis. Scribes insensitive to this fact could well impute later Pauline collocations onto his earlier letters. The internal evidence seems to support, albeit slightly, the omission of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#947;&#943;&#959;&#953;&#962;</font> here. Externally, most of the better witnesses of the Alexandrian and Western texts (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* B D F G 0278 it sa) combine in having the shorter reading. Although the rating of &#8220;A&#8221; in UBS<sup>4</sup> for the omission seems too generous, this reading is still to be preferred.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;brothers.&#8221; See note on the phrase &#8220;brothers and sisters&#8221; in 1:4.</p>
