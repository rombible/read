<A NAME="21"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=21><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;brothers.&#8221; See note on the phrase &#8220;brothers and sisters&#8221; in 1:4.</p>
<A NAME="22"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=22><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;has not become empty.&#8221; Paul is defending himself against the charge that he lacked earnestness and personal concern for them, but appeared in their city out of greed or egotism. In his defense he appeals to what they recall of his ministry and what has become of it since he left, all of which demonstrates his God-given earnestness and effectiveness.</p>
<A NAME="23"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=23><b>map</b> For location see JP1-C1; JP2-C1; JP3-C1; JP4-C1.</p>
<A NAME="24"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=24><b>tn</b> The genitive in the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8056; &#949;&#8016;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#941;&#955;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">to euangelion tou qeou</font>, &#8220;the gospel of God&#8221;) could be translated as either a subjective genitive (&#8220;the gospel which God brings&#8221;) or an objective genitive (&#8220;the gospel about God&#8221;). Either is grammatically possible. This is possibly an instance of a plenary genitive (see <i>ExSyn</i> 119-21; M. Zerwick, <i>Biblical Greek</i>, §§36-39). If so, an interplay between the two concepts is intended: The gospel which God brings is in fact the gospel about himself. This same phrase occurs in vv. 8 and 9 as well.</p>
<A NAME="25"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=25><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;For our exhortation.&#8221; Paul here uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#940;&#954;&#955;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">paraklhsis</font>) to speak in broad terms about his preaching of the gospel, in which he urges or appeals to people to respond to God&#8217;s salvation (cf. the verb form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#8166;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font> [<font face="Greektl">parakalounto&quot;</font>] in 2 Cor 5:20).</p>
<A NAME="26"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=26><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;[is] not&#8221; (the verb &#8220;to be&#8221; is implied in the Greek construction).</p>
<A NAME="27"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=27><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;came on the scene,&#8221; &#8220;came.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="28"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=28><b>tn</b> Punctuating vv. 6 and 7 is difficult. One must consider the difficult textual problem of v. 7 (see <b>tc</b> note on the word &#8220;children&#8221; in that verse) as well as the grammar of the verse. In the translation above, &#8220;little children&#8221; is understood to be a predicate nominative connected to the verb &#8220;became.&#8221; This allows a full stop to be placed at the end of v. 6 and before the phrase &#8220;like a nursing mother&#8221; in v. 7. This separates the two metaphors which impact the textual problem and allows for greater clarity in the way the sentence is read.</p>
<A NAME="29"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=29><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;were,&#8221; &#8220;proved to be.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=30><b>tc</b> The variant <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7972;&#960;&#953;&#959;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">hpioi</font>, &#8220;gentle&#8221;) has fair support (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2 </sup>A C<sup>2 </sup>D<sup>2 </sup><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font><sup>c </sup>0278 33 1739 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>), but <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#957;&#8053;&#960;&#953;&#959;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">nhpioi</font>, &#8220;little children&#8221;) has significantly stronger backing (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>65</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* B C* D* F G I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font>* <i>pc </i>it bo). It is not insignificant that the earliest Alexandrian and Western witnesses in support of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7972;&#960;&#953;&#959;&#953;</font> are actually not Alexandrian or Western; they are the <i>second</i> correctors of Alexandrian and Western <sc>mss. Such correctors generally follow a Byzantine <i>Vorlage</i>. The reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#957;&#8053;&#960;&#953;&#959;&#953;</font> is thus superior externally. Further, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#957;&#8053;&#960;&#953;&#959;&#953;</font> is much harder in this context, for Paul mixes his metaphors (&#8220;we became little children in your midst&#8230;Like a nursing mother&#8230;&#8221;). Thus, the scribes would naturally alter this reading to the softer <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7972;&#960;&#953;&#959;&#953;</font> (&#8220;we became gentle&#8230;&#8221;). Paul is not known for his consistency of figures, however (cf., e.g., Gal 4:19); hence, the intrinsic evidence points to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#957;&#8053;&#960;&#953;&#959;&#953;</font> as original. On the other hand, it is possible that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#957;&#8053;&#960;&#953;&#959;&#953;</font> was caused by dittography with the preceding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">-&#956;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">-men</font>). It is even possible that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#957;&#8053;&#960;&#953;&#959;&#953;</font> was caused by an error of hearing right from the beginning: The amanuensis could have heard the apostle incorrectly. But such a supposition cuts both ways; further, Paul would no doubt have corrected the reading in the ms before it was sent out. If so, one would surely have expected both earlier witnesses on the side of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7972;&#960;&#953;&#959;&#953;</font> and perhaps a few first correctors to have this reading. The reading &#8220;little children&#8221; thus stands as most probably original. (For an extended discussion of this problem, see J. A. D. Weima, &#8220;&#8216;But We Became Infants Among You&#8217;: The Case for NHPIOI in 1 Thess 2.7,&#8221; <i>NTS</i> 46 [2000]: 547-64; T. B. Sailors, &#8220;Wedding Textual and Rhetorical Criticism to Understand the Text of 1 Thessalonians 2.7,&#8221; <i>JSNT</i> 80 [2000]: 81-98.)</p>

<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=32><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;we are happy.&#8221; This verb may be past or present tense, but the context favors the past.</p>

<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=34><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;for this reason,&#8221; which seems to look back to Paul&#8217;s behavior just described. But it may look forward to v. 13b and mean: &#8220;and here is another reason that we constantly thank God: that&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=35><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;God&#8217;s word of hearing from us.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=36><b>tn</b> Paul&#8217;s focus is their attitude toward the message he preached: They received it not as a human message but a message from God.</p>

This is obviously a secondary reading. Marcion&#8217;s influence may stand behind part of the tradition, but the Byzantine text probably added the adjective in light of its mention in v. 14 and as a clarification or interpretation of which prophets were in view.</p>
<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=39><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;and drove us out&#8221; (cf. Acts 17:5-10).</p>

<A NAME="228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=48><b>sn</b> <i>Crown to boast of </i>(<i>Grk</i> &#8220;crown of boasting&#8221;).
