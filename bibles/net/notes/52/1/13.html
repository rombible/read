Apart from a desire to omit the redundancy of the mention of God and Christ in this verse, there is no good reason why scribes would have omitted the characteristically Pauline greeting. (Further, if this were the case, why did these same scribes overlook such an opportunity in 2 Thess 1:1-2?) On the other hand, since 1 Thessalonians is one of Paul&#8217;s earliest letters, what would become characteristic of his greetings seems to have been still in embryonic form (e.g., he does not yet call his audience &#8220;saints&#8221; [which will first be used in his address to the Corinthians], nor does he use <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en</font>) plus the dative to refer to the location of the church). Thus, the internal evidence is overwhelming in support of the shorter reading, for scribes would have been strongly motivated to rework this salutation in light of Paul&#8217;s style elsewhere. And the external evidence, though not overwhelming, is supportive of this shorter reading, found as it is in some of the best witnesses of the Alexandrian and Western texttypes.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Grace to you and peace.&#8221; </p>
