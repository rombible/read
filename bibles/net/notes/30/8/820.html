<A NAME="820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=369><b>sn</b> In an oath one appeals to something permanent to emphasize one&#8217;s commitment to the promise. Here the <sc>Lord sarcastically swears by <i>the arrogance of Jacob</i>, which he earlier had condemned (6:8), something just as enduring as the <sc>Lord&#8217;s own life (see 6:8) or unchanging character (see 4:2). Other suggestions include that the Lord is swearing by the land, his most valuable possession (cf. Isa 4:2; Ps 47:4 [47:5 HT]); that this is a divine epithet analogous to &#8220;the Glory of Israel&#8221; (1 Sam 15:29); or that an ellipsis should be understood here, in which case the meaning is the same as that of 6:8 (&#8220;The Lord has sworn [by himself] against the arrogance of Jacob&#8221;).</p>
