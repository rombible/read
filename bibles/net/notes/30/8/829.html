<A NAME="829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=378><b>tn</b> The entire verse is phrased in a series of rhetorical questions which anticipate the answer, &#8220;Of course!&#8221; (For example, the first line reads, &#8220;Because of this will the earth not quake?&#8221;). The rhetorical questions entrap the listener in the logic of the judgment of God (cf. 3:3-6; 9:7). The rhetorical questions have been converted to affirmative statements in the translation for clarity.</p>
