<A NAME="851"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=400><b>tc</b> The MT reads, &#8220;As surely as the way [to] Beer Sheba lives,&#8221; or &#8220;As surely as the way lives, O Beer Sheba.&#8221; Perhaps the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">derekh</font>, &#8220;the way&#8221;) refers to the pilgrimage route to Beersheba (see S. M. Paul, <i>Amos </i>[Hermeneia], 272) or it may be a title for a god. The notion of pilgrimage appears elsewhere in the book (cf. 4:4-5; 5:4-5; 8:12). The translation above assumes an emendation to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1465;&#1491;&#1456;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dodÿkh</font>, &#8220;your beloved&#8221; or &#8220;relative&#8221;; the term also is used in 6:10) and understands this as referring either to the Lord (since other kinship terms are used of him, such as &#8220;Father&#8221;) or to another deity that was particularly popular in Beer Sheba. Besides the commentaries, see S. M. Olyan, &#8220;The Oaths of Amos 8:14&#8221; <i>Priesthood and Cult in Ancient Israel</i>, 121-49.</p>
