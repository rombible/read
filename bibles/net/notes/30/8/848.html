<A NAME="848"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=397><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the sin [or &#8220;guilt&#8221;] of Samaria.&#8221; This could be a derogatory reference to an idol-goddess popular in the northern kingdom, perhaps Asherah (cf. 2 Chr 24:18, where this worship is labeled &#8220;their guilt&#8221;), or to the golden calf at the national sanctuary in Bethel (Hos 8:6, 10:8). Some English versions (e.g., NEB, NRSV, CEV) repoint the word and read &#8220;Ashimah,&#8221; the name of a goddess worshiped in Hamath in Syria (see 2 Kgs 17:30).</p>
