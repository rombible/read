<A NAME="911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=411><b>sn</b> If the article indicates a definite serpent, then the mythological <i>Sea Serpent</i>, symbolic of the world&#8217;s chaotic forces, is probably in view. See Job 26:13 and Isa 27:1 (where it is also called Leviathan). Elsewhere in the OT this serpent is depicted as opposing the <sc>Lord, but this text implies that even this powerful enemy of God is ultimately subject to his sovereign will.</p>
