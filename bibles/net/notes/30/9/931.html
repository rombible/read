<A NAME="931"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=431><b>tn</b> The phrase translated &#8220;collapsing hut&#8221; refers to a temporary shelter (cf. NASB, NRSV &#8220;booth&#8221;) in disrepair and emphasizes the relatively weakened condition of the once powerful Davidic dynasty. Others have suggested that the term refers to Jerusalem, while still others argue that it should be repointed to read &#8220;Sukkoth,&#8221; a garrison town in Transjordan.
