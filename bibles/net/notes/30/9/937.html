<A NAME="937"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=437><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;nations over whom my name is proclaimed.&#8221; The Hebrew idiom indicates ownership, sometimes as a result of conquest. See 2 Sam 12:28.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This verse envisions a new era of Israelite rule, perhaps patterned after David&#8217;s imperialistic successes (see 2 Sam 8-10). At the same time, however, the verse does not specify how this rule is to be accomplished. Note that the book ends with a description of peace and abundance, and its final reference to God (v. 15) does not include the epithet &#8220;the Lord who commands armies,&#8221; which has militaristic overtones. This is quite a different scene than what the book began with: nations at war and standing under the judgment of God.</p>
