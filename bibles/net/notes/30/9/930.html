<A NAME="930"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=430><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;like being shaken with a sieve, and a pebble does not fall to the ground.&#8221; The meaning of the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsÿror</font>), translated &#8220;pebble,&#8221; is unclear here. In 2 Sam 17:13 it appears to refer to a stone. If it means &#8220;pebble,&#8221; then the sieve described in v. 6 allows the grain to fall into a basket while retaining the debris and pebbles. However, if one interprets <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font> as a &#8220;kernel of grain&#8221; (cf. NASB, NIV, NKJV, NLT) then the sieve is constructed to retain the grain and allow the refuse and pebbles to fall to the ground. In either case, the simile supports the last statement in v. 8 by making it clear that God will distinguish between the righteous (the grain) and the wicked (the pebbles) when he judges, and will thereby preserve a remnant in Israel. Only the sinners will be destroyed (v. 10).</p>
