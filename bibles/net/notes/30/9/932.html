<A NAME="932"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=432><b>tc</b> The MT reads a third feminine plural suffix, which could refer to the two kingdoms (Judah and Israel) or, more literally, to the breaches in the walls of the cities that are mentioned in v. 4 (cf. 4:3). Some emend to third feminine singular, since the &#8220;hut&#8221; of the preceding line (a feminine singular noun) might be the antecedent. In that case, the final <i>nun</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1503;</font>) is virtually dittographic with the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) that appears at the beginning of the following word.</p>
