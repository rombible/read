<A NAME="940"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=440><b>sn</b> <i>The plowman will catch up to the reaper</i>. Plowing occurred in October-November, and harvesting in April-May (see P. King, <i>Amos, Hosea, Micah</i>, 109.) But in the future age of restored divine blessing, there will be so many crops the reapers will take all summer to harvest them, and it will be time for plowing again before the harvest is finished.</p>
