In the ancient Near Eastern world familial terms were sometimes used to describe treaty partners. In a treaty between superior and inferior parties, the lord would be called &#8220;father&#8221; and the subject &#8220;son.&#8221; The partners in a treaty between equals referred to themselves as &#8220;brothers.&#8221; For biblical examples, see 1 Kgs 9:13; 20:32-33.</p>
