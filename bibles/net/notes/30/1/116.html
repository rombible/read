<a name="116"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=16><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will not bring it [or &#8220;him&#8221;] back.&#8221; The pronominal object (1) refers to the decree of judgment that follows; the referent (the decree) has been specified in the translation for clarity. See S. M. Paul, <i>Amos</i> (Hermeneia), 46-47. Another option (2) is to understand the suffix as referring to the particular nation mentioned in the oracle and to translate, &#8220;I will not take him [i.e., that particular nation] back.&#8221; In this case the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> makes it clear that he does not intend to resume treaty relations with the nation in view.
