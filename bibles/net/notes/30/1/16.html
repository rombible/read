<a name="16"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=6><b>sn</b> This refers to a well-known earthquake that occurred during the first half of the 8th century <span class="smallcaps">b.c</span>. According to a generally accepted dating system, Uzziah was a co-regent with his father Amaziah from 792-767 <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span> and ruled independently from 767-740 <span class="smallcaps">b.c</span>. Jeroboam II was a co-regent with his father Joash from 793-782 <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span> and ruled independently from 782-753 <span class="smallcaps">b.c</span>. Since only Uzziah and Jeroboam are mentioned in the introduction it is likely that Amos&#8217; mission to Israel and the earthquake which followed occurred between 767-753 <span class="smallcaps">b.c</span>. The introduction validates the genuine character of Amos&#8217; prophetic ministry in at least two ways: (1) Amos was not a native Israelite or a prophet by trade. Rather he was a herdsman in Tekoa, located in Judah. His mere presence in the northern kingdom as a prophet was evidence that he had been called by God (see 7:14-15). (2) The mighty earthquake shortly after Amos&#8217; ministry would have been interpreted as an omen or signal of approaching judgment. The clearest references to an earthquake are 1:1 and 9:1, 5. It is possible that the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hafakh</font>, &#8220;overturn&#8221;) at 3:13-15, 4:11, 6:11, and 8:8 also refers to an earthquake, as might the descriptions at 2:13 and 6:9-10. Evidence of a powerful earthquake has been correlated with a destruction layer at Hazor and other sites. Its lasting impact is evident by its mention in Zech 14:5 and 2 Chr 26:16-21. Earthquake imagery appears in later prophets as well (cf. D. N. Freedman and A. Welch, &#8220;Amos&#8217;s Earthquake and Israelite Prophecy,&#8221; <i>Scripture and Other Artifacts</i>, 188-98). On the other hand, some of these verses in Amos could allude to the devastation that would be caused by the imminent military invasion.</p>
