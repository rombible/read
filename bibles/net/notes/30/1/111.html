<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>tn</b> Lexicographers debate whether there are two roots <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aval</font>), one signifying &#8220;mourn&#8221; and the other &#8220;be dry,&#8221; or simply one (&#8220;mourn&#8221;). The parallel verb (&#8220;withers&#8221;) might favor the first option and have the meaning &#8220;wilt away.&#8221; It is interesting to note, however, that the root appears later in the book in the context of lament (5:16; 8:8, 10; 9:5). Either 1:2 is a possible wordplay to alert the reader to the death that will accompany the judgment (the option of two roots), or perhaps the translation &#8220;mourns&#8221; is appropriate here as well (cf. KJV, NASB, NKJV, NJPS; see also D. J. A. Clines, &#8220;Was There an <i>&#8217;BL</i> II &#8216;Be Dry&#8217; in Classical Hebrew?&#8221; <i>VT</i> 42 [1992]: 1-10).</p>
