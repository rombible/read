Based on the use of a similar formula in wisdom literature (see Prov 30:18-19, 29-31), one expects to find in each case a list of four specific violations. However, only in the eighth oracle (against Israel) does one find the expected fourfold list. Through this adaptation and alteration of the normal pattern the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> indicates that his focus is Israel (he is too bent on judging Israel to dwell very long on her neighbors) and he emphasizes Israel&#8217;s guilt with respect to the other nations. (Israel&#8217;s list fills up before the others&#8217; lists do.) See R. B. Chisholm, &#8220;For Three Sins&#8230;Even for Four: The Numerical Sayings in Amos,&#8221; <i>BSac</i> 147 (1990): 188-97.</p>
