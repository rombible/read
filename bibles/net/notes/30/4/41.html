<A NAME="41"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=160><b>sn</b> The expression <i>cows of Bashan</i> is used by the prophet to address the wealthy women of Samaria, who demand that their husbands satisfy their cravings. The derogatory language perhaps suggests that they, like the livestock of Bashan, were well fed, ironically in preparation for the coming slaughter. This phrase is sometimes cited to critique the book&#8217;s view of women.</p>
