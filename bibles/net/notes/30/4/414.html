<A NAME="414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=173><b>sn</b> <i>Bethel</i> and <i>Gilgal</i> were important formal worship centers because of their importance in Israel&#8217;s history. Here the Lord ironically urges the people to visit these places so they can increase their sin against him. Their formal worship, because it was not accompanied by social justice, only made them more guilty in God&#8217;s sight by adding hypocrisy to their list of sins. Obviously, theirs was a twisted view of the Lord. They worshiped a god of their own creation in order to satisfy their religious impulses (see 4:5: &#8220;For you love to do this&#8221;). Note that none of the rituals listed in 4:4-5 have to do with sin.</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map4-G4; Map5-C1; Map6-E3; Map7-D1; Map8-G3.</p>
