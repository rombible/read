<A NAME="440"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=199><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he who makes dawn, darkness.&#8221; The meaning of the statement is unclear. The present translation assumes that allusion is made to God&#8217;s approaching judgment, when the light of day will be turned to darkness (see 5:20). Other options include: (1) &#8220;He makes the dawn [and] the darkness.&#8221; A few Hebrew <sc>mss, as well as the LXX, add the conjunction (&#8220;and&#8221;) between the two nouns. (2) &#8220;He turns darkness into glimmering dawn&#8221; (NJPS). See S. M. Paul (<i>Amos </i>[Hermeneia], 154), who takes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shakhar</font>) as &#8220;blackness&#8221; rather than &#8220;dawn&#8221; and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1497;&#1508;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">efah</font>) as &#8220;glimmering dawn&#8221; rather than &#8220;darkness.&#8221;</p>
