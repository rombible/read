<A NAME="410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=169><b>tn</b> The meaning of the Hebrew expression translated &#8220;in fishermen&#8217;s pots&#8221; is uncertain. The translation follows that of S. M. Paul (<i>Amos</i> [Hermeneia], 128), who discusses the various options (132-33): &#8220;thorns,&#8221; understood by most modern interpreters to mean (by extension) &#8220;fishhooks&#8221; (cf. NASB, NIV, NRSV); &#8220;boats,&#8221; but as mentioned in the previous note on the word &#8220;baskets,&#8221; a deportation of the Samaritans by boat is geographically unlikely; and &#8220;pots,&#8221; referring to a container used for packing fish (cf. NEB &#8220;fish-baskets&#8221;). Paul (p. 134) argues that the imagery comes from the ancient fishing industry. When hauled away into exile, the women of Samaria will be like fish packed and transported to market.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The imagery of catching fish in connection with the captivity of Israel is also found in Jer 16:16 and Hab 1:14.</p>
