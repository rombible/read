<A NAME="48"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=167><b>tn</b> The meaning of the Hebrew word translated &#8220;baskets&#8221; is uncertain. The translation follows the suggestion of S. M. Paul (<i>Amos</i> [Hermeneia], 128), who discusses the various options (130-32): &#8220;shields&#8221; (cf. NEB); &#8220;ropes&#8221;; &#8220;thorns,&#8221; which leads to the most favored interpretation, &#8220;hooks&#8221; (cf. NASB &#8220;meat hooks&#8221;; NIV, NRSV &#8220;hooks&#8221;); &#8220;baskets,&#8221; and (derived from &#8220;baskets&#8221;) &#8220;boats.&#8221; Against the latter, it is unlikely that Amos envisioned a deportation by boat for the inhabitants of Samaria! See also the note on the expression &#8220;fishermen&#8217;s pots&#8221; later in this verse.</p>
