<A NAME="715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=323><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anakh</font>, &#8220;tin&#8221;) occurs only in this passage (twice in this verse and twice in the following verse). (Its proposed meaning is based on an Akkadian cognate <font face="Scholar">annaku</font>.) The tin wall of the vision, if it symbolizes Israel, may suggest weakness and vulnerability to judgment. See S. M. Paul, <i>Amos </i>(Hermeneia), 233-35. The symbolic significance of God holding tin in his hand and then placing tin among the people is unclear. Possibly the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1498;&#1456;</font> in v. 8b is a homonym meaning &#8220;grief&#8221; (this term is attested in postbiblical Hebrew). In this case there is a wordplay, the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (&#8220;tin&#8221;) of the vision suggesting the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (&#8220;grief&#8221;) that judgment will bring upon the land. See F. I. Andersen and D. N. Freedman, <i>Amos</i> (AB), 759. Another option is to maintain the meaning &#8220;tin&#8221; and understand that the Lord has ripped off a piece of the tin wall and placed it in front of all to see. Their citadels, of which the nation was so proud and confident, are nothing more than tin fortresses. The traditional interpretation of these verses (reflected in many English versions) understands the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1498;&#1456;</font> to mean &#8220;lead,&#8221; and by extension, &#8220;plumb line.&#8221; In this case, one may translate: &#8220;I saw the sovereign one standing by a wall built true to plumb holding a plumb line in his hand. The <sc>Lord said to me, &#8216;What do you see, Amos?&#8217; I said, &#8216;A plumb line.&#8217; The sovereign one then said, &#8216;Look, I am about to place a plumb line among my people&#8230;&#8217;&#8221; According to this view, the plumb line symbolizes God&#8217;s moral standards by which he will measure Israel to see if they are a straight or crooked wall.</p>
