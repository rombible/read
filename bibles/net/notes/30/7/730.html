<A NAME="730"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=338><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I was not a prophet nor was I the son of a prophet.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;son of a prophet&#8221; refers to one who was trained in a prophetic guild. Since there is no equative verb present in the Hebrew text, another option is to translate with the present tense, &#8220;I <i>am</i> not a prophet by profession.&#8221; In this case Amos, though now carrying out a prophetic ministry (v. 15), denies any official or professional prophetic status. Modern English versions are divided about whether to understand the past (JB, NIV, NKJV) or present tense (NASB, NEB, NRSV, NJPS) here.</p>
