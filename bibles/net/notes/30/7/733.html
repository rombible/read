<A NAME="733"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=341><b>sn</b> It is possible that <i>herdsmen</i> agreed to care for <i>sycamore fig trees</i> in exchange for grazing rights. See P. King, <i>Amos, Hosea, Micah</i>, 116-17. Since these trees do not grow around Tekoa but rather in the lowlands, another option is that Amos owned other property outside his hometown. In this case, this verse demonstrates his relative wealth and is his response to Amaziah; he did not depend on prophecy as a profession (v. 13).</p>
