<A NAME="61"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=270><b>tn</b> On the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hoy</font>; &#8220;ah, woe&#8221;) as a term of mourning, see the notes in 5:16, 18.</p>
<A NAME="62"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=271><b>sn</b> <i>Zion</i> is a reference to Jerusalem.</p>
<A NAME="63"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=272><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;They think of themselves as&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarification. In the Hebrew text the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1511;&#1467;&#1489;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nÿquvey</font>; &#8220;distinguished ones, elite&#8221;) is in apposition to the substantival participles in the first line.</p>
<A NAME="64"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=273><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;house.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="65"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=274><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;comes to them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="66"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=275><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;They say to the people&#8221; are interpretive and supplied in the translation for clarification. The translation understands v. 2 as the boastful words, which the leaders (described in v. 1) spoke to those who came to them (v. 1b). Some interpret v. 2 differently, understanding the words as directed <i>to</i> the leaders by the prophet. Verse 2b would then be translated: &#8220;Are <i>you</i> (i.e., Israel and Judah) better than these kingdoms (i.e., Calneh, etc.)? Is your border larger than their border?&#8221; (This reading requires an emendation of the Hebrew text toward the end of the verse.) In this case the verse is a reminder to Judah/Israel that they are <i>not</i> superior to other nations, which have already fallen victim to military conquest. Consequently Judah/Israel should not expect to escape the same fate. Following this line of interpretation, some take v. 2 as a later addition since the Assyrians under Tiglath-pileser III conquered Calneh, Hamath, and Gath after the time of Amos&#8217; ministry. However, this conclusion is not necessary since the kingdoms mentioned here had suffered military setbacks prior to Amos&#8217; time as well. See S. M. Paul, <i>Amos </i>(Hermeneia), 201-4.</p>
<A NAME="67"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=276><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Great Hamath&#8221; (cf. NIV); or &#8220;Hamath the great&#8221; (cf. KJV, NAB, NASB, NRSV); the word &#8220;rabbah&#8221; means &#8220;great&#8221; in Hebrew.</p>
<A NAME="68"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=277><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to these,&#8221; referring to Judah and Israel (see v. 1a).</p>
<A NAME="69"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=278><b>tn</b> Both rhetorical questions in this verse expect the answer &#8220;no.&#8221; If these words do come from the leaders, then this verse underscores their self-delusion of power (compare 6:13). The prophet had no such mistaken sense of national grandeur (7:2, 5).</p>
<A NAME="610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=279><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;those who push away a day of disaster.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=280><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you bring near a seat of violence.&#8221; The precise meaning of the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shevet</font>, &#8220;seat, sitting&#8221;) is unclear in this context. The translation assumes that it refers to a throne from which violence (in the person of the oppressive leaders) reigns. Another option is that the expression refers not to the leaders&#8217; oppressive rule, but to the coming judgment when violence will overtake the nation in the person of enemy invaders.</p>
<A NAME="612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=281><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;beds of ivory.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=282><b>tn</b> The meaning of the Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">parat</font>), which occurs only here in the OT, is unclear. Some translate &#8220;strum,&#8221; &#8220;pluck,&#8221; or &#8220;improvise.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=283><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;upon the mouth of,&#8221; that is, &#8220;according to.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=284><b>sn</b> The <i>stringed instruments</i> mentioned here are probably harps (cf. NIV, NRSV) or lutes (cf. NEB).</p>
<A NAME="616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=285><b>tn</b> The meaning of the Hebrew phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1464;&#1492;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khoshvu lahem</font>) is uncertain. Various options include: (1) &#8220;they think their musical instruments are like David&#8217;s&#8221;; (2) &#8220;they consider themselves musicians like David&#8221;; (3) &#8220;they esteem musical instruments highly like David&#8221;; (4) &#8220;they improvise [new songs] for themselves [on] instruments like David&#8221;; (5) &#8220;they invent musical instruments like David.&#8221; However, the most commonly accepted interpretation is that given in the translation (see S. M. Paul, <i>Amos </i>[Hermeneia], 206-7).</p>
<A NAME="617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=286><b>sn</b> Perhaps some religious rite is in view, or the size of the bowls is emphasized (i.e., bowls as large as sacrificial bowls).</p>
<A NAME="618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=287><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;with the best of oils they anoint [themselves].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=288><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;not sickened by.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=289><b>sn</b> The <i>ruin of Joseph</i> may refer to the societal disintegration in Israel, or to the effects of the impending judgment.</p>
<A NAME="621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=290><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they will go into exile at the head of the exiles.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=291><b>sn</b> <i>Religious banquets</i>. This refers to the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1494;&#1461;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">marzeakh</font>), a type of pagan religious banquet popular among the upper class of Israel at this time and apparently associated with mourning. See P. King, <i>Amos, Hosea, Micah</i>, 137-61; J. L. McLaughlin, <i>The &#8220;Marzeah&#8221; in the Prophetic Literature</i> (VTSup). Scholars debate whether at this banquet the dead were simply remembered or actually venerated in a formal, cultic sense.</p>
<A NAME="623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=292><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;of the sprawled out.&#8221; See v. 4.</p>
<A NAME="624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=293><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;swears by his life&#8221;; or &#8220;swears by himself.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="625"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=294><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his,&#8221; referring to Jacob, which stands here for the nation of Israel.</p>
<A NAME="626"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=295><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;to their enemies&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarification.</p>
<A NAME="627"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=296><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the city&#8221;; this probably refers to the city of Samaria (cf. 6:1), which in turn, by metonymy, represents the entire northern kingdom.</p>
<A NAME="628"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=297><b>tn</b> The translation assumes that &#8220;their relatives&#8221; and &#8220;the ones who will burn the corpses&#8221; are in apposition. Another option is to take them as distinct individuals, in which case one could translate, &#8220;When their close relatives and the ones who will burn the corpses pick up&#8230;&#8221; The meaning of the form translated &#8220;the ones who burn the corpses&#8221; is uncertain. Another option is to translate, &#8220;the ones who prepare the corpses for burial&#8221; (NASB &#8220;undertaker&#8221;; cf. also CEV). See S. M. Paul, <i>Amos </i>(Hermeneia), 215-16.</p>
<A NAME="629"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=298><b>tn</b> This verse is notoriously difficult to interpret. The Hebrew text literally reads, &#8220;And he will lift him up, his uncle, and the one burning him, to bring out bones from the house. And he will say to the one who is in the inner parts of the house, &#8216;Is there [anyone] still with you?&#8217; And he will say, &#8216;Be quiet for not to invoke the name of the <sc>Lord.&#8217;&#8221; The translation assumes that the singular pronominal and verbal forms throughout the verse are collective or distributive. This last sentence has been interpreted in several ways: a command not to call on the name of the Lord out of fear that he might return again in judgment; the realization that it is not appropriate to seek a blessing in the Lord&#8217;s name upon the dead in the house since the judgment was deserved; an angry refusal to call on the Lord out of a sense that he has betrayed his people in allowing them to suffer.</p>
<A NAME="630"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=299><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;is issuing the decree.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="631"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=300><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Does one plow with oxen?&#8221; This obviously does not fit the parallelism, for the preceding rhetorical question requires the answer, &#8220;Of course not!&#8221; An error of fusion has occurred in the Hebrew, with the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yam</font>, &#8220;sea&#8221;) being accidentally added as a plural ending to the collective noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">baqar</font>, &#8220;oxen&#8221;). A proper division of the consonants produces the above translation, which fits the parallelism and also anticipates the answer, &#8220;Of course not!&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="632"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=301><b>sn</b> The botanical imagery, when juxtaposed with the preceding rhetorical questions, vividly depicts and emphasizes how the Israelites have perverted justice and violated the created order by their morally irrational behavior.</p>
<A NAME="633"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=302><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;those who rejoice over Lo-Debar.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Lo-Debar</i> was located across the Jordan River in Gilead, which the Israelite army had conquered. However, there is stinging irony here, for in Hebrew the name Lo-Debar means &#8220;nothing.&#8221; In reality Israel was happy over nothing of lasting consequence.</p>
<A NAME="634"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=303><b>sn</b> <i>Karnaim</i> was also located across the Jordan River. The name in Hebrew means &#8220;double horned.&#8221; Since an animal&#8217;s horn was a symbol of strength (see Deut 33:17), the Israelites boasted in this victory over a town whose very name symbolized military power.</p>
<A NAME="635"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=304><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;raise up&#8221; (KJV, NASB); NIV &#8220;stir up.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="636"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=305><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;house.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="637"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=306><b>sn</b> Once again there is irony in the divine judgment. The oppressive nation itself will suffer oppression. The verb &#8220;oppress&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1509;</font>, <font face="Scholar">lakhats</font>) in this verse is not the same as that used in 4:1 (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1511;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">ashaq</font>).</p>
<A NAME="638"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=307><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;from the entrance to Hamath.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿvo</font>&#8217;) can either be translated or considered a part of the place name.</p>
<A NAME="639"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=308><b>sn</b> <i>Lebo-Hamath</i> refers to the northern border of Israel, the <i>Stream of the Arabah</i> to its southern border. See 2 Kgs 14:25. Through this invader the Lord would reverse the victories and territorial expansion Israel experienced during the reign of Jeroboam II.</p>
