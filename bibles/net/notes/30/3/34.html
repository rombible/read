<A NAME="34"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=125><b>sn</b> The rhetorical questions in vv. 3-5 expect the answer, &#8220;No, of course not!&#8221; Those in v. 6 anticipate the answer, &#8220;Yes, of course they do/he is.&#8221; They all draw attention to the principle of cause and effect and lay the logical foundation for the argument in vv. 7-8. Also note the progression from a general question in v. 3 to the &#8220;meetings&#8221; of two animals (v. 4), to that of an animal and a human trap (v. 5), to a climax with the confrontation with the Lord (v. 6). Each of these meetings is disastrous.</p>
