<A NAME="322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=143><b>sn</b> The verb translated <i>salvaged</i>, though often used in a positive sense of deliverance from harm, is here employed in a sarcastic manner. A shepherd would attempt to salvage part of an animal to prove that a predator had indeed killed it. In this way he could prove that he had not stolen the missing animal and absolve himself from any responsibility to repay the owner (see Exod 22:12-13).</p>
