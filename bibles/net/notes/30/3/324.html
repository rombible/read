<A NAME="324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=145><b>tn</b> The meaning of the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dÿmesheq</font>), which occurs only here, is uncertain. If not emended, it is usually related to the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dammeseq</font>) and translated as the &#8220;Damask linens&#8221; of the bed (cf. NASB &#8220;the cover&#8221;) or as &#8220;in Damascus&#8221; (so KJV, NJB, NIV). The differences in spelling (Damascus is spelled correctly in 5:27), historical considerations, and the word order make both of these derivations unlikely. Many emendations have been proposed (e.g., &#8220;a part from the foot [of a bed],&#8221; based on a different division of the Hebrew letters (cf. NEB, NRSV); &#8220;on the edge,&#8221; based on a Hebrew term not attested in the Bible (NKJV). Some suggest a resemblance to an Akkadian term which means &#8220;sideboard [of a bed],&#8221; which is sometimes incorrectly rendered &#8220;headboard&#8221; (NJPS; see S. M. Paul, <i>Amos</i> [Hermeneia], 121-22). Most likely another part of a bed or couch is in view, but it is difficult to be more specific.</p>
