<A NAME="334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=155><b>sn</b> The <i>horns</i> of an ancient altar projected upwards from the four corners and resembled an animal&#8217;s horns in appearance. Fugitives could seek asylum by grabbing hold of these corners (see Exod 21:14; 1 Kgs 1:50; 2:28). When the altar&#8217;s horns were cut off, there would be no place of asylum left for the <sc>Lord&#8217;s enemies.</p>
