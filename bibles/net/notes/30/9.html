<A NAME="91"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=401><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the Lord.&#8221; The Hebrew term translated &#8220;sovereign One&#8221; here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adonay</font>).</p>
<A NAME="92"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=402><b>sn</b> The <i>altar</i> is perhaps the altar at Bethel.</p>
<A NAME="93"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=403><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the capitals.&#8221; The Hebrew singular form is collective.</p>
<A NAME="94"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=404><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;cut them off on the head of all of them.&#8221; The translation assumes the objective suffix on the verb refers to the tops of the pillars and that the following prepositional phrase refers to the people standing beneath. Another option is to take this phrase as referring to the pillars, in which case one could translate, &#8220;Knock all the tops of the pillars off.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="95"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=405><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the remnant of them.&#8221; One could possibly translate, &#8220;every last one of them&#8221; (cf. NEB &#8220;to the last man&#8221;). This probably refers to those who survive the collapse of the temple, which may symbolize the northern kingdom.</p>
<A NAME="96"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=406><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a fugitive belonging to them will not run away.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="97"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=407><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a survivor belonging to them will not escape.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="98"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=408><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;into Sheol&#8221; (so ASV, NASB, NRSV), that is, the land of the dead localized in Hebrew thought in the earth&#8217;s core or the grave. Cf. KJV &#8220;hell&#8221;; NCV, NLT &#8220;the place of the dead&#8221;; NIV &#8220;the depths of the grave.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="99"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=409><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from before my eyes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="910"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=410><b>tn</b> Or perhaps simply, &#8220;there,&#8221; if the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mem</font>) prefixed to the adverb is dittographic (note the preceding word ends in <font face="Scholar">mem</font>).</p>
<A NAME="911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=411><b>sn</b> If the article indicates a definite serpent, then the mythological <i>Sea Serpent</i>, symbolic of the world&#8217;s chaotic forces, is probably in view. See Job 26:13 and Isa 27:1 (where it is also called Leviathan). Elsewhere in the OT this serpent is depicted as opposing the <sc>Lord, but this text implies that even this powerful enemy of God is ultimately subject to his sovereign will.</p>
<A NAME="912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=412><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Even if they go into captivity before their enemies.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=413><b>tn</b> Or perhaps simply, &#8220;there,&#8221; if the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;</font> (<i>mem</i>) prefixed to the adverb is dittographic (note the preceding word ends in <i>mem</i>).</p>
<A NAME="914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=414><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will set my eye on them for disaster, not good.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=415><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;will do this&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarification.</p>
<A NAME="916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=416><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;melts.&#8221; The verb probably depicts earthquakes and landslides. See v. 5b.</p>
<A NAME="917"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=417><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all of it.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=418><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the Nile.&#8221; The word &#8220;River&#8221; is supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=419><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;sinks back down.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="920"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=420><b>sn</b> See Amos 8:8, which is very similar to this verse.</p>
<A NAME="921"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=421><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;his steps.&#8221; If this is correct, then the reference may be to the steps leading up to the heavenly temple or the throne of God (cf. 1 Kgs 10:19-20). The prefixed <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;</font> (<i>mem</i>) may be dittographic (note the preceding word ends in <font face="Scholar">mem</font>). The translation assumes an emendation to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aliyyato</font>, &#8220;his upper rooms&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="922"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=422><b>tn</b> Traditionally, &#8220;vault&#8221; (so ASV, NAB, NRSV). The precise meaning of this word in this context is unclear. Elsewhere it refers to objects grouped or held together. F. I. Andersen and D. N. Freedman (<i>Amos</i> [AB], 845-46) suggest the foundational structure of a building is in view.</p>
<A NAME="923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=423><b>sn</b> Verse 6a pictures the entire universe as a divine palace founded <i>on the earth</i> and extending into the heavens.</p>
<A NAME="924"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=424><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has a rhetorical question, &#8220;Are you children of Israel not like the Cushites to me?&#8221; The rhetorical question has been converted to an affirmative statement in the translation for clarity. See the comment at 8:8.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Though Israel was God&#8217;s special covenant people (see 3:2a), the Lord emphasizes they are not inherently superior to the other nations subject to his sovereign rule.</p>
<A NAME="925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=425><b>sn</b> <i>Caphtor </i>may refer to the island of Crete.</p>
<A NAME="926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=426><b>tn</b> The second half of v. 7 is also phrased as a rhetorical question in the Hebrew text, &#8220;Did I not bring Israel up from the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and Aram from Kir?&#8221; The translation converts the rhetorical question into an affirmation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=427><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the eyes of the sovereign <sc>Lord are on.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="928"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=428><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;kingdom.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="929"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=429><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;house&#8221; (also in the following verse).</p>
<A NAME="930"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=430><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;like being shaken with a sieve, and a pebble does not fall to the ground.&#8221; The meaning of the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsÿror</font>), translated &#8220;pebble,&#8221; is unclear here. In 2 Sam 17:13 it appears to refer to a stone. If it means &#8220;pebble,&#8221; then the sieve described in v. 6 allows the grain to fall into a basket while retaining the debris and pebbles. However, if one interprets <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font> as a &#8220;kernel of grain&#8221; (cf. NASB, NIV, NKJV, NLT) then the sieve is constructed to retain the grain and allow the refuse and pebbles to fall to the ground. In either case, the simile supports the last statement in v. 8 by making it clear that God will distinguish between the righteous (the grain) and the wicked (the pebbles) when he judges, and will thereby preserve a remnant in Israel. Only the sinners will be destroyed (v. 10).</p>
<A NAME="931"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=431><b>tn</b> The phrase translated &#8220;collapsing hut&#8221; refers to a temporary shelter (cf. NASB, NRSV &#8220;booth&#8221;) in disrepair and emphasizes the relatively weakened condition of the once powerful Davidic dynasty. Others have suggested that the term refers to Jerusalem, while still others argue that it should be repointed to read &#8220;Sukkoth,&#8221; a garrison town in Transjordan. Its reconstruction would symbolize the rebirth of the Davidic empire and its return to power (e.g., M. E. Polley, <i>Amos and the Davidic Empire</i>, 71-74).</p>
<A NAME="932"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=432><b>tc</b> The MT reads a third feminine plural suffix, which could refer to the two kingdoms (Judah and Israel) or, more literally, to the breaches in the walls of the cities that are mentioned in v. 4 (cf. 4:3). Some emend to third feminine singular, since the &#8220;hut&#8221; of the preceding line (a feminine singular noun) might be the antecedent. In that case, the final <i>nun</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1503;</font>) is virtually dittographic with the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) that appears at the beginning of the following word.</p>
<A NAME="933"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=433><b>tc</b> The MT reads a third masculine singular suffix, which could refer back to David. However, it is possible that an original third feminine singular suffix (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1492;</font>-, <font face="Scholar">yod-hey</font>) has been misread as masculine (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;</font>-, <font face="Scholar">yod-vav</font>). In later Hebrew script a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;</font> (<i>he</i>) resembles a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;</font>- (<i>yod-vav</i>) combination.</p>
<A NAME="934"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=434><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and I will rebuild as in days of antiquity.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="935"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=435><b>sn</b> <i>They</i> probably refers to the Israelites or to the Davidic rulers of the future.</p>
<A NAME="936"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=436><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;take possession of the remnant of Edom&#8221;; NASB, NIV, NRSV &#8220;possess the remnant of Edom.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="937"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=437><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;nations over whom my name is proclaimed.&#8221; The Hebrew idiom indicates ownership, sometimes as a result of conquest. See 2 Sam 12:28.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This verse envisions a new era of Israelite rule, perhaps patterned after David&#8217;s imperialistic successes (see 2 Sam 8-10). At the same time, however, the verse does not specify how this rule is to be accomplished. Note that the book ends with a description of peace and abundance, and its final reference to God (v. 15) does not include the epithet &#8220;the Lord who commands armies,&#8221; which has militaristic overtones. This is quite a different scene than what the book began with: nations at war and standing under the judgment of God.</p>
<A NAME="938"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=438><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;behold&#8221; or<i> </i>&#8220;look.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="939"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=439><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the days are.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="940"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=440><b>sn</b> <i>The plowman will catch up to the reaper</i>. Plowing occurred in October-November, and harvesting in April-May (see P. King, <i>Amos, Hosea, Micah</i>, 109.) But in the future age of restored divine blessing, there will be so many crops the reapers will take all summer to harvest them, and it will be time for plowing again before the harvest is finished.</p>
<A NAME="941"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=441><b>sn</b> When the grapes had been harvested, they were placed in a press where workers would stomp on them with their feet and squeeze out the juice. For a discussion of grape harvesting technique, see O. Borowski, <i>Agriculture in Iron Age Israel</i>, 110-12.</p>
<A NAME="942"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=442><b>tn</b> The verb is omitted here in the Hebrew text, but has been supplied in the translation from the parallel line.</p>
<A NAME="943"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=443><b>sn</b> The grape harvest occurred in August-September, planting in November-December (see P. King, <i>Amos, Hosea, Micah</i>, 109). But in the future age described here there will be so many grapes the workers who stomp them will still be working when the next planting season arrives.</p>
<A NAME="944"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=444><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;hills,&#8221; where the vineyards were planted.</p>
<A NAME="945"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=445><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and all the hills will melt.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="946"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=446><b>tn</b> This line can also be translated &#8220;I will restore the fortunes of my people, Israel&#8221; and is a common idiom (e.g., Deut 30:3; Jer 30:3; Hos 6:11; Zeph 3:20). This rendering is followed by several modern English versions (e.g., NEB, NRSV, NJPS).</p>
<A NAME="947"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=447><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the ruined [or &#8220;desolate&#8221;] cities.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="948"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=448><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;and live [in them].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="949"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=449><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;drink their wine.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="950"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=450><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;gardens.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="951"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=451><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;eat their fruit.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="952"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=452><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;their.&#8221; The pronoun was replaced by the English definite article in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
