<A NAME="611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=280><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you bring near a seat of violence.&#8221; The precise meaning of the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shevet</font>, &#8220;seat, sitting&#8221;) is unclear in this context. The translation assumes that it refers to a throne from which violence (in the person of the oppressive leaders) reigns. Another option is that the expression refers not to the leaders&#8217; oppressive rule, but to the coming judgment when violence will overtake the nation in the person of enemy invaders.</p>
