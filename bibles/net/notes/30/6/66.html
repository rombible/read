<A NAME="66"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=275><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;They say to the people&#8221; are interpretive and supplied in the translation for clarification. The translation understands v. 2 as the boastful words, which the leaders (described in v. 1) spoke to those who came to them (v. 1b). Some interpret v. 2 differently, understanding the words as directed <i>to</i> the leaders by the prophet. Verse 2b would then be translated: &#8220;Are <i>you</i> (i.e., Israel and Judah) better than these kingdoms (i.e., Calneh, etc.)? Is your border larger than their border?&#8221; (This reading requires an emendation of the Hebrew text toward the end of the verse.) In this case the verse is a reminder to Judah/Israel that they are <i>not</i> superior to other nations, which have already fallen victim to military conquest. Consequently Judah/Israel should not expect to escape the same fate. Following this line of interpretation, some take v. 2 as a later addition since the Assyrians under Tiglath-pileser III conquered Calneh, Hamath, and Gath after the time of Amos&#8217; ministry. However, this conclusion is not necessary since the kingdoms mentioned here had suffered military setbacks prior to Amos&#8217; time as well. See S. M. Paul, <i>Amos </i>(Hermeneia), 201-4.</p>
