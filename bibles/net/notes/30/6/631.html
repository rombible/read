<A NAME="631"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=300><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Does one plow with oxen?&#8221; This obviously does not fit the parallelism, for the preceding rhetorical question requires the answer, &#8220;Of course not!&#8221; An error of fusion has occurred in the Hebrew, with the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yam</font>, &#8220;sea&#8221;) being accidentally added as a plural ending to the collective noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">baqar</font>, &#8220;oxen&#8221;). A proper division of the consonants produces the above translation, which fits the parallelism and also anticipates the answer, &#8220;Of course not!&#8221;</p>
