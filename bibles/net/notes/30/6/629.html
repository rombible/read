<A NAME="629"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=298><b>tn</b> This verse is notoriously difficult to interpret. The Hebrew text literally reads, &#8220;And he will lift him up, his uncle, and the one burning him, to bring out bones from the house. And he will say to the one who is in the inner parts of the house, &#8216;Is there [anyone] still with you?&#8217; And he will say, &#8216;Be quiet for not to invoke the name of the <sc>Lord.&#8217;&#8221; The translation assumes that the singular pronominal and verbal forms throughout the verse are collective or distributive. This last sentence has been interpreted in several ways: a command not to call on the name of the Lord out of fear that he might return again in judgment; the realization that it is not appropriate to seek a blessing in the Lord&#8217;s name upon the dead in the house since the judgment was deserved; an angry refusal to call on the Lord out of a sense that he has betrayed his people in allowing them to suffer.</p>
