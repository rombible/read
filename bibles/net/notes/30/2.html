For an explanation of the atrocities outlined in this oracle as treaty violations of God&#8217;s mandate to Noah in Gen 9:5-7, see the note on the word &#8220;violations&#8221; in 1:3.</p>
<A NAME="22"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=75><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Because of three violations of Moab, even because of four.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> On the <i>three&#8230;four</i> style that introduces each of the judgment oracles of chaps. 1-2 see the note on the word &#8220;four&#8221; in 1:3.</p>

For another option see the note on the word &#8220;judgment&#8221; in 1:3.</p>
<A NAME="24"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=77><b>sn</b> The Moabites apparently desecrated the tomb of an Edomite king and burned his bones into a calcined substance which they then used as plaster (cf. Deut 27:2, 4). See S. M. Paul, <i>Amos </i>(Hermeneia), 72. Receiving a proper burial was very important in this culture. Desecrating a tomb or a deceased individual&#8217;s bones was considered an especially heinous act.</p>
<A NAME="25"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=78><b>sn</b> The destruction of Moab by <i>fire</i> is an example of a judgment in kind &#8211; as the Moabites committed the crime of &#8220;burning,&#8221; so the <sc>Lord will punish them by setting them on fire.</p>
<A NAME="26"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=79><b>sn</b> <i>Kerioth</i> was an important Moabite city. See Jer 48:24, 41.</p>
<A NAME="27"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=80><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;die&#8221; (KJV, NASB, NRSV, TEV); NAB &#8220;shall meet death.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="28"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=81><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;in the tumult.&#8221; This word refers to the harsh confusion of sounds that characterized an ancient battle &#8211; a mixture of war cries, shouts, shrieks of pain, clashes of weapons, etc.</p>
<A NAME="29"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=82><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sound&#8221; (so KJV, NASB, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=83><b>sn</b> The <i>ram&#8217;s horn</i> (used as a trumpet) was blown to signal the approaching battle.</p>
<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=84><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;cut off&#8221; (so KJV, NASB, NRSV); NAB &#8220;root out&#8221;; NCV &#8220;bring to an end.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=85><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the leader [traditionally, &#8220;judge&#8221;] from her midst.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=86><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;her&#8221;; the referent (Moab) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=87><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;princes&#8221; (KJV, NAB, NASB, NLT); TEV, CEV &#8220;leaders.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=88><b>tn</b> This is the same Hebrew term that is translated &#8220;crimes&#8221; in the previous oracles (see at 1:3). The change to &#8220;covenant transgressions&#8221; reflects the probability that the prophet is condemning the nation of Israel for violating stipulations of the Mosaic Law.</p>
<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=89><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Because of three violations of Judah, even because of four.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> On the <i>three&#8230;four</i> style that introduces each of the judgment oracles of chaps. 1-2 see the note on the word &#8220;four&#8221; in 1:3.</p>
<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=90><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will not bring it [or &#8220;him&#8221;] back.&#8221; The translation understands the pronominal object to refer to the decree of judgment that follows; the referent (the decree) has been specified in the translation for clarity. For another option see the note on the word &#8220;judgment&#8221; in 1:3.</p>
<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=91><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;instruction&#8221;; NCV &#8220;teachings.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=92><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lies.&#8221; This may very well be a derogatory term for idols (perhaps also at Ps. 40:4 [Heb 40:5]). Elsewhere false gods are called &#8220;vanities&#8221; (Deut 32:21; 1 Kgs 16:13, 26) and a delusion (Isa 66:3). In no other prophetic passages, however, are they called &#8220;lies.&#8221; The term could refer to the deceptions of false prophets (note Ezek 13:6-9; cf. Hab 2:3). See F. I. Andersen and D. N. Freedman, <i>Amos</i> (AB), 301-6.</p>
<A NAME="220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=93><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;after which their fathers walked.&#8221; The expression &#8220;to walk after&#8221; is an idiom meaning &#8220;to be loyal to.&#8221; See S. M. Paul, <i>Amos </i>(Hermeneia), 75-76.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Here the idolatry of the parents carried over to the children, who persisted in worshiping<i> </i>the<i> </i>idols<i> to which their fathers were loyal</i>.</p>
<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=94><b>map</b> For the location of Jerusalem see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=95><b>tn</b> For this translation see the note at 2:4.</p>
<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=96><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Because of three violations of Israel, even because of four.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> On the <i>three&#8230;four</i> style that introduces each of the judgment oracles of chaps. 1-2 see the note on the word &#8220;four&#8221; in 1:3. Only in this last oracle against Israel does one find the list of four specific violations expected based on the use of a similar formula elsewhere in wisdom literature (see Prov 30:18-19, 29-31). This adaptation of the normal pattern indicates the <sc>Lord&#8217;s focus on Israel here (he is too bent on judging Israel to dwell very long on her neighbors) and emphasizes Israel&#8217;s guilt with respect to the other nations (Israel&#8217;s list fills up before the others&#8217; lists do). See R. B. Chisholm, &#8220;&#8216;For three sins...even for four&#8217;: the numerical sayings in Amos,&#8221; <i>BSac</i> 147 (1990) 188-97.</p>
<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=97><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will not bring it [or &#8220;him&#8221;] back.&#8221; The translation understands the pronominal object to refer to the decree of judgment that follows; the referent (the decree) has been specified in the translation for clarity. For another option see the note on the word &#8220;judgment&#8221; in 1:3.</p>
<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=98><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;honest&#8221; (CEV, NLT). The Hebrew word sometimes has a moral-ethical connotation, &#8220;righteous, godly,&#8221; but the parallelism (note &#8220;poor&#8221;) suggests a socio-economic or legal sense here. The practice of selling debtors as slaves is in view (Exod 21:2-11; Lev 25:35-55; Deut 15:12-18) See the note at Exod 21:8 and G. C. Chirichigno, <i>Debt-Slavery in Israel and the Ancient Near East</i> (JSOTSup). Probably the only &#8220;crime&#8221; the victim had committed was being unable to pay back a loan or an exorbitant interest rate on a loan. Some have suggested that this verse refers to bribery in legal proceedings: The innocent are &#8220;sold&#8221; in the sense that those in power pay off the elders or judges for favorable decisions (5:12; cf. Exod 23:6-7).</p>
<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=99><b>tn</b> Perhaps the expression &#8220;for a pair of sandals&#8221; indicates a relatively small price or debt. Some suggest that the sandals may have been an outward token of a more substantial purchase price. Others relate the sandals to a ritual attached to the transfer of property, signifying here that the poor would be losing their inherited family lands because of debt (Ruth 4:7; cf. Deut 25:8-10). Still others emend the Hebrew form slightly to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1506;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ne</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">lam</font>, &#8220;hidden thing&#8221;; from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1501;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">alam</font>, &#8220;to hide&#8221;) and understand this as referring to a bribe.</p>
<A NAME="227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=100><b>tn</b> Most scholars now understand this verb as derived from the root II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">af</font>, &#8220;to crush; to trample&#8221;), an alternate form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shuf</font>), rather than from I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">af</font>, &#8220;to pant, to gasp&#8221;; cf. KJV, ASV, NASB).</p>
<A NAME="228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=101><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;those who stomp on the dirt of the ground on the head of the poor.&#8221; It is possible to render the line as &#8220;they trample the heads of the poor into the dust of the ground,&#8221; thereby communicating that the poor are being stepped on in utter contempt (see S. M. Paul, <i>Amos </i>[Hermeneia], 79-80). The participial form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1458;&#1508;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hasho</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">afim</font>) is substantival and stands in apposition to the pronominal suffix on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mikhram</font>, v. 6b).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The picture of the poor having <i>dirt-covered heads</i> suggests their humiliation before their oppressors and/or their sorrow (see 2 Sam 1:2; 15:32).</p>
<A NAME="229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=102><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they turn aside the way of the destitute.&#8221; Many interpreters take &#8220;way&#8221; to mean &#8220;just cause&#8221; and understand this as a direct reference to the rights of the destitute being ignored. The injustice done to the poor is certainly in view, but the statement is better taken as a word picture depicting the powerful rich pushing the &#8220;way of the poor&#8221; (i.e., their attempt to be treated justly) to the side. An even more vivid picture is given in Amos 5:12, where the rich are pictured as turning the poor away from the city gate (where legal decisions were made, and therefore where justice should be done).</p>
<A NAME="230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=103><b>sn</b> Most interpreters see some type of sexual immorality here (cf. KJV, NASB, NIV, NCV, NRSV, TEV, CEV, NLT), even though the Hebrew phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456; &#1488;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">halakh </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>, &#8220;go to&#8221;) never refers elsewhere to sexual intercourse. (The usual idiom is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488; &#1488;&#1462;&#1500;</font> [<font face="Scholar">bo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>]. However, S. M. Paul (<i>Amos </i>[Hermeneia], 82) attempts to develop a linguistic case for a sexual connotation here.) The precise identification of the &#8220;girl&#8221; in question is not clear. Some see the referent as a cultic prostitute (cf. NAB; v. 8 suggests a cultic setting), but the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">na</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arah</font>) nowhere else refers to a prostitute. Because of the contextual emphasis on social oppression, some suggest the exploitation of a slave girl is in view. H. Barstad argues that the &#8220;girl&#8221; is the hostess at a pagan <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1494;&#1461;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">marzeakh</font>) banquet (described at some length in 6:4-7). In his view the sin described here is not sexual immorality, but idolatry (see H. Barstad, <i>The Religious Polemics of Amos</i> [VTSup], 33-36). In this case, one might translate, &#8220;Father and son go together to a pagan banquet.&#8221; In light of this cultic context, F. I. Andersen and D. N. Freedman argue that this is a reference to a specific female deity (&#8220;the Girl&#8221;) and correlate this verse with 8:14 (<i>Amos</i> [AB], 318-19).</p>
<A NAME="231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=104><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;pollute&#8221;; &#8220;desecrate&#8221;; &#8220;dishonor.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=105><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my holy name.&#8221; Here &#8220;name&#8221; is used metonymically for God&#8217;s moral character or reputation, while &#8220;holy&#8221; has a moral and ethical connotation.</p>
<A NAME="233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=106><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;They do so right&#8221; are supplied twice in the translation of this verse for clarification.</p>

<A NAME="235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=108><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;gods.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohehem</font>) may be translated &#8220;their gods&#8221; (referring to pagan gods), &#8220;their god&#8221; (referring to a pagan god, cf. NAB, NIV, NLT), or &#8220;their God&#8221; (referring to the God of Israel, cf. NASB, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=109><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I destroyed the Amorites from before them.&#8221; The translation takes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mippÿney</font>) in the sense of &#8220;for the sake of.&#8221; See BDB 818 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1467;&#1492;</font> II.6.a and H. W. Wolff, <i>Joel and Amos</i> (Hermeneia), 134. Another option is to take the phrase in a spatial sense, &#8220;I destroyed the Amorites, [clearing them out] from before them [i.e., Israel]&#8221; (cf. NIV, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=110><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;whose height was like the height of cedars.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=113><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;religious devotees&#8221; (also in the following verse). The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1494;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nazir</font>) refers to one who &#8220;consecrated&#8221; or &#8220;devoted&#8221; to God (see Num 6:1-21).</p>
<A NAME="241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=114><b>sn</b> Nazirites were strictly forbidden to <i>drink wine</i> (Num 6:2-3).</p>
<A NAME="242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=115><b>tn</b> The precise meaning of this verse is unclear. Various suggested meanings have been proposed (see S. M. Paul, <i>Amos </i>[Hermeneia], 94): (1) One option is to relate the verb to an Arabic verb, meaning &#8220;to hinder; to hamper,&#8221; and translate, &#8220;I am making you immobile, like a cart filled with grain is immobile.&#8221; In this case, the <sc>Lord refers to Israel&#8217;s inability to escape his coming judgment (see vv. 14-16; NJPS). (2) Another view relates the verb to a different Arabic verb meaning &#8220;to cut in pieces,&#8221; translating &#8220;I will cut you in pieces as a cart cuts in pieces [the earth],&#8221; referring to the ruts and rifts in the ground caused by an earthquake. (3) Some relate the verb to an Arabic root meaning &#8220;to groan&#8221; with the idea that the <sc>Lord causes the ground underneath Israel to groan (cf. NLT). (4) The translation connects the verb to an Aramaism signifying to &#8220;press down&#8221; (cf. NIV, NRSV). Some English versions translate the verb in an intransitive sense as &#8220;I am weighted down&#8221; (cf. NASB, NKJV) or &#8220;I groan beneath you&#8221; (NEB). For this last option, see F. I. Andersen and D. N. Freedman, <i>Amos</i> (AB), 334.</p>
<A NAME="243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=116><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and a place of refuge will perish from the swift.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="244"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=117><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the strong will not increase his strength.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=118><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the one who holds the bow.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="246"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=119><b>tn</b> For the idiom of &#8220;holding [or &#8220;standing&#8221;] one&#8217;s ground&#8221; in battle, there is a similar phrase in Ezek 13:5; also related is the expression &#8220;to hold one&#8217;s own against&#8221; (or &#8220;to withstand&#8221;) in Judg 2:14; 2 Kgs 10:4; Dan 8:7 (see S. M. Paul, <i>Amos</i> [Hermeneia], 97). Other options include &#8220;will not endure&#8221; or &#8220;will not survive.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="247"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=120><b>tn</b> The last two lines read literally, &#8220;The one fast in his feet will not rescue [his life], and the rider of the horse will not rescue his life.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;his life&#8221; does double duty in the parallelism and should be understood in both lines.</p>
<A NAME="248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=121><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the most stouthearted&#8221; (NAB); NRSV &#8220;those who are stout of heart.&#8221;</p>
