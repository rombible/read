<A NAME="31"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=122><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;about.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="32"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=123><b>tn</b> One might expect a third person verb form (&#8220;he brought up&#8221;), since the <sc>Lord apparently refers to himself in the third person in the preceding sentence. This first person form, however, serves to connect this message to the earlier indictment (2:10) and anticipates the words of the following verse.</p>
<A NAME="33"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=124><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;You only have I known.&#8221; The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yada</font>&#8217;) is used here in its covenantal sense of &#8220;recognize in a special way.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="34"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=125><b>sn</b> The rhetorical questions in vv. 3-5 expect the answer, &#8220;No, of course not!&#8221; Those in v. 6 anticipate the answer, &#8220;Yes, of course they do/he is.&#8221; They all draw attention to the principle of cause and effect and lay the logical foundation for the argument in vv. 7-8. Also note the progression from a general question in v. 3 to the &#8220;meetings&#8221; of two animals (v. 4), to that of an animal and a human trap (v. 5), to a climax with the confrontation with the Lord (v. 6). Each of these meetings is disastrous.</p>
<A NAME="35"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=126><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;without having prey [or &#8220;food&#8221;].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="36"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=127><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;If the ram&#8217;s horn is blown.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="37"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=128><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;tremble&#8221; (NASB, NIV, NCV); or &#8220;shake.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="38"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=129><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;is in&#8221;; NIV, NCV, NLT &#8220;comes to.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="39"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=130><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;has the <sc>Lord not acted?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=131><b>sn</b> The roar of the lion is here a metaphor for impending judgment (see 1:2; cf. 3:4, 12). Verses 7-8 justify Amos&#8217; prophetic ministry and message of warning and judgment. The people should expect a prophetic message prior to divine action.</p>
<A NAME="311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=132><b>sn</b> <i>Who can refuse to prophesy?</i> When a message is revealed, the prophet must speak, and the news of impending judgment should cause people to fear.</p>
<A NAME="312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=133><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;on&#8221; or &#8220;over&#8221; (also later in this verse).</p>
<A NAME="313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=134><b>sn</b> <i>Samaria</i> might refer here both to the region and to the capital city (later known as Sebaste). On the other hand, there actually are hills that surround the mound upon which the city was built. The implication is that the nations can come and sit and see from those hills the sin of the capital city and its judgment.</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location of the city see Map2-B1; Map4-D3; Map5-E2; Map6-A4; Map7-C1.</p>
<A NAME="314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=135><b>tn</b> The Hebrew noun carries the nuance of &#8220;panic&#8221; or &#8220;confusion.&#8221; Here it refers metonymically to the violent deeds that terrorize the oppressed.</p>
<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=136><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in her midst&#8221; (so NAB, NASB); NIV &#8220;among her people.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=137><b>tn</b> The translation assumes the form is an abstract plural (see Job 35:9; Eccl 4:1). Another option is to understand the form as a substantival passive participle and translate, &#8220;the oppressed&#8221; (so KJV).</p>
<A NAME="317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=138><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;within her.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=139><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;those who.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=140><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;violence and destruction.&#8221; The expression &#8220;violence and destruction&#8221; stand metonymically for the goods the oppressors have accumulated by their unjust actions.</p>
<A NAME="320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=141><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;an enemy and around the land.&#8221; It is also possible to take the MT as an exclamation (&#8220;an enemy, and all about the land!&#8221;; see S. M. Paul, <i>Amos</i> [Hermeneia], 118; NJPS; cf. NLT).Most scholars and versions emend the text to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1505;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;&#1461;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿsovev</font>, Polel imperfect), &#8220;will encircle.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=142><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;He will bring down your power from you.&#8221; Some emend the text to read &#8220;Your power will be brought down from you.&#8221; The shift, however, from an active to a passive sense also appears at 3:14 (&#8220;I will destroy Bethel&#8217;s altars. The horns of the altar will be cut off.&#8221;) The pronouns (&#8220;your&#8230;you&#8221;) are feminine singular, indicating that the personified city of Samaria is addressed here. Samaria&#8217;s &#8220;power&#8221; here is her defenses and/or wealth.</p>
<A NAME="322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=143><b>sn</b> The verb translated <i>salvaged</i>, though often used in a positive sense of deliverance from harm, is here employed in a sarcastic manner. A shepherd would attempt to salvage part of an animal to prove that a predator had indeed killed it. In this way he could prove that he had not stolen the missing animal and absolve himself from any responsibility to repay the owner (see Exod 22:12-13).</p>
<A NAME="323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=144><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;with a corner of a bed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=145><b>tn</b> The meaning of the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dÿmesheq</font>), which occurs only here, is uncertain. If not emended, it is usually related to the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dammeseq</font>) and translated as the &#8220;Damask linens&#8221; of the bed (cf. NASB &#8220;the cover&#8221;) or as &#8220;in Damascus&#8221; (so KJV, NJB, NIV). The differences in spelling (Damascus is spelled correctly in 5:27), historical considerations, and the word order make both of these derivations unlikely. Many emendations have been proposed (e.g., &#8220;a part from the foot [of a bed],&#8221; based on a different division of the Hebrew letters (cf. NEB, NRSV); &#8220;on the edge,&#8221; based on a Hebrew term not attested in the Bible (NKJV). Some suggest a resemblance to an Akkadian term which means &#8220;sideboard [of a bed],&#8221; which is sometimes incorrectly rendered &#8220;headboard&#8221; (NJPS; see S. M. Paul, <i>Amos</i> [Hermeneia], 121-22). Most likely another part of a bed or couch is in view, but it is difficult to be more specific.</p>
<A NAME="325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=146><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;testify against.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=147><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;house.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=148><b>tn</b> These words are spoken to either the unidentified heralds addressed at the beginning of v. 9, or to the Egyptians and Philistines (see v. 9b). Another possibility is that one is not to look for a specific addressee but rather appreciate the command simply as a rhetorical device to grab the attention of the listeners and readers of the prophetic message.</p>
<A NAME="328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=149><b>tn</b> Traditionally, &#8220;the God of hosts.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=150><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the day.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=151><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his.&#8221; With the referent &#8220;Israel&#8221; here, this amounts to a collective singular.</p>
<A NAME="331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=152><b>tn</b> Traditionally, &#8220;transgressions, sins,&#8221; but see the note on the word &#8220;crimes&#8221; in 1:3.</p>
<A NAME="332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=153><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;punish&#8221; (so NASB, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=154><b>map</b> For location see Map4-G4; Map5-C1; Map6-E3; Map7-D1; Map8-G3.</p>
<A NAME="334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=155><b>sn</b> The <i>horns</i> of an ancient altar projected upwards from the four corners and resembled an animal&#8217;s horns in appearance. Fugitives could seek asylum by grabbing hold of these corners (see Exod 21:14; 1 Kgs 1:50; 2:28). When the altar&#8217;s horns were cut off, there would be no place of asylum left for the <sc>Lord&#8217;s enemies.</p>
<A NAME="335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=156><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the winter house along with the summer house.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Like kings, many in Israel&#8217;s wealthy class owned both <i>winter and summer houses</i> (cf. 1 Kgs 21:1,18; Jer 36:22). For a discussion of archaeological evidence relating to these structures, see P. King, <i>Amos, Hosea, Micah</i>, 64-65.</p>
<A NAME="336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=157><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;houses of ivory.&#8221; These houses were not made of ivory, but they had ivory panels and furniture decorated with ivory inlays. See P. King, <i>Amos, Hosea, Micah</i>, 139-48.</p>
<A NAME="337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=158><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;many,&#8221; cf. NAB &#8220;their many rooms.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="338"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=159><b>tn</b> The translation assumes the form is from the Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1508;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">safah</font>, &#8220;to sweep away&#8221;) rather than <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">suf</font>, &#8220;to come to an end&#8221;), which is the choice of most versions. Either option effectively communicates the destruction of the structures.</p>
