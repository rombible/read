<A NAME="82"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=351><b>sn</b> The <i>basket of summer fruit </i>(also in the following verse) probably refers to figs from the summer crop, which ripens in August-September. See O. Borowski, <i>Agriculture in Iron Age Israel</i>, 115.</p>
<A NAME="83"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=352><b>tn</b> There is a wordplay here. The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1461;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qets</font>, &#8220;end&#8221;) sounds like <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1497;&#1460;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qayits</font>, &#8220;summer fruit&#8221;). The summer fruit arrived toward the end of Israel&#8217;s agricultural year; Israel&#8217;s national existence was similarly at an end.</p>
<A NAME="84"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=353><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will no longer pass over him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="85"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=354><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;palace&#8221; (NASB, NCV, TEV).</p>
<A NAME="86"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=355><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Many corpses in every place he will throw out.&#8221; The subject of the verb is probably impersonal, though many emend the active (Hiphil) form to a passive (Hophal): &#8220;Many corpses in every place will be thrown out.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="87"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=356><b>tn</b> See the note on the word &#8220;trample&#8221; in 2:7.</p>
<A NAME="88"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=357><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;put an end to&#8221;; or &#8220;exterminate.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="89"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=358><b>sn</b> Apparently work was prohibited during the <i>new moon festival</i>, just as it was on the Sabbath.</p>
<A NAME="810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=359><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;pass by.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=360><b>tn</b> The verb, though omitted in the Hebrew text, is supplied in the translation from the parallel line.</p>
<A NAME="812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=361><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sell grain.&#8221; Here &#8220;grain&#8221; could stand by metonymy for the bins where it was stored.</p>
<A NAME="813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=362><b>tn</b> Here and in v. 6 the words &#8220;we&#8217;re eager&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarification.</p>
<A NAME="814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=363><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to make small the ephah and to make great the shekel.&#8221; The &#8220;ephah&#8221; was a unit of dry measure used to determine the quantity purchased, while the &#8220;shekel&#8221; was a standard weight used to determine the purchase price. By using a smaller than standard ephah and a heavier than standard shekel, these merchants were able to increase their profit (&#8220;sell less for a higher price&#8221;) by cheating the buyer.</p>
<A NAME="815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=364><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and to cheat with deceptive scales&#8221;; NASB, NIV &#8220;dishonest scales&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;false balances.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Rigged scales</i> may refer to bending the crossbar or shifting the center point of the scales to make the amount weighed appear heavier than it actually was, thus cheating the buyer.</p>
<A NAME="816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=365><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to buy the poor for silver.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The expression<i> trade silver for the poor </i>refers to the slave trade.</p>
<A NAME="817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=366><b>tn</b> See the note on the word &#8220;sandals&#8221; in 2:6.</p>
<A NAME="818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=367><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The chaff of the grain we will sell.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=368><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;swears.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=369><b>sn</b> In an oath one appeals to something permanent to emphasize one&#8217;s commitment to the promise. Here the <sc>Lord sarcastically swears by <i>the arrogance of Jacob</i>, which he earlier had condemned (6:8), something just as enduring as the <sc>Lord&#8217;s own life (see 6:8) or unchanging character (see 4:2). Other suggestions include that the Lord is swearing by the land, his most valuable possession (cf. Isa 4:2; Ps 47:4 [47:5 HT]); that this is a divine epithet analogous to &#8220;the Glory of Israel&#8221; (1 Sam 15:29); or that an ellipsis should be understood here, in which case the meaning is the same as that of 6:8 (&#8220;The Lord has sworn [by himself] against the arrogance of Jacob&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=370><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;I swear&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text, but have been supplied in the translation because a self-imprecation is assumed in oaths of this type.</p>
<A NAME="822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=371><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I will never forget all your deeds.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=372><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;land&#8221; (also later in this verse).</p>
<A NAME="824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=373><b>tn</b> It is not clear whether the speaker in this verse is the <sc>Lord or the prophet.</p>
<A NAME="825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=374><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all of it.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=375><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;like the light&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1464;&#1488;&#1465;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">or</font>; note this term also appears in v. 9), which is commonly understood to be an error for &#8220;like the Nile&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ki</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">or</font>). See the parallel line and Amos 9:5. The word &#8220;River&#8221; is supplied in the translation for clarity. If this emendation is correct, in the Hebrew of Amos &#8220;Nile&#8221; is actually spelled three slightly different ways.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The movement of the quaking earth is here compared to the annual flooding and receding of the <i>River</i> <i>Nile</i>.</p>
<A NAME="827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=376><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;churn.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=377><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;sink back down.&#8221; The translation assumes the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shaqa</font>&#8217;), following the <i>Qere</i>.</p>
<A NAME="829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=378><b>tn</b> The entire verse is phrased in a series of rhetorical questions which anticipate the answer, &#8220;Of course!&#8221; (For example, the first line reads, &#8220;Because of this will the earth not quake?&#8221;). The rhetorical questions entrap the listener in the logic of the judgment of God (cf. 3:3-6; 9:7). The rhetorical questions have been converted to affirmative statements in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=379><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in a day of light.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=380><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;mourning.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="832"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=381><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will place sackcloth on all waists.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Mourners wore sackcloth (<i>funeral clothes</i>) as an outward expression of grief.</p>
<A NAME="833"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=382><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and make every head bald.&#8221; This could be understood in a variety of ways, while the ritual act of mourning typically involved shaving the head (although occasionally the hair could be torn out as a sign of mourning).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Shaving the head or tearing out one&#8217;s hair was a ritual act of mourning. See Lev 21:5; Deut 14:1; Isa 3:24; 15:2; Jer 47:5; 48:37; Ezek 7:18; 27:31; Mic 1:16.</p>
<A NAME="834"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=383><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will make it like the mourning for an only son.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="835"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=384><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and its end will be like a bitter day.&#8221; The Hebrew preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kaf</font>) sometimes carries the force of &#8220;in every respect,&#8221; indicating identity rather than mere comparison.</p>
<A NAME="836"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=385><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;behold&#8221; or &#8220;look.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="838"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=387><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;not a hunger for food or a thirst for water, but for hearing the words of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="839"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=388><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they&#8221;; the referent (people) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="840"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=389><b>tn</b> That is, from the Mediterranean Sea in the west to the Dead Sea in the east &#8211; that is, across the whole land.</p>
<A NAME="841"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=390><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;looking for the word of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="842"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=391><b>tn</b> It is not clear whether the speaker in this verse is the <sc>Lord or the prophet.</p>

<A NAME="848"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=397><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the sin [or &#8220;guilt&#8221;] of Samaria.&#8221; This could be a derogatory reference to an idol-goddess popular in the northern kingdom, perhaps Asherah (cf. 2 Chr 24:18, where this worship is labeled &#8220;their guilt&#8221;), or to the golden calf at the national sanctuary in Bethel (Hos 8:6, 10:8). Some English versions (e.g., NEB, NRSV, CEV) repoint the word and read &#8220;Ashimah,&#8221; the name of a goddess worshiped in Hamath in Syria (see 2 Kgs 17:30).</p>
<A NAME="849"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=398><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;say.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="850"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=399><b>sn</b> <i>Your god</i> is not identified. It may refer to another patron deity who was not the God of Israel, a local manifestation of the Lord that was worshiped by the people there, or, more specifically, the golden calf image erected in Dan by Jeroboam I (see 1 Kgs 12:28-30).</p>
<A NAME="851"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=400><b>tc</b> The MT reads, &#8220;As surely as the way [to] Beer Sheba lives,&#8221; or &#8220;As surely as the way lives, O Beer Sheba.&#8221; Perhaps the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">derekh</font>, &#8220;the way&#8221;) refers to the pilgrimage route to Beersheba (see S. M. Paul, <i>Amos </i>[Hermeneia], 272) or it may be a title for a god. The notion of pilgrimage appears elsewhere in the book (cf. 4:4-5; 5:4-5; 8:12). The translation above assumes an emendation to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1465;&#1491;&#1456;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dodÿkh</font>, &#8220;your beloved&#8221; or &#8220;relative&#8221;; the term also is used in 6:10) and understands this as referring either to the Lord (since other kinship terms are used of him, such as &#8220;Father&#8221;) or to another deity that was particularly popular in Beer Sheba. Besides the commentaries, see S. M. Olyan, &#8220;The Oaths of Amos 8:14&#8221; <i>Priesthood and Cult in Ancient Israel</i>, 121-49.</p>
