<A NAME="558"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=258><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will not smell.&#8221; These verses are full of vivid descriptions of the Lord&#8217;s total rejection of Israelite worship. In the first half of this verse two verbs are used together for emphasis. Here the verb alludes to the sense of smell, a fitting observation since offerings would have been burned on the altar ideally to provide a sweet aroma to God (see, e.g., Lev 1:9, 13, 17; Num 29:36). Other senses that are mentioned include sight and hearing in vv. 22-23.</p>
