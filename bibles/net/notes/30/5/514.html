<A NAME="514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=214><b>tn</b> In the Hebrew text the statement is emphasized by sound play. The name &#8220;Gilgal&#8221; sounds like the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">galah</font>, &#8220;to go into exile&#8221;), which occurs here in the infinitival + finite verb construction (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492; &#1497;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1500;&#1462;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">galoh yigleh</font>). The repetition of the &#8220;<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;</font>&#8221; (<font face="Scholar">g</font>) and &#8220;<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font>&#8221; (<font face="Scholar">l</font>) sounds draws attention to the announcement and suggests that Gilgal&#8217;s destiny is inherent in its very name.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> That the people of <i>Gilgal</i> would be taken into exile is ironic, for Gilgal was Israel&#8217;s first campsite when the people entered the land under Joshua and the city became a symbol of Israel&#8217;s possession of the promised land.</p>
