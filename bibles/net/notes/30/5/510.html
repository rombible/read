<A NAME="510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=210><b>sn</b> The following verses explain what it meant to <i>seek</i> the <sc>Lord. Israel was to abandon the mere formalism and distorted view of God and reality that characterized religious activity at the worship sites, as well as the social injustice that permeated Israelite society. Instead the people were to repent and promote justice in the land. This call to seek the Lord echoes the challenge in 4:13 to prepare to meet him as he truly is.</p>
