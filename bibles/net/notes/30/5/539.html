<A NAME="539"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=239><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the wise&#8221;; or &#8220;the prudent.&#8221; Another option is to translate &#8220;the successful, prosperous&#8221; and understand this as a reference to the rich oppressors. See G. V. Smith, <i>Amos</i>, 169-70. In this case the following verb will also have a different nuance, that is, the wealthy remain silent before the abuses they perpetuate. See the note on the verb translated &#8220;keeps quiet&#8221; later in this verse.</p>
