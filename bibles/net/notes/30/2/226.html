<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=99><b>tn</b> Perhaps the expression &#8220;for a pair of sandals&#8221; indicates a relatively small price or debt. Some suggest that the sandals may have been an outward token of a more substantial purchase price. Others relate the sandals to a ritual attached to the transfer of property, signifying here that the poor would be losing their inherited family lands because of debt (Ruth 4:7; cf. Deut 25:8-10). Still others emend the Hebrew form slightly to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1506;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ne</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">lam</font>, &#8220;hidden thing&#8221;; from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1501;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">alam</font>, &#8220;to hide&#8221;) and understand this as referring to a bribe.</p>
