<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=92><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lies.&#8221; This may very well be a derogatory term for idols (perhaps also at Ps. 40:4 [Heb 40:5]). Elsewhere false gods are called &#8220;vanities&#8221; (Deut 32:21; 1 Kgs 16:13, 26) and a delusion (Isa 66:3). In no other prophetic passages, however, are they called &#8220;lies.&#8221; The term could refer to the deceptions of false prophets (note Ezek 13:6-9; cf. Hab 2:3). See F. I. Andersen and D. N. Freedman, <i>Amos</i> (AB), 301-6.</p>
