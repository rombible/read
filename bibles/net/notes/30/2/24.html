<A NAME="24"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=77><b>sn</b> The Moabites apparently desecrated the tomb of an Edomite king and burned his bones into a calcined substance which they then used as plaster (cf. Deut 27:2, 4). See S. M. Paul, <i>Amos </i>(Hermeneia), 72. Receiving a proper burial was very important in this culture. Desecrating a tomb or a deceased individual&#8217;s bones was considered an especially heinous act.</p>
