<A NAME="242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=115><b>tn</b> The precise meaning of this verse is unclear. Various suggested meanings have been proposed (see S. M. Paul, <i>Amos </i>[Hermeneia], 94): (1) One option is to relate the verb to an Arabic verb, meaning &#8220;to hinder; to hamper,&#8221; and translate, &#8220;I am making you immobile, like a cart filled with grain is immobile.&#8221; In this case, the <sc>Lord refers to Israel&#8217;s inability to escape his coming judgment (see vv. 14-16; NJPS). (2) Another view relates the verb to a different Arabic verb meaning &#8220;to cut in pieces,&#8221; translating &#8220;I will cut you in pieces as a cart cuts in pieces [the earth],&#8221; referring to the ruts and rifts in the ground caused by an earthquake. (3) Some relate the verb to an Arabic root meaning &#8220;to groan&#8221; with the idea that the <sc>Lord causes the ground underneath Israel to groan (cf. NLT). (4) The translation connects the verb to an Aramaism signifying to &#8220;press down&#8221; (cf. NIV, NRSV). Some English versions translate the verb in an intransitive sense as &#8220;I am weighted down&#8221; (cf. NASB, NKJV) or &#8220;I groan beneath you&#8221; (NEB). For this last option, see F. I. Andersen and D. N. Freedman, <i>Amos</i> (AB), 334.</p>
