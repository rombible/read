<A NAME="229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=102><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they turn aside the way of the destitute.&#8221; Many interpreters take &#8220;way&#8221; to mean &#8220;just cause&#8221; and understand this as a direct reference to the rights of the destitute being ignored. The injustice done to the poor is certainly in view, but the statement is better taken as a word picture depicting the powerful rich pushing the &#8220;way of the poor&#8221; (i.e., their attempt to be treated justly) to the side. An even more vivid picture is given in Amos 5:12, where the rich are pictured as turning the poor away from the city gate (where legal decisions were made, and therefore where justice should be done).</p>
