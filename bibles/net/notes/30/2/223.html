<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=96><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Because of three violations of Israel, even because of four.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> On the <i>three&#8230;four</i> style that introduces each of the judgment oracles of chaps. 1-2 see the note on the word &#8220;four&#8221; in 1:3. Only in this last oracle against Israel does one find the list of four specific violations expected based on the use of a similar formula elsewhere in wisdom literature (see Prov 30:18-19, 29-31). This adaptation of the normal pattern indicates the <sc>Lord&#8217;s focus on Israel here (he is too bent on judging Israel to dwell very long on her neighbors) and emphasizes Israel&#8217;s guilt with respect to the other nations (Israel&#8217;s list fills up before the others&#8217; lists do). See R. B. Chisholm, &#8220;&#8216;For three sins...even for four&#8217;: the numerical sayings in Amos,&#8221; <i>BSac</i> 147 (1990) 188-97.</p>
