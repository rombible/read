<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=98><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;honest&#8221; (CEV, NLT). The Hebrew word sometimes has a moral-ethical connotation, &#8220;righteous, godly,&#8221; but the parallelism (note &#8220;poor&#8221;) suggests a socio-economic or legal sense here. The practice of selling debtors as slaves is in view (Exod 21:2-11; Lev 25:35-55; Deut 15:12-18) See the note at Exod 21:8 and G. C. Chirichigno, <i>Debt-Slavery in Israel and the Ancient Near East</i> (JSOTSup). Probably the only &#8220;crime&#8221; the victim had committed was being unable to pay back a loan or an exorbitant interest rate on a loan. Some have suggested that this verse refers to bribery in legal proceedings: The innocent are &#8220;sold&#8221; in the sense that those in power pay off the elders or judges for favorable decisions (5:12; cf. Exod 23:6-7).</p>
