<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The words of Amos.&#8221; Among the prophetic books this opening phrase finds a parallel only at Jer 1:1 but is not that uncommon in other genres (note, e.g., Prov 30:1; 31:1; Eccl 1:1; Neh 1:1).</p>

<a name="16"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=6><b>sn</b> This refers to a well-known earthquake that occurred during the first half of the 8th century <span class="smallcaps">b.c</span>. According to a generally accepted dating system, Uzziah was a co-regent with his father Amaziah from 792-767 <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span> and ruled independently from 767-740 <span class="smallcaps">b.c</span>. Jeroboam II was a co-regent with his father Joash from 793-782 <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span> and ruled independently from 782-753 <span class="smallcaps">b.c</span>. Since only Uzziah and Jeroboam are mentioned in the introduction it is likely that Amos&#8217; mission to Israel and the earthquake which followed occurred between 767-753 <span class="smallcaps">b.c</span>. The introduction validates the genuine character of Amos&#8217; prophetic ministry in at least two ways: (1) Amos was not a native Israelite or a prophet by trade. Rather he was a herdsman in Tekoa, located in Judah. His mere presence in the northern kingdom as a prophet was evidence that he had been called by God (see 7:14-15). (2) The mighty earthquake shortly after Amos&#8217; ministry would have been interpreted as an omen or signal of approaching judgment. The clearest references to an earthquake are 1:1 and 9:1, 5. It is possible that the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hafakh</font>, &#8220;overturn&#8221;) at 3:13-15, 4:11, 6:11, and 8:8 also refers to an earthquake, as might the descriptions at 2:13 and 6:9-10. Evidence of a powerful earthquake has been correlated with a destruction layer at Hazor and other sites. Its lasting impact is evident by its mention in Zech 14:5 and 2 Chr 26:16-21. Earthquake imagery appears in later prophets as well (cf. D. N. Freedman and A. Welch, &#8220;Amos&#8217;s Earthquake and Israelite Prophecy,&#8221; <i>Scripture and Other Artifacts</i>, 188-98). On the other hand, some of these verses in Amos could allude to the devastation that would be caused by the imminent military invasion.</p>

<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>tn</b> Lexicographers debate whether there are two roots <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aval</font>), one signifying &#8220;mourn&#8221; and the other &#8220;be dry,&#8221; or simply one (&#8220;mourn&#8221;). The parallel verb (&#8220;withers&#8221;) might favor the first option and have the meaning &#8220;wilt away.&#8221; It is interesting to note, however, that the root appears later in the book in the context of lament (5:16; 8:8, 10; 9:5). Either 1:2 is a possible wordplay to alert the reader to the death that will accompany the judgment (the option of two roots), or perhaps the translation &#8220;mourns&#8221; is appropriate here as well (cf. KJV, NASB, NKJV, NJPS; see also D. J. A. Clines, &#8220;Was There an <i>&#8217;BL</i> II &#8216;Be Dry&#8217; in Classical Hebrew?&#8221; <i>VT</i> 42 [1992]: 1-10).</p>

<a name="113"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=13><b>sn</b> Loss of a land&#8217;s fertility is frequently associated with judgment in the OT and ancient Near Eastern literature.</p>
<a name="114"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=14><b>tn</b> Traditionally, &#8220;transgressions&#8221; or &#8220;sins.&#8221; The word refers to rebellion against authority and is used in the international political realm (see 1 Kgs 12:19; 2 Kgs 1:1; 3:5, 7; 8:22). There is debate over its significance in this context. Some relate the &#8220;rebellion&#8221; of the foreign nations to God&#8217;s mandate to Noah (Gen 9:5-7). This mandate is viewed as a treaty between God and humankind, whereby God holds humans accountable to populate the earth and respect his image as it is revealed in all people. While this option is a possible theological explanation of the message in light of the Old Testament as a whole, nothing in these oracles alludes to that Genesis passage. J. Barton suggests that the prophet is appealing to a common morality shared across the ancient Near East regarding the conduct of war since all of the oracles can be related to activities and atrocities committed in warfare (<i>Amos&#8217;s Oracles against the Nations</i> [SOTSMS], 39-61). The &#8220;transgression&#8221; then would be a violation of what all cultures would take as fundamental human decency. Some argue that the nations cited in Amos 1-2 had been members of the Davidic empire. Their crime would consist of violating the mutual agreements that all should have exhibited toward one another (cf. M. E. Polley, <i>Amos and the Davidic Empire</i>). This interpretation is connected to the notion that Amos envisions a reconstituted Davidic empire for Israel and the world (9:11-15). Ultimately, we can only speculate what lay behind Amos&#8217; thinking. He does not specify the theological foundation of his universal moral vision, but it is clear that Amos believes that all nations are responsible before the Lord for their cruelty toward other human beings. He also assumes that even those who did not know his God would recognize their inhumane treatment of others as inherently wrong. The translation &#8220;crimes&#8221; is general enough to communicate that a standard (whether human or divine) has been breached. For a survey of the possible historical events behind each oracle, see S. M. Paul, <i>Amos </i>(Hermeneia).</p>
<a name="115"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=15><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Because of three violations of Damascus, even because of four.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The <i>three&#8230;four</i> style introduces each of the judgment oracles of chaps. 1-2. Based on the use of a similar formula in wisdom literature (see Prov 30:18-19, 29-31), one expects to find in each case a list of four specific violations. However, only in the eighth oracle (against Israel) does one find the expected fourfold list. Through this adaptation and alteration of the normal pattern the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> indicates that his focus is Israel (he is too bent on judging Israel to dwell very long on her neighbors) and he emphasizes Israel&#8217;s guilt with respect to the other nations. (Israel&#8217;s list fills up before the others&#8217; lists do.) See R. B. Chisholm, &#8220;For Three Sins&#8230;Even for Four: The Numerical Sayings in Amos,&#8221; <i>BSac</i> 147 (1990): 188-97.</p>

See S. M. Paul, <i>Amos</i> (Hermeneia), 46-47. Another option (2) is to understand the suffix as referring to the particular nation mentioned in the oracle and to translate, &#8220;I will not take him [i.e., that particular nation] back.&#8221; In this case the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> makes it clear that he does not intend to resume treaty relations with the nation in view. See M. L. Barré, &#8220;The Meaning of <font face="Scholar">lá ás&#338;ybnw</font> in Amos 1:3-2:6,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 105 (1986): 622.</p>

A threshing sledge was made of wooden boards embedded with sharp stones or iron teeth. As the sledge was pulled over the threshing floor the stones or iron teeth would separate the grain from the stalks. See O. Borowski, <i>Agriculture in Iron Age Israel</i>, 64-65. Here the threshing metaphor is used to emphasize how violently and inhumanely the Arameans (the people of Damascus) had treated the people of Gilead (located east of the Jordan River).</p>

The context and the parallel in the next clause (&#8220;the one who holds the royal scepter&#8221;), however, suggest that the royal house is in view.
