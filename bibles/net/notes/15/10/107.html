<A NAME="107"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=303><b>tn</b> The MT vocalizes this word as a plural, which could be understood as a reference to God. But the context seems to suggest that a human lord is intended. The apparatus of <i>BHS</i> suggests repointing the word as a singular (&#8220;my lord&#8221;), but this is unnecessary. The plural (&#8220;my lords&#8221;) can be understood in an honorific sense even when a human being is in view. Most English versions regard this as a reference to Ezra, so the present translation supplies &#8220;your&#8221; before &#8220;counsel&#8221; to make this clear.</p>
