<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>sn</b> Cf. Jer 29:10; 25:11-14. Jeremiah had prophesied that after a time of seventy years the Jews would return &#8220;to this place.&#8221; How these seventy years are to be reckoned is a matter of debate among scholars. Some understand the period to refer to the approximate length of Babylon&#8217;s ascendancy as a world power, beginning either with the fall of Nineveh (612 <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span>) or with Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s coronation (605 <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span>) and continuing till the fall of Babylon to the Persians in 539 <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span> Others take the seventy years to refer to the period from the destruction of the temple in 586 <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span> till its rebuilding in 516 <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span></p>
