<A NAME="313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=81><b>tn</b> The Hebrew phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514; &#1495;&#1463;&#1490;&#1470;&#1492;&#1463;&#1505;&#1468;&#1467;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et khag-hassukot</font>, &#8220;festival of huts&#8221; [or &#8220;shelters&#8221;]) is traditionally known as the Feast of Tabernacles. The rendering &#8220;booths&#8221; (cf. NAB, NASB, NRSV) is probably better than the traditional &#8220;tabernacles&#8221; in light of the meaning of the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1467;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sukkah</font>, &#8220;hut; booth&#8221;), but &#8220;booths&#8221; are frequently associated with trade shows and craft fairs in contemporary American English. The nature of the celebration during this feast as a commemoration of the wanderings of the Israelites after they left Egypt suggests that a translation like &#8220;temporary shelters&#8221; is more appropriate.</p>
