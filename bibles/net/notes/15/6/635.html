<A NAME="635"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=219><b>sn</b> The expression &#8220;king of Assyria&#8221; is anachronistic, since Assyria fell in 612 <sc>b.c., long before the events of this chapter. Perhaps the expression is intended subtly to contrast earlier kings of Assyria who were hostile toward Israel with this Persian king who showed them favor.</p>
