<A NAME="66"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=190><b>tc</b> The Syriac Peshitta reads &#8220;twenty cubits&#8221; here, a measurement probably derived from dimensions given elsewhere for Solomon&#8217;s temple. According to 1 Kgs 6:2 the dimensions of the Solomonic temple were as follows: length, 60 cubits; width, 20 cubits; height, 30 cubits. Since one would expect the dimensions cited in Ezra 6:3 to correspond to those of Solomon&#8217;s temple, it is odd that no dimension for length is provided. The Syriac has apparently harmonized the width dimension provided here (&#8220;twenty cubits&#8221;) to that given in 1 Kgs 6:2.</p>
