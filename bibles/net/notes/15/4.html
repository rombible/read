<A NAME="46"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=111><b>sn</b> Esarhaddon was king of Assyria ca. 681-669 <sc>b.c.</></p>
<A NAME="47"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=112><b>sn</b> The Assyrian policy had been to resettle Samaria with peoples from other areas (cf. 2 Kgs 17:24-34). These immigrants acknowledged Yahweh as well as other deities in some cases. The Jews who returned from the Exile regarded them with suspicion and were not hospitable to their offer of help in rebuilding the temple.</p>
<A NAME="48"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=113><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;not to you and to us.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="49"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=114><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the people of the land.&#8221; Elsewhere this expression sometimes has a negative connotation, referring to a lay population that was less zealous for Judaism than it should have been. Here, however, it seems to refer to the resident population of the area without any negative connotation.</p>
<A NAME="410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=115><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;were making slack the hands of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=116><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all the days of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=117><b>sn</b> <i>Darius</i> ruled Persia ca. 522-486 <sc>B.C.</p>
<A NAME="413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=118><b>sn</b> The purpose of the opening verses of this chapter is to summarize why the Jews returning from the exile were unable to complete the rebuilding of the temple more quickly than they did. The delay was due not to disinterest on their part but to the repeated obstacles that had been placed in their path by determined foes.</p>
<A NAME="414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=119><b>sn</b> The chronological problems of Ezra 4:6-24 are well known and have been the subject of extensive discussion since ancient times. Both v. 5 and v. 24 describe the reign of Darius I Hystaspes, who ruled Persia ca. 522&#8211;486 <sc>b.c. and in whose time the rebuilt temple was finished. The material in between is from later times (v. 16 describes the rebuilding of the walls, not the temple), and so appear to be a digression. Even recognizing this, there are still questions, such as why Cambyses (530-522 <sc>b.c.) is not mentioned at all, and why events from the time of Xerxes (486-465 <sc>b.c.) and Artaxerxes (464-423 <sc>b.c.) are included here if the author was discussing opposition to the building of the temple, which was finished in 516 <sc>b.c. Theories to explain these difficulties are too numerous to mention here, but have existed since ancient times: Josephus, the first century Jewish historian, rearranged the account to put Cambyses before Xerxes and replacing Artaxerxes with Xerxes (for further discussion of Josephus&#8217; rearrangement see L. L. Grabbe, &#8220;Josephus and the Reconstruction of the Judean Restoration&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 106 [1987]: 231-46). In brief, it seems best to view the author&#8217;s primary concern here as thematic (the theme of opposition to the Jewish resettlement in Jerusalem, including the rebuilding of the temple and restoration of Jerusalem&#8217;s walls) rather than purely chronological. In the previous verses the author had shown how the Jews had rejected an offer of assistance from surrounding peoples and how these people in turn harassed them. The inserted account shows how, in light of the unremitting opposition the Jews experienced (even extending down to more recent times), this refusal of help had been fully justified. Some of the documents the author employed show how this opposition continued even after the temple was rebuilt. (The failure to mention Cambyses may simply mean the author had no documents available from that period.) For detailed discussion of the difficulties presented by the passage and the various theories advanced to explain them, see H. G. M. Williamson, <i>Ezra, Nehemiah</i> (WBC), 56-60.</p>
<A NAME="415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=120><b>sn</b> <i>Ahasuerus</i>, otherwise known as Xerxes I, ruled ca. 486-464 <sc>b.c.</></p>
<A NAME="416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=121><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=122><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And in the days.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=123><b>tn</b> The LXX understands this word as a prepositional phrase (&#8220;in peace&#8221;) rather than as a proper name (&#8220;Bishlam&#8221;). Taken this way it would suggest that Mithredath was &#8220;in agreement with&#8221; the contents of Tabeel&#8217;s letter. Some scholars regard the word in the MT to be a corruption of either &#8220;in Jerusalem&#8221; (i.e., &#8220;in the matter of Jerusalem&#8221;) or &#8220;in the name of Jerusalem.&#8221; The translation adopted above follows the traditional understanding of the word as a name.</p>
<A NAME="419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=124><b>tc</b> The translation reads the plural with the <i>Qere</i> rather than the singular found in the MT <i>Kethib</i>.</p>
<A NAME="420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=125><b>sn</b> Artaxerxes I ruled in Persia from ca. 465&#8211;425 <sc>b.c.</></p>
<A NAME="421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=126><b>tc</b> It is preferable to delete the MT&#8217;s <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ukhÿtav</font>) here.</p>
<A NAME="422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=127><b>sn</b> The double reference in v. 7 to the Aramaic language is difficult. It would not make sense to say that the letter was written in Aramaic and then translated into Aramaic. Some interpreters understand the verse to mean that the letter was written in the Aramaic <i>script</i> and in the Aramaic <i>language</i>, but this does not seem to give sufficient attention to the participle &#8220;translated&#8221; at the end of the verse. The second reference to Aramaic in the verse is more probably a gloss that calls attention to the fact that the following verses retain the Aramaic language of the letter in its original linguistic form. A similar reference to Aramaic occurs in Dan 2:4b, where the language of that book shifts from Hebrew to Aramaic. Ezra 4:8&#8211;6:18 and 7:12-26 are written in Aramaic, whereas the rest of the book is written in Hebrew.</p>
<A NAME="423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=128><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;lord of the command.&#8221; So also in vv. 9, 17.</p>
<A NAME="424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=129><b>sn</b> Like Rehum, Shimshai was apparently a fairly high-ranking official charged with overseeing Persian interests in this part of the empire. His title was &#8220;scribe&#8221; or &#8220;secretary,&#8221; but in a more elevated political sense than that word sometimes has elsewhere. American governmental titles such as &#8220;Secretary of State&#8221; perhaps provide an analogy in that the word &#8220;secretary&#8221; can have a broad range of meaning.</p>
<A NAME="425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=130><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;against.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="426"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=131><b>tn</b> <i>Aram </i>&#8220;then.&#8221; What follows in v. 9 seems to be the preface of the letter, serving to identify the senders of the letter. The word &#8220;from&#8221; is not in the Aramaic text but has been supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="427"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=132><b>tn</b> For the <i>qere</i> of the MT (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1461;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">dehaye</font>&#8217;, a proper name) it seems better to retain the <i>Kethib</i> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dihu</font>&#8217;, &#8220;that is&#8221;). See F. Rosenthal, <i>Grammar</i>, 25, §35; E. Vogt, <i>Lexicon linguae aramaicae</i>, 36.</p>
<A NAME="428"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=133><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;Osnappar&#8221; (so ASV, NASB, NRSV), another name for Ashurbanipal.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Ashurbanipal</i> succeeded his father Esarhaddon as king of Assyria in 669 <sc>B.C. Around 645 <sc>B.C. he sacked the city of Susa, capital of Elam, and apparently some of these people were exiled to Samaria and other places.</p>
<A NAME="429"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=134><b>tc</b> The translation reads with the ancient versions the plural <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1511;&#1467;&#1512;&#1456;&#1497;&#1463;&#1492;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿquryah</font>, &#8220;in the cities&#8221;) rather than the singular (&#8220;in the city&#8221;) of the MT.</p>
<A NAME="430"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=135><b>tn</b> <i>Aram </i>&#8220;beyond the river.&#8221; In Ezra this term is a technical designation for the region west of the Euphrates river.</p>
<A NAME="431"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=136><b>tn</b> The Masoretic accents indicate that the phrase &#8220;to Artaxerxes the king&#8221; goes with what precedes and that the letter begins with the words &#8220;from your servants.&#8221; But it seems better to understand the letter to begin by identifying the addressee.</p>
<A NAME="432"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=137><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;men of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="433"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=138><b>tn</b> The MT takes this word with the latter part of v. 11, but in English style it fits better with v. 12.</p>
<A NAME="434"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=139><b>sn</b> Management of the provinces that were distantly removed from the capital was difficult, and insurrection in such places was a perennial problem. The language used in this report about Jerusalem (i.e., &#8220;rebellious,&#8221; &#8220;odious&#8221;) is intentionally inflammatory. It is calculated to draw immediate attention to the perceived problem.</p>
<A NAME="435"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=140><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;the treasury of kings.&#8221; The plural &#8220;kings&#8221; is Hebrew, not Aramaic. If the plural is intended in a numerical sense the reference is not just to Artaxerxes but to his successors as well. Some scholars understand this to be the plural of majesty, referring to Artaxerxes. See F. C. Fensham, <i>Ezra and Nehemiah</i> (NICOT), 74.</p>
<A NAME="436"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=141><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;we eat the salt of the palace.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="437"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=142><b>tn</b> <i>Aram </i>&#8220;the dishonor of the king is not fitting for us to see.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="438"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=143><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;and we have made known.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="439"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=144><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;the book of the minutes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="440"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=145><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;of your fathers.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="441"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=146><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;discover&#8230;and learn.&#8221; For stylistic reasons this has been translated as a single concept.</p>
<A NAME="442"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=147><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;is a rebellious city.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="443"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=148><b>tn</b> <i>Aram </i>&#8220;revolts they are making in its midst.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="444"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=149><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;from olden days.&#8221; So also in v. 19.</p>

<A NAME="447"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=152><b>tn</b> <i>Aram </i>&#8220;from me was placed a decree.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="448"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=153><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;and they searched and found.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="450"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=155><b>sn</b> The statement that prior Jewish kings ruled over the entire Trans-Euphrates is an overstatement. Not even in the days of David and Solomon did the kingdom of Israel extend its borders to such an extent.</p>
