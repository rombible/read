<A NAME="424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=129><b>sn</b> Like Rehum, Shimshai was apparently a fairly high-ranking official charged with overseeing Persian interests in this part of the empire. His title was &#8220;scribe&#8221; or &#8220;secretary,&#8221; but in a more elevated political sense than that word sometimes has elsewhere. American governmental titles such as &#8220;Secretary of State&#8221; perhaps provide an analogy in that the word &#8220;secretary&#8221; can have a broad range of meaning.</p>
