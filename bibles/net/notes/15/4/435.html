<A NAME="435"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=140><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;the treasury of kings.&#8221; The plural &#8220;kings&#8221; is Hebrew, not Aramaic. If the plural is intended in a numerical sense the reference is not just to Artaxerxes but to his successors as well. Some scholars understand this to be the plural of majesty, referring to Artaxerxes. See F. C. Fensham, <i>Ezra and Nehemiah</i> (NICOT), 74.</p>
