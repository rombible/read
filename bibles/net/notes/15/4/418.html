<A NAME="418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=123><b>tn</b> The LXX understands this word as a prepositional phrase (&#8220;in peace&#8221;) rather than as a proper name (&#8220;Bishlam&#8221;). Taken this way it would suggest that Mithredath was &#8220;in agreement with&#8221; the contents of Tabeel&#8217;s letter. Some scholars regard the word in the MT to be a corruption of either &#8220;in Jerusalem&#8221; (i.e., &#8220;in the matter of Jerusalem&#8221;) or &#8220;in the name of Jerusalem.&#8221; The translation adopted above follows the traditional understanding of the word as a name.</p>
