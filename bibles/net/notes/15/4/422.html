<A NAME="422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=127><b>sn</b> The double reference in v. 7 to the Aramaic language is difficult. It would not make sense to say that the letter was written in Aramaic and then translated into Aramaic. Some interpreters understand the verse to mean that the letter was written in the Aramaic <i>script</i> and in the Aramaic <i>language</i>, but this does not seem to give sufficient attention to the participle &#8220;translated&#8221; at the end of the verse. The second reference to Aramaic in the verse is more probably a gloss that calls attention to the fact that the following verses retain the Aramaic language of the letter in its original linguistic form. A similar reference to Aramaic occurs in Dan 2:4b, where the language of that book shifts from Hebrew to Aramaic. Ezra 4:8&#8211;6:18 and 7:12-26 are written in Aramaic, whereas the rest of the book is written in Hebrew.</p>
