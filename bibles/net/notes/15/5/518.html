<A NAME="518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=178><b>sn</b> Cyrus was actually a Persian king, but when he conquered Babylon in 539 <sc>b.c. he apparently appropriated to himself the additional title &#8220;king of Babylon.&#8221; The Syriac Peshitta substitutes &#8220;Persia&#8221; for &#8220;Babylon&#8221; here, but this is probably a hyper-correction.</p>
