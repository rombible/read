<A NAME="85"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=255><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;those who came later.&#8221; The exact meaning of this Hebrew phrase is uncertain. It may refer to the last remaining members of Adonikam&#8217;s family who were in Babylon. So, for example, H. G. M. Williamson, <i>Ezra, Nehemiah</i> (WBC), 108; cf. NASB, NIV, NCV. The phrase has also been taken to mean &#8220;the younger sons (so NAB), or the ones who &#8220;returned at a later date&#8221; (so TEV).</p>
