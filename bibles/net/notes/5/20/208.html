<A NAME="208"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=833><b>tn</b><i> </i>The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khanakh</font>) occurs elsewhere only with respect to the dedication of Solomon&#8217;s temple (1 Kgs 8:63 = 2 Chr 7:5). There it has a religious connotation which, indeed, may be the case here as well. The noun form (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1504;&#1467;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khanukah</font>) is associated with the consecration of the great temple altar (2 Chr 7:9) and of the postexilic wall of Jerusalem (Neh 12:27). In Maccabean times the festival of Hanukkah was introduced to celebrate the rededication of the temple following its desecration by Antiochus IV Epiphanes (1 Macc 4:36-61).</p>
