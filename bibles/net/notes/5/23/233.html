<A NAME="233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=960><b>sn</b><i> </i>The Hebrew term translated &#8220;assembly&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">qahal</font>) does not refer here to the nation as such but to the formal services of the tabernacle or temple. Since emasculated or other sexually abnormal persons were commonly associated with pagan temple personnel, the thrust here may be primarily polemical in intent. One should not read into this anything having to do with the mentally and physically handicapped as fit to participate in the life and ministry of the church.</p>
