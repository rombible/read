<A NAME="2924"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1197><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the watered with the parched.&#8221; The word &#8220;ground&#8221; is implied. The exact meaning of the phrase is uncertain although it appears to be figurative. This appears to be a proverbial observation employing a figure of speech (a merism) suggesting totality. That is, the Israelite who violates the letter and even spirit of the covenant will harm not only himself but everything he touches &#8211; &#8220;the watered and the parched.&#8221; Cf. CEV &#8220;you will cause the rest of Israel to be punished along with you.&#8221;</p>
