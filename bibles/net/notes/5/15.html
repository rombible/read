<A NAME="151"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=654><b>tn</b><i> </i>The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1496;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿmittat</font>), a derivative of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shamat</font>, &#8220;to release; to relinquish&#8221;), refers to the cancellation of the debt and even pledges for the debt of a borrower by his creditor. This could be a full and final remission or, more likely, one for the seventh year only. See R. Wakely, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 4:155-60. Here the words &#8220;of debts&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text, but are implied. Cf. NAB &#8220;a relaxation of debts&#8221;; NASB, NRSV &#8220;a remission of debts.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="152"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=655><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his neighbor,&#8221; used idiomatically to refer to another person.</p>
<A NAME="153"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=656><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his neighbor and his brother.&#8221; The words &#8220;his brother&#8221; may be a scribal gloss identifying &#8220;his neighbor&#8221; (on this idiom, see the preceding note) as a fellow Israelite (cf. v. 3). In this case the conjunction before &#8220;his brother&#8221; does not introduce a second category, but rather has the force of &#8220;that is.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="154"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=657><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your brother.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="155"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=658><b>tc</b> After the phrase &#8220;the <sc>Lord&#8221; many <sc>mss and versions add &#8220;your God&#8221; to complete the usual full epithet.</p>
<A NAME="156"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=659><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text uses the infinitive absolute for emphasis, which the translation indicates with &#8220;surely.&#8221; Note however, that the use is rhetorical, for the next verse attaches a condition.</p>
<A NAME="157"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=660><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the <sc>Lord your God.&#8221; The pronoun has been used in the translation for stylistic reasons to avoid redundancy.</p>
<A NAME="158"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=661><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text includes &#8220;to possess.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="159"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=662><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;if listening you listen to the voice of.&#8221; The infinitive absolute is used for emphasis, which the translation indicates with &#8220;carefully.&#8221; The idiom &#8220;listen to the voice&#8221; means &#8220;obey.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=663><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;the <sc>Lord your God.&#8221; See note on &#8220;he&#8221; in 15:4.</p>
<A NAME="1511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=664><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;by being careful to do.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=665><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;commanding&#8221; (so NASB); NAB &#8220;which I enjoin you today.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=666><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;one of your brothers&#8221; (so NASB); NAB &#8220;one of your kinsmen&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;a member of your community.&#8221; See the note at v. 2.</p>
<A NAME="1514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=667><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;gates.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=668><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;withdraw your hand.&#8221; Cf. NIV &#8220;hardhearted or tightfisted&#8221; (NRSV and NLT similar).</p>
<A NAME="1516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=669><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;from your needy brother.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=670><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text uses the infinitive absolute before both verbs. The translation indicates the emphasis with the words &#8220;be sure to&#8221; and &#8220;generously,&#8221; respectively.</p>
<A NAME="1518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=671><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;whatever his need that he needs for himself.&#8221; This redundant expression has been simplified in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="1519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=672><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;your eye.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=673><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your needy brother.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=674><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;give&#8221; (likewise in v. 10). </p>
<A NAME="1522"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=675><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;it will be a sin to you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=676><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text uses the infinitive absolute for emphasis, which the translation indicates with &#8220;by all means.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=677><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your heart must not be grieved in giving to him.&#8221; The LXX and Orig add, &#8220;you shall surely lend to him sufficient for his need,&#8221; a suggestion based on the same basic idea in v. 8. Such slavish adherence to stock phrases is without warrant in most cases, and certainly here.</p>
<A NAME="1525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=678><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text uses the infinitive absolute for emphasis, which the translation indicates with &#8220;make sure.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=679><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your brother.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1527"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=680><b>sn</b> Elsewhere in the OT, the Israelites are called &#8220;Hebrews&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">ivriy</font>) by outsiders, rarely by themselves (cf. Gen 14:13; 39:14, 17; 41:12; Exod 1:15, 16, 19; 2:6, 7, 11, 13; 1 Sam 4:6; Jonah 1:9). Thus, here and in the parallel passage in Exod 21:2-6 the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;</font> may designate non-Israelites, specifically a people well-known throughout the ancient Near East as &#8217;<font face="Scholar">apiru</font> or <font face="Scholar">habiru</font>. They lived a rather vagabond lifestyle, frequently hiring themselves out as laborers or mercenary soldiers. While accounting nicely for the surprising use of the term here in an Israelite law code, the suggestion has against it the unlikelihood that a set of laws would address such a marginal people so specifically (as opposed to simply calling them aliens or the like). More likely <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;</font> is chosen as a term to remind Israel that when they were &#8220;Hebrews,&#8221; that is, when they were in Egypt, they were slaves. Now that they are free they must not keep their fellow Israelites in economic bondage. See v. 15.</p>
<A NAME="1528"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=681><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your brother, a Hebrew (male) or Hebrew (female).&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1529"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=682><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;him.&#8221; The singular pronoun occurs throughout the passage.</p>
<A NAME="1530"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=683><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text includes &#8220;from you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1531"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=684><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text uses the infinitive absolute for emphasis, which the translation indicates with &#8220;generously.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1532"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=685><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (the indentured servant introduced in v. 12) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1533"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=686><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;go out from.&#8221; The imperfect verbal form indicates the desire of the subject here.</p>
<A NAME="1534"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=687><b>sn</b> When the bondslave&#8217;s <i>ear </i>was drilled through <i>to the door</i>, the door in question was that of the master&#8217;s house. In effect, the bondslave is declaring his undying and lifelong loyalty to his creditor. The scar (or even hole) in the earlobe would testify to the community that the slave had surrendered independence and personal rights. This may be what Paul had in mind when he said &#8220;I bear on my body the marks of Jesus&#8221; (Gal 6:17).</p>
<A NAME="1535"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=688><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mishneh</font>, &#8220;twice&#8221;) could mean &#8220;equivalent to&#8221; (cf. NRSV) or, more likely, &#8220;double&#8221; (cf. NAB, NIV, NLT). The idea is that a hired worker would put in only so many hours per day whereas a bondslave was available around the clock.</p>
<A NAME="1536"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=689><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;sanctify&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1511;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</font>, <font face="Scholar">taqdish</font>), that is, put to use on behalf of the <sc>Lord.</></p>
<A NAME="1537"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=690><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the Lord.&#8221; The translation uses a pronoun for stylistic reasons. See note on &#8220;he&#8221; in 15:4.</p>
<A NAME="1538"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=691><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;any evil blemish&#8221;; NASB &#8220;any (+ other NAB, TEV) serious defect.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1539"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=692><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;in your gates.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1540"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=693><b>tc</b> The LXX adds <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#963;&#959;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en soi</font>, &#8220;among you&#8221;) to make clear that the antecedent is the people and not the animals. That is, the people, whether ritually purified or not, may eat such defective animals.</p>
