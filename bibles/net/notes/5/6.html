See note on the word &#8220;commandments&#8221; in 5:31.</p>
<A NAME="62"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=306><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;where you are going over to possess it&#8221; (so NASB); NRSV &#8220;that you are about to cross into and occupy.&#8221;</p>

It is clear that these terms are used interchangeably and that their technical precision ought not be overly stressed.</p>
<A NAME="64"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=308><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;commanding.&#8221; For stylistic reasons, to avoid redundancy, &#8220;giving&#8221; has been used in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="65"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=309><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;may multiply greatly&#8221; (so NASB, NRSV); the words &#8220;in number&#8221; have been supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="66"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=310><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fathers&#8221; (also in vv. 10, 18, 23).</p>
<A NAME="67"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=311><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the <sc>Lord, our God, the <sc>Lord, one.&#8221; (1) One option is to translate: &#8220;The <sc>Lord is our God, the <sc>Lord alone&#8221; (cf. NAB, NRSV, NLT). This would be an affirmation that the Lord was the sole object of their devotion. This interpretation finds support from the appeals to loyalty that follow (vv. 5, 14). (2) Another option is to translate: &#8220;The <sc>Lord is our God, the <sc>Lord is unique.&#8221; In this case the text would be affirming the people&#8217;s allegiance to the Lord, as well as the Lord&#8217;s superiority to all other gods. It would also imply that he is the only one worthy of their worship. Support for this view comes from parallel texts such as Deut 7:9 and 10:17, as well as the use of &#8220;one&#8221; in Song 6:8-9, where the starstruck lover declares that his beloved is unique (literally, &#8220;one,&#8221; that is, &#8220;one of a kind&#8221;) when compared to all other women.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Verses 4-5 constitute the so-called <i>Shema</i> (after the first word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shÿma</font>&#8217;, &#8220;hear&#8221;), widely regarded as the very heart of Jewish confession and faith. When Jesus was asked what was the greatest commandment of all, he quoted this text (Matt 22:37-38). </p>
<A NAME="68"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=312><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ahav</font>, &#8220;to love&#8221;) in this setting communicates not so much an emotional idea as one of covenant commitment. To love the <sc>Lord is to be absolutely loyal and obedient to him in every respect, a truth Jesus himself taught (cf. John 14:15). See also the note on the word &#8220;loved&#8221; in Deut 4:37.</p>
<A NAME="69"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=313><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;heart.&#8221; In OT physiology the heart (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1461;&#1489;</font>, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1461;&#1489;&#1464;&#1489;</font>; <font face="Scholar">levav, lev</font>) was considered the seat of the mind or intellect, so that one could think with one&#8217;s heart. See A. Luc, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 2:749-54.</p>
<A NAME="610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=314><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;soul&#8221;; &#8220;being.&#8221; Contrary to Hellenistic ideas of a soul that is discrete and separate from the body and spirit, OT anthropology equated the &#8220;soul&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>) with the person himself. It is therefore best in most cases to translate <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>) as &#8220;being&#8221; or the like. See H. W. Wolff, <i>Anthropology of the Old Testament</i>, 10-25; D. Fredericks, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 3:133-34.</p>
<A NAME="611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=315><b>sn</b> For NT variations on the <i>Shema</i> see Matt 22:37-39; Mark 12:29-30; Luke 10:27.</p>

If from the root I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shanan</font>), the verb means essentially to &#8220;engrave,&#8221; that is, &#8220;to teach incisively&#8221; (Piel); note NAB &#8220;Drill them into your children.&#8221; Cf. BDB 1041-42 s.v.</p>
<A NAME="613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=317><b>tn</b><i> </i>Or &#8220;as you are away on a journey&#8221; (cf. NRSV, TEV, NLT); NAB &#8220;at home and abroad.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=318><b>sn</b> <i>Tie them as a sign on your forearm</i>. Later Jewish tradition referred to the little leather containers tied to the forearms and foreheads as <i>tefillin</i>. They were to contain the following passages from the Torah: Exod 13:1-10, 11-16; Deut 6:5-9; 11:13-21. The purpose was to serve as a &#8220;sign&#8221; of covenant relationship and obedience.</p>
<A NAME="615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=319><b>sn</b><i> Fasten them as symbols on your forehead</i>. These were also known later as <i>tefillin</i> (see previous note) or phylacteries (from the Greek term). These box-like containers, like those on the forearms, held the same scraps of the Torah. It was the hypocritical practice of wearing these without heartfelt sincerity that caused Jesus to speak scathingly about them (cf. Matt 23:5).</p>
<A NAME="616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=320><b>sn</b><i> </i>The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿzuzot</font>) refers both to the door frames and to small cases attached on them containing scripture texts (always Deut 6:4-9 and 11:13-21; and sometimes the decalogue; Exod 13:1-10, 11-16; and Num 10:35-36). See J. H. Tigay, <i>Deuteronomy </i>(JPSTC), 443-44.</p>
<A NAME="617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=321><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;out of the house of slavery&#8221; (so NASB, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=322><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;from the gods.&#8221; The demonstrative pronoun has been used in the translation for stylistic reasons to avoid redundancy.</p>
<A NAME="619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=323><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lest the anger of the <sc>Lord your God be kindled against you and destroy you from upon the surface of the ground.&#8221; Cf. KJV, ASV &#8220;from off the face of the earth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=324><b>sn</b> The place name <i>Massah</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1505;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">massah</font>) derives from a root (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1505;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nasah</font>) meaning &#8220;to test; to try.&#8221; The reference here is to the experience in the Sinai desert when Moses struck the rock to obtain water (Exod 17:1-2). The complaining Israelites had, thus, &#8220;tested&#8221; the <sc>Lord, a wickedness that gave rise to the naming of the place (Exod 17:7; cf. Deut 9:22; 33:8).</p>
<A NAME="621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=325><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;the commandments of the <sc>Lord your God.&#8221; The pronoun has been used in the translation for stylistic reasons to avoid redundancy.</p>
<A NAME="622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=326><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text uses the infinitive absolute before the finite verb to emphasize the statement. The imperfect verbal form is used here with an obligatory nuance that can be captured in English through the imperative. Cf. NASB, NRSV &#8220;diligently keep (obey NLT).&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="627"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=331><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;by a strong hand.&#8221; The image is that of a warrior who, with weapon in hand, overcomes his enemies. The <sc>Lord is commonly depicted as a divine warrior in the Book of Deuteronomy (cf. 5:15; 7:8; 9:26; 26:8).</p>
<A NAME="628"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=332><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;the <sc>Lord.&#8221; See note on the word &#8220;his&#8221; in v. 17.</p>
