<A NAME="2625"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1081><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;so that.&#8221; Verses 18-19 are one sentence in the Hebrew text, but the translation divides it into three sentences for stylistic reasons. The first clause in verse 19 gives a result of the preceding clause. When Israel keeps God&#8217;s law, God will bless them with fame and honor (cf. NAB &#8220;he will then raise you high in praise and renown and glory&#8221;; NLT &#8220;And if you do, he will make you greater than any other nation&#8221;).</p>
