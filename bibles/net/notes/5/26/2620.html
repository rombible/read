<A NAME="2620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1076><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;the sacred thing.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1465;&#1491;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">haqqodesh</font>) likely refers to an offering normally set apart for the <sc>Lord but, as a third-year tithe, given on this occasion to people in need. Sometimes this is translated as &#8220;the sacred portion&#8221; (cf. NASB, NIV, NRSV), but that could sound to a modern reader as if a part of the house were being removed and given away.</p>
