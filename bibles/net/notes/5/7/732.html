<A NAME="732"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=368><b>sn</b> One of the ironies about the promises to the patriarchs concerning offspring was the characteristic barrenness of the wives of the men to whom these pledges were made (cf. Gen 11:30; 25:21; 29:31). Their affliction is in each case described by the very Hebrew word used here (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">aqarah</font>), an affliction that will no longer prevail in Canaan.</p>
