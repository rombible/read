<A NAME="712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=348><b>sn</b> <i>Sacred pillars</i>. The<i> </i>Hebrew word (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1461;&#1489;&#1465;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">matsevot</font>) denotes a standing pillar, usually made of stone. Its purpose was to mark the presence of a shrine or altar thought to have been visited by deity. Though sometimes associated with pure worship of the <sc>Lord (Gen 28:18, 22; 31:13; 35:14; Exod 24:4), these pillars were usually associated with pagan cults and rituals (Exod 23:24; 34:13; Deut 12:3; 1 Kgs 14:23; 2 Kgs 17:10; Hos 3:4; 10:1; Jer 43:13).</p>
