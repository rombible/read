<A NAME="723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=359><b>sn</b> <i>Redeeming you from the place of slavery</i>. The Hebrew verb translated &#8220;redeeming&#8221; (from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">padah</font>) has the idea of redemption by the payment of a ransom. The initial symbol of this was the Passover lamb, offered by Israel to the <sc>Lord as ransom in exchange for deliverance from bondage and death (Exod 12:1-14). Later, the firstborn sons of Israel, represented by the Levites, became the ransom (Num 3:11-13). These were all types of the redemption effected by the death of Christ who described his atoning work as &#8220;a ransom for many&#8221; (Matt 20:28; cf. 1 Pet 1:18).</p>
