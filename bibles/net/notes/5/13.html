<A NAME="131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=591><b>sn</b> Beginning with <b>12:32</b>, the verse numbers through <b>13:18</b> in the English Bible differ from the verse numbers in the Hebrew text (<i>BHS</i>), with <b>12:32</b> ET = <b>13:1</b> HT, <b>13:1</b> ET = <b>13:2</b> HT, <b>13:2</b> ET = <b>13:3</b> HT, etc., through <b>13:18</b> ET = <b>13:19</b> HT. With <b>14:1</b> the verse numbers in the ET and HT are again the same.</p>
<A NAME="132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=592><b>tn</b> This verse highlights a phenomenon found throughout Deuteronomy, but most especially in chap. 12, namely, the alternation of grammatical singular and plural forms of the pronoun (known as <i>Numeruswechsel</i> in German scholarship). Critical scholarship in general resolves the &#8220;problem&#8221; by suggesting varying literary traditions &#8211; one favorable to the singular pronoun and the other to the plural &#8211; which appear in the (obviously rough) redacted text at hand. Even the ancient versions were troubled by the lack of harmony of grammatical number and in this verse, for example, offered a number of alternate readings. The MT reads &#8220;Everything I am commanding you (plural) you (plural) must be careful to do; you (singular) must not add to it nor should you (singular) subtract form it.&#8221; Smr, LXX, Syriac, and Vulgate suggest singular for the first two pronouns but a few Smr <sc>mss propose plural for the last two. What both ancient and modern scholars tend to overlook, however, is the covenantal theological tone of the Book of Deuteronomy, one that views Israel as a collective body (singular) made up of many individuals (plural). See M. Weinfeld, <i>Deuteronomy 1&#8211;11 </i>(AB), 15-16; J. A. Thompson, <i>Deuteronomy </i>(TOTC), 21-23.</p>
<A NAME="133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=593><b>sn</b> <i>Do not add to it or subtract from it</i>. This prohibition makes at least two profound theological points: (1) This work by Moses is of divine origination (i.e., it is inspired) and therefore can tolerate no human alteration; and (2) the work is complete as it stands (i.e., it is canonical).</p>
<A NAME="134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=594><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;or a dreamer of dreams&#8221; (so KJV, ASV, NASB). The difference between a prophet (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">navi</font>&#8217;) and one who foretells by dreams (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1500;&#1461;&#1501;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">o kholem</font>) was not so much one of office &#8211; for both received revelation by dreams (cf. Num 12:6) &#8211; as it was of function or emphasis. The prophet was more a proclaimer and interpreter of revelation whereas the one who foretold by dreams was a receiver of revelation. In later times the role of the one who foretold by dreams was abused and thus denigrated as compared to that of the prophet (cf. Jer 23:28).</p>
<A NAME="135"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=595><b>tn</b> The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514; &#1488;&#1493;&#1465; &#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1508;&#1461;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ot </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">o mofet</font>) became a formulaic way of speaking of ways of authenticating prophetic messages or other works of God (cf. Deut 28:46; Isa 20:3). The NT equivalent is the Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#951;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">shmeion</font>), a sign performed (used frequently in the Gospel of John, cf. 2:11, 18; 20:30-31). They could, however, be counterfeited or (as here) permitted to false prophets by the <sc>Lord as a means of testing his people.</p>
<A NAME="136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=596><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;or dreamer of dreams.&#8221; See note on this expression in v. 1.</p>
<A NAME="137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=597><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;the <sc>Lord your God.&#8221; The pronoun has been used in the translation for stylistic reasons to avoid redundancy.</p>
<A NAME="138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=598><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;all your heart and soul&#8221; (so NRSV, CEV, NLT); or &#8220;heart and being&#8221; (NCV &#8220;your whole being&#8221;). See note on the word &#8220;being&#8221; in Deut 6:5.</p>
<A NAME="139"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=599><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;or dreamer of dreams.&#8221; See note on this expression in v. 1.</p>
<A NAME="1310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=600><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;your midst&#8221; (so NAB, NRSV). The severity of the judgment here (i.e., capital punishment) is because of the severity of the sin, namely, high treason against the Great King. Idolatry is a violation of the first two commandments (Deut 5:6-10) as well as the spirit and intent of the <i>Shema</i> (Deut 6:4-5).</p>
<A NAME="1311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=601><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;your brother, the son of your mother.&#8221; In a polygamous society it was not rare to have half brothers and sisters by way of a common father and different mothers.</p>
<A NAME="1312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=602><b>tn</b> In the Hebrew text these words are in the form of a brief quotation: &#8220;entice you secretly saying, &#8216;Let us go and serve other gods.&#8217;&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=603><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fathers&#8221; (also in v. 17).</p>
<A NAME="1314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=604><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;which you have not known, you or your fathers.&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV; on &#8220;fathers&#8221; cf. v. 18).</p>
<A NAME="1315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=605><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;land&#8221; (so NIV, NCV); the same Hebrew word can be translated &#8220;land&#8221; or &#8220;earth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=606><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text uses the infinitive absolute for emphasis, which the translation indicates with the words &#8220;without fail&#8221; (cf. NIV &#8220;you must certainly put him to death&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=607><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to put him to death,&#8221; but this is misleading in English for such an action would leave nothing for the others to do.</p>
<A NAME="1318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=608><b>sn</b> Execution by means of pelting the offender with stones afforded a mechanism whereby the whole community could share in it. In a very real sense it could be done not only in the name of the community and on its behalf but by its members (cf. Lev 24:14; Num 15:35; Deut 21:21; Josh 7:25).</p>
<A NAME="1319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=609><b>sn</b> Some see in this statement an argument for the deterrent effect of capital punishment (Deut 17:13; 19:20; 21:21).</p>
<A NAME="1320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=610><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;men, sons of Belial.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿliyya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) has the idea of worthlessness, without morals or scruples (<i>HALOT</i> 133-34 s.v.). Cf. NAB, NRSV &#8220;scoundrels&#8221;; TEV, CEV &#8220;worthless people&#8221;; NLT &#8220;worthless rabble.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=611><b>tc</b> The LXX and Tg read &#8220;your&#8221; for the MT&#8217;s &#8220;their.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=612><b>tn</b> The translation understands the relative clause as a statement by Moses, not as part of the quotation from the evildoers. See also v. 2.</p>
<A NAME="1323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=613><b>tc</b> Theodotian adds &#8220;in Israel,&#8221; perhaps to broaden the matter beyond the local village.</p>
<A NAME="1324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=614><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text uses the infinitive absolute for emphasis, indicated in the translation by the words &#8220;by all means.&#8221; Cf. KJV, NASB &#8220;surely&#8221;; NIV &#8220;certainly.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=615><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;put under divine judgment. The Hebrew word (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1461;&#1512;&#1462;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kherem</font>) refers to placing persons or things under God&#8217;s judgment, usually to the extent of their complete destruction.Though primarily applied against the heathen, this severe judgment could also fall upon unrepentant Israelites (cf. the story of Achan in Josh 7). See also the note on the phrase &#8220;divine judgment&#8221; in Deut 2:34.</p>
<A NAME="1326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=616><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;street.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=617><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;mound&#8221;; NAB &#8220;a heap of ruins.&#8221; The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tel</font>) refers to this day to a ruin represented especially by a built-up mound of dirt or debris (cf. Tel Aviv, &#8220;mound of grain&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=618><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;anything that has been put under the divine curse&#8221;;<i> Heb</i> &#8220;anything of the ban&#8221; (cf. NASB). See note on the phrase &#8220;divine judgment&#8221; in Deut 2:34.</p>
<A NAME="1329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=619><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;commanding&#8221; (so NASB, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="1330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=620><b>tc</b> The LXX and Smr add &#8220;and good&#8221; to bring the phrase in line with a familiar cliché (cf. Deut 6:18; Josh 9:25; 2 Kgs 10:3; 2 Chr 14:1; etc.). This is an unnecessary and improper attempt to force a text into a preconceived mold.</p>
<A NAME="1331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=621><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;in the eyes of the <sc>Lord your God.&#8221; See note on the word &#8220;him&#8221; in v. 3.</p>
