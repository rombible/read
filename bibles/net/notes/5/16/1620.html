<A NAME="1620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=713><b>tn</b><i> </i>The Hebrew phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1490; &#1492;&#1463;&#1505;&#1468;&#1467;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khag</font> <font face="Scholar">hassukot</font>, &#8220;festival of huts&#8221; or &#8220;festival of shelters&#8221;) is traditionally known as the Feast of Tabernacles. The rendering &#8220;booths&#8221; (cf. NAB, NASB, NRSV) is now preferable to the traditional &#8220;tabernacles&#8221; (KJV, ASV, NIV) in light of the meaning of the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1467;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sukkah</font>, &#8220;hut; booth&#8221;), but &#8220;booths&#8221; are frequently associated with trade shows and craft fairs in contemporary American English. Clearer is the English term &#8220;shelters&#8221; (so NCV, TEV, CEV, NLT), but this does not reflect the temporary nature of the living arrangement. This feast was a commemoration of the wanderings of the Israelites after they left Egypt, suggesting that a translation like &#8220;temporary shelters&#8221; is more appropriate.</p>
