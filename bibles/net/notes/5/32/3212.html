<A NAME="3212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1300><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elyon</font>) is an abbreviated form of the divine name <i>El Elyon</i>, frequently translated &#8220;God Most High&#8221; (so here NCV, CEV) or something similar. This full name (or epithet) occurs only in Gen 14, though the two elements are parallel in Ps 73:11; 107:11; etc. Here it is clear that Elyon has to do with the nations in general whereas in v. 9, by contrast, Yahweh relates specifically to Israel. See T. Fretheim, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 1:400-401. The title depicts God as the sovereign ruler of the world, who is enthroned high above his dominion.</p>
