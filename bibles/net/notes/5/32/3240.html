<A NAME="3240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1328><b>sn</b> <i>They have made me jealous</i>. The &#8220;jealousy&#8221; of God is not a spirit of pettiness prompted by his insecurity, but righteous indignation caused by the disloyalty of his people to his covenant grace (see note on the word &#8220;God&#8221; in Deut 4:24). The jealousy of Israel, however (see next line), will be envy because of God&#8217;s lavish attention to another nation. This is an ironic wordplay. See H. Peels, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 3:938-39.</p>
