<A NAME="3214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1302><b>tc</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the sons of Israel.&#8221; The idea, perhaps, is that Israel was central to Yahweh&#8217;s purposes and all other nations were arranged and distributed according to how they related to Israel. See S. R. Driver, <i>Deuteronomy </i>(ICC), 355-56. For the MT <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿney yisra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>, &#8220;sons of Israel&#8221;) a Qumran fragment has &#8220;sons of God,&#8221; while the LXX reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#947;&#941;&#955;&#969;&#957; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">angelwn qeou</font>, &#8220;angels of God&#8221;), presupposing <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497; &#1488;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿney </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>) or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497; &#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">beney </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elim</font>). &#8220;Sons of God&#8221; is undoubtedly the original reading; the MT and LXX have each interpreted it differently. MT assumes that the expression &#8220;sons of God&#8221; refers to Israel (cf. Hos. 1:10), while LXX has assumed that the phrase refers to the angelic heavenly assembly (Pss 29:1; 89:6; cf. as well Ps 82). The phrase is also attested in Ugaritic, where it refers to the high god El&#8217;s divine assembly. According to the latter view, which is reflected in the translation, the Lord delegated jurisdiction over the nations to his angelic host (cf. Dan. 10:13-21), while reserving for himself Israel, over whom he rules directly. For a defense of the view taken here, see M. S. Heiser, &#8220;Deuteronomy 32:8 and the Sons of God,&#8221; <i>BSac </i>158 (2001): 52-74.</p>
