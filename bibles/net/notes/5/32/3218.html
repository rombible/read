<A NAME="3218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1306><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in an empty, howling wasteland.&#8221; The word &#8220;howling&#8221; is derived from a verbal root that typically refers to the wailing of mourners. Here it likely refers to the howling of desert animals, or perhaps to the howling wind, in which case one may translate, &#8220;in an empty, windy wasteland.&#8221;</p>
