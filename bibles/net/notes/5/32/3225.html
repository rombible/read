<A NAME="3225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1313><b>tn</b> The form of the suffix on this and the following verb forms (cf. &#8220;lifted him up&#8221;) indicates that the verbs are preterites, not imperfects. As such they simply state the action factually. The use of the preterite here suggests that the preceding verb (cf. &#8220;spread out&#8221;) is preterite as well.</p>
