<A NAME="3269"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=1357><b>tn</b> In the Hebrew text the forms translated &#8220;you will die&#8230;and join&#8221; are imperatives, but the actions in view cannot really be commanded. The imperative is used here in a rhetorical, emphatic manner to indicate the certainty of Moses&#8217; death on the mountain. On the rhetorical use of the imperative see <i>IBHS</i> 572 §34.4c.</p>
