<A NAME="3215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1303><b>tc</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the portion of his inheritance.&#8221; The LXX and Smr add &#8220;Israel&#8221; and <i>BHS</i> suggests the reconstruction: &#8220;The <sc>Lord&#8217;s allotment is Jacob, the portion of his inheritance is Israel&#8221; (cf. NAB). While providing good parallelism, it destroys a fine chiastic structure: &#8220;allotment&#8221; (a), &#8220;his people&#8221; (b), &#8220;Jacob (b&#8217;), and &#8220;inheritance&#8221; (a&#8217;).</p>
