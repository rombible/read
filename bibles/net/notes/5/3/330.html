<A NAME="330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=170><b>sn</b> <i>Maacathites</i>. These were the people of a territory southwest of Mount Hermon on the Jordan River. The name probably has nothing to do with David&#8217;s wife from Geshur (see note on &#8220;Geshurites&#8221; earlier in this verse).</p>
