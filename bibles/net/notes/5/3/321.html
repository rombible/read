<A NAME="321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=161><b>sn</b> <i>Rabbath</i>. This place name (usually occurring as Rabbah; 2 Sam 11:11; 12:27; Jer 49:3) refers to the ancient capital of the Ammonite kingdom, now the modern city of Amman, Jordan. The word means &#8220;great [one],&#8221; probably because of its political importance. The fact that the sarcophagus &#8220;still remain[ed]&#8221; there suggests this part of the verse is post-Mosaic, having been added as a matter of explanation for the existence of the artifact and also to verify the claim as to its size.</p>
