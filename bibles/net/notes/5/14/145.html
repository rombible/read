<A NAME="145"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=626><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;treasured.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1456;&#1490;&#1467;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font><i> </i>(<font face="Scholar">sÿgullah</font>) describes Israel as God&#8217;s choice people, those whom he elected and who are most precious to him (cf. Exod 19:4-6; Deut 14:2; 26:18; 1 Chr 29:3; Ps 135:4; Eccl 2:8 Mal 3:17). See E. Carpenter, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 3:224.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Hebrew term translated &#8220;select&#8221; (and the whole verse) is reminiscent of the classic covenant text (Exod 19:4-6) which describes Israel&#8217;s entry into covenant relationship with the <sc>Lord. Israel must resist paganism and its trappings precisely because she is a holy people elected by the <sc>Lord from among the nations to be his instrument of world redemption (cf. Deut 7:6; 26:18; Ps 135:4; Mal 3:17; Titus 2:14; 1 Pet 2:9).</p>
