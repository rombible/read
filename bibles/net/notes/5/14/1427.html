<A NAME="1427"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=648><b>sn</b> <i>Do not boil a young goat in its mother&#8217;s milk</i>. This strange prohibition &#8211; one whose rationale is unclear but probably related to pagan ritual &#8211; may seem out of place here but actually is not for the following reasons: (1) the passage as a whole opens with a prohibition against heathen mourning rites (i.e., death, vv. 1-2) and closes with what appear to be birth and infancy rites. (2) In the other two places where the stipulation occurs (Exod 23:19 and Exod 34:26) it similarly concludes major sections. (3) Whatever the practice signified it clearly was abhorrent to the <sc>Lord and fittingly concludes the topic of various breaches of purity and holiness as represented by the ingestion of unclean animals (vv. 3-21). See C. M. Carmichael, &#8220;On Separating Life and Death: An Explanation of Some Biblical Laws,&#8221; <i>HTR</i> 69 (1976): 1-7; J.
