<A NAME="2511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1033><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;an.&#8221; By implication this is one&#8217;s own animal.</p>
<A NAME="2512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1034><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;take her as wife&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;taking her in marriage.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1035><b>sn</b> This is the so-called &#8220;levirate&#8221; custom (from the Latin term <font face="Scholar">levir</font>, &#8220;brother-in-law&#8221;), an ancient provision whereby a man who died without male descendants to carry on his name could have a son by proxy, that is, through a surviving brother who would marry his widow and whose first son would then be attributed to the brother who had died. This is the only reference to this practice in an OT legal text but it is illustrated in the story of Judah and his sons (Gen 38) and possibly in the account of Ruth and Boaz (Ruth 2:8; 3:12; 4:6).</p>
<A NAME="2514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1036><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;and it will be that.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1037><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the firstborn.&#8221; This refers to the oldest male child.</p>
<A NAME="2516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1038><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;want to take his sister-in-law, then his sister in law.&#8221; In the second instance the pronoun (&#8220;she&#8221;) has been used in the translation to avoid redundancy.</p>
<A NAME="2517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1039><b>sn</b> The removal of the sandal was likely symbolic of the relinquishment by the man of any claim to his dead brother&#8217;s estate since the sandal was associated with the soil or land (cf. Ruth 4:7-8). Spitting in the face was a sign of utmost disgust or disdain, an emotion the rejected widow would feel toward her uncooperative brother-in-law (cf. Num 12:14; Lev 15:8). See W. Bailey, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 2:544.</p>
<A NAME="2518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1040><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;build the house of his brother&#8221;; TEV &#8220;refuses to give his brother a descendant&#8221;; NLT &#8220;refuses to raise up a son for his brother.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1041><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;called,&#8221; i.e., &#8220;known as.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="2522"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1044><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;a man and his brother.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1045><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;shameful parts.&#8221; Besides the inherent indelicacy of what she has done, the woman has also threatened the progenitive capacity of the injured man. The level of specificity given this term in modern translations varies: &#8220;private parts&#8221; (NAB, NIV, CEV); &#8220;genitals&#8221; (NASB, NRSV, TEV); &#8220;sex organs&#8221; (NCV); &#8220;testicles&#8221; (NLT).</p>
<A NAME="2524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1046><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a stone and a stone.&#8221; The repetition of the singular noun here expresses diversity, as the following phrase indicates. See <i>IBHS</i> 116 §7.2.3c. </p>
<A NAME="2525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1047><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a large and a small,&#8221; but since the issue is the weight, &#8220;a heavy and a light one&#8221; conveys the idea better in English.</p>
<A NAME="2526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1048><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;an ephah and an ephah.&#8221; An ephah refers to a unit of dry measure roughly equivalent to five U.S. gallons (just under 20 liters). On the repetition of the term to indicate diversity, see <i>IBHS</i> 116 §7.2.3c.</p>
<A NAME="2527"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1049><b>tn</b><i> </i>Or &#8220;just&#8221;;<i> Heb</i> &#8220;righteous.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2528"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1050><b>tn</b><i> </i>The Hebrew term translated here &#8220;abhorrent&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1506;&#1461;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">to</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">evah</font>) speaks of attitudes and/or behaviors so vile as to be reprehensible to a holy God. See note on the word &#8220;abhorrent&#8221; in Deut 7:25.</p>
<A NAME="2529"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1051><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;what Amalek&#8221; (so NAB, NRSV). Here the individual ancestor, the namesake of the tribe, is cited as representative of the entire tribe at the time Israel was entering Canaan. Consistent with this, singular pronouns are used in v. 18 and the singular name appears again in v. 19. Since readers unfamiliar with the tribe of Amalekites might think this refers to an individual, the term &#8220;Amalekites&#8221; and the corresponding plural pronouns have been used throughout these verses (cf. NIV, NCV, TEV, CEV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="2530"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1052><b>sn</b> See Exod 17:8-16.</p>
<A NAME="2531"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1053><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220; the <sc>Lord your God.&#8221; The pronoun has been used in the translation for stylistic reasons to avoid redundancy.</p>
<A NAME="2532"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1054><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text includes &#8220;to possess it.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2533"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1055><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;from beneath the sky.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shamayim</font>) may be translated &#8220;heaven(s)&#8221; or &#8220;sky&#8221; depending on the context.</p>
<A NAME="2534"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1056><b>sn</b> This command is fulfilled in 1 Sam 15:1-33.</p>
