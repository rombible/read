<A NAME="1921"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=808><b>sn</b> <i>You will add three more cities</i>. Since these are alluded to nowhere else and thus were probably never added, this must be a provision for other cities of refuge should they be needed (cf. v. 8). See P. C. Craigie, <i>Deuteronomy </i>(NICOT), 267.</p>
