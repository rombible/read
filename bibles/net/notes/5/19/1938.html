<A NAME="1938"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=825><b>sn</b> This kind of justice is commonly called <i>lex talionis</i> or &#8220;measure for measure&#8221; (cf. Exod 21:23-25; Lev 24:19-20). It is likely that it is the principle that is important and not always a strict application. That is, the punishment should fit the crime and it may do so by the payment of fines or other suitable and equitable compensation (cf. Exod 22:21; Num 35:31). See T. S. Frymer-Kensky, &#8220;Tit for Tat: The Principle of Equal Retribution in Near Eastern and Biblical Law,&#8221; <i>BA</i> 43 (1980): 230-34.</p>
