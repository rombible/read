<A NAME="2129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=887><b>sn</b> <i>You have humiliated her</i>. Since divorce was considered rejection, the wife subjected to it would &#8220;lose face&#8221; in addition to the already humiliating event of having become a wife by force (21:11-13). Furthermore, the Hebrew verb translated &#8220;humiliated&#8221; here (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">anah</font>), commonly used to speak of rape (cf. Gen 34:2; 2 Sam 13:12, 14, 22, 32; Judg 19:24), likely has sexual overtones as well. The woman may not be enslaved or abused after the divorce because it would be double humiliation (see also E. H. Merrill, <i>Deuteronomy </i>[NAC], 291).</p>
