<A NAME="2125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=883><b>sn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;send her off.&#8221; The<i> </i>Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shillakhtah</font>) is a somewhat euphemistic way of referring to divorce, the matter clearly in view here (cf. Deut 22:19, 29; 24:1, 3; Jer 3:1; Mal 2:16). This passage does not have the matter of divorce as its principal objective, so it should not be understood as endorsing divorce generally. It merely makes the point that if grounds for divorce exist (see Deut 24:1-4), and then divorce ensues, the husband could in no way gain profit from it.</p>
