<A NAME="2138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=896><b>tc</b> The LXX and Smr read &#8220;to the men,&#8221; probably to conform to this phrase in v. 21. However, since judicial cases were the responsibility of the elders in such instances (cf. Deut 19:12; 21:3, 6; 25:7-8) the reading of the MT is likely original and correct here.</p>
