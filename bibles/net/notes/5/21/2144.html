<A NAME="2144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=902><b>sn</b> The idea behind the phrase <i>cursed by God</i> seems to be not that the person was impaled because he was cursed but that to leave him exposed there was to invite the curse of God upon the whole land. Why this would be so is not clear, though the rabbinic idea that even a criminal is created in the image of God may give some clue (thus J. H. Tigay, <i>Deuteronomy </i>[JPSTC], 198). Paul cites this text (see Gal 3:13) to make the point that Christ, suspended from a cross, thereby took upon himself the curse associated with such a display of divine wrath and judgment (T. George, <i>Galatians </i>[NAC], 238-39).</p>
