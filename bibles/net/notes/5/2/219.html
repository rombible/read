<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=105><b>sn</b> <i>Rephaites</i>. The earliest reference to this infamous giant race is, again, in the story of the invasion of the eastern kings (Gen 14:5). They lived around Ashteroth Karnaim, probably modern <font face="Scholar">Tell Ashtarah</font> (cf. Deut 1:4), in the Bashan plateau east of the Sea of Galilee. Og, king of Bashan, was a Rephaite (Deut 3:11; Josh 12:4; 13:12). Other texts speak of them or their kinfolk in both Transjordan (Deut 2:20; 3:13) and Canaan (Josh 11:21-22; 14:12, 15; 15:13-14; Judg 1:20; 1 Sam 17:4; 1 Chr 20:4-8). They also appear in extra-biblical literature, especially in connection with the city state of Ugarit. See C. L&#8217;Heureux, &#8220;Ugaritic and Biblical Rephaim,&#8221; <i>HTR</i> 67 (1974): 265-74.</p>
