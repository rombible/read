<A NAME="24"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=90><b>sn</b> <i>The descendants of Esau</i> (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;sons of Esau&#8221;; the phrase also occurs in 2:8, 12, 22, 29). These are the inhabitants of the land otherwise known as Edom, south and east of the Dead Sea. Jacob&#8217;s brother Esau had settled there after his bitter strife with Jacob (Gen 36:1-8). &#8220;Edom&#8221; means &#8220;reddish,&#8221; probably because of the red sandstone of the region, but also by popular etymology because Esau, at birth, was reddish (Gen 25:25).</p>
