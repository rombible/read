<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=100><b>sn</b> <i>Elat</i> was a port city at the head of the eastern arm of the Red Sea, that is, the Gulf of Aqaba (or Gulf of Eilat). Solomon (1 Kgs 9:28), Uzziah (2 Kgs 14:22), and Ahaz (2 Kgs 16:5-6) used it as a port but eventually it became permanently part of Edom. It may be what is known today as <font face="Scholar">Tell el-Kheleifeh</font>. Modern Eilat is located further west along the northern coast. See G. Pratico, &#8220;Nelson Glueck&#8217;s 1938-1940 Excavations at Tell el-Kheleifeh: A Reappraisal,&#8221; <i>BASOR</i> 259 (1985): 1-32.</p>
