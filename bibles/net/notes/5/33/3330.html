<A NAME="3330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1391><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;him who resided in the bush&#8221; is frequently understood as a reference to the appearance of the Lord to Moses at Sinai from a burning bush (so NIV, NCV, TEV, CEV, NLT; cf. Exod 2:2-6; 3:2, 4). To make this reference clear the word &#8220;burning&#8221; is supplied in the translation.</p>
