<A NAME="3345"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1406><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and from under, arms of perpetuity.&#8221; The words &#8220;you&#8221; and &#8220;his&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarification. Some have perceived this line to be problematic and have offered alternative translations that differ significantly from the present translation: &#8220;He spread out the primeval tent; he extended the ancient canopy&#8221; (NAB); &#8220;He subdues the ancient gods, shatters the forces of old&#8221; (NRSV). These are based on alternate meanings or conjectural emendations rather than textual variants in the <sc>mss and versions.</p>
