<A NAME="3344"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1405><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;(who) rides (on) the heavens&#8221; (cf. NIV, NRSV, NLT). This title depicts Israel&#8217;s God as sovereign over the elements of the storm (cf. Ps 68:33). The use of the phrase here may be polemical; Moses may be asserting that Israel&#8217;s God, not Baal (called the &#8220;rider of the clouds&#8221; in the Ugaritic myths), is the true divine king (cf. v. 5) who controls the elements of the storm, grants agricultural prosperity, and delivers his people from their enemies. See R. B. Chisholm, Jr., &#8220;The Polemic against Baalism in Israel&#8217;s Early History and Literature,&#8221; <i>BSac</i> 151 (1994): 275.</p>
