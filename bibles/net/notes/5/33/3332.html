<A NAME="3332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1393><b>sn</b> <i>Ephraim</i> and <i>Manasseh</i> were the sons of Joseph who became founders of the two tribes into which Joseph&#8217;s descendants were split (Gen 48:19-20). Jacob&#8217;s blessing granted favored status to Ephraim; this is probably why Ephraim is viewed here as more numerous than Manasseh.</p>
