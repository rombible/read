<A NAME="276"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1089><b>tc</b> Smr reads &#8220;Mount Gerizim&#8221; for the MT reading &#8220;Mount Ebal&#8221; to justify the location of the Samaritan temple there in the postexilic period. This reading is patently self-serving and does not reflect the original. In the NT when the Samaritan woman of Sychar referred to &#8220;this mountain&#8221; as the place of worship for her community she obviously had Gerizim in mind (cf. John 4:20).</p>
