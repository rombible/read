<a name="179"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">79</span><note=79><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the Reed Sea.&#8221; &#8220;Reed&#8221; is a better translation of the Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">suf</font>), traditionally rendered &#8220;red.&#8221; The name &#8220;Red Sea&#8221; is based on the LXX which referred to it as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#961;&#965;&#952;&#961;&#8118;&#962; &#952;&#945;&#955;&#940;&#963;&#963;&#951;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">eruqra&quot; qalassh&quot;</font>, &#8220;red sea&#8221;). Nevertheless, because the body of water in question is known in modern times as the Red Sea, this term was used in the translation. The part of the Red Sea in view here is not the one crossed in the exodus but its eastern arm, now known as the Gulf of Eilat or Gulf of Aqaba.</p>
