This is a figure of speech called a merism (suggesting a whole by referring to its extreme opposites). Other examples are the tree of &#8220;the knowledge of good and evil&#8221; (Gen 2:9), the boy who knows enough &#8220;to reject the wrong and choose the right&#8221; (Isa 7:16; 8:4), and those who &#8220;cannot tell their right hand from their left&#8221; (Jonah 4:11).
