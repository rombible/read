<A NAME="87"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=391><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;manna which you and your ancestors did not know.&#8221; By popular etymology the word &#8220;manna&#8221; comes from the Hebrew phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1503; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">man hu</font>&#8217;), i.e., &#8220;What is it?&#8221; (Exod 16:15). The question remains unanswered to this very day. Elsewhere the material is said to be &#8220;white like coriander seed&#8221; with &#8220;a taste like honey cakes&#8221; (Exod 16:31; cf. Num 11:7). Modern attempts to associate it with various desert plants are unsuccessful for the text says it was a new thing and, furthermore, one that appeared and disappeared miraculously (Exod 16:21-27).</p>
