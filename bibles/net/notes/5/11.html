<A NAME="111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=489><b>tn</b> This collocation of technical terms for elements of the covenant text lends support to its importance and also signals a new section of paraenesis in which Moses will exhort Israel to covenant obedience. The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mishmarot</font>, &#8220;obligations&#8221;) sums up the three terms that follow &#8211; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1467;&#1511;&#1468;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khuqot</font>), <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1496;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mishppatim</font>), and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mitsot</font>).</p>
<A NAME="112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=490><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;that not.&#8221; The words &#8220;I am speaking&#8221; have been supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=491><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;who have not known and who have not seen the discipline of the Lord.&#8221; The collocation of the verbs &#8220;know&#8221; and &#8220;see&#8221; indicates that personal experience (knowing by seeing) is in view. The term translated &#8220;discipline&#8221; (KJV, ASV &#8220;chastisement&#8221;) may also be rendered &#8220;instruction,&#8221; but vv. 2b-6 indicate that the referent of the term is the various acts of divine judgment the Israelites had witnessed.</p>
<A NAME="114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=492><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;which revealed&#8221; have been supplied in the translation to show the logical relationship between the terms that follow and the divine judgments. In the Hebrew text the former are in apposition to the latter. </p>
<A NAME="115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=493><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;his strong hand and his stretched-out arm.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=494><b>tn</b> In the Hebrew text vv. 2-7 are one long sentence. For stylistic reasons the English translation divides the passage into three sentences. To facilitate this stylistic decision the words &#8220;They did not see&#8221; are supplied at the beginning of both v. 3 and v. 5, and &#8220;I am speaking&#8221; at the beginning of v. 7. </p>
<A NAME="117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=495><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his signs and his deeds which he did&#8221; (NRSV similar). The collocation of &#8220;signs&#8221; and &#8220;deeds&#8221; indicates that these acts were intended to make an impression on observers and reveal something about God&#8217;s power (cf. v. 2b). The word &#8220;awesome&#8221; has been employed to bring out the force of the word &#8220;signs&#8221; in this context.</p>
<A NAME="118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=496><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Reed Sea.&#8221; &#8220;Reed Sea&#8221; (or &#8220;Sea of Reeds&#8221;) is a more accurate rendering of the Hebrew expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1501; &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yam suf</font>), traditionally translated &#8220;Red Sea.&#8221; See note on the term &#8220;Red Sea&#8221; in Exod 13:18.</p>
<A NAME="119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=497><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The pronoun has been used in the translation for stylistic reasons to avoid redundancy.</p>
<A NAME="1110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=498><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the Lord destroyed them to this day&#8221; (cf. NRSV); NLT &#8220;he has kept them devastated to this very day.&#8221; The translation uses the verb &#8220;annihilated&#8221; to indicate the permanency of the action.</p>
<A NAME="1111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=499><b>tn</b> See note on these same words in v. 3.</p>
<A NAME="1112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=500><b>sn</b> <i>Dathan and Abiram</i>. These two (along with others) had challenged Moses&#8217; leadership in the desert with the result that the earth beneath them opened up and they and their families disappeared (Num 16:1-3, 31-35).</p>
<A NAME="1113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=501><b>tn</b><i> </i>Or &#8220;the descendant of Reuben&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;son of Reuben.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=502><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;in the midst of all Israel&#8221; (so KJV, ASV, NRSV); NASB &#8220;among all Israel.&#8221; In the Hebrew text these words appear at the end of the verse, but they are logically connected with the verbs. To make this clear the translation places the phrase after the first verb.</p>
<A NAME="1115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=503><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;their houses,&#8221; referring to all who lived in their household. Cf. KJV, ASV, NASB, NIV, NRSV, NLT &#8220;households.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=504><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and all the substance which was at their feet.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=505><b>tn</b> On the addition of these words in the translation see note on &#8220;They did not see&#8221; in v. 3.</p>
<A NAME="1118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=506><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the commandment.&#8221; The singular <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mitsvah</font>, &#8220;commandment&#8221;) speaks here as elsewhere of the whole corpus of covenant stipulations in Deuteronomy (cf. 6:1, 25; 7:11; 8:1).</p>
<A NAME="1119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=507><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;commanding&#8221; (so NASB, NRSV). For stylistic reasons, to avoid redundancy, &#8220;giving&#8221; has been used in the translation (likewise in vv. 13, 27).</p>
<A NAME="1120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=508><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;which you are crossing over there to possess it.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=509><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fathers&#8221; (also in v. 21).</p>
<A NAME="1122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=510><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;you are going there to possess it&#8221;; NASB &#8220;into which you are about to cross to possess it&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;that you are crossing over to occupy.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=511><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;with your foot&#8221; (so NASB, NLT). There is a two-fold significance to this phrase. First, Egypt had no rain so water supply depended on human efforts at irrigation. Second, the Nile was the source of irrigation waters but those waters sometimes had to be pumped into fields and gardens by foot-power, perhaps the kind of machinery (Arabic <font face="Scholar">shaduf</font>) still used by Egyptian farmers (see C. Aldred, <i>The Egyptians</i>, 181). Nevertheless, the translation uses &#8220;by hand,&#8221; since that expression is the more common English idiom for an activity performed by manual labor.</p>
<A NAME="1124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=512><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;which you are crossing over there to possess it.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=513><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;rain of heaven.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=514><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;seeks.&#8221; The statement reflects the ancient belief that God (Baal in Canaanite thinking) directly controlled storms and rainfall.</p>
<A NAME="1127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=515><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;the eyes of the <sc>Lord your God are continually on it&#8221; (so NIV); NASB, NRSV &#8220;always on it.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Constantly attentive to it. </i>This attention to the land by the <sc>Lord is understandable in light of the centrality of the land in the Abrahamic covenant (cf. Gen 12:1, 7; 13:15; 15:7, 16, 18; 17:8; 26:3).</p>
<A NAME="1128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=516><b>sn</b> <i>From the beginning to the end of the year</i>. This refers to the agricultural year that was marked by the onset of the heavy rains, thus the autumn. See note on the phrase &#8220;the former and the latter rains&#8221; in v. 14.</p>
<A NAME="1129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=517><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;if hearing, you will hear.&#8221; The Hebrew text uses the infinitive absolute to emphasize the verbal idea. The translation renders this emphasis with the word &#8220;close.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1130"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=518><b>tn</b> Again, the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ahav</font>) draws attention to the reciprocation of divine love as a condition or sign of covenant loyalty (cf. Deut 6:5).</p>
<A NAME="1131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=519><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;heart and soul&#8221; or &#8220;heart and being.&#8221; See note on the word &#8220;being&#8221; in Deut 6:5.</p>
<A NAME="1132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=520><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;he promises&#8221; do not appear in the Hebrew text but are needed in the translation to facilitate the transition from the condition (v. 13) to the promise and make it clear that the Lord is speaking the words of vv. 14-15.</p>
<A NAME="1133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=521><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the rain of your land.&#8221; In this case the genitive (modifying term) indicates the recipient of the rain.</p>
<A NAME="1134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=522><b>sn</b> <i>The autumn and the spring rains</i>. The &#8220;former&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yoreh</font>) and &#8220;latter&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1511;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;</font>, <font face="Scholar">malqosh</font>) rains come in abundance respectively in September/October and March/April. Planting of most crops takes place before the former rains fall and the harvests follow the latter rains.</p>
<A NAME="1135"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=523><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;grass in your field.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=524><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Watch yourselves lest your heart turns and you turn aside and serve other gods and bow down to them.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1142"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=530><b>tn</b><i> </i>On the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1493;&#1465;&#1496;&#1464;&#1508;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">totafot</font>, &#8220;reminders&#8221;), cf. Deut 6:4-9.</p>
<A NAME="1143"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=531><b>tn</b><i> </i>Or &#8220;as you are away on a journey&#8221; (cf. NRSV, TEV, NLT); NAB &#8220;at home and abroad.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1145"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=533><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;this commandment.&#8221; See note at Deut 5:30.</p>
<A NAME="1146"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=534><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;commanding you to do it.&#8221; For stylistic reasons, to avoid redundancy, &#8220;giving&#8221; has been used in the translation and &#8220;to do it&#8221; has been left untranslated.</p>
<A NAME="1147"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=535><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;walk in all his ways&#8221; (so KJV, NIV); TEV &#8220;do everything he commands.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1148"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=536><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The pronoun has been used in the translation for stylistic reasons to avoid redundancy.</p>
<A NAME="1149"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=537><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;the sole of your foot walks.&#8221; The placing of the foot symbolizes conquest and dominion, especially on land or on the necks of enemies (cf. Deut 1:36; Ps 7:13; Isa 63:3 Hab 3:19; Zech 9:13). See E. H. Merrill, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 1:992.</p>
<A NAME="1150"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=538><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;the after sea,&#8221; that is, the sea behind one when one is facing east, which is the normal OT orientation. Cf. ASV &#8220;the hinder sea.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1151"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=539><b>sn</b> <i>A blessing and a curse</i>. Every extant treaty text of the late Bronze Age attests to a section known as the &#8220;blessings and curses,&#8221; the former for covenant loyalty and the latter for covenant breach. Blessings were promised rewards for obedience; curses were threatened judgments for disobedience. In the Book of Deuteronomy these are fully developed in 27:1&#8211;28:68. Here Moses adumbrates the whole by way of anticipation.</p>
<A NAME="1152"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=540><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;listen to,&#8221; that is, obey.</p>
<A NAME="1153"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=541><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;do not listen to,&#8221; that is, do not obey.</p>
<A NAME="1154"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=542><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;the commandments of the <sc>Lord your God.&#8221; The pronoun has been used in the translation for stylistic reasons to avoid redundancy.</p>
<A NAME="1155"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=543><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;am commanding&#8221; (so NASB, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="1156"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=544><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;walk after&#8221;; NIV &#8220;by following&#8221;; NLT &#8220;by worshiping.&#8221; This is a violation of the first commandment, the most serious of the covenant violations (Deut 5:6-7).</p>
<A NAME="1157"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=545><b>sn</b> <i>Mount Gerizim&#8230;Mount Ebal</i>. These two mountains are near the ancient site of Shechem and the modern city of Nablus. The valley between them is like a great amphitheater with the mountain slopes as seating sections. The place was sacred because it was there that Abraham pitched his camp and built his first altar after coming to Canaan (Gen 12:6). Jacob also settled at Shechem for a time and dug a well from which Jesus once requested a drink of water (Gen 33:18-20; John 4:5-7). When Joshua and the Israelites finally brought Canaan under control they assembled at Shechem as Moses commanded and undertook a ritual of covenant reaffirmation (Josh 8:30-35; 24:1, 25). Half the tribes stood on Mt. Gerizim and half on Mt. Ebal and in antiphonal chorus pledged their loyalty to the <sc>Lord before Joshua and the Levites who stood in the valley below (Josh 8:33; cf. Deut 27:11-13).</p>
<A NAME="1158"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=546><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;River&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but has been supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1159"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=547><b>sn</b> <i>Gilgal</i>. From a Hebrew verb root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">galal</font>, &#8220;to roll&#8221;) this place name means &#8220;circle&#8221; or &#8220;rolling,&#8221; a name given because God had &#8220;rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you&#8221; (Josh 5:9). It is perhaps to be identified with Khirbet el-Metjir, 1.2 mi (2 km) northeast of OT Jericho.</p>
<A NAME="1160"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=548><b>tc</b> The MT plural &#8220;oaks&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">eloney</font>) should probably be altered (with many Greek texts) to the singular &#8220;oak&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">elon</font>; cf. NRSV) in line with the only other occurrence of the phrase (Gen 12:6). The Syriac, <i>Tg. Ps.-J.</i> read <font face="Scholar">mmrá</font>, confusing this place with the &#8220;oaks of Mamre&#8221; near Hebron (Gen 13:18). Smr also appears to confuse &#8220;Moreh&#8221; with &#8220;Mamre&#8221; (reading <font face="Scholar">mwr</font>&#8217;, a combined form), adding the clarification <font face="Scholar">mwl shkm</font> (&#8220;near Shechem&#8221;) apparently to distinguish it from Mamre near Hebron.</p>
