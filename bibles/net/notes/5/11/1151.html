<A NAME="1151"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=539><b>sn</b> <i>A blessing and a curse</i>. Every extant treaty text of the late Bronze Age attests to a section known as the &#8220;blessings and curses,&#8221; the former for covenant loyalty and the latter for covenant breach. Blessings were promised rewards for obedience; curses were threatened judgments for disobedience. In the Book of Deuteronomy these are fully developed in 27:1&#8211;28:68. Here Moses adumbrates the whole by way of anticipation.</p>
