<A NAME="1123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=511><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;with your foot&#8221; (so NASB, NLT). There is a two-fold significance to this phrase.

Aldred, <i>The Egyptians</i>, 181). Nevertheless, the translation uses &#8220;by hand,&#8221; since that expression is the more common English idiom for an activity performed by manual labor.</p>
