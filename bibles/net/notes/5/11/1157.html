<A NAME="1157"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=545><b>sn</b> <i>Mount Gerizim&#8230;Mount Ebal</i>. These two mountains are near the ancient site of Shechem and the modern city of Nablus. The valley between them is like a great amphitheater with the mountain slopes as seating sections. The place was sacred because it was there that Abraham pitched his camp and built his first altar after coming to Canaan (Gen 12:6). Jacob also settled at Shechem for a time and dug a well from which Jesus once requested a drink of water (Gen 33:18-20; John 4:5-7). When Joshua and the Israelites finally brought Canaan under control they assembled at Shechem as Moses commanded and undertook a ritual of covenant reaffirmation (Josh 8:30-35; 24:1, 25). Half the tribes stood on Mt. Gerizim and half on Mt. Ebal and in antiphonal chorus pledged their loyalty to the <sc>Lord before Joshua and the Levites who stood in the valley below (Josh 8:33; cf. Deut 27:11-13).</p>
