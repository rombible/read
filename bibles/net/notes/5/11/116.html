<A NAME="116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=494><b>tn</b> In the Hebrew text vv. 2-7 are one long sentence. For stylistic reasons the English translation divides the passage into three sentences. To facilitate this stylistic decision the words &#8220;They did not see&#8221; are supplied at the beginning of both v. 3 and v. 5, and &#8220;I am speaking&#8221; at the beginning of v. 7. </p>
