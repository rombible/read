<A NAME="113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=491><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;who have not known and who have not seen the discipline of the Lord.&#8221; The collocation of the verbs &#8220;know&#8221; and &#8220;see&#8221; indicates that personal experience (knowing by seeing) is in view. The term translated &#8220;discipline&#8221; (KJV, ASV &#8220;chastisement&#8221;) may also be rendered &#8220;instruction,&#8221; but vv. 2b-6 indicate that the referent of the term is the various acts of divine judgment the Israelites had witnessed.</p>
