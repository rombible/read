<A NAME="117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=495><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his signs and his deeds which he did&#8221; (NRSV similar). The collocation of &#8220;signs&#8221; and &#8220;deeds&#8221; indicates that these acts were intended to make an impression on observers and reveal something about God&#8217;s power (cf. v. 2b). The word &#8220;awesome&#8221; has been employed to bring out the force of the word &#8220;signs&#8221; in this context.</p>
