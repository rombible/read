<A NAME="2416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1010><b>sn</b> <i>What the </i><sc>Lord</><i> your God did to Miriam</i>. The reference is to Miriam&#8217;s having contracted leprosy because of her intemperate challenge to Moses&#8217; leadership (Num 12:1-15). The purpose for the allusion here appears to be the assertion of the theocratic leadership of the priests who, like Moses, should not be despised.</p>
