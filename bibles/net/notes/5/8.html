<BODY ><p>
<A NAME="81"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=385><b>tn</b> The singular term (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mitsvah</font>) includes the whole corpus of covenant stipulations, certainly the book of Deuteronomy at least (cf. Deut 5:28; 6:1, 25; 7:11; 11:8, 22; 15:5; 17:20; 19:9; 27:1; 30:11; 31:5). The plural (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mitsot</font>) refers to individual stipulations (as in vv. 2, 6).</p>
<A NAME="82"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=386><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;commanding&#8221; (so NASB). For stylistic reasons, to avoid redundancy, &#8220;giving&#8221; has been used in the translation (likewise in v. 11).</p>
<A NAME="83"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=387><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;multiply&#8221; (so KJV, NASB, NLT); NIV, NRSV &#8220;increase.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="84"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=388><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fathers&#8221; (also in vv. 16, 18).</p>
<A NAME="85"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=389><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;the <sc>Lord your God.&#8221; The pronoun has been used in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="86"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=390><b>tn</b><i> </i>Or &#8220;wilderness&#8221; (so KJV, NRSV, NLT); likewise in v. 15.</p>
<A NAME="87"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=391><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;manna which you and your ancestors did not know.&#8221; By popular etymology the word &#8220;manna&#8221; comes from the Hebrew phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1503; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">man hu</font>&#8217;), i.e., &#8220;What is it?&#8221; (Exod 16:15). The question remains unanswered to this very day. Elsewhere the material is said to be &#8220;white like coriander seed&#8221; with &#8220;a taste like honey cakes&#8221; (Exod 16:31; cf. Num 11:7). Modern attempts to associate it with various desert plants are unsuccessful for the text says it was a new thing and, furthermore, one that appeared and disappeared miraculously (Exod 16:21-27).</p>
<A NAME="88"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=392><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in order to make known to you.&#8221; In the Hebrew text this statement is subordinated to what precedes, resulting in a very long sentence in English. The translation makes this statement a separate sentence for stylistic reasons. </p>
<A NAME="89"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=393><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the man,&#8221; but in a generic sense, referring to the whole human race (&#8220;mankind&#8221; or &#8220;humankind&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=394><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term may refer to &#8220;food&#8221; in a more general sense (cf. CEV).</p>
<A NAME="811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=395><b>sn</b> Jesus quoted this text to the devil in the midst of his forty-day fast to make the point that spiritual nourishment is incomparably more important than mere physical bread (Matt 4:4; cf. Luke 4:4).</p>
<A NAME="812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=396><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;just as a man disciplines his son.&#8221; The Hebrew text reflects the patriarchal idiom of the culture.</p>
<A NAME="813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=397><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;the commandments of the <sc>Lord your God.&#8221; The pronoun has been used in the translation for stylistic reasons to avoid redundancy.</p>
<A NAME="814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=398><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;by walking in his ways.&#8221; The &#8220;ways&#8221; of the Lord refer here to his moral standards as reflected in his commandments. The verb &#8220;walk&#8221; is used frequently in the Bible (both OT and NT) for one&#8217;s moral and ethical behavior.</p>
<A NAME="815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=399><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;wadis.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=400><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term may refer to &#8220;food&#8221; in a more general sense (cf. NASB, NCV, NLT) or &#8220;bread&#8221; in particular (cf. NAB, NIV, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=401><b>sn</b> <i>A land whose stones are iron</i>. Since iron deposits are few and far between in Palestine, the reference here is probably to iron ore found in mines as opposed to the meteorite iron more commonly known in that area.</p>
<A NAME="818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=402><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;be sure&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text; vv. 12-14 are part of the previous sentence. For stylistic reasons a new sentence was started at the beginning of v. 12 in the translation and the words &#8220;be sure&#8221; repeated from v. 11 to indicate the connection.</p>
<A NAME="819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=403><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;flaming serpents&#8221;; KJV, NASB &#8220;fiery serpents&#8221;; NAB &#8220;saraph serpents.&#8221; This figure of speech (metonymy) probably describes the venomous and painful results of snakebite. The feeling from such an experience would be like a burning fire (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1507;</font>, <font face="Scholar">saraf</font>).</p>
<A NAME="820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=404><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the one who brought out for you water.&#8221; In the Hebrew text this continues the preceding sentence, but the translation begins a new sentence here for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=405><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in order to humble you and in order to test you.&#8221; See 8:2.</p>
<A NAME="822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=406><b>tn</b> For stylistic reasons a new sentence was started at the beginning of v. 17 in the translation and the words &#8220;be careful&#8221; supplied to indicate the connection.</p>
<A NAME="823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=407><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;my strength and the might of my hand.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=408><b>tc</b> Smr and Lucian add &#8220;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,&#8221; the standard way of rendering this almost stereotypical formula (cf. Deut 1:8; 6:10; 9:5, 27; 29:13; 30:20; 34:4). The MT&#8217;s harder reading<i> </i>presumptively argues for its originality, however.</p>
<A NAME="825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=409><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;if forgetting, you forget.&#8221; The infinitive absolute is used for emphasis; the translation indicates this with the words &#8220;at all&#8221; (cf. KJV).</p>
<A NAME="826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=410><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;so you will perish.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=411><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;listen to the voice of the <sc>Lord your God.&#8221; The pronoun has been used in the translation for stylistic reasons to avoid redundancy.</p>
