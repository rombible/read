<A NAME="24"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=90><b>sn</b> <i>The descendants of Esau</i> (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;sons of Esau&#8221;; the phrase also occurs in 2:8, 12, 22, 29). These are the inhabitants of the land otherwise known as Edom, south and east of the Dead Sea. Jacob&#8217;s brother Esau had settled there after his bitter strife with Jacob (Gen 36:1-8). &#8220;Edom&#8221; means &#8220;reddish,&#8221; probably because of the red sandstone of the region, but also by popular etymology because Esau, at birth, was reddish (Gen 25:25).</p>
<A NAME="25"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=91><b>sn</b> <i>Mount Seir</i> is synonymous with Edom.</p>

<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=99><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the way of the Arabah&#8221; (so ASV); NASB, NIV &#8220;the Arabah road.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=100><b>sn</b> <i>Elat</i> was a port city at the head of the eastern arm of the Red Sea, that is, the Gulf of Aqaba (or Gulf of Eilat). Solomon (1 Kgs 9:28), Uzziah (2 Kgs 14:22), and Ahaz (2 Kgs 16:5-6) used it as a port but eventually it became permanently part of Edom. It may be what is known today as <font face="Scholar">Tell el-Kheleifeh</font>. Modern Eilat is located further west along the northern coast. See G. Pratico, &#8220;Nelson Glueck&#8217;s 1938-1940 Excavations at Tell el-Kheleifeh: A Reappraisal,&#8221; <i>BASOR</i> 259 (1985): 1-32.</p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=101><b>sn</b> <i>Ezion Geber</i>. A place near the Gulf of Aqaba, Ezion-geber must be distinguished from Elat (cf. 1 Kgs 9:26-28; 2 Chr 8:17-18). It was, however, also a port city (1 Kgs 22:48-49). It may be the same as the modern site <font face="Scholar">Gezirat al-Fauran</font>, 15 mi (24 km) south-southwest from <font face="Scholar">Tell el-Kheleifah</font>.</p>
<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=102><b>sn</b> <i>Ar</i> was a Moabite city on the Arnon River east of the Dead Sea. It is mentioned elsewhere in the &#8220;Book of the Wars of Yahweh&#8221; (Num 21:15; cf. 21:28; Isa 15:1). Here it is synonymous with the whole land of Moab.</p>
<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=103><b>sn</b> <i>The descendants of Lot</i>. Following the destruction of the cities of the plain, Sodom and Gomorrah, as God&#8217;s judgment, Lot fathered two sons by his two daughters, namely, Moab and Ammon (Gen 19:30-38). Thus, these descendants of Lot in and around Ar were the Moabites.</p>
<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=104><b>sn</b> <i>Emites</i>. These giant people, like the Anakites (Deut 1:28), were also known as Rephaites (v. 11). They appear elsewhere in the narrative of the invasion of the kings of the east where they are said to have lived around Shaveh Kiriathaim, perhaps 9 to 11 mi (15 to 18 km) east of the north end of the Dead Sea (Gen 14:5).</p>
<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=105><b>sn</b> <i>Rephaites</i>. The earliest reference to this infamous giant race is, again, in the story of the invasion of the eastern kings (Gen 14:5). They lived around Ashteroth Karnaim, probably modern <font face="Scholar">Tell Ashtarah</font> (cf. Deut 1:4), in the Bashan plateau east of the Sea of Galilee. Og, king of Bashan, was a Rephaite (Deut 3:11; Josh 12:4; 13:12). Other texts speak of them or their kinfolk in both Transjordan (Deut 2:20; 3:13) and Canaan (Josh 11:21-22; 14:12, 15; 15:13-14; Judg 1:20; 1 Sam 17:4; 1 Chr 20:4-8). They also appear in extra-biblical literature, especially in connection with the city state of Ugarit. See C. L&#8217;Heureux, &#8220;Ugaritic and Biblical Rephaim,&#8221; <i>HTR</i> 67 (1974): 265-74.</p>
<A NAME="220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=106><b>sn</b> <i>Horites</i>. Most likely these are the same as the well-known people of ancient Near Eastern texts described as Hurrians. They were geographically widespread and probably non-Semitic. Genesis speaks of them as the indigenous peoples of Edom that Esau expelled (Gen 36:8-19, 31-43) and also as among those who confronted the kings of the east (Gen 14:6).</p>
<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=107><b>tn</b> Most modern English versions, beginning with the ASV (1901), regard vv. 10-12 as parenthetical to the narrative.</p>
<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=108><b>sn</b> <i>Wadi Zered</i>. Now known as <font face="Scholar">Wadi el-H£esa</font>, this valley marked the boundary between Moab to the north and Edom to the south.</p>
<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=109><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;we crossed the Wadi Zered.&#8221; This has been translated as &#8220;we did so&#8221; for stylistic reasons, to avoid redundancy.</p>
<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=110><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;from the middle of.&#8221; Although many recent English versions leave this expression untranslated, the point seems to be that these soldiers did not die in battle but &#8220;within the camp.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=111><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and it was when they were eliminated, all the men of war, to die from the midst of the people.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=112><b>sn</b> <i>Ar</i>. See note on this word in Deut 2:9.</p>
<A NAME="227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=113><b>sn</b> <i>Lot&#8217;s descendants</i>. See note on this phrase in Deut 2:9.</p>
<A NAME="228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=114><b>sn</b> <i>Rephaites</i>. See note on this word in Deut 2:11.</p>
<A NAME="229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=115><b>sn</b> <i>Zamzummites</i>. Just as the Moabites called Rephaites by the name Emites, the Ammonites called them Zamzummites (or Zazites; Gen 14:5).</p>
<A NAME="230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=116><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;them&#8221;; the referent (the Rephaites) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>

<A NAME="232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=118><b>sn</b> <i>Avvites</i>. Otherwise unknown, these people were probably also Anakite (or Rephaite) giants who lived in the lower Mediterranean coastal plain until they were expelled by the Caphtorites.</p>
<A NAME="233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=119><b>sn</b> <i>Caphtorites</i>. These peoples are familiar from both the OT (Gen 10:14; 1 Chr 1:12; Jer 47:4; Amos 9:7) and ancient Near Eastern texts (Miriam Lichtheim, <i>Ancient Egyptian Literature</i>, 2:37-38; <i>ANET</i> 138). They originated in Crete (OT &#8220;Caphtor&#8221;) and are identified as the ancestors of the Philistines (Gen 10:14; Jer 47:4).</p>
<A NAME="234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=120><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Caphtor&#8221;; the modern name of the island of Crete is used in the translation for clarity (cf. NCV, TEV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=121><b>sn</b> <i>Heshbon</i> is the name of a prominent site (now <font face="Scholar">Tell Hesba&#8222;n</font>, about 7.5 mi [12 km] south southwest of Amman, Jordan). Sihon made it his capital after having driven Moab from the area and forced them south to the Arnon (Num 21:26-30). Heshbon is also mentioned in Deut 1:4.</p>
<A NAME="236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=122><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;under heaven&#8221; (so NIV, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=123><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;from before you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=124><b>sn</b> <i>Kedemoth</i>. This is probably <font face="Scholar">Aleiyan</font>, about 8 mi (13 km) north of the Arnon and between Dibon and Mattanah.</p>
<A NAME="239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=125><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;in the way in the way&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456; &#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">baderekh baderekh</font>). The repetition lays great stress on the idea of resolute determination to stick to the path. <i>IBHS</i> 116 §7.2.3c.</p>
<A NAME="240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=126><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;silver.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=127><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and water for silver give to me so that I may drink.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=128><b>tc</b> The translation follows the LXX in reading the first person pronoun. The MT, followed by many English versions, has a second person masculine singular pronoun, &#8220;your.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=129><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;hardened his spirit&#8221; (so KJV, NASB, NRSV); NIV &#8220;made his spirit stubborn.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=134><b>tc</b> The translation follows the <i>Qere</i> or marginal reading; the <i>Kethib</i> (consonantal text) has the singular, &#8220;his son.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="250"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=136><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;every city of men.&#8221; This apparently identifies the cities as inhabited.</p>
<A NAME="251"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=137><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;under the ban&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1461;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nakharem</font>). The verb employed is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kharam</font>, usually in the Hiphil) and the associated noun is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1461;&#1512;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kherem</font>). See J. Naudé, <i>NIDOTTE</i>, 2:276-77, and, for a more thorough discussion, Susan Niditch, <i>War in the Hebrew Bible</i>, 28-77.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Divine judgment</i> refers to God&#8217;s designation of certain persons, places, and things as objects of his special wrath and judgment because, in his omniscience, he knows them to be impure and hopelessly unrepentant.</p>
<A NAME="252"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=138><b>sn</b> <i>Aroer</i>. Now known as <font face="Scholar">àAraáir</font> on the northern edge of the Arnon river, Aroer marked the southern limit of Moab and, later, of the allotment of the tribe of Reuben (Josh 13:9, 16).</p>
<A NAME="253"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=139><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the city in the wadi.&#8221; This enigmatic reference may refer to Ar or, more likely, to Aroer itself.
