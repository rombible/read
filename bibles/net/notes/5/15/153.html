<A NAME="153"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=656><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his neighbor and his brother.&#8221; The words &#8220;his brother&#8221; may be a scribal gloss identifying &#8220;his neighbor&#8221; (on this idiom, see the preceding note) as a fellow Israelite (cf. v. 3). In this case the conjunction before &#8220;his brother&#8221; does not introduce a second category, but rather has the force of &#8220;that is.&#8221;</p>
