<A NAME="1527"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=680><b>sn</b> Elsewhere in the OT, the Israelites are called &#8220;Hebrews&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">ivriy</font>) by outsiders, rarely by themselves (cf. Gen 14:13; 39:14, 17; 41:12; Exod 1:15, 16, 19; 2:6, 7, 11, 13; 1 Sam 4:6; Jonah 1:9). Thus, here and in the parallel passage in Exod 21:2-6 the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;</font> may designate non-Israelites, specifically a people well-known throughout the ancient Near East as &#8217;<font face="Scholar">apiru</font> or <font face="Scholar">habiru</font>. They lived a rather vagabond lifestyle, frequently hiring themselves out as laborers or mercenary soldiers. While accounting nicely for the surprising use of the term here in an Israelite law code, the suggestion has against it the unlikelihood that a set of laws would address such a marginal people so specifically (as opposed to simply calling them aliens or the like). More likely <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;</font> is chosen as a term to remind Israel that when they were &#8220;Hebrews,&#8221; that is, when they were in Egypt, they were slaves. Now that they are free they must not keep their fellow Israelites in economic bondage. See v. 15.</p>
