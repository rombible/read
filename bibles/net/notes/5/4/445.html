<A NAME="445"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=236><b>sn</b> <i>I invoke heaven and earth as witnesses against you</i>. This stock formula introduces what is known form-critically as a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">riv</font>) or controversy pattern. It is commonly used in the ancient Near Eastern world in legal contexts and in the OT as a forensic or judicial device to draw attention to Israel&#8217;s violation of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s covenant with them (see Deut 30:19; Isa 1:2; 3:13; Jer 2:9). Since court proceedings required the testimony of witnesses, the <sc>Lord here summons heaven and earth (that is, all creation) to testify to his faithfulness, Israel&#8217;s disobedience, and the threat of judgment.</p>
