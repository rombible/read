<A NAME="434"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=225><b>tn</b><i> </i>A <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kur</font>) was not a source of heat but a crucible (&#8220;iron-smelting furnace&#8221;) in which precious metals were melted down and their impurities burned away (see I. Cornelius, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 2:618-19); cf. NAB &#8220;that iron foundry, Egypt.&#8221; The term is a metaphor for intense heat. Here it refers to the oppression and suffering Israel endured in Egypt. Since a crucible was used to burn away impurities, it is possible that the metaphor views Egypt as a place of refinement to bring Israel to a place of submission to divine sovereignty.</p>
