<A NAME="457"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=248><b>tn</b> The translation assumes the reference is to Israel&#8217;s God in which case the point is this: God&#8217;s intervention in Israel&#8217;s experience is unique in the sense that he has never intervened in such power for any other people on earth. The focus is on the uniqueness of Israel&#8217;s experience. Some understand the divine name here in a generic sense, &#8220;a god,&#8221; or &#8220;any god.&#8221; In this case God&#8217;s incomparability is the focus (cf. v. 35, where this theme is expressed). </p>
