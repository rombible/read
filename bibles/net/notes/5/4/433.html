<A NAME="433"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=224><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;under all the heaven.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The OT views the heavenly host as God&#8217;s council, which surrounds his royal throne ready to do his bidding (see 1 Kgs 22:19). God has given this group, sometimes called the &#8220;sons of God&#8221; (cf. Job 1:6; 38:7; Ps 89:6), jurisdiction over the nations. See Deut 32:8 (LXX). Some also see this assembly as the addressee in Ps 82. While God delegated his council to rule over the nations, he established a theocratic government over Israel and ruled directly over his chosen people via the Mosaic covenant. See v. 20, as well as Deut 32:9. </p>
