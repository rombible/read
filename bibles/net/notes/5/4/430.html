<A NAME="430"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=221><b>tn</b> In the Hebrew text the verbal sequence in v. 19 is &#8220;lest you look up&#8230;and see&#8230;and be seduced&#8230;and worship them&#8230;and serve them.&#8221; However, the first two actions are not prohibited in and of themselves. The prohibition pertains to the final three actions. The first two verbs describe actions that are logically subordinate to the following actions and can be treated as temporal or circumstantial: &#8220;lest, looking up&#8230;and seeing&#8230;, you are seduced.&#8221; See Joüon 2:635 §168.<i>h</i>.</p>
