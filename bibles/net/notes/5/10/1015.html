<A NAME="1015"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=470><b>sn</b> <i>Levi has no allotment or inheritance</i>. As the priestly tribe, Levi would have no land allotment except for forty-eight towns set apart for their use (Num 35:1-8; Josh 21:1-42). But theirs was a far greater inheritance, for the <sc>Lord himself was their apportionment, that is, service to him would be their full-time and lifelong privilege (Num 18:20-24; Deut 18:2; Josh 13:33).</p>
