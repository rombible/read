<A NAME="1013"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=468><b>sn</b> <i>The </i><sc>Lord</><i> set apart the tribe of Levi</i>. This was not the initial commissioning of the tribe of Levi to this ministry (cf. Num 3:11-13; 8:12-26), but with Aaron&#8217;s death it seemed appropriate to Moses to reiterate Levi&#8217;s responsibilities. There is no reference in the Book of Numbers to this having been done, but the account of Eleazar&#8217;s succession to the priesthood there (Num 20:25-28) would provide a setting for this to have occurred.</p>
