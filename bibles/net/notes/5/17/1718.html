<A NAME="1718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=744><b>tc</b> Several Greek recensions add &#8220;to place his name there,&#8221; thus completing the usual formula to describe the central sanctuary (cf. Deut 12:5, 11, 14, 18; 16:6). However, the context suggests that the local Levitical towns, and not the central sanctuary, are in mind.</p>
