<A NAME="177"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=733><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;and to the sun,&#8221; thus including the sun, the moon, and other heavenly spheres among the gods. However, Theodotion and Lucian read &#8220;or to the sun,&#8221; suggesting perhaps that the sun and the other heavenly bodies are not in the category of actual deities.</p>
