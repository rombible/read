<A NAME="95"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=416><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;uprightness of your heart&#8221; (so NASB, NRSV). The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsÿdaqah</font>, &#8220;righteousness&#8221;), though essentially synonymous here with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yosher</font>, &#8220;uprightness&#8221;), carries the idea of conformity to an objective standard.<i> </i>The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;</font> has more to do with an inner, moral quality (cf. NAB, NIV &#8220;integrity&#8221;). Neither, however, was grounds for the <sc>Lord&#8217;s favor. As he states in both vv. 4-5, the main reason he allowed Israel to take this land was the sinfulness of the Canaanites who lived there (cf. Gen 15:16). </p>
