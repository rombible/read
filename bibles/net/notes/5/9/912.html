<A NAME="912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=423><b>sn</b> <i>The very finger of God</i>. This is a double figure of speech (1) in which God is ascribed human features (anthropomorphism) and (2) in which a part stands for the whole (synecdoche). That is, God, as Spirit, has no literal finger nor, if he had, would he write with his finger. Rather, the sense is that God himself &#8211; not Moses in any way &#8211; was responsible for the composition of the Ten Commandments (cf. Exod 31:18; 32:16; 34:1).</p>
