<A NAME="1823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=776><b>tc</b> The MT expands here on the usual formula by adding &#8220;from among you&#8221; (cf. Deut 17:15; 18:18; Smr; a number of Greek texts). The expansion seems to be for the purpose of emphasis, i.e., the prophet to come must be not just from Israel but an Israelite by blood.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> &#8220;from your brothers,&#8221; but not referring to actual siblings. Cf. NAB &#8220;from among your own kinsmen&#8221;; NASB &#8220;from your countrymen&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;from among your own people.&#8221; A similar phrase occurs in v. 17.</p>
