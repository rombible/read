<A NAME="1811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=764><b>tn</b><i> </i>Presumably this would not refer to a land inheritance, since that was forbidden to the descendants of Levi (v. 1). More likely it referred to some family possessions (cf. NIV, NCV, NRSV, CEV) or other private property (cf. NLT &#8220;a private source of income&#8221;), or even support sent by relatives (cf. TEV &#8220;whatever his family sends him&#8221;).</p>
