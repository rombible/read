<A NAME="181"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=754><b>tn</b> The MT places the terms &#8220;priests&#8221; and &#8220;Levites&#8221; in apposition, thus creating an epexegetical construction in which the second term qualifies the first, i.e., &#8220;Levitical priests.&#8221; This is a way of asserting their legitimacy as true priests. The Syriac renders &#8220;to the priest and to the Levite,&#8221; making a distinction between the two, but one that is out of place here.</p>
