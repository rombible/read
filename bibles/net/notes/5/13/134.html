<A NAME="134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=594><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;or a dreamer of dreams&#8221; (so KJV, ASV, NASB). The difference between a prophet (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">navi</font>&#8217;) and one who foretells by dreams (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1500;&#1461;&#1501;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">o kholem</font>) was not so much one of office &#8211; for both received revelation by dreams (cf. Num 12:6) &#8211; as it was of function or emphasis. The prophet was more a proclaimer and interpreter of revelation whereas the one who foretold by dreams was a receiver of revelation. In later times the role of the one who foretold by dreams was abused and thus denigrated as compared to that of the prophet (cf. Jer 23:28).</p>
