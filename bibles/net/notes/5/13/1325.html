<A NAME="1325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=615><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;put under divine judgment. The Hebrew word (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1461;&#1512;&#1462;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kherem</font>) refers to placing persons or things under God&#8217;s judgment, usually to the extent of their complete destruction.Though primarily applied against the heathen, this severe judgment could also fall upon unrepentant Israelites (cf. the story of Achan in Josh 7). See also the note on the phrase &#8220;divine judgment&#8221; in Deut 2:34.</p>
