<A NAME="2517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1039><b>sn</b> The removal of the sandal was likely symbolic of the relinquishment by the man of any claim to his dead brother&#8217;s estate since the sandal was associated with the soil or land (cf. Ruth 4:7-8). Spitting in the face was a sign of utmost disgust or disdain, an emotion the rejected widow would feel toward her uncooperative brother-in-law (cf. Num 12:14; Lev 15:8). See W. Bailey, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 2:544.</p>
