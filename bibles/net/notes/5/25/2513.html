<A NAME="2513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1035><b>sn</b> This is the so-called &#8220;levirate&#8221; custom (from the Latin term <font face="Scholar">levir</font>, &#8220;brother-in-law&#8221;), an ancient provision whereby a man who died without male descendants to carry on his name could have a son by proxy, that is, through a surviving brother who would marry his widow and whose first son would then be attributed to the brother who had died. This is the only reference to this practice in an OT legal text but it is illustrated in the story of Judah and his sons (Gen 38) and possibly in the account of Ruth and Boaz (Ruth 2:8; 3:12; 4:6).</p>
