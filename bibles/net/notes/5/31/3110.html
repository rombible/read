<A NAME="3110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1247><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;this law&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but English style requires an object for the verb here. Other translations also supply the object which is otherwise implicit (cf. NIV &#8220;who do not know this law&#8221;; TEV &#8220;who have never heard the Law of the Lord your God&#8221;). </p>
