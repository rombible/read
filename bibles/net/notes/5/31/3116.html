<A NAME="3116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1253><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;he.&#8221; Smr, LXX, and the Targums read the plural &#8220;they,&#8221; which is necessary in any case in the translation because of contemporary English style. The third person singular also occurs in the Hebrew text twice more in this verse, three times in v. 17, once in v. 18, five times in v. 20, and four times in v. 21. Each time it is translated as third person plural for stylistic reasons.</p>
