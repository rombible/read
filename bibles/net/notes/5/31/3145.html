<A NAME="3145"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1282><b>tc</b> The LXX reads, &#8220;as the <sc>Lord promised them, and he will be with you.&#8221; This relieves the problem of Moses apparently promising to be with Joshua as the MT reads on the surface (&#8220;I will be with you&#8221;). However, the reading of the LXX is clearly an attempt to clarify an existing obscurity and therefore is unlikely to reflect the original.</p>
