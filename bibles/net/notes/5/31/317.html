<A NAME="317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1244><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1496;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿmittah</font>), a derivative of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shamat</font>, &#8220;to release; to relinquish&#8221;), refers to the procedure whereby debts of all fellow Israelites were to be canceled. Since the Feast of Tabernacles celebrated God&#8217;s own deliverance of and provision for his people, this was an appropriate time for Israelites to release one another. See note on this word at Deut 15:1.</p>
