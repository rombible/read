<A NAME="101"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=456><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;chest&#8221; (so NIV, CEV); NLT &#8220;sacred chest&#8221;; TEV &#8220;wooden box.&#8221; This chest was made of acacia wood; it is later known as the ark of the covenant.</p>
<A NAME="102"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=457><b>sn</b> <i>The same words</i>. The care with which the replacement copy must be made underscores the importance of verbal precision in relaying the <sc>Lord&#8217;s commandments.</p>
<A NAME="103"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=458><b>sn</b> <i>Acacia wood</i> (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;shittim wood&#8221;). This is wood from the acacia, the most common timber tree of the Sinai region. Most likely it is the species <i>Acacia raddiana</i> because this has the largest trunk. See F. N. Hepper, <i>Illustrated Encyclopedia of Bible Plants</i>, 63.</p>
<A NAME="104"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=459><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (the <sc>Lord) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="105"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=460><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;according to the former writing.&#8221; See note on the phrase &#8220;the same words&#8221; in v. 2.</p>
<A NAME="106"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=461><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;ten words.&#8221; The &#8220;Ten Commandments&#8221; are known in Hebrew as the &#8220;Ten Words,&#8221; which in Greek became the &#8220;Decalogue.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="107"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=462><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The pronoun has been used in the translation for stylistic reasons to avoid redundancy.</p>
<A NAME="108"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=463><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;the <sc>Lord.&#8221; See note on &#8220;he&#8221; earlier in this verse.</p>
<A NAME="109"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=464><b>sn</b> <i>Beeroth Bene-Yaaqan</i>. This Hebrew name could be translated &#8220;the wells of Bene-Yaaqan&#8221; or &#8220;the wells of the sons of Yaaqan,&#8221; a site whose location cannot be determined (cf. Num 33:31-32; 1 Chr 1:42).</p>
<A NAME="1010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=465><b>sn</b> <i>Moserah</i>. Since Aaron in other texts (Num 20:28; 33:38) is said to have died on Mount Hor, this must be the Arabah region in which Hor was located.</p>
<A NAME="1011"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=466><b>sn</b> <i>Gudgodah</i>. This is probably the same as Haggidgad, which is also associated with Jotbathah (Num 33:33).</p>
<A NAME="1012"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=467><b>sn</b> <i>Jotbathah</i>. This place, whose Hebrew name can be translated &#8220;place of wadis,&#8221; is possibly modern <font face="Scholar">Ain Tabah</font>, just north of Eilat, or <font face="Scholar">Tabah</font>, 6.5 mi (11 km) south of Eilat on the west shore of the Gulf of Aqaba.</p>
<A NAME="1013"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=468><b>sn</b> <i>The </i><sc>Lord</><i> set apart the tribe of Levi</i>. This was not the initial commissioning of the tribe of Levi to this ministry (cf. Num 3:11-13; 8:12-26), but with Aaron&#8217;s death it seemed appropriate to Moses to reiterate Levi&#8217;s responsibilities. There is no reference in the Book of Numbers to this having been done, but the account of Eleazar&#8217;s succession to the priesthood there (Num 20:25-28) would provide a setting for this to have occurred.</p>
<A NAME="1014"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=469><b>sn</b> <i>To formulate blessings</i>. The most famous example of this is the priestly &#8220;blessing formula&#8221; of Num 6:24-26.</p>
<A NAME="1015"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=470><b>sn</b> <i>Levi has no allotment or inheritance</i>. As the priestly tribe, Levi would have no land allotment except for forty-eight towns set apart for their use (Num 35:1-8; Josh 21:1-42). But theirs was a far greater inheritance, for the <sc>Lord himself was their apportionment, that is, service to him would be their full-time and lifelong privilege (Num 18:20-24; Deut 18:2; Josh 13:33).</p>
<A NAME="1016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=471><b>tn</b> That is, among the other Israelite tribes.</p>
<A NAME="1017"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=472><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;the <sc>Lord.&#8221; See note on &#8220;he&#8221; in 10:4.</p>
<A NAME="1018"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=473><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;before&#8221; (so KJV, ASV); NAB, NRSV &#8220;at the head of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1019"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=474><b>tn</b> After the imperative these subordinated jussive forms (with prefixed <i>vav</i>) indicate purpose or result.</p>
<A NAME="1020"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=475><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fathers&#8221; (also in vv. 15, 22).</p>
<A NAME="1021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=476><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;the <sc>Lord your God.&#8221; See note on &#8220;he&#8221; in 10:4.</p>
<A NAME="1022"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=477><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to walk in all his ways&#8221; (so KJV, NIV, NRSV); NAB &#8220;follow his ways exactly&#8221;; NLT &#8220;to live according to his will.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=478><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;the <sc>Lord your God.&#8221; See note on &#8220;he&#8221; in 10:4.</p>
<A NAME="1024"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=479><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;heart and soul&#8221; or &#8220;heart and being&#8221;; NCV &#8220;with your whole being.&#8221; See note on the word &#8220;being&#8221; in Deut 6:5.</p>
<A NAME="1025"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=480><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;commanding&#8221; (so NASB, NRSV). For stylistic reasons, to avoid redundancy, &#8220;giving&#8221; has been used in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="1026"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=481><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;the <sc>Lord.&#8221; See note on &#8220;he&#8221; in 10:4.</p>
<A NAME="1027"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=482><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;take delight to love.&#8221; Here again the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ahav</font>, &#8220;love&#8221;), juxtaposed with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bakhar</font>, &#8220;choose&#8221;), is a term in covenant contexts that describes the <sc>Lord&#8217;s initiative in calling the patriarchal ancestors to be the founders of a people special to him (cf. the note on the word &#8220;loved&#8221; in Deut 4:37).</p>
<A NAME="1028"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=483><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text includes &#8220;after them,&#8221; but it is redundant in English style and has not been included in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="1029"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=484><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;circumcise the foreskin of&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV, NRSV). Reference to the Abrahamic covenant prompts Moses to recall the sign of that covenant, namely, physical circumcision (Gen 17:9-14). Just as that act signified total covenant obedience, so spiritual circumcision (cleansing of the heart) signifies more internally a commitment to be pliable and obedient to the will of God (cf. Deut 30:6; Jer 4:4; 9:26).</p>
<A NAME="1030"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=485><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;your neck do not harden again.&#8221; See note on the word &#8220;stubborn&#8221; in Deut 9:6.</p>
<A NAME="1031"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=486><b>tn</b><i> </i>Or &#8220;who executes justice for&#8221; (so NAB, NRSV); NLT &#8220;gives justice to.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1032"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=487><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your praise.&#8221; The pronoun is subjective and the noun &#8220;praise&#8221; is used here metonymically for the object of their praise (the Lord).</p>
<A NAME="1033"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=488><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;heavens.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shamayim</font>) may be translated &#8220;heaven(s)&#8221; or &#8220;sky&#8221; depending on the context.</p>
