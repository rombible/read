<A NAME="345"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1414><b>tc</b> Smr and some LXX <sc>mss read &#8220;they buried him,&#8221; that is, the Israelites. The MT reads &#8220;he buried him,&#8221; meaning in the context that &#8220;the <sc>Lord buried him.&#8221; This understanding, combined with the statement at the end of the verse that Moses&#8217; burial place is unknown, gave rise to traditions during the intertestamental period that are reflected in the NT in Jude 9 and in OT pseudepigraphic works like the <i>Assumption of Moses</i>.</p>
