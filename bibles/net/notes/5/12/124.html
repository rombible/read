<A NAME="124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=552><b>sn</b> <i>Every leafy tree</i>. This expression refers to evergreens which, because they keep their foliage throughout the year, provided apt symbolism for nature cults such as those practiced in Canaan. The deity particularly in view is Asherah, wife of the great god El, who was considered the goddess of fertility and whose worship frequently took place at shrines near or among clusters (groves) of such trees (see also Deut 7:5). See J. Hadley, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 1:569-70; J. DeMoor, <i>TDOT</i> 1:438-44.</p>
