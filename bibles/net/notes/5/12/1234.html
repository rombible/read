<A NAME="1234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=582><b>sn</b> <i>The blood is life itself</i>. This is a figure of speech (metonymy) in which the cause or means (the blood) stands for the result or effect (life). That is, life depends upon the existence and circulation of blood, a truth known empirically but not scientifically tested and proved until the 17th century <sc>a.d. (cf. Lev 17:11).</p>
