<A NAME="56"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=269><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;upon my face,&#8221; or &#8220;before me&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;&#1463;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">al-panaya</font>). Some understand this in a locative sense: &#8220;in my sight.&#8221; The translation assumes that the phrase indicates exclusion. The idea is that of placing any other god before the <sc>Lord in the sense of taking his place. Contrary to the view of some, this does not leave the door open for a henotheistic system where the Lord is the primary god among others. In its literary context the statement must be taken in a monotheistic sense. See, e.g., 4:39; 6:13-15.</p>
