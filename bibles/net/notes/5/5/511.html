<A NAME="511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=274><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;visiting the sin of fathers upon sons and upon a third (generation) and upon a fourth (generation) of those who hate me.&#8221; God sometimes punishes children for the sins of a father (cf. Num 16:27, 32; Josh 7:24-25; 2 Sam 21:1-9). On the principle of corporate solidarity and responsibility in OT thought see J. Kaminsky, <i>Corporate Responsibility in the Hebrew Bible</i> (JSOTSup). In the idiom of the text, the father is the first generation and the &#8220;sons&#8221; the second generation, making grandsons the third and great-grandsons the fourth. The reference to a third and fourth generation is a way of emphasizing that the sinner&#8217;s punishment would last throughout his lifetime. In this culture, where men married and fathered children at a relatively young age, it would not be unusual for one to see his great-grandsons. In an Aramaic tomb inscription from Nerab dating to the seventh century b.c., Agbar observes that he was surrounded by &#8220;children of the fourth generation&#8221; as he lay on his death bed (see <i>ANET</i> 661). The language of the text differs from Exod 34:7, the sons are the first generation, the grandsons (literally, &#8220;sons of the sons&#8221;) the second, great-grandsons the third, and great-great-grandsons the fourth. One could argue that formulation in Deut 5:9 (see also Exod 20:50) is elliptical/abbreviated or that it suffers from textual corruption (the repetition of the words &#8220;sons&#8221; would invite accidental omission). </p>
