<a name="16"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=6><b>tc</b> The prepositional phrase that begins v. 2, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#955;&#8053;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#945;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">dia thn alhqeian</font>, &#8220;because of the truth&#8221;), is missing in a number of significant <span class="smallcaps">mss</span>, among them <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 614 1241 1505 1739 <i>al</i>. However, it looks to be a simple case of homoioteleuton, for v. 1 ends with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#955;&#8053;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#945;&#957;</font>. For some of these <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> it could be an intentional omission, for the sense of the passage is largely the same without the prepositional phrase (the following adjectival participle, in this case, would simply attach itself to the previous <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#955;&#8053;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#945;&#957;</font>). The phrase could thus have been viewed as redundant and for this reason expunged from the text.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> While <i>truth</i> certainly has a doctrinal aspect in this context, the following phrase <i>that resides in us and will be with us forever</i> suggests more than doctrine is involved. A close parallel is John 14:16-17 where Jesus promised his disciples that the Spirit (Paraclete) would be with them forever: &#8220;He remains with you and will be in you.&#8221; The &#8220;truth&#8221; the author speaks of here is a manifestation of the Spirit of Truth who is permanently with the believer.</p>
