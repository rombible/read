<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3><b>tn</b> This phrase may refer to an individual or to a church (or the church at large). Some have suggested that the addressee is a Christian lady named &#8220;Electa,&#8221; but the same word in v. 13 is clearly an adjective, not a proper name. Others see the letter addressed to a Christian lady named &#8220;Kyria&#8221; (first proposed by Athanasius) or to an unnamed Christian lady. The internal evidence of 2 John clearly supports a collective reference, however. In v. 6 the addressee is mentioned using second person plural, and this is repeated in vv. 8, 10, and 12. Only in v. 13 does the singular reappear. The uses in vv. 1 and 13 are most likely collective. Some have seen a reference to the church at large, but v. 13, referring to &#8220;the children of your elect sister&#8221; is hard to understand if the universal church is in view. Thus the most probable explanation is that the &#8220;elect lady&#8221; is a particular local church at some distance from where the author is located.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> 2 John is being written to warn a &#8220;sister&#8221; church some distance away, referred to as <i>an elect lady</i>, of the missionary efforts of the secessionist false teachers (discussed in 1 John) and the dangers of welcoming them whenever they arrive.</p>
