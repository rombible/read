<a name="125"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=25><b>sn</b> The statement <i>This person is the Deceiver and the Antichrist!</i> is a metaphor (metonymy). The author does not mean that each individual is to be identified as the Antichrist. The opponents are compared to the Deceiver (Satan) and the Antichrist since they are accomplishing Satan&#8217;s work and preparing the way for the Antichrist.</p>
