<a name="124"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=24><b>tn</b> This is the same confession as in 1 John 4:2 except the perfect participle used there is replaced by a present participle (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#961;&#967;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">ercomenon</font>) here. It is not clear why the author changed from a perfect participle in 1 John 4:2 to a present participle here. The perfect participle suggests a reference to the incarnation (past). The present participle could suggest a reference to the (future) second advent, but based on the similarity to 1 John 4:2 it is probably best to take it as referring to the incarnation.</p>
