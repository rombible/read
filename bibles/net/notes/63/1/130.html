<a name="130"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=30><b>tn</b> The genitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">tou Cristou</font>, &#8220;of Christ&#8221;) is difficult because it may be understood as objective (the teaching about Christ), subjective (Christ&#8217;s own teaching), or both (M. Zerwick&#8217;s &#8220;general&#8221; genitive [<i>Biblical Greek </i>§§36-39]; D. B. Wallace&#8217;s &#8220;plenary&#8221; genitive [<i>ExSyn</i> 119-21]). An objective genitive (with Christ as the object of the &#8220;apostolic&#8221; teaching) might seem to be the obvious reading in context, especially since verse 7 makes reference to what a person &#8220;confesses&#8221; about Jesus Christ. A good case can also be made for a subjective genitive, however, since other Johannine uses of the genitive following the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#948;&#945;&#967;&#8053;</font> (<font face="Greektl">didach</font>, &#8220;teaching&#8221;) favor a subjective sense here. In John 7:16, 17 Jesus himself refers to &#8220;my teaching&#8221; and &#8220;teaching from me,&#8221; and 18:19 refers to &#8220;his (Jesus&#8217;) teaching.&#8221; Rev 2:14, 15 refers to the &#8220;teaching of Balaam&#8221; and &#8220;the teaching of the Nicolaitans,&#8221; both of which are clearly subjective in context. In the present context, to speak of &#8220;Christ's teaching&#8221; as a subjective genitive would make Christ himself (in the person of the indwelling Spirit) the teacher, and this is consistent with the author&#8217;s position in 1 John 2:27 that the community does not need other teachers. In 1 John 2:27 it is the Paraclete, referred to as &#8220;his anointing,&#8221; who does the teaching. Since the dispute with the opponents concerns the salvific significance of the earthly life and ministry of Jesus, the &#8220;teaching&#8221; here would refer to Jesus&#8217; own teaching (reflected in the Gospel of John) concerning his person and work. Since this is ultimately one with the apostolic eyewitness testimony about Jesus, it is perhaps best to view the genitive here as both objective and subjective (perhaps the author deliberately intended not to be specific).</p>
