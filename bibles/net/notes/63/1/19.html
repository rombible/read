<a name="19"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=9><b>tn</b> &#8220;Some&#8221; is not in the Greek text, but is supplied because the prepositional phrase beginning with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ek</font>) has partitive force. The partitive force of the prepositional phrase here has been taken by some interpreters to mean that the author has found some of the elect lady&#8217;s children who are living according to the truth and some who are not. This is grammatically possible, but the author has merely stated that he knows of some Christians in the church addressed who are &#8220;walking in the truth.&#8221; He does not know for certain that all of them are, and concern over this is probably part of the motivation for writing the letter.</p>
