<a name="139"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=39><b>tc</b> The Byzantine text has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">amhn</font>, &#8220;amen&#8221;) at the conclusion of this letter. Such a conclusion is routinely added by scribes to NT books because a few of these books originally had such an ending (cf. Rom 16:27; Gal 6:18; Jude 25). A majority of Greek witnesses have the concluding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> in every NT book except Acts, James, and 3 John (and even in these books, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> is found in some witnesses). It is thus a predictable variant. Further, the particle is lacking in excellent, early, and diffuse witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A B P <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 33 81 323 1739 1881 <i>al</i> co), rendering its omission the strongly preferred reading. </p>
