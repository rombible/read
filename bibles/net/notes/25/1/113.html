<a name="113"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=13><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lovers.&#8221; The term &#8220;lovers&#8221; is a figurative expression (hypocatastasis), comparing Jerusalem&#8217;s false gods and foreign political alliances to sexually immoral lovers. Hosea uses similar imagery (Hos 2:5, 7, 10, 13). It may also function as a double entendre, first evoking a disconcerting picture of a funeral where the widow has no loved ones present to comfort her. God also does not appear to be present to comfort Jerusalem and will later be called her enemy. The imagery in Lamentations frequently capitalizes on changing the reader&#8217;s expectations midstream. </p>
