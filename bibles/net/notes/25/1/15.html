<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">badad</font>, &#8220;isolation, alone&#8221;) functions as adverbial accusative of state. After verbs of dwelling, it pictures someone sitting apart, which may be linked to dwelling securely, especially of a city or people (Num 23:9; Deut 33:28; Jer 49:31; Ps 4:8 [HT 9]), or to isolation (Lev 13:46; Jer 15:17; 3:28). Applied to personified Jerusalem, it contrasts a possible connotation of dwelling securely, instead stating that Lady Jerusalem is abandoned and connoting that the city is deserted.</p>
