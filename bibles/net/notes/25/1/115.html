<a name="115"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=15><b>tn</b> There is a debate over the function of the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">min</font>): (1) temporal sense: &#8220;after&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 598 s.v. 2.c; BDB 581 s.v. 4.b) (e.g., Gen 4:3; 38:24; Josh 23:1; Judg 11:4; 14:8; Isa 24:22; Ezek 38:8; Hos 6:2) is adopted by one translation: &#8220;After affliction and harsh labor, Judah has gone into exile&#8221; (NIV). (2) causal sense: &#8220;because&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 598 s.v. 6; BDB 580 s.v. 2.f) (e.g., Isa 5:13) is adopted by many English versions: &#8220;Judah has gone into exile because of misery and harsh oppression/servitude&#8221; (cf. KJV, NKJV, RSV, NRSV, NJPS). (3) instrumentality: &#8220;by, through&#8221; (BDB 579 s.v. 2.e): &#8220;Judah has gone into exile under affliction, and under harsh servitude&#8221; (NASB). The issue here is whether this verse states that Judah went into exile <i>after</i> suffering a long period of trouble and toil, or that Judah went into exile <i>because of</i> the misery and affliction that the populace suffered under the hands of the Babylonians. For fuller treatment of this difficult syntactical problem, see D. R. Hillers, <i>Lamentations</i> (AB), 6-7.</p>
