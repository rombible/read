<a name="173"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=73><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qahal</font>, &#8220;assembly&#8221;) does not refer here to the collective group of people assembled to worship the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, but to the place of their assembly: the temple. This is an example of a synecdoche of the people contained (= assembly) for the container (= temple). The intent is to make the violation feel more personal than someone walking into a building.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This is a quotation from Deut 23:3, &#8220;No Ammonite or Moabite or any of his descendants may enter the assembly of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, even down to the tenth generation.&#8221; Jeremiah applies this prohibition against Ammonites and Moabites to the Babylonians who ransacked and destroyed the temple in 587/586 <span class="smallcaps">b.c</span>. This hermeneutical move may be explained on the basis of synecdoche of species (= Ammonites and Moabites) for general (= unconverted Gentiles as a whole). On a different note, the prohibition forbidding Ammonites and Moabites from entering the &#8220;assembly&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">qahal</font>, Deut 23:2-8) did not disallow Gentile proselytes from converting to Yahwism or from living within the community (= assembled body) of Israel. For example, Ruth the Moabitess abandoned the worship of Moabite gods and embraced Yahweh, then was welcomed into the community of Bethlehem in Judah (Ruth 1:15-22) and even incorporated into the lineage leading to King David (Ruth 4:18-22). This Deuteronomic law did not disallow such genuine conversions of repentant faith toward Yahweh, nor their incorporation into the life of the Israelite community. Nor did it discourage Gentiles from offering sacrifices to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> (Num 15:15-16). Rather, it prohibited Gentiles from entering into the tabernacle/temple (= place of assembly) of Israel. This is clear from the reaction of the post-exilic community when it realized that Deut 23:3-5 had been violated by Tobiah the Ammonite who had been given living quarters in the temple precincts (Neh 13:1-9). This is also reflected in the days of the Second Temple when Gentile proselytes were allowed to enter the &#8220;court of the Gentiles&#8221; in Herod&#8217;s temple, but were forbidden further access into the inner temple precincts. </p>
