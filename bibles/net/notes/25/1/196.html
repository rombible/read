<a name="196"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">96</span><note=96><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">salah</font>) occurs only twice in OT; once in Qal (Ps 119:118) and once here in Piel. It is possibly a by-form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">salal</font>, &#8220;to heap up&#8221;). It may also be related to Aramaic <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1500;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sl</font>&#8217;) meaning &#8220;to throw away&#8221; and Assyrian<font face="Scholar"> salu/shalu </font>meaning &#8220;to hurl (away)&#8221; (<i>AHw</i> 1152) or &#8220;to kick up dust, shoot (arrows), reject, throw away?&#8221; (<i>CAD </i>17:272). With people as its object<font face="Scholar"> shalu </font>is used of people casting away their children, specifically meaning selling them on the market. The LXX translates <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">salah</font>) as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#958;&#8134;&#961;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">exhren</font>, &#8220;to remove, lead away&#8221;). Thus God is either (1) heaping them up (dead) in the city square, (2) putting them up for sale in the city square, or (3) leading them out of the city (into exile or to deprive it of defenders prior to attack). The English &#8220;round up&#8221; could accommodate any of these and is also a cattle term, which fits well with the use of the word &#8220;bulls&#8221; (see following note). </p>
