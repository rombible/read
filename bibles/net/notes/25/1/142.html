<a name="142"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=42><b>tc</b> The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest that the second bicola in 1:7 is a late addition and should be deleted. Apart from the four sets of bicola here in 1:7 and again in 2:19, every stanza in chapters 1-4 consists of three sets of bicola. Commentators usually suggest dropping line b or line c. Depending on the meaning of &#8220;days&#8221; in line a (see note on &#8220;when&#8221; earlier in the verse) either line makes sense. The four lines would make sense as two bicola if &#8220;days of&#8221; in line 7a is understood adverbially and 7b as the direct object completing the sentence. Lines 7c-d would begin with a temporal modifier and the rest of the couplet describe conditions that were true at that time. </p>
