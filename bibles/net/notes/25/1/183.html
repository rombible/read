<a name="183"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">83</span><note=83><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;which was afflicted on me.&#8221; The Polal of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alal</font>) gives the passive voice of the Polel. The Polel of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alal</font>) occurs ten times in the Bible, appearing in agricultural passages for gleaning or some other harvest activity and also in military passages. Jer 6:9 plays on this by comparing an attack to gleaning. The relationship between the meaning in the two types of contexts is unclear, but the very neutral rendering &#8220;to treat&#8221; in some dictionaries and translations misses the nuance appropriate to the military setting. Indeed it is not at all feasible in a passage like Judges 20:45 where &#8220;they treated them on the highway&#8221; would make no sense but &#8220;they mowed them down on the highway&#8221; would fit the context. Accordingly the verb is sometimes rendered &#8220;treat&#8221; or &#8220;deal severely,&#8221; as <i>HALOT</i> 834 s.v. poel.3 suggests for Lam 3:51, although simply suggesting &#8220;to deal with&#8221; in Lam 1:22 and 2:20. A more injurious nuance is given to the translation here and in 1:22; 2:20 and 3:51. </p>
