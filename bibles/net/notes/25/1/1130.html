<a name="1130"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">130</span><note=130><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1461;&#1489;&#1461;&#1488;&#1514;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">heve</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ta</font>) Hiphil perfect 2nd person masculine singular from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bo</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to bring&#8221; in the Hiphil) probably functions, not as a simple past-time perfect, but as a precative perfect, an unusual volitional nuance similar to the imperative of request. The precative is used in reference to situations the speaker prays for and expects to be realized; it is a prayer or request of confidence (e.g., 2 Sam 7:29; Job 21:16; 22:18; Pss 3:8; 4:2; 7:7; 22:22; 31:5-6; 71:3; Lam 1:21). See <i>IBHS</i> 494-95 §30.5.4c, d. This volitional precative nuance is reflected in the Syriac Peshitta which translates this verb using an imperative. Most English versions adopt the precative nuance: &#8220;Bring on the day you have announced&#8221; (NRSV), &#8220;Oh, that Thou wouldst bring the day which Thou hast proclaimed&#8221; (NASB), &#8220;May you bring the day you have announced&#8221; (NIV), &#8220;Bring the day you promised&#8221; (TEV), &#8220;Oh, bring on them what befell me!&#8221; (NJPS), &#8220;Hurry and punish them, as you have promised&#8221; (CEV). A few English versions adopt a prophetic perfect future-time nuance: &#8220;thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called&#8221; (KJV, NKJV, ASV).</p>
