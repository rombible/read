<a name="140"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=40><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the days of her poverty and her homelessness,&#8221; or &#8220;the days of her affliction and wandering.&#8221; The plural construct <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1502;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿme</font>, &#8220;days of&#8221;) functions in the general sense &#8220;the time of&#8221; or &#8220;when,&#8221; envisioning the time period in which this occurred. The principal question is whether the phrase is a direct object or an adverb. If a direct object, she remembers either the season when the process happened or she remembers, i.e. reflects on, her current season of life. An adverbial sense, &#8220;during&#8221; or &#8220;throughout&#8221; normally occurs with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kol</font>, &#8220;all&#8221;) in the phrase &#8220;all the days of&#8230;&#8221; but may also occur without <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kol</font>) in poetry as in Job 10:20. The adverbial sense would be translated &#8220;during her poor homeless days.&#8221; Treating &#8220;days&#8221; adverbially makes better sense with line 7b, whereas treating &#8220;days&#8221; as a direct object makes better sense with line 7c. </p>
