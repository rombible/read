<a name="171"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=71><b>sn</b> Lam 1-2 has two speaking voices: a third person voice reporting the horrific reality of Jerusalem&#8217;s suffering and Jerusalem&#8217;s voice. See W. F. Lanahan, &#8220;The Speaking Voice in the Book of Lamentations&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 93 (1974): 41-49. The reporting voice has been addressing the listener, referring to the Lord in the third person. Here he switches to a second person address to God, also changing the wording of the following command to second person. The revulsion of the Reporter is so great that he is moved to address God directly. </p>
