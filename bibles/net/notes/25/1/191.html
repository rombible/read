<a name="191"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">91</span><note=91><b>tc</b> The MT reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alu</font>, &#8220;they went up&#8221;), Qal perfect 3rd person common plural from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alah</font>, &#8220;to go up&#8221;). However, several important recensions of the LXX reflect an alternate vocalization tradition: Lucian and Symmachus both reflect a <i>Vorlage</i> of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1467;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ullo</font>, &#8220;his yoke&#8221;), the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1465;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ol</font>, &#8220;yoke&#8221;) + 3rd person masculine singular suffix. The Lucianic recension was aimed at bringing the LXX into closer conformity to the Hebrew; therefore, this is an important textual witness. Internal evidence favors the readings of Lucian and Symmachus as well: the entire stanza focuses on the repeated theme of the &#8220;yoke&#8221; of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. The MT reading is obscure in meaning, and the 3rd person common plural form violates the syntactical flow: &#8220;[my sins] are lashed together by <i>his</i> hand; <i>they</i> have gone up upon my neck, <i>he</i> has weakened my strength; <i>the </i><span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has handed me over &#8230;.&#8221; On the other hand, the Lucian/Symmachus reflects contextual congruence: &#8220;My sins are bound around my neck like a <i>yoke</i>, they are <i>lashed together</i> by his hand; <i>his yoke</i> is upon my neck, he has weakened my strength; he has handed me over to those whom I am powerless to resist.&#8221;</p>
