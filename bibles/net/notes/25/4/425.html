<A NAME="425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=415><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;Nazirites&#8221; (so KJV). The Nazirites were consecrated under a vow to refrain from wine, contact with the dead, and from cutting their hair. In Gen 49:26 and Deut 33:16 Joseph, who was not a Nazirite, is called the &#8220;Nazir&#8221; of his brothers. From context, many translate this as &#8220;prince&#8221; (e.g., NAB, NIV, NRSV, NLT), though the nuance is uncertain. If it is valid, then princes might be understood in this context as well.</p>
