<A NAME="426"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=416><b>tn</b><i> </i>The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1494;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gizrah</font>) is used primarily in Ezekiel 41-42 (seven of its nine uses), where it refers to a separated area of the temple complex described in Ezekiel&#8217;s vision. It is not used of people other than here. Probably based on the reference to a precious stone BDB 160 s.v. 1 postulated that it refers to the cutting or polishing of precious stones, but this is conjecture. The English versions handle this variously. D. R. Hillers suggests beards, hair, or eyebrows based on other ancient Near Eastern comparisons between lapis lazuli and the body (<i>Lamentations</i> [AB], 81). </p>
