<A NAME="473"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=463><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;will be completed.&#8221; The perfect tense verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tam</font>), Qal perfect 3rd person masculine singular from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tamam</font>, &#8220;to be complete&#8221;), could be taken as a precative perfect expressing a request (&#8220;may your punishment be complete&#8221;). The translation understands it as an example of the so-called &#8220;prophetic perfect.&#8221; The perfect tense often describes actions that are viewed as complete (normally past- or present-time events). When the perfect tense describes a future event, it often depicts it as &#8220;complete,&#8221; that is, &#8220;as good as done&#8221; or certain to take place from the viewpoint of the prophet. Thus, by using the perfect tense, Jeremiah may be emphasizing the certainty that the exile will eventually come to an end. It has also been viewed as a simple perfect &#8220;your punishment is ended.&#8221;</p>
