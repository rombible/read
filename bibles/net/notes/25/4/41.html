<A NAME="41"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=391><b>sn</b> According to W. F. Lanahan (&#8220;The Speaking Voice in the Book of Lamentations&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 93 [1974]: 48), the persona or speaking voice in chap. 4 is a bourgeois, the common man. This voice is somewhat akin to the Reporter in chs 1-2 in that much of the description is in the third person. However, &#8220;the bourgeois has some sense of identity with his fellow-citizens&#8221; seen in the shift to the first person plural. The alphabetic acrostic structure reduces to two bicola per letter. The first letter of only the first line in each stanza spells the acrostic. </p>
