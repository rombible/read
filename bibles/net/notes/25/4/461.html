<A NAME="461"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=451><b>tn</b> The bird referred to here could be one of several species of eagles, but more likely is the griffin-vulture (cf. NEB &#8220;vultures&#8221;). However, because eagles are more commonly associated with swiftness than vultures in contemporary English, &#8220;eagles&#8221; was used in the translation. </p>
