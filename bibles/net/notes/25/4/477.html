<A NAME="477"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=467><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avon</font>) is repeated twice in this verse: its first occurrence means &#8220;punishment for iniquity&#8221; (v. 22a), and its second usage means &#8220;iniquity&#8221; (v. 22b). See preceding translator&#8217;s note on the broad range of meanings of this word. The repetition of the same root with different meanings creates an ironic polysemantic wordplay: Zion&#8217;s &#8220;punishment&#8221; for its sin is about to come to an end; however, the punishment for Edom&#8217;s &#8220;sin&#8221; is about to begin.</p>
