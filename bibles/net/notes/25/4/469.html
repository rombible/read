<A NAME="469"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=459><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;the cup.&#8221; Judgment is often depicted as a cup of wine that God forces a person to drink, causing him to lose consciousness, red wine drooling out of his mouth &#8211; resembling corpses lying on the ground as a result of the actual onslaught of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s judgment. The drunkard will reel and stagger, causing bodily injury to himself &#8211; an apt metaphor to describe the devastating effects of God&#8217;s judgment. Just as a cup of poison kills all those who are forced to drink it, the cup of God&#8217;s wrath destroys all those who must drink it (e.g., Ps 75:9; Isa 51:17, 22; Jer 25:15, 17, 28; 49:12; 51:7; Lam 4:21; Ezek 23:33; Hab 2:16).</p>
