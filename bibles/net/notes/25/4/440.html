<A NAME="440"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=430><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;has completed.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">killah</font>), Piel perfect 3rd person masculine singular from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kalah</font>, &#8220;to complete&#8221;), has a range of closely related meanings: (1) &#8220;to complete, bring to an end,&#8221; (2) &#8220;to accomplish, finish, cease,&#8221; (3) &#8220;to use up, exhaust, consume.&#8221; Used in reference to God&#8217;s wrath, it describes God unleashing his full measure of anger so that divine justice is satisfied. This is handled admirably by several English versions: &#8220;The <sc>Lord has given full vent to his wrath&#8221; (NIV), &#8220;The <sc>Lord gave full vent to his wrath&#8221; (RSV, NRSV), &#8220;The <sc>Lord vented all his fury&#8221; (NJPS), &#8220;The <sc>Lord turned loose the full force of his fury&#8221; (TEV). Others miss the mark: &#8220;The <sc>Lord has accomplished his wrath/fury&#8221; (KJV, NKJV, ASV, NASB).</p>
