<A NAME="367"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=323><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;him.&#8221; The speaking voice in this chapter continues to be that of the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gever</font>, &#8220;man&#8221;). The image of female Jerusalem in chs. 1-2 was fluid, being able to refer to the city or its inhabitants, both female and male. So too the &#8220;defeated soldier&#8221; or &#8220;everyman&#8221; (see note at 3:1 on &#8220;man&#8221;) is fluid and can represent any member of the Jewish community, male and female. This line especially has a proverbial character which can be extended to any person, hence the translation. But masculine pronouns are otherwise maintained reflecting the Hebrew grammatical system and the speaking voice of the poem. </p>
