<A NAME="379"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">79</span><note=335><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;prisoners of earth/land.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1512;&#1510;</font> may refer to (1) the earth or (2) a country or (3) the promised land in particular (as well as other referents). &#8220;Earth&#8221; is chosen here since the context presents God&#8217;s general principles in dealing with humanity. Given the historical circumstances, however, prisoners from the land of Israel are certainly in the background. </p>
