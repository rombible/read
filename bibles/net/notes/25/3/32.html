<A NAME="32"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=258><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gever</font>, &#8220;man&#8221;) refers to a strong man, distinguished from women, children, and other non-combatants whom he is to defend. According to W. F. Lanahan the speaking voice in this chapter is that of a defeated soldier (&#8220;The Speaking Voice in the Book of Lamentations&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 93 [1974]: 41-49.) F. W. Dobbs-Allsopp (<i>Lamentations</i> [IBC], 108) argues that is the voice of an &#8220;everyman&#8221; although &#8220;one might not unreasonably suppose that some archetypal communal figure like the king does in fact stand in the distant background.&#8221;</p>
