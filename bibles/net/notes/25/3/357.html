<A NAME="357"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=313><b>tn</b> The adjective <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rav</font>) has a broad range of meanings: (1) quantitative: &#8220;much, numerous, many (with plurals), abundant, enough, exceedingly&#8221; and (2) less often in a qualitative sense: &#8220;great&#8221; (a) of space and location, (b) &#8220;strong&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;weak&#8221; and (c) &#8220;major.&#8221; The traditional translation, &#8220;great is thy faithfulness,&#8221; is less likely than the quantitative sense: &#8220;your faithfulness is abundant&#8221; [or, &#8220;plentiful&#8221;]. NJPS is on target in its translation: &#8220;Ample is your grace!&#8221;</p>
