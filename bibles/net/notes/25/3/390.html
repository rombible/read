<A NAME="390"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">90</span><note=346><b>tc</b> The MT reads the singular noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1489;&#1461;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿvavenu</font>, &#8220;our heart&#8221;) but the ancient versions (LXX, Aramaic Targum, Latin Vulgate) and many medieval Hebrew <sc>mss read the plural noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1489;&#1461;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿvavenu</font>, &#8220;our hearts&#8221;). Hebrew regularly places plural pronouns on singular nouns used as a collective (135 times on the singular &#8220;heart&#8221; and only twice on the plural &#8220;hearts&#8221;). The plural &#8220;hearts&#8221; in any Hebrew construction is actually rather rare. The LXX renders similar Hebrew constructions (singular &#8220;heart&#8221; plus a plural pronoun) with the plural &#8220;hearts&#8221; about 1/3 of the time, therefore it cannot be considered evidence for the reading. The Vulgate may have been influenced by the LXX. Although a distributive sense is appropriate for a much higher percentage of passages using the plural &#8220;hearts&#8221; in the LXX, no clear reason for the differentiation in the LXX has emerged. Likely the singular Hebrew form is original but the meaning is best represented in English with the plural. </p>
