<A NAME="33"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=259><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>, &#8220;to see&#8221;) has a broad range of meanings, including (1) &#8220;to see&#8221; as to learn from experience and (2) &#8220;to see&#8221; as to experience (e.g., Gen 20:10; Ps 89:49; Eccl 5:17; Jer 5:12; 14:13; 20:18; 42:14; Zeph 3:15). Here it means that the speaker has experienced these things. The same Hebrew verb occurs in 2:20 where the Lord is asked to &#8220;see&#8221; (translated &#8220;Consider!&#8221;), although it is difficult to maintain this connection in an English translation.</p>
