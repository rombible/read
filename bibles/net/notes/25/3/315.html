<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=271><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">garad</font>) has a two-fold range of meanings: (1) &#8220;to build up a wall&#8221; with stones, and (2) &#8220;to block a road&#8221; with a wall of stones. The imagery depicts the <sc>Lord building a wall to seal off personified Jerusalem with no way of escape out of the city, or the <sc>Lord blocking the road of escape. Siege imagery prevails in 3:4-6, but 3:7-9 pictures an unsuccessful escape that is thwarted due to blocked roads in 3:7 and 3:9.</p>
