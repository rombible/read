<A NAME="35"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=261><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nahag</font>) describes the process of directing (usually a group of) something along a route, hence commonly &#8220;to drive,&#8221; when describing flocks, caravans, or prisoners and spoils of war (1 Sam 23:5; 30:2). But with people it may also have a positive connotation &#8220;to shepherd&#8221; or &#8220;to guide&#8221; (Ps 48:14; 80:1). The line plays on this through the reversal of expectations. Rather than being safely shepherded by the Lord their king, he has driven them away into captivity.</p>
