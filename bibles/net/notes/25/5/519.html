<A NAME="519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=487><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;slaves.&#8221; While indicating that social structures are awry, the expression &#8220;slaves rule over us&#8221; might be an idiom for &#8220;tyrants rule over us.&#8221; This might find its counterpart in the gnomic truth that the most ruthless rulers are made of former slaves: &#8220;Under three things the earth quakes, under four it cannot bear up: under a slave when he becomes king&#8221; (Prov 30:21-22a).</p>
