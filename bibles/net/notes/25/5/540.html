<A NAME="540"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=508><b>tn</b> The compound conjunction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497; &#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>) functions to limit the preceding clause: &#8220;unless, or&#8230;&#8221; (e.g., Ruth 3:18; Isa 65:6; Amos 3:7) (BDB 474 s.v. 2.a): &#8220;Bring us back to yourself&#8230; <i>unless</i> you have utterly rejected us&#8221; (as in the present translation) or &#8220;Bring us back to yourself&#8230;<i>Or</i> have you utterly rejected us?&#8221; It is Jeremiah&#8217;s plea that the <sc>Lord be willing to relent of his anger and restore a repentant nation to himself; however, Jeremiah acknowledges that this wished-for restoration might not be possible if the <sc>Lord has become so angry with Jerusalem/Judah that he is determined to reject the nation once and for all. Then, Jerusalem/Judah&#8217;s restoration would be impossible.</p>
