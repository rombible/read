<A NAME="55"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=473><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;Our inheritance&#8221;; or &#8220;Our inherited possessions/property.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhalah</font>) has a range of meanings: (1) &#8220;inheritance,&#8221; (2) &#8220;portion, share&#8221; and (3) &#8220;possession, property.&#8221; The land of Canaan was given by the <sc>Lord to Israel as its inheritance (Deut 4:21; 15:4; 19:10; 20:16; 21:23; 24:4; 25:19; 26:1; Josh 20:6) and distributed among the tribes, clans and families (Num 16:14; 36:2; Deut 29:7; Josh 11:23; 13:6; 14:3, 13; 17:4, 6, 14; 19:49; 23:4; Judg 18:1; Ezek 45:1; 47:22, 29). Through the family, the family provided an inheritance (property) to its children with the first-born receiving pride of position (Gen 31:14; Num 27:7-11; 36:3, 8; 1 Kgs 21:3, 4; Job 42:15; Prov 19:14; Ezek 46:16). Here, the parallelism between &#8220;our inheritance&#8221; and &#8220;our homes&#8221; would allow for the specific referent of the phrase &#8220;our inheritance&#8221; to be (1) land or (2) material possessions, or given the nature of the poetry in Lamentations, to carry both meanings at the same time.</p>
