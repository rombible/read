<A NAME="529"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=497><b>tn</b> The text is difficult. Word by word the MT<i> </i>has &#8220;young men hand mill(?) they take up&#8221; Perhaps it means &#8220;they take [our] young men for mill grinding,&#8221; or perhaps it means &#8220;the young men take up [the labor of] mill grinding.&#8221; This expression is an example of synecdoche where the mill stands for the labor at the mill and then that labor stands for performing menial physical labor as servants. The surface reading, &#8220;young men carry hand mills,&#8221; does not portray any great adversity for them. The Vulgate translates as an abusive sexual metaphor (see D. R. Hillers, <i>Lamentations</i> [AB], 99), but this gives no known parallel to the second part of the verse.</p>
