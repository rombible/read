<A NAME="254"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=193><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the virgins of Jerusalem.&#8221; The term &#8220;virgins&#8221; is a metonymy of association, standing for single young women who are not yet married. These single women are in grief because their potential suitors have been killed. The elders, old men, and young women function together as a merism for all of the survivors (F. W. Dobbs-Allsopp, <i>Lamentations</i> [IBC], 92). </p>
