<A NAME="249"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=188><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;there is no torah&#8221; or &#8220;there is no Torah&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1503; &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">en torah</font>). Depending on whether <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">torah</font>, &#8220;instruction, law&#8221;) is used in parallelism with the preceding or following line, it refers to (1) political guidance that the now-exiled king had formerly provided or (2) prophetic instruction that the now-ineffective prophets had formerly provided (BDB 434 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> 1.b). It is possible that the three lines are arranged in an ABA chiastic structure, exploiting the semantic ambiguity of the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">torah</font>, &#8220;instruction&#8221;). Possibly it is an oblique reference to the priests&#8217; duties of teaching, thus introducing a third group of the countries leaders. It is possible to hear in this a lament in reference to the destruction of Torah scrolls that may have been at the temple when it was destroyed. </p>
