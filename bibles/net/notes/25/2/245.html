<A NAME="245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=184><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;have sunk down.&#8221; This expression, &#8220;her gates have sunk down into the ground,&#8221; is a personification, picturing the city gates descending into the earth, as if going down into the grave or the netherworld. Most English versions render it literally (KJV, RSV, NRSV, NASB, NIV, NJPS); however, a few paraphrases have captured the equivalent sense quite well: &#8220;Zion&#8217;s gates have fallen facedown on the ground&#8221; (CEV) and &#8220;the gates are buried in rubble&#8221; (TEV).</p>
