<A NAME="2117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">117</span><note=256><b>tn</b> This entire line is an accusative noun clause, functioning as the direct object of the following line: &#8220;my enemy has destroyed the perfectly healthy children&#8230;.&#8221; Normal word order in Hebrew is: verb + subject + direct object. Here, the accusative direct object clause is moved forward for rhetorical emphasis: those whom the Babylonians killed had been children born perfectly healthy and well raised &#8230; what a tragic loss of perfectly good human life!</p>
