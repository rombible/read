<A NAME="210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=149><b>tc</b> The Kethib is written <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488; &#1495;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> khamal</font>, &#8220;without mercy&#8221;), while the Qere reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1488; &#1495;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿlo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> khamal</font>, &#8220;and he has shown no mercy&#8221;). The Kethib is followed by the LXX, while the Qere is reflected in many Hebrew <sc>mss and the ancient versions (Syriac Peshitta, Aramaic Targum, Latin Vulgate). The English versions are split between the Kethib: &#8220;The <sc>Lord swallowed all the dwellings of Jacob without mercy&#8221; (cf. RSV, NRSV, NIV, TEV, NJPS) and the Qere: &#8220;The <sc>Lord swallowed all the dwellings of Jacob, and has shown no mercy&#8221; (cf. KJV, NASB, CEV). As these words occur between a verb and its object (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;</font> [<font face="Scholar">khamal</font>] is not otherwise followed by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1514;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et</font>, direct object marker]), an adverbial reading is the most natural, although interrupting the sentence with an insertion is possible. Compare 2:17, 21; 3:43. In contexts of harming, to show mercy often means to spare from harm. </p>
