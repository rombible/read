<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=155><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;every horn of Israel.&#8221; The term &#8220;horn&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">qeren</font>) normally refers to the horn of a bull, one of the most powerful animals in ancient Israel. This term is often used figuratively as a symbol of strength, usually in reference to the military might of an army (Deut 33:17; 1 Sam 2:1, 10; 2 Sam 22:3; Pss 18:3; 75:11; 89:18, 25; 92:11; 112:9; 1 Chr 25:5; Jer 48:25; Lam 2:3, 17; Ezek 29:21) (BDB 901 s.v. 2), just as warriors are sometimes figuratively described as &#8220;bulls.&#8221; Cutting off the &#8220;horn&#8221; is a figurative expression for destroying warriors (Jer 48:25; Ps 75:10 [HT 11]).</p>
