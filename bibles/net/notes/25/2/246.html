<A NAME="246"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=185><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;he has destroyed and smashed her bars.&#8221; The two verbs <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1491; &#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ibbad vÿshibbar</font>) form a verbal hendiadys that emphasizes the forcefulness of the destruction of the locking bars on the gates. The first verb functions adverbially and the second retains its full verbal sense: &#8220;he has smashed to pieces.&#8221; Several English versions render this expression literally and miss the rhetorical point: &#8220;he has ruined and broken&#8221; (RSV, NRSV), &#8220;he has destroyed and broken&#8221; (KJV, NASB), &#8220;he has broken and destroyed&#8221; (NIV). The hendiadys has been correctly noted by others: &#8220;smashed to pieces&#8221; (TEV, CEV) and &#8220;smashed to bits&#8221; (NJPS).</p>
