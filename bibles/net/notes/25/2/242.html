<A NAME="242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=181><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;he stretched out a measuring line.&#8221; In Hebrew, this idiom is used (1) literally: to describe a workman&#8217;s preparation of measuring and marking stones before cutting them for building (Job 38:5; Jer 31:39; Zech 1:16) and (2) figuratively: to describe the <sc>Lord&#8217;s planning and preparation to destroy a walled city, that is, to mark off for destruction (2 Kgs 21:13; Isa 34:11; Lam 2:8). It is not completely clear how a phrase from the vocabulary of building becomes a metaphor for destruction; however, it might picture a predetermined and carefully planned measure from which God will not deviate.</p>
