<A NAME="2110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">110</span><note=249><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;in the day of your anger.&#8221; The construction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bayom</font>, &#8220;in the day of&#8230;&#8221;) is a common Hebrew idiom, meaning &#8220;when&#8230;&#8221; (e.g., Gen 2:4; Lev 7:35; Num 3:1; Deut 4:15; 2 Sam 22:1; Pss 18:1; 138:3; Zech 8:9). This temporal idiom refers to a general time period, but uses the term &#8220;day&#8221; as a forceful rhetorical device to emphasize the vividness and drama of the event, depicting it as occurring within a single day. In the ancient Near East, military minded kings often referred to a successful campaign as &#8220;the day of X&#8221; in order to portray themselves as powerful conquerors who, as it were, could inaugurate and complete a victory military campaign within the span of one day.</p>
