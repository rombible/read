<A NAME="298"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">98</span><note=237><b>tn</b><i> </i>The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1461;&#1489;&#1464;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">levav</font>, &#8220;heart&#8221;) functions here as a metonymy of association for the thoughts and emotions in the heart. The Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1461;&#1489;&#1464;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">levav</font>) includes the mind so that in some cases the translation &#8220;heart&#8221; implies an inappropriate division between the cognitive and affective. This context is certainly emotionally loaded, but as part of a series of admonitions to address God in prayer, these emotions are inextricably bound with the thoughts of the mind. The singular &#8220;heart&#8221; is retained in the translation to be consistent with the personification of Jerusalem (cf. v. 18). </p>
