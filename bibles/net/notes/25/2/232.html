<A NAME="232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=171><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;The <sc>Lord has caused to be forgotten in Zion both appointed festival and Sabbath.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shikkakh</font>, &#8220;to cause someone to forget&#8221;), Piel perfect 3rd person masculine singular from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shakhakh</font>, &#8220;to forget&#8221;) is used figuratively. When people forget &#8220;often the neglect of obligations is in view&#8221; (L. C. Allen, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 4:104). When people forget the things of God, they are in disobedience and often indicted for ignoring God or neglecting their duties to him (Deut 4:23, 31; 6:12; 8:11, 19; 26:13; 31:21; 32:18; Judg 3:7; 1 Sam 12:9; 2 Kgs 17:38; Is 49:14; 51:13; 65:11; Jer 18:15; Exek 23:35; Hos 4:6). The irony is that the one to whom worship is due has made it so that people must neglect it. Most English versions render this in a metonymical sense: &#8220;the <sc>Lord has brought to an end in Zion appointed festival and sabbath&#8221; (RSV), &#8220;[he] did away with festivals and Sabbaths&#8221; (CEV), &#8220;he has put an end to holy days and Sabbaths&#8221; (TEV), &#8220;the <sc>Lord has ended&#8230;festival and sabbath&#8221; (NJPS), &#8220;the <sc>Lord has abolished&#8230;festivals and sabbath&#8221; (NRSV). Few English versions employ the gloss &#8220;remember&#8221;: &#8220;the <sc>Lord hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten&#8221; (KJV) and &#8220;the <sc>Lord has made Zion forget her appointed feasts and her sabbaths&#8221;(NIV).</p>
