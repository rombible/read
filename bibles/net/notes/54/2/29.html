<A NAME="29"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=38><b>sn</b> <i>Revealing God&#8217;s purpose at his appointed time</i> is a difficult expression without clear connection to the preceding, literally &#8220;a testimony at the proper time.&#8221; This may allude to testimony about Christ&#8217;s atoning work given by Paul and others (as v. 7 mentions). But it seems more likely to identify Christ&#8217;s death itself as a testimony to God&#8217;s gracious character (as vv. 3-4 describe). This testimony was planned from all eternity, but now has come to light at the time God intended, in the work of Christ. See 2 Tim 1:9-10; Titus 2:11-14; 3:4-7 for similar ideas. </p>
