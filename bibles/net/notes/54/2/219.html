<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=48><b>sn</b> <i>But I do not allow. </i>Although the Greek conjunction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941; </font>(<font face="Greektl">de</font>)<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> </font>can have a simple connective force (&#8220;and&#8221;), it is best to take it as contrastive here: Verse 11 gives a positive statement (that is to say, that a woman should <i>learn</i>). This was a radical and liberating departure from the Jewish view that women were not to learn the law.</p>
