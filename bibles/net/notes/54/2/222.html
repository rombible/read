<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=51><b>tn</b> This phrase uses a compound form of the same verb as in v. 14a: &#8220;deceived&#8221; vs. &#8220;deceived out, completely deceived.&#8221; The two verbs could be synonymous, but because of the close contrast in this context, it seems that a stronger meaning is intended for the second verb.</p>
