<A NAME="27"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=36><b>tn</b> Traditionally this word (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#949;&#963;&#943;&#964;&#951;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">mesith&quot;</font>) is rendered &#8220;mediator,&#8221; but this conveys a wrong impression in contemporary English. Jesus was not a mediator, for example, who worked for compromise between opposing parties. Instead he was the only one able to go between man and God to enable them to have a relationship, but entirely on God&#8217;s terms.</p>
