<A NAME="324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=78><b>tc</b> The Byzantine text along with a few other witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>c</sup> A<sup>c</sup> C<sup>2</sup> D<sup>2</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936; </font>[88 <i>pc</i>] 1739 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> </font>vg<sup>ms</sup>) read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">qeos</font>, &#8220;God&#8221;) for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jos</font>, &#8220;who&#8221;). Most significant among these witnesses is 1739; the second correctors of some of the other <sc>mss tend to conform to the medieval standard, the Byzantine text, and add no independent voice to the discussion. A few <sc>mss have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#952;&#949;&#972;&#962; </font>(so 88 <i>pc</i>), a reading that is a correction on the anarthrous <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font>.<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> </font>On the other side, the masculine relative pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#962; </font>is strongly supported by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* A* C* F G 33 365 <i>pc </i>Did Epiph. Significantly, D* and virtually the entire Latin tradition read the neuter relative pronoun, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jo</font>, &#8220;which&#8221;), a reading that indirectly supports <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#962;</font> since it could not easily have been generated if <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font> had been in the text. Thus, externally, there is no question as to what should be considered original: The Alexandrian and Western traditions are decidedly in favor of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#962;</font>. Internally, the evidence is even stronger. What scribe would change <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font> to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#962;</font> intentionally? &#8220;Who&#8221; is not only a theologically pale reading by comparison; it also is much harder (since the relative pronoun has no obvious antecedent, probably the reason for the neuter pronoun of the Western tradition). Intrinsically, the rest of 3:16, beginning with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#962;</font>, appears to form a six-strophed hymn. As such, it is a text that is seemingly incorporated into the letter without syntactical connection. Hence, not only should we <i>not</i> look for an antecedent for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#962;</font> (as is often done by commentators), but the relative pronoun thus is not too hard a reading (or impossible, as Dean Burgon believed). Once the genre is taken into account, the relative pronoun fits neatly into the author&#8217;s style (cf. also Col 1:15; Phil 2:6 for other places in which the relative pronoun begins a hymn, as was often the case in poetry of the day). On the other hand, with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font> written as a <i>nomen sacrum</i>, it would have looked very much like the relative pronoun: <font face="Greek Uncials">q-=s </font>vs. <font face="Greek Uncials">os</font>. Thus, it may have been easy to confuse one for the other. This, of course, does not solve which direction the scribes would go, although given their generally high Christology and the bland and ambiguous relative pronoun, it is doubtful that they would have replaced <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font> with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#962;</font>. How then should we account for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font>? It appears that sometime after the 2nd century the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font> reading came into existence, either via confusion with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#962;</font> or as an intentional alteration to magnify Christ and clear up the syntax at the same time. Once it got in, this theologically rich reading was easily able to influence all the rest of the <sc>mss it came in contact with (including <sc>mss already written, such as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A C D). That this reading did not arise until after the 2nd century is evident from the Western reading, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;</font>. The neuter relative pronoun is certainly a &#8220;correction&#8221; of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#962;</font>, conforming the gender to that of the neuter <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#8053;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957; </font>(<font face="Greektl">musthrion</font>, &#8220;mystery&#8221;). What is significant in this reading is (1) since virtually all the Western witnesses have either the masculine or neuter relative pronoun, the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font> reading was apparently unknown to them in the 2nd century (when the &#8220;Western&#8221; text seems to have originated, though its place of origination was most likely in the east); they thus supply strong indirect evidence of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#962;</font> outside of Egypt in the 2nd century; (2) even 2nd century scribes were liable to misunderstand the genre, feeling compelled to alter the masculine relative pronoun because it appeared to them to be too harsh. The evidence, therefore, for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#962;</font> is quite compelling, both externally and internally. As <i>TCGNT</i> 574 notes, &#8220;no uncial (in the first hand) earlier than the eighth or ninth century (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font>) supports <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font>; all ancient versions presuppose <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#962;</font> or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;</font>; and no patristic writer prior to the last third of the fourth century testifies to the reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font>.&#8221; Thus, the cries of certain groups that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962; </font>has to be original must be seen as special pleading in this case. To argue that heretics tampered with the text here is self-defeating, for most of the Western <i>fathers</i> who quoted the verse with the relative pronoun were quite orthodox, strongly affirming the deity of Christ. They would have dearly loved such a reading as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font>. Further, had heretics introduced a variant to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font>, a far more natural choice would have been <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Cristos</font>, &#8220;Christ&#8221;) or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kurios</font>, &#8220;Lord&#8221;), since the text is self-evidently about Christ, but it is not self-evidently a proclamation of his deity.

These terms are used broadly to refer to the genre of writing, not to the content. There are two broad criteria for determining if a passage is poetic or hymnic: &#8220;(a) <i>stylistic:</i> a certain rhythmical lilt when the passages are read aloud, the presence of <i>parallelismus membrorum</i> (i.e., an arrangement into couplets), the semblance of some metre, and the presence of rhetorical devices such as alliteration, <i>chiasmus</i>, and antithesis; and (b) <i>linguistic: </i>an unusual vocabulary, particularly the presence of theological terms, which is different from the surrounding context&#8221; (P. T. O&#8217;Brien, <i>Philippians </i>[NIGTC], 188-89). Classifying a passage as hymnic or poetic is important because understanding this genre can provide keys to interpretation. However, not all scholars agree that the above criteria are present in this passage, so the decision to typeset it as poetry should be viewed as a tentative decision about its genre. </p>
