<A NAME="318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=72><b>sn</b> In the phrase <i>the faith that is in Christ Jesus</i>, the term <i>faith</i> seems to mean &#8220;what Christians believe, Christian truth,&#8221; rather than personal trust in Christ. So the whole phrase could mean that others will come to place greater confidence in them regarding Christian truth; but the word &#8220;confidence&#8221; is much more likely to refer to their own boldness to act on the truth of their convictions.</p>
