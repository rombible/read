<A NAME="34"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=58><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;a man married only once,&#8221; &#8220;devoted solely to his wife&#8221; (see 1 Tim 3:12; 5:9; Titus 1:6). The meaning of this phrase is disputed. It is frequently understood to refer to the marital status of the church leader, excluding from leadership those who are (1) unmarried, (2) polygamous, (3) divorced, or (4) remarried after being widowed. A different interpretation is reflected in the NEB&#8217;s translation &#8220;faithful to his one wife.&#8221;</p>
