It occurs six times in these letters, but only twice elsewhere in the NT. However, it occurs commonly in the OT, especially in Isaiah. It emphasizes the Father as the initiator and source of salvation.</p>

See parallels in 1 Tim 4:7; 2 Tim 4:4; and Titus 1:14. They were perhaps built by speculation from the patriarchal narratives in the OT; hence the connection with <i>genealogies</i> and with wanting <i>to be teachers of the law</i> (v. 7).</p>

Here the former is in view (see the summary of God&#8217;s plan in 1 Tim 2:3-6; 2 Tim 1:9-10; Titus 3:4-7), and Paul notes the response people must make to God&#8217;s arrangement: It is &#8220;in faith&#8221; or &#8220;by faith.&#8221;</p>
