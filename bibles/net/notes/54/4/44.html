The precise meaning of this phrase is somewhat debated. Three primary interpretations are (1) the consciences of these false teachers are &#8220;branded&#8221; with Satan&#8217;s mark to indicate ownership, (2) their consciences are &#8220;branded&#8221; with a penal mark to show they are lawbreakers, or (3) their consciences have been &#8220;seared&#8221; (i.e., totally burnt and desensitized) so that they are unable to notice the difference between right and wrong. See G. W. Knight, <i>Pastoral Epistles </i>(NIGTC), 189.</p>
