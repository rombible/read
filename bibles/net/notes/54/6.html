<A NAME="61"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=146><b>tn</b> Traditionally, &#8220;servants.&#8221; Though <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">doulos</font>) is normally translated &#8220;servant,&#8221; the word does not bear the connotation of a free individual serving another. BDAG notes that &#8220;&#8216;servant&#8217; for &#8216;slave&#8217; is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times&#8230;in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished&#8221; (BDAG 260 s.v.). The most accurate translation is &#8220;bondservant&#8221; (sometimes found in the ASV for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font>), in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another. But as this is archaic, few today understand its force.</p>

It is likely that it crept into the text early, perhaps as a marginal comment, but it should not be considered authentic in light of the strong external evidence against it.</p>
<A NAME="610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=155><b>tc</b> The Greek conjunction<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> &#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> usually means &#8220;because,&#8221; but here it takes the sense &#8220;so that&#8221; (see BDAG 732 s.v. 5.c). This unusual sense led to textual variation as scribes attempted to correct what appeared to be an error: D* and a few versional witnesses read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#941;&#962; &#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (&#8220;it is true that&#8221;), and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> D<sup>2</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#8134;&#955;&#959;&#957; &#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (&#8220;it is clear that&#8221;).

This seems to be not entirely true to life (some evils are unrelated to love of money), but it should be read as a case of hyperbole (exaggeration to make a point more strongly).</p>
<A NAME="613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=158><b>tn</b> Many translations render this &#8220;of all kinds of evil,&#8221; especially to allow for the translation &#8220;a root&#8221; along with it. But there is no parallel for taking a construction like this to mean &#8220;all kinds of&#8221; or &#8220;every kind of.&#8221; The normal sense is &#8220;all evils.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=162><b>sn</b> At some point in Timothy&#8217;s life, he publicly acknowledged Jesus as the resurrected Lord, perhaps either at his baptism or his ordination as a minister of the gospel. With this reminder of the historical moment of his <i>good confession</i>, Timothy is encouraged to remain steadfast in his faith and to finish his life as a minister in the same way it began (see G.

Hence, the omission is the harder reading, and the addition of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#959;&#953; </font>is one of clarification.
