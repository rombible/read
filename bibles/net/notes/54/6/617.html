<A NAME="617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=162><b>sn</b> At some point in Timothy&#8217;s life, he publicly acknowledged Jesus as the resurrected Lord, perhaps either at his baptism or his ordination as a minister of the gospel. With this reminder of the historical moment of his <i>good confession</i>, Timothy is encouraged to remain steadfast in his faith and to finish his life as a minister in the same way it began (see G. W. Knight, <i>Pastoral Epistles </i>[NIGTC], 264-65).</p>
