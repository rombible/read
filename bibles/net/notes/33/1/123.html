Universal judgment is coming, but ironically Israel is the focal point of God&#8217;s anger. In v. 5c the prophet includes Judah within the scope of divine judgment, for it has followed in the pagan steps of the northern kingdom. He accomplishes this with rhetorical skill. In v. 5b he develops the first assertion of v. 5a (&#8220;All of this is because of Jacob&#8217;s rebellion&#8221;). One expects in v. 5c an elaboration of the second assertion in v. 5a (&#8220;and the sins of the nation of Israel&#8221;), which one assumes, in light of v. 5b, pertains to the northern kingdom. But the prophet specifies the &#8220;sins&#8221; as &#8220;high places&#8221; and makes it clear that &#8220;the nation of Israel&#8221; includes Judah. Verses 6-7 further develop v. 5b (judgment on the northern kingdom), while vv. 8-16 expand on v. 5c (judgment on Judah).</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4. </p>
