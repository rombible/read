<a name="172"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=72><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Again a conqueror I will bring to you, residents of Mareshah.&#8221; The first person verb is problematic, for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> would have to be the subject (cf. NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV, NLT). But the prophet appears to be delivering this lament and the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is referred to in the third person in v. 12. Consequently many emend the verb to a third person form (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yavo</font>&#8217;) and understand the &#8220;conqueror&#8221; as subject.</p>
