<a name="173"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=73><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to Adullam the glory of Israel will go.&#8221; This probably means that the nation&#8217;s leadership will run for their lives and, like David of old, hide from their enemy in the caves of Adullam. Cf. NIV&#8217;s &#8220;He who is the glory of Israel will come to Adullam,&#8221; which sounds as if an individual is in view, and could be understood as a messianic reference.</p>
