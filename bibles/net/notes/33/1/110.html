<a name="110"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=10><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord </span>from his majestic palace.&#8221; Since the verb is omitted it is unclear whether the implied term be supplied from the preceding line (&#8220;he will testify against you&#8221;) or the following line (&#8220;he is leaving&#8221;). So the line may be rendered &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will accuse you from his majestic temple&#8221; or &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will come forth from his majestic temple.&#8221; Most translations render it literally, but some remove the ambiguity: &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord God </span>accuses you from his holy temple&#8221; (CEV); &#8220;He speaks from his holy temple&#8221; (TEV). </p>
