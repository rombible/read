<a name="19"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=9><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;May the sovereign <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> testify against you.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1460;&#1497;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vihiy</font>) is jussive, which normally conveys a volitional sense of an urgent request or prayer (&#8220;may he testify!&#8221;). However, GKC<i> </i>325-26 §109.<i>k</i> notes that here the jussive form is used without any volitional sense for the ordinary imperfect, as a rhythmic shortening at the beginning of a sentence, thus removed as far as possible from the principal accent (cf. Gen 49:17; Deut 28:8; 1 Sam 10:5; 2 Sam 5:24; Hos 6:1; 11:4; Amos 5:14; Zeph 2:13; Zech 9:5; Pss 72:16-17; 104:31; Job 18:12; 20:23, 26, 28; 27:8; 33:21; 34:37; Ruth 3:4). Thus, the translation here renders the jussive as an ordinary imperfect. Some translations render it in a traditional jussive sense: (1) urgent request: &#8220;And let my Lord God be your accuser&#8221; (NJPS); or (2) dependent purpose/result: &#8220;that the Sovereign <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> may witness against you&#8221; (NIV).</p>
