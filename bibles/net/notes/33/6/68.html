<A NAME="68"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=251><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;From Shittim to Gilgal, in order to know the just acts of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; Something appears to be missing at the beginning of the line. The present translation supplies the words, &#8220;Recall how you went.&#8221; This apparently refers to how Israel crossed the Jordan River (see Josh 3:1; 4:19-24).</p>
