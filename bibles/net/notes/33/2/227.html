<A NAME="227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=103><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from their children you take my glory forever.&#8221; The <i>yod </i>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font>) ending on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1458;&#1491;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hadariy</font>) is usually taken as a first person common singular suffix (&#8220;my glory&#8221;). But it may be the archaic genitive ending (&#8220;glory of&#8221;) in the construct expression &#8220;glory of perpetuity,&#8221; that is, &#8220;perpetual glory.&#8221; In either case, this probably refers to the dignity or honor the <sc>Lord bestowed on each Israelite family by giving them a share of his land to be inherited perpetually from one generation to another within each family. The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hadar</font>) may refer to possessions that a person prizes (Lam 1:6).</p>
