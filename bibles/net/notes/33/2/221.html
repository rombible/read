<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=97><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Do not my words accomplish good for the one who walks uprightly?&#8221; The rhetorical question expects the answer, &#8220;Of course they do!&#8221; The <sc>Lord begins his response to the claim of the house of Jacob that they are immune to judgment (see v. 7a). He points out that the godly are indeed rewarded, but then he goes on to show that those in the house of Jacob are not godly and can expect divine judgment, not blessing (vv. 8-11). Some emend &#8220;my words&#8221; to &#8220;his words.&#8221; In this case, v. 7b is a continuation of the immediately preceding quotation. The people, thinking they are godly, confidently ask, &#8220;Do not his [God&#8217;s] words accomplish good for the one who walks uprightly?&#8221;</p>
