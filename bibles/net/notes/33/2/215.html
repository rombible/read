<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=91><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;&#8216;Do not foam at the mouth,&#8217; they foam at the mouth.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1496;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nataf</font>) means &#8220;to drip.&#8221; When used of speech it probably has the nuance &#8220;to drivel, to foam at the mouth&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 694 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1496;&#1507;</font>). The sinful people tell the <sc>Lord&#8217;s prophets not to &#8220;foam at the mouth,&#8221; which probably refers in a derogatory way to their impassioned style of delivery. But the <sc>Lord (who is probably still speaking here, see v. 3) sarcastically refers to their impassioned exhortation as &#8220;foaming at the mouth.&#8221;</p>
