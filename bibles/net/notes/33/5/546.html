<A NAME="546"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=241><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Asherah poles.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Asherah</i> was a leading deity of the Canaanite pantheon, wife/sister of El and goddess of fertility. She was commonly worshiped at shrines in or near groves of evergreen trees, or, failing that, at places marked by wooden poles. These were to be burned or cut down (Deut 12:3; 16:21; Judg 6:25, 28, 30; 2 Kgs 18:4). The <sc>Lord states that he will destroy these images, something the Israelites themselves should have done but failed to do.</p>
