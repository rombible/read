<A NAME="73"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=286><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I am like the gathering of the summer fruit, like the gleanings of the harvest.&#8221; Micah is not comparing himself to the harvested fruit. There is an ellipsis here, as the second half of the verse makes clear. The idea is, &#8220;I am like [one at the time] the summer fruit is gathered and the grapes are harvested.&#8221;</p>
