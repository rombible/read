<A NAME="713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=296><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the day of your watchmen, your appointed [time], is coming.&#8221; The present translation takes &#8220;watchmen&#8221; to refer to actual sentries. However, the &#8220;watchmen&#8221; could refer figuratively to the prophets who had warned Judah of approaching judgment. In this case one could translate, &#8220;The day your prophets warned about &#8211; your appointed time of punishment &#8211; is on the way.&#8221;</p>
