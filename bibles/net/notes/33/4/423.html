<A NAME="423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=178><b>sn</b> The city of David, located within Jerusalem, is addressed as <i>Daughter Zion</i>. As the home of the Davidic king, who was Israel&#8217;s shepherd (Ps 78:70-72), the royal citadel could be viewed metaphorically as the watchtower of the flock.</p>
