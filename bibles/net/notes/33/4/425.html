<A NAME="425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=180><b>tn</b> The Hebrew form is feminine singular, indicating that Jerusalem, personified as a young woman, is now addressed (see v. 10). In v. 8 the tower/fortress was addressed with masculine forms, so there is clearly a shift in addressee here. &#8220;Jerusalem&#8221; has been supplied in the translation at the beginning of v. 9 to make this shift apparent.</p>
