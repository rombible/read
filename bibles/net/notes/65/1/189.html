<a name="189"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">89</span><note=89><b>tn</b> The participles in v. 20 have been variously interpreted. Some treat them imperativally or as attendant circumstance to the imperative in v. 21 (&#8220;maintain&#8221;): &#8220;build yourselves up&#8230;pray.&#8221; But they do not follow the normal contours of either the imperatival or attendant circumstance participles, rendering this unlikely. A better option is to treat them as the <i>means</i> by which the readers are to maintain themselves in the love of God. This both makes eminently good sense and fits the structural patterns of instrumental participles elsewhere.</p>
