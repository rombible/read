<a name="113"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=13><b>sn</b> <i>I now feel compelled instead&#8230;saints. </i>Apparently news of some crisis has reached Jude, prompting him to write a different letter than what he had originally planned. A plausible scenario (assuming authenticity of 2 Peter or at least that there are authentic Petrine snippets in it) is that after Peter&#8217;s death, Jude intended to write to the same Gentile readers that Peter had written to (essentially, Paul&#8217;s churches). Jude starts by affirming that the gospel the Gentiles had received from Paul was the same as the one the Jewish Christians had received from the other apostles (<i>our common salvation</i>). But in the midst of writing this letter, Jude felt that the present crisis deserved another, shorter piece. The crisis, as the letter reveals, is that the false teachers whom Peter prophesied have now infiltrated the church. The letter of Jude is thus an <i>ad hoc</i> letter, intended to confirm the truth of Peter&#8217;s letter and encourage the saints to ground their faith in the written documents of the nascent church, rather than listen to the twisted gospel of the false teachers. In large measure, the letter of Jude illustrates the necessity of clinging to the authority of scripture as opposed to those who claim to be prophets.</p>
