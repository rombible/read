<a name="121"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=21><b>tn</b> The terms &#8220;Master and Lord&#8221; both refer to the same person. The construction in Greek is known as the Granville Sharp rule, named after the English philanthropist-linguist who first clearly articulated the rule in 1798. Sharp pointed out that in the construction article-noun-<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font>-noun (where <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> [<font face="Greektl">kai</font>] = &#8220;and&#8221;), when two nouns are singular, personal, and common (i.e., not proper names), they <i>always</i> had the same referent. Illustrations such as &#8220;the friend and brother,&#8221; &#8220;the God and Father,&#8221; etc. abound in the NT to prove Sharp&#8217;s point. For more discussion see <i>ExSyn</i> 270-78. See also Titus 2:13 and 2 Pet 1:1 </p>
