<a name="135"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=35><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;strange flesh.&#8221; This phrase has been variously interpreted. It could refer to flesh of another species (such as angels lusting after human flesh). This would aptly describe the sin of the angels, but not easily explain the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah. It could refer to the homosexual practices of the Sodomites, but a difficulty arises from the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7957;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">{etero&quot;</font>; &#8220;strange,&#8221; &#8220;other&#8221;). When this is to be distinguished from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">allos</font>, &#8220;another&#8221;) it suggests &#8220;another of a different kind.&#8221; If so, would that properly describe <i>homo</i>sexual behavior? In response, the language could easily be compact: &#8220;pursued flesh <i>other</i> than what was normally pursued.&#8221; However, would this find an analogy in the lust of angels (such would imply that angels <i>normally</i> had sexual relations of some sort, but cf. Matt 22:30)? Another alternative is that the focus of the parallel is on the activity of the surrounding cities and the activity of the angels. This is especially plausible since the participles <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#963;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ekporneusasai</font>, &#8220;having indulged in sexual immorality&#8221;) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#949;&#955;&#952;&#959;&#8166;&#963;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">apelqousai</font>, &#8220;having pursued&#8221;) have concord with &#8220;cities&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#972;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">poleis</font>), a feminine plural noun, rather than with Sodom and Gomorrah (both masculine nouns). If so, then their sin would not necessarily have to be homosexuality. However, most likely the feminine participles are used because of <i>constructio ad sensum</i> (construction according to sense). That is, since both Sodom and Gomorrah are cities, the feminine is used to imply that all the cities are involved. The connection with angels thus seems to be somewhat loose: Both angels and Sodom and Gomorrah indulged in heinous sexual immorality. Thus, whether the false teachers indulge in homosexual activity is not the point; mere sexual immorality is enough to condemn them.</p>
