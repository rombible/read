Though rare (see BDAG 820 s.v. 3), it is not unexampled and must have this meaning here.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The term &#8220;faith&#8221; has a variety of meanings in the NT. Here, <i>the faith</i> refers to the doctrinal content embraced by believers rather than the act of believing. Rather than discuss the points of agreement that Jude would have with these believers, because of the urgency of the present situation he must assume that these believers were well grounded and press on to encourage them to fight for this common belief.</p>
