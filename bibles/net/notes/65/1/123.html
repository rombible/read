<a name="123"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=23><b>tc</b> &#8225; Some translations take <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7941;&#960;&#945;&#958;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Japax</font>) with the following clause (thus, &#8220;[Jesus,] having saved the people <i>once for all</i>&#8221;). Such a translation presupposes that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7941;&#960;&#945;&#958;</font> is a part of the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) clause. The reading of NA<sup>27</sup>, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#8005;&#964;&#953; </font>[<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001;</font>]<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> &#954;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#7941;&#960;&#945;&#958;</font> (<font face="Greektl">panta {oti </font>[<font face="Greektl">Jo</font>]<font face="Greektl"> kurio&quot; {apax</font>), suggests this interpretation (though with &#8220;Lord&#8221; instead of &#8220;Jesus&#8221;). This particle is found before <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#945;&#972;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">laon</font>) in the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> C* <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 630 1241 1243 1505 1739 1846 1881 <i>pc</i> co<i>.</i> But <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7941;&#960;&#945;&#958;</font> is found before the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause in most witnesses, including several important ones (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>72</sup> A B C<sup>2</sup> 33 81 623 2344 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> vg). What seems best able to explain the various placements of the adverb is that scribes were uncomfortable with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7941;&#960;&#945;&#958;</font> referring to the readers&#8217; knowledge, feeling it was more appropriate to the theological significance of &#8220;saved&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#8061;&#963;&#945;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">swsas</font>).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In this translation, Jude is stressing that the readers have been informed <i>once for all </i>of the OT illustrations he is about to mention. Where would they get this information? Most likely from having read 2 Peter. Earlier Jude used the same adverb to indicate that these believers had a written record of the faith. This seems to be his implication here, too. Thus, for the second time Jude is appealing to the written documents of the early church as authoritative as opposed to the messages of the false teachers. As the 1st century began to draw to a close, the early church found itself increasingly dependent on the letters and gospels of the apostles and their associates. Once those apostles died, false apostles and false teachers sprang up, like wolves in sheep&#8217;s clothing (cf. Acts 20:29-30). To combat this, some of the latest books of the NT stressed the authority of what had been written (so Hebrews, Jude, Ephesians, 1 John). Although these writers anticipated the return of the Lord, they also braced their audiences for a delay of the <i>parousia</i> (the second coming of Christ) by suggesting that when they were gone the NT documents should guide them.</p>
