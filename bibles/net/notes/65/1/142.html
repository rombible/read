<a name="142"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=42><b>sn</b> <i>The glorious ones</i> refers to angelic beings rather than mere human beings, just as in 2 Pet 2:10 (on which this passage apparently depends). Whether the angelic beings are good or evil, however, is difficult to tell (hence, the translation is left ambiguous). However, both in 2 Pet 2:11 and here, in Jude 9, the wicked angels seem to be in view (for not even Michael insults them). </p>
