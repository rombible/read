However, not only does this reading enjoy the strongest support from a variety of early witnesses (e.g., A B 33 81 1241 1739 1881 2344 <i>pc </i>vg co Or<sup>1739mg</sup>), but the plethora of variants demonstrate that scribes were uncomfortable with it, for they seemed to exchange <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kurios</font>, &#8220;Lord&#8221;) or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">qeos</font>, &#8220;God&#8221;) for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</font> (though <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>72</sup> has the intriguing reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#8056;&#962; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> [<font face="Greektl">qeos Cristos</font>, &#8220;God Christ&#8221;] for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</font>). In addition to the evidence supplied in NA<sup>27</sup> for this reading, note also {88 322 323 424<sup>c</sup> 665 915 2298 eth Cyr Hier Bede}. As difficult as the reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</font> is, in light of v. 4 and in light of the progress of revelation (Jude being one of the last books in the NT to be composed), it is wholly appropriate.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The construction <i>our Master and Lord, Jesus Christ </i>in v. 4 follows Granville Sharp&#8217;s rule (see note on <i>Lord</i>). The construction strongly implies the deity of Christ. This is followed by a statement that <i>Jesus</i> was involved in the salvation (and later judgment) of the Hebrews. He is thus to be identified with the Lord God, Yahweh. Verse 5, then, simply fleshes out what is implicit in v. 4.</p>
