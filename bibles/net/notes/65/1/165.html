<a name="165"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=65><b>sn</b> The imagery of a star seems to fit the nautical theme that Jude is developing. Stars were of course the guides to sailors at night, just as teachers are responsible to lead the flock through a benighted world. But false teachers, as <i>wayward stars</i>, are not fixed and hence offer unreliable, even disastrous guidance. They are thus both the dangerous reefs on which the ships could be destroyed and the false guides, leading them into these rocks. There is a special irony that these lights will be snuffed out, reserved for the darkest <i>depths of eternal darkness</i>.</p>
