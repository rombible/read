<a name="157"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=57><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;shepherding themselves.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#953;&#956;&#945;&#943;&#957;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">poimainw</font>) means &#8220;shepherd, nurture [the flock].&#8221; But these men, rather than tending to the flock of God, nurture only themselves. They thus fall under the condemnation Paul uttered when writing to the Corinthians: &#8220;For when it comes time to eat [the Lord&#8217;s Supper,] each one goes ahead with his own meal&#8221; (1 Cor 11:21). Above all, the love-feast was intended to be a shared meal in which all ate and all felt welcome.</p>
