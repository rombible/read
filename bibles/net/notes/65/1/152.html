<a name="152"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=52><b>tn</b> The three verbs in this verse are all aorist indicative (&#8220;have gone down,&#8221; &#8220;have abandoned,&#8221; &#8220;have perished&#8221;). Although the first and second could be considered constative or ingressive, the last is almost surely proleptic (referring to the certainty of their future judgment). Although it may seem odd that a proleptic aorist is so casually connected to other aorists with a different syntactical force, it is not unparalleled (cf. Rom 8:30).</p>
