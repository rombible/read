<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;by.&#8221; Datives of agency are quite rare in the NT (and other ancient Greek), almost always found with a perfect verb. Although this text qualifies, in light of the well-worn idiom of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#951;&#961;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">threw</font>) in eschatological contexts, in which God or Christ keeps the believer safe until the <i>parousia</i> (cf. 1 Thess 5:23; 1 Pet 1:4; Rev 3:10; other terms meaning &#8220;to guard,&#8221; &#8220;to keep&#8221; are also found in similar eschatological contexts [cf. 2 Thess 3:3; 2 Tim 1:12; 1 Pet 1:5; Jude 24]), it is probably better to understand this verse as having such an eschatological tinge. It is at the same time possible that Jude&#8217;s language was intentionally ambiguous, implying both ideas (&#8220;kept <i>by</i> Jesus Christ [so that they might be] kept <i>for</i> Jesus Christ&#8221;). Elsewhere he displays a certain fondness for wordplays; this may be a hint of things to come.</p>
