<a name="175"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">75</span><note=75><b>sn</b> An apparent quotation from <i>1 En.</i> 1:9. There is some doubt as to whether Jude is actually quoting from the text of 1 Enoch; the text here in Jude differs in some respects from the extant text of this pseudepigraphic book. It is sometimes suggested that Jude may instead have been quoting from oral tradition which had roots older than the written text.</p>
