It makes little difference in one sense: Jude is thinking primarily of sexual sins, which are borne of the sin nature and manifest themselves in inappropriate deeds done with the body. At the same time, he is <i>not</i> saying that the body is intrinsically bad, a view held by the opponents of Christianity. Hence, it is best to see &#8220;flesh&#8221; as referring to the sin nature here and the language as metaphorical.</p>
