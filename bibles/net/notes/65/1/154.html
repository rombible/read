<a name="154"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=54><b>tn</b> Though <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#960;&#953;&#955;&#940;&#948;&#949;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">spilades</font>) is frequently translated &#8220;blemishes&#8221; or &#8220;stains,&#8221; such is actually a translation of the Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#960;&#943;&#955;&#959;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">spiloi</font>). The two words are quite similar, especially in their root or lexical forms (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#960;&#953;&#955;&#940;&#962;</font> [<font face="Greektl">spila&quot;</font>] and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#960;&#943;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> [<font face="Greektl">spilos</font>] respectively). Some scholars have suggested that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#960;&#953;&#955;&#940;&#948;&#949;&#962;</font> in this context means the same thing as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#960;&#943;&#955;&#959;&#953;</font>. But such could be the case only by a stretch of the imagination (see BDAG 938 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#960;&#953;&#955;&#940;&#962;</font> for discussion). Others suggest that Jude&#8217;s spelling was in error (which also is doubtful). One reason for the tension is that in the parallel passage, 2 Pet 2:13, the term used is indeed <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#960;&#943;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font>. And if either Jude used 2 Peter or 2 Peter used Jude, one would expect to see the same word. Jude, however, may have changed the wording for the sake of a subtle wordplay. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#960;&#953;&#955;&#940;&#962;</font> was often used of a mere rock, though it normally was associated with a rock along the shore or one jutting out in the water. Thus, the false teachers would appear as &#8220;rocks&#8221; &#8211; as pillars in the community (cf. Matt 16:18; Gal 2:9), when in reality if a believer got too close to them his faith would get shipwrecked. Some suggest that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#960;&#953;&#955;&#940;&#948;&#949;&#962;</font> here means &#8220;hidden rocks.&#8221; Though this meaning is attested for the word, it is inappropriate in this context, since these false teachers are anything but hidden. They are dangerous because undiscerning folks get close to them, thinking they are rocks and pillars, when they are really dangerous reefs.</p>
