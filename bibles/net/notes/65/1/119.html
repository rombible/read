If it were a gospel of works, no such abuse could be imagined. Along these lines, note Rom 6:1 &#8211; &#8220;Are we to remain in sin so that grace may increase?&#8221; This question could not have even been asked had the gospel been one of works. But grace is easily misunderstood by those who would abuse it.</p>
