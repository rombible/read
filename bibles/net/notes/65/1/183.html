<a name="183"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">83</span><note=83><b>sn</b> This verse parallels 2 Pet 3:2 both conceptually and in much of the verbiage. There is one important difference, however: In 2 Pet 3:2 the prophets and apostles speak; here, just the <i>apostles</i> speak. This makes good sense if Jude is using 2 Peter as his main source and is urging his readers to go back to the authoritative writings, both OT and now especially NT. </p>
