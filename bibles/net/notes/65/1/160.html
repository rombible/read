<a name="160"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=60><b>sn</b> The imagery portraying the false teachers as <i>autumn trees without fruit</i> has to do with their lack of productivity. Recall the statement to the same effect by Jesus in Matt 7:16-20, in which false prophets will be known by their fruits. Like waterless clouds full of false hope, these trees do not yield any harvest even though it is expected. </p>
