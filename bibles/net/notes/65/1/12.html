<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2><b>tn</b> Though <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">doulos</font>) is normally translated &#8220;servant,&#8221; the word does not bear the connotation of a free individual serving another. BDAG notes that &#8220;&#8216;servant&#8217; for &#8216;slave&#8217; is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times&#8230;in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished&#8221; (BDAG 260 s.v.). At the same time, perhaps &#8220;servant&#8221; is apt in that the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> of Jesus Christ took on that role voluntarily, unlike a slave. The most accurate translation is &#8220;bondservant&#8221; (sometimes found in the ASV for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font>), in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another. But as this is archaic, few today understand its force. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Undoubtedly the background for the concept of being the Lord&#8217;s slave or servant is to be found in the Old Testament scriptures. For a Jew this concept did not connote drudgery, but honor and privilege. It was used of national Israel at times (Isa 43:10), but was especially associated with famous OT personalities, including such great men as Moses (Josh 14:7), David (Ps 89:3; cf. 2 Sam 7:5, 8) and Elijah (2 Kgs 10:10); all these men were &#8220;servants (or slaves) of the Lord.&#8221;</p>
