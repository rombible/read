By first calling himself <i>a slave of Jesus Christ</i>, it is evident that he wants no one to place stock in his physical connections. At the same time, he must identify himself further: Since Jude was a common name in the 1st century (two of Jesus&#8217; disciples were so named, including his betrayer), more information was needed, that is to say, <i>brother of James</i>.</p>
