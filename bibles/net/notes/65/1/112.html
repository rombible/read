That is to say, Jude could appeal to <i>written</i> documents of the Christian faith in his arguments with the false teachers. Most likely, these documents were the letters of Paul and perhaps one or more gospels. First and Second Peter may also have been among the documents Jude has in mind (see also the note on the phrase <i>entrusted to the saints</i> in this verse).</p>
