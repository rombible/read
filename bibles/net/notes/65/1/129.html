<a name="129"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=29><b>sn</b> There is an interesting play on words used in this verse. Because the angels did not <i>keep</i> their proper place, Jesus has <i>kept</i> them chained up in another place. The same verb <i>keep</i> is used in v. 1 to describe believers&#8217; status before God and Christ.</p>
