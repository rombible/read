<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Judas,&#8221; traditionally &#8220;Jude&#8221; in English versions to distinguish him from the one who betrayed Jesus. The word &#8220;From&#8221; is not in the Greek text, but has been supplied to indicate the sender of the letter.</p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2><b>tn</b> Though <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">doulos</font>) is normally translated &#8220;servant,&#8221; the word does not bear the connotation of a free individual serving another. BDAG notes that &#8220;&#8216;servant&#8217; for &#8216;slave&#8217; is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times&#8230;in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished&#8221; (BDAG 260 s.v.). At the same time, perhaps &#8220;servant&#8221; is apt in that the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> of Jesus Christ took on that role voluntarily, unlike a slave. The most accurate translation is &#8220;bondservant&#8221; (sometimes found in the ASV for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font>), in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another. But as this is archaic, few today understand its force. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Undoubtedly the background for the concept of being the Lord&#8217;s slave or servant is to be found in the Old Testament scriptures. For a Jew this concept did not connote drudgery, but honor and privilege. It was used of national Israel at times (Isa 43:10), but was especially associated with famous OT personalities, including such great men as Moses (Josh 14:7), David (Ps 89:3; cf. 2 Sam 7:5, 8) and Elijah (2 Kgs 10:10); all these men were &#8220;servants (or slaves) of the Lord.&#8221;</p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3><b>sn</b> Although Jude was half-brother of Jesus, he humbly associates himself with <i>James</i>, his full brother. By first calling himself <i>a slave of Jesus Christ</i>, it is evident that he wants no one to place stock in his physical connections. At the same time, he must identify himself further: Since Jude was a common name in the 1st century (two of Jesus&#8217; disciples were so named, including his betrayer), more information was needed, that is to say, <i>brother of James</i>.</p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;loved in.&#8221; The perfect passive participle suggests that the audience&#8217;s relationship to God is not recent; the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en</font>) before <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">patri</font>) could be taken as sphere or instrument (agency is unlikely, however). Another possible translation would be &#8220;dear to God.&#8221;</p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;by.&#8221; Datives of agency are quite rare in the NT (and other ancient Greek), almost always found with a perfect verb. Although this text qualifies, in light of the well-worn idiom of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#951;&#961;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">threw</font>) in eschatological contexts, in which God or Christ keeps the believer safe until the <i>parousia</i> (cf. 1 Thess 5:23; 1 Pet 1:4; Rev 3:10; other terms meaning &#8220;to guard,&#8221; &#8220;to keep&#8221; are also found in similar eschatological contexts [cf. 2 Thess 3:3; 2 Tim 1:12; 1 Pet 1:5; Jude 24]), it is probably better to understand this verse as having such an eschatological tinge. It is at the same time possible that Jude&#8217;s language was intentionally ambiguous, implying both ideas (&#8220;kept <i>by</i> Jesus Christ [so that they might be] kept <i>for</i> Jesus Christ&#8221;). Elsewhere he displays a certain fondness for wordplays; this may be a hint of things to come.</p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=6><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;may mercy and peace and love be multiplied to you.&#8221;</p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=7><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;while being quite diligent to write to you,&#8221; <i>or</i> &#8220;while making all haste to write to you.&#8221; Two issues are at stake: (1) whether <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#948;&#8053;</font> (<font face="Greektl">spoudh</font>) here means <i>diligence</i>, <i>eagerness</i>, or <i>haste</i>; (2) whether <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#973;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#949;&#953;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">poioumeno&quot; grafein</font>) is to be taken conatively (&#8220;I was about to write&#8221;) or progressively (&#8220;I was writing&#8221;). Without knowing more of the background, it is difficult to tell which option is to be preferred. </p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=8><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;I had the necessity.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#940;&#947;&#954;&#951;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anankh</font>, &#8220;necessity&#8221;) often connotes urgency or distress. In this context, Jude is indicating that the more comprehensive treatment about the faith shared between himself and his readers was not nearly as urgent as the letter he found it now necessary to write.</p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=9><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;encouraging.&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#928;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#8182;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">parakalwn</font>) is most likely a telic participle. In keeping with other participles of purpose, it is present tense and occurs after the main verb.</p>
<a name="110"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=10><b>tn</b> the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#945;&#947;&#969;&#957;&#943;&#950;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">epagwnizomai</font>) is an intensive form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#969;&#957;&#943;&#950;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">agwnizomai</font>). As such, the notion of struggling, fighting, contending, etc. is heightened. </p>
<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>tn</b> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#932;&#8135; &#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">th pistei</font>) here is taken as a dative of advantage (&#8220;on behalf of the faith&#8221;). Though rare (see BDAG 820 s.v. 3), it is not unexampled and must have this meaning here.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The term &#8220;faith&#8221; has a variety of meanings in the NT. Here, <i>the faith</i> refers to the doctrinal content embraced by believers rather than the act of believing. Rather than discuss the points of agreement that Jude would have with these believers, because of the urgency of the present situation he must assume that these believers were well grounded and press on to encourage them to fight for this common belief.</p>
<a name="112"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=12><b>sn</b> The adverb <i>once for all</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7941;&#960;&#945;&#958;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Japax</font>) seems to indicate that the doctrinal convictions of the early church had been substantially codified. That is to say, Jude could appeal to <i>written</i> documents of the Christian faith in his arguments with the false teachers. Most likely, these documents were the letters of Paul and perhaps one or more gospels. First and Second Peter may also have been among the documents Jude has in mind (see also the note on the phrase <i>entrusted to the saints</i> in this verse).</p>
<a name="113"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=13><b>sn</b> <i>I now feel compelled instead&#8230;saints. </i>Apparently news of some crisis has reached Jude, prompting him to write a different letter than what he had originally planned. A plausible scenario (assuming authenticity of 2 Peter or at least that there are authentic Petrine snippets in it) is that after Peter&#8217;s death, Jude intended to write to the same Gentile readers that Peter had written to (essentially, Paul&#8217;s churches). Jude starts by affirming that the gospel the Gentiles had received from Paul was the same as the one the Jewish Christians had received from the other apostles (<i>our common salvation</i>). But in the midst of writing this letter, Jude felt that the present crisis deserved another, shorter piece. The crisis, as the letter reveals, is that the false teachers whom Peter prophesied have now infiltrated the church. The letter of Jude is thus an <i>ad hoc</i> letter, intended to confirm the truth of Peter&#8217;s letter and encourage the saints to ground their faith in the written documents of the nascent church, rather than listen to the twisted gospel of the false teachers. In large measure, the letter of Jude illustrates the necessity of clinging to the authority of scripture as opposed to those who claim to be prophets.</p>
<a name="114"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=14><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;people.&#8221; However, if Jude is indeed arguing that Peter&#8217;s prophecy about false teachers has come true, these are most likely men in the original historical and cultural setting. See discussion of this point in the note on the phrase &#8220;these men&#8221; in 2 Pet 2:12.</p>
<a name="115"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=15><b>tn</b> &#8220;Among you&#8221; is not in the Greek text, but is obviously implied.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The infiltration referred to by the phrase <i>slipped in among you</i> was predicted by Peter (2 Pet 2:1), Paul (e.g., Acts 20:29-30), and OT prophets.</p>
<a name="116"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=16><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;in the past.&#8221; The adverb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#940;&#955;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">palai</font>) can refer to either, though the meaning &#8220;long ago&#8221; is more common. </p>
<a name="117"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=17><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;written about.&#8221;</p>
<a name="118"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=18><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;for this condemnation.&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;</font> (<font face="Greektl">touto</font>) is almost surely a kataphoric demonstrative pronoun, pointing to what follows in vv. 5-18. Otherwise, the condemnation is only implied (in v. 3b) or is merely a <i>statement</i> of their sinfulness (&#8220;ungodly&#8221; in v. 4b), not a judgment of it.</p>
<a name="119"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=19><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;debauchery.&#8221; This is the same word Peter uses to predict what the false teachers will be like (2 Pet 2:2, 7, 18).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Turned the grace of our God into a license for evil. </i>One of the implications that the gospel in the apostolic period was truly a gospel of <i>grace</i> was the fact that the enemies of the gospel could pervert it into <i>license</i>. If it were a gospel of works, no such abuse could be imagined. Along these lines, note Rom 6:1 &#8211; &#8220;Are we to remain in sin so that grace may increase?&#8221; This question could not have even been asked had the gospel been one of works. But grace is easily misunderstood by those who would abuse it.</p>
<a name="120"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=20><b>tc</b> Most later witnesses (P <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> sy) have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">qeon</font>, &#8220;God&#8221;) after <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#949;&#963;&#960;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">despothn</font>, &#8220;master&#8221;), which appears to be a motivated reading in that it explicitly links &#8220;Master&#8221; to &#8220;God&#8221; in keeping with the normal NT pattern (see Luke 2:29; Acts 4:24; 2 Tim 2:21; Rev 6:10). In patristic Greek, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#949;&#963;&#960;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">despoth&quot;</font>) was used especially of God (cf. BDAG 220 s.v. 1.b.). The earlier and better witnesses (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>72,78</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A B C 0251 33 81 323 1241 1739 <i>al</i> co) lack <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#957;</font>; the shorter reading is thus preferred on both internal and external grounds.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Greek term for <i>Master</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#949;&#963;&#960;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">despoths</font>) is the same term the author of 2 Peter used (2 Pet 2:1) to describe his Lord when he prophesied about these false teachers. Since <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#949;&#963;&#960;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#962;</font> is used only ten times in the NT, the verbal connection between these two books at this juncture is striking. This is especially so since both Peter and Jude speak of these false teachers as <i>denying</i> the <i>Master</i> (both using the same verb). The basic difference is that Peter is looking to the future, while Jude is arguing that these false teachers are here now.</p>
<a name="121"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=21><b>tn</b> The terms &#8220;Master and Lord&#8221; both refer to the same person. The construction in Greek is known as the Granville Sharp rule, named after the English philanthropist-linguist who first clearly articulated the rule in 1798. Sharp pointed out that in the construction article-noun-<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font>-noun (where <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> [<font face="Greektl">kai</font>] = &#8220;and&#8221;), when two nouns are singular, personal, and common (i.e., not proper names), they <i>always</i> had the same referent. Illustrations such as &#8220;the friend and brother,&#8221; &#8220;the God and Father,&#8221; etc. abound in the NT to prove Sharp&#8217;s point. For more discussion see <i>ExSyn</i> 270-78. See also Titus 2:13 and 2 Pet 1:1 </p>
<a name="122"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=22><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;knowing all things.&#8221; The subject of the participle &#8220;knowing&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#948;&#972;&#964;&#945;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">eidota&quot;</font>) is an implied <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#956;&#8118;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jumas</font>), though several ancient witnesses actually add it. The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">panta</font>) takes on an adverbial force in this context (&#8220;fully&#8221;), intensifying how acquainted the readers are with the following points.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> That Jude comments on his audience&#8217;s prior knowledge of what he is about to tell them (<i>you have been fully informed of these facts</i>) may imply that they were familiar with 2 Peter. In 2 Pet 2:4ff., the same illustrations from the OT are drawn. See the note on the following phrase <i>once for all</i>.</p>
<a name="123"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=23><b>tc</b> &#8225; Some translations take <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7941;&#960;&#945;&#958;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Japax</font>) with the following clause (thus, &#8220;[Jesus,] having saved the people <i>once for all</i>&#8221;). Such a translation presupposes that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7941;&#960;&#945;&#958;</font> is a part of the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) clause. The reading of NA<sup>27</sup>, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#8005;&#964;&#953; </font>[<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001;</font>]<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> &#954;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#7941;&#960;&#945;&#958;</font> (<font face="Greektl">panta {oti </font>[<font face="Greektl">Jo</font>]<font face="Greektl"> kurio&quot; {apax</font>), suggests this interpretation (though with &#8220;Lord&#8221; instead of &#8220;Jesus&#8221;). This particle is found before <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#945;&#972;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">laon</font>) in the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> C* <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 630 1241 1243 1505 1739 1846 1881 <i>pc</i> co<i>.</i> But <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7941;&#960;&#945;&#958;</font> is found before the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause in most witnesses, including several important ones (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>72</sup> A B C<sup>2</sup> 33 81 623 2344 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> vg). What seems best able to explain the various placements of the adverb is that scribes were uncomfortable with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7941;&#960;&#945;&#958;</font> referring to the readers&#8217; knowledge, feeling it was more appropriate to the theological significance of &#8220;saved&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#8061;&#963;&#945;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">swsas</font>).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In this translation, Jude is stressing that the readers have been informed <i>once for all </i>of the OT illustrations he is about to mention. Where would they get this information? Most likely from having read 2 Peter. Earlier Jude used the same adverb to indicate that these believers had a written record of the faith. This seems to be his implication here, too. Thus, for the second time Jude is appealing to the written documents of the early church as authoritative as opposed to the messages of the false teachers. As the 1st century began to draw to a close, the early church found itself increasingly dependent on the letters and gospels of the apostles and their associates. Once those apostles died, false apostles and false teachers sprang up, like wolves in sheep&#8217;s clothing (cf. Acts 20:29-30). To combat this, some of the latest books of the NT stressed the authority of what had been written (so Hebrews, Jude, Ephesians, 1 John). Although these writers anticipated the return of the Lord, they also braced their audiences for a delay of the <i>parousia</i> (the second coming of Christ) by suggesting that when they were gone the NT documents should guide them.</p>
<a name="124"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=24><b>tc</b> &#8225; The reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Ihsous</font>, &#8220;Jesus&#8221;) is deemed too hard by several scholars, since it involves the notion of Jesus acting in the early history of the nation Israel. However, not only does this reading enjoy the strongest support from a variety of early witnesses (e.g., A B 33 81 1241 1739 1881 2344 <i>pc </i>vg co Or<sup>1739mg</sup>), but the plethora of variants demonstrate that scribes were uncomfortable with it, for they seemed to exchange <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kurios</font>, &#8220;Lord&#8221;) or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">qeos</font>, &#8220;God&#8221;) for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</font> (though <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>72</sup> has the intriguing reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#8056;&#962; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> [<font face="Greektl">qeos Cristos</font>, &#8220;God Christ&#8221;] for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</font>).

As difficult as the reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</font> is, in light of v. 4 and in light of the progress of revelation (Jude being one of the last books in the NT to be composed), it is wholly appropriate.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The construction <i>our Master and Lord, Jesus Christ </i>in v. 4 follows Granville Sharp&#8217;s rule (see note on <i>Lord</i>). The construction strongly implies the deity of Christ. This is followed by a statement that <i>Jesus</i> was involved in the salvation (and later judgment) of the Hebrews. He is thus to be identified with the Lord God, Yahweh. Verse 5, then, simply fleshes out what is implicit in v. 4.</p>

It could refer to flesh of another species (such as angels lusting after human flesh). This would aptly describe the sin of the angels, but not easily explain the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah. It could refer to the homosexual practices of the Sodomites, but a difficulty arises from the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7957;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">{etero&quot;</font>; &#8220;strange,&#8221; &#8220;other&#8221;).

In response, the language could easily be compact: &#8220;pursued flesh <i>other</i> than what was normally pursued.&#8221; However, would this find an analogy in the lust of angels (such would imply that angels <i>normally</i> had sexual relations of some sort, but cf. Matt 22:30)? Another alternative is that the focus of the parallel is on the activity of the surrounding cities and the activity of the angels. This is especially plausible since the participles <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#963;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ekporneusasai</font>, &#8220;having indulged in sexual immorality&#8221;) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#949;&#955;&#952;&#959;&#8166;&#963;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">apelqousai</font>, &#8220;having pursued&#8221;) have concord with &#8220;cities&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#972;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">poleis</font>), a feminine plural noun, rather than with Sodom and Gomorrah (both masculine nouns). If so, then their sin would not necessarily have to be homosexuality. However, most likely the feminine participles are used because of <i>constructio ad sensum</i> (construction according to sense). That is, since both Sodom and Gomorrah are cities, the feminine is used to imply that all the cities are involved. The connection with angels thus seems to be somewhat loose: Both angels and Sodom and Gomorrah indulged in heinous sexual immorality. Thus, whether the false teachers indulge in homosexual activity is not the point; mere sexual immorality is enough to condemn them.</p>

Thus, the false teachers would appear as &#8220;rocks&#8221; &#8211; as pillars in the community (cf. Matt 16:18; Gal 2:9), when in reality if a believer got too close to them his faith would get shipwrecked. Some suggest that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#960;&#953;&#955;&#940;&#948;&#949;&#962;</font> here means &#8220;hidden rocks.&#8221; Though this meaning is attested for the word, it is inappropriate in this context, since these false teachers are anything but hidden.

<a name="189"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">89</span><note=89><b>tn</b> The participles in v. 20 have been variously interpreted. Some treat them imperativally or as attendant circumstance to the imperative in v. 21 (&#8220;maintain&#8221;): &#8220;build yourselves up&#8230;pray.&#8221; But they do not follow the normal contours of either the imperatival or attendant circumstance participles, rendering this unlikely. A better option is to treat them as the <i>means</i> by which the readers are to maintain themselves in the love of God. This both makes eminently good sense and fits the structural patterns of instrumental participles elsewhere.</p>

At the same time, he is <i>not</i> saying that the body is intrinsically bad, a view held by the opponents of Christianity. Hence, it is best to see &#8220;flesh&#8221; as referring to the sin nature here and the language as metaphorical.</p>
