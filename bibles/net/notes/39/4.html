<A NAME="41"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=82><b>sn</b> Beginning with <b>4:1</b>, the verse numbers through <b>4:6</b> in the English Bible differ from the verse numbers in the Hebrew text (<i>BHS</i>), with <b>4:1</b> ET = <b>3:19</b> HT, <b>4:2</b> ET = <b>3:20</b> HT, etc., through <b>4:6</b> ET = <b>3:24</b> HT. Thus the book of Malachi in the Hebrew Bible has only three chapters, with 24 verses in ch. 3.</p>
<A NAME="42"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=83><b>sn</b> This <i>day</i> is the well-known &#8220;day of the <sc>Lord&#8221; so pervasive in OT eschatological texts (see Joel 2:30-31; Amos 5:18; Obad 15). For the believer it is a day of grace and salvation; for the sinner, a day of judgment and destruction.</p>
<A NAME="43"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=84><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;so that it&#8221; (so NASB, NRSV). For stylistic reasons a new sentence was begun here in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="44"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=85><b>tn</b> Here the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsÿdaqah</font>), usually translated &#8220;righteousness&#8221; (so KJV, NIV, NRSV, NLT; cf. NAB &#8220;justice&#8221;), has been rendered as &#8220;vindication&#8221; because it is the vindication of God&#8217;s people that is in view in the context. Cf. BDB 842 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1492;</font> 6; &#8220;<i>righteousness</i> as vindicated, <i>justification</i>, <i>salvation</i>, etc.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The expression <i>the sun of vindication will rise</i> is a metaphorical way of describing the day of the <sc>Lord as a time of restoration when God vindicates his people (see 2 Sam 23:4; Isa 30:26; 60:1, 3). Their vindication and restoration will be as obvious and undeniable as the bright light of the rising sun.</p>
<A NAME="45"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=86><b>sn</b> The point of the metaphor of <i>healing wings</i> is unclear. The sun seems to be compared to a bird. Perhaps the sun&#8217;s &#8220;wings&#8221; are its warm rays. &#8220;Healing&#8221; may refer to a reversal of the injury done by evildoers (see Mal 3:5).</p>
<A NAME="46"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=87><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you will go out and skip about.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="47"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=88><b>sn</b> <i>Horeb</i> is another name for Mount Sinai (cf. Exod 3:1).</p>
<A NAME="48"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=89><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;which I commanded him in Horeb concerning all Israel, statutes and ordinances.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="49"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=90><b>sn</b> <i>I will send you Elijah the prophet</i>. In light of the ascension of Elijah to heaven without dying (2 Kgs 2:11), Judaism has always awaited his return as an aspect of the messianic age (see, e.g., John 1:19-28). Jesus identified John the Baptist as Elijah, because he came in the &#8220;spirit and power&#8221; of his prototype Elijah (Matt 11:14; 17:1-13; Mark 9:2-13; Luke 9:28-36). </p>
<A NAME="410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=91><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;he will turn the heart[s] of [the] fathers to [the] sons, and the heart[s] of [the] sons to their fathers.&#8221; This may mean that the messenger will encourage reconciliation of conflicts within Jewish families in the postexilic community (see Mal 2:10; this interpretation is followed by most English versions). Another option is to translate, &#8220;he will turn the hearts of the fathers together with those of the children [to me], and the hearts of the children together with those of their fathers [to me].&#8221; In this case the prophet encourages both the younger and older generations of sinful society to repent and return to the <sc>Lord (cf. Mal 3:7). This option is preferred in the present translation; see Beth Glazier-McDonald, <i>Malachi </i>(SBLDS), 256.</p>
<A NAME="411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=92><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;[the] ban&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1461;&#1512;&#1462;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kherem</font>). God&#8217;s prophetic messenger seeks to bring about salvation and restoration, thus avoiding the imposition of the covenant curse, that is, the divine ban that the hopelessly unrepentant must expect (see Deut 7:2; 20:17; Judg 1:21; Zech 14:11). If the wicked repent, the purifying judgment threatened in 4:1-3 will be unnecessary.</p>
