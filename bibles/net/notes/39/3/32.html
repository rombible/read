<A NAME="32"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=50><b>tn</b> In Hebrew the phrase &#8220;my messenger&#8221; is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1499;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mal</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akhi</font>), the same form as the prophet&#8217;s name (see note on the name &#8220;Malachi&#8221; in 1:1). However, here the messenger appears to be an eschatological figure who is about to appear, as the following context suggests. According to 4:5, this messenger is &#8220;Elijah the prophet,&#8221; whom the NT identifies as John the Baptist (Matt 11:10; Mark 1:2) because he came in the &#8220;spirit and power&#8221; of Elijah (Matt 11:14; 17:11-12; Lk 1:17).</p>
