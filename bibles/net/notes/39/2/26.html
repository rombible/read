<A NAME="26"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=29><b>sn</b> <i>My covenant </i>refers to the priestly covenant through Aaron and his grandson Phinehas (see Exod 6:16-20; Num 25:10-13; Jer 33:21-22). The point here is to contrast the priestly ideal with the disgraceful manner in which it was being carried out in postexilic times.</p>
