<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=40><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;every man who does this, him who is awake and him who answers.&#8221; For &#8220;answers&#8221; the LXX suggests an underlying Hebrew text of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anah</font>, &#8220;to be humbled&#8221;), and then the whole phrase is modified slightly: &#8220;until he is humbled.&#8221; This requires also that the MT <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">er</font>, &#8220;awake&#8221;) be read as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1491;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ed</font>, &#8220;until&#8221;; here the LXX reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7957;&#969;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jews</font>). The reading of the LXX is most likely an alteration to correct what is arguably a difficult text.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;every man who does this, him who is awake and him who answers.&#8221; The idea seems to be a merism expressing totality, that is, everybody from the awakener to the awakened, thus &#8220;every last person who does this&#8221; (NLT similar); NIV &#8220;whoever he may be.&#8221;</p>
