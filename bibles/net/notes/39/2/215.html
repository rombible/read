<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=38><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;has married the daughter of a foreign god.&#8221; Marriage is used here as a metaphor to describe Judah&#8217;s idolatry, that is, her unfaithfulness to the <sc>Lord and &#8220;remarriage&#8221; to pagan gods. But spiritual intermarriage found expression in literal, physical marriage as well, as vv. 14-16 indicate.</p>
