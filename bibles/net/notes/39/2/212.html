<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=35><b>sn</b> The rhetorical question <i>Do we not all have one father?</i> by no means teaches the &#8220;universal fatherhood of God,&#8221; that is, that all people equally are children of God. The reference to the covenant in v. 10 as well as to Israel and Judah (v. 11) makes it clear that the referent of &#8220;we&#8221; is God&#8217;s elect people.</p>
