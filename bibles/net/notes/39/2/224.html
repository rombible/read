<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=47><b>tc</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1504;&#1461;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sane</font>&#8217;) appears to be a third person form, &#8220;he hates,&#8221; which makes little sense in the context, unless one emends the following word to a third person verb as well. Then one might translate, &#8220;he [who] hates [his wife] [and] divorces her&#8230;is guilty of violence.&#8221; A similar translation is advocated by M. A. Shields, &#8220;Syncretism and Divorce in Malachi 2,10-16,&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 111 (1999): 81-85. However, it is possible that the first person pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1504;&#1465;&#1499;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anokhi</font>, &#8220;I&#8221;) has accidentally dropped from the text after <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>). If one restores the pronoun, the form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1504;&#1461;&#1488;</font> can be taken as a participle and the text translated, &#8220;for I hate&#8221; (so NAB, NASB, NRSV, NLT). </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Though the statement &#8220;I hate divorce&#8221; may (and should) be understood as a comprehensive biblical principle, the immediate context suggests that the divorce in view is that of one Jewish person by another in order to undertake subsequent marriages. The injunction here by no means contradicts Ezra&#8217;s commands to Jewish men to divorce their heathen wives (Ezra 9&#8211;10).</p>
