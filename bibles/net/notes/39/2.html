<A NAME="21"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=24><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;and if you do not place upon [the] heart&#8221;; KJV, NAB, NRSV &#8220;lay it to heart.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="22"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=25><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;the curse&#8221; (so NASB, NRSV); NLT &#8220;a terrible curse.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="23"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=26><b>tc</b> The phrase &#8220;discipline your children&#8221; is disputed. The LXX and Vulgate suppose <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1506;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zÿroa</font>&#8217;, &#8220;arm&#8221;) for the MT <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1462;&#1512;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zera</font>&#8217;, &#8220;seed&#8221;; hence, &#8220;children&#8221;). Then, for the MT <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1465;&#1506;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">go</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">er</font>, &#8220;rebuking&#8221;) the same versions suggest <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gara</font>&#8217;, &#8220;take away&#8221;). The resulting translation is &#8220;I am about to take away your arm&#8221; (cf. NAB &#8220;deprive you of the shoulder&#8221;). However, this reading is unlikely. It is common for a curse (v. 2) to fall on offspring (see, e.g., Deut 28:18, 32, 41, 53, 55, 57), but a curse never takes the form of a broken or amputated arm. It is preferable to retain the reading of the MT here.</p>
<A NAME="24"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=27><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">feresh</font>, &#8220;offal&#8221;) refers to the entrails as ripped out in preparing a sacrificial victim (BDB 831 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font>). This graphic term has been variously translated: &#8220;dung&#8221; (KJV, RSV, NRSV, NLT); &#8220;refuse&#8221; (NKJV, NASB); &#8220;offal&#8221; (NEB, NIV).</p>
<A NAME="25"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=28><b>sn</b> See Zech 3:3-4 for similar coarse imagery which reflects cultic disqualification.</p>
<A NAME="26"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=29><b>sn</b> <i>My covenant </i>refers to the priestly covenant through Aaron and his grandson Phinehas (see Exod 6:16-20; Num 25:10-13; Jer 33:21-22). The point here is to contrast the priestly ideal with the disgraceful manner in which it was being carried out in postexilic times.</p>
<A NAME="27"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=30><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;True teaching was in his mouth&#8221;; cf. NASB, NRSV &#8220;True instruction (doctrine NAB) was in his mouth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="28"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=31><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;from his mouth&#8221; (so NAB, NASB, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="29"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=32><b>tn</b> The definite article embedded within <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">battorah</font>) may suggest that <i>the</i> Torah is in mind and not just &#8220;ordinary&#8221; priestly instruction, though it might refer to the instruction previously mentioned (v. 7).</p>
<A NAME="210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=33><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the Levitical covenant.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=34><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the instruction&#8221; (so NASB). The Hebrew article is used here as a possessive pronoun (cf. NRSV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=35><b>sn</b> The rhetorical question <i>Do we not all have one father?</i> by no means teaches the &#8220;universal fatherhood of God,&#8221; that is, that all people equally are children of God. The reference to the covenant in v. 10 as well as to Israel and Judah (v. 11) makes it clear that the referent of &#8220;we&#8221; is God&#8217;s elect people.</p>
<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=36><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=37><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;secularized&#8221;; cf. NIV &#8220;desecrated&#8221;; TEV, NLT &#8220;defiled&#8221;; CEV &#8220;disgraced.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=38><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;has married the daughter of a foreign god.&#8221; Marriage is used here as a metaphor to describe Judah&#8217;s idolatry, that is, her unfaithfulness to the <sc>Lord and &#8220;remarriage&#8221; to pagan gods. But spiritual intermarriage found expression in literal, physical marriage as well, as vv. 14-16 indicate.</p>
<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=39><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;tents,&#8221; used figuratively for the community here (cf. NCV, TEV); NLT &#8220;the nation of Israel.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=40><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;every man who does this, him who is awake and him who answers.&#8221; For &#8220;answers&#8221; the LXX suggests an underlying Hebrew text of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anah</font>, &#8220;to be humbled&#8221;), and then the whole phrase is modified slightly: &#8220;until he is humbled.&#8221; This requires also that the MT <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">er</font>, &#8220;awake&#8221;) be read as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1491;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ed</font>, &#8220;until&#8221;; here the LXX reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7957;&#969;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jews</font>). The reading of the LXX is most likely an alteration to correct what is arguably a difficult text.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;every man who does this, him who is awake and him who answers.&#8221; The idea seems to be a merism expressing totality, that is, everybody from the awakener to the awakened, thus &#8220;every last person who does this&#8221; (NLT similar); NIV &#8220;whoever he may be.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=41><b>sn</b> <i>You cover the altar of the </i><sc>Lord</><i> with tears</i>. These tears<i> </i>are the false tears of hypocrisy, not genuine tears of repentance. The people weep because the <sc>Lord will not hear them, not because of their sin.</p>
<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=42><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;the <sc>Lord is a witness between you and [between] the wife of your youth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=43><b>sn</b> Though there is no explicit reference to marriage vows in the OT (but see Job 7:13; Prov 2:17; Ezek 16:8), the term <i>law </i>(<i>Heb</i> &#8220;covenant&#8221;) here asserts that such vows or agreements must have existed. References to divorce documents (e.g., Deut 24:1-3; Jer 3:8) also presuppose the existence of marriage documents.</p>
<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=44><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;and not one has done, and a remnant of the spirit to him.&#8221; The very elliptical nature of the statement suggests it is proverbial. The present translation represents an attempt to clarify the meaning of the statement (cf. NASB).</p>
<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=45><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the one.&#8221; This is an oblique reference to Abraham who sought to obtain God&#8217;s blessing by circumventing God&#8217;s own plan for him by taking Hagar as wife (Gen 16:1-6). The result of this kind of intermarriage was, of course, disastrous (Gen 16:11-12).</p>
<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=46><b>sn</b> <i>The wife he took in his youth</i> probably refers to the first wife one married (cf. NCV &#8220;the wife you married when you were young&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=47><b>tc</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1504;&#1461;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sane</font>&#8217;) appears to be a third person form, &#8220;he hates,&#8221; which makes little sense in the context, unless one emends the following word to a third person verb as well. Then one might translate, &#8220;he [who] hates [his wife] [and] divorces her&#8230;is guilty of violence.&#8221; A similar translation is advocated by M. A. Shields, &#8220;Syncretism and Divorce in Malachi 2,10-16,&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 111 (1999): 81-85. However, it is possible that the first person pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1504;&#1465;&#1499;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anokhi</font>, &#8220;I&#8221;) has accidentally dropped from the text after <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>). If one restores the pronoun, the form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1504;&#1461;&#1488;</font> can be taken as a participle and the text translated, &#8220;for I hate&#8221; (so NAB, NASB, NRSV, NLT). </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Though the statement &#8220;I hate divorce&#8221; may (and should) be understood as a comprehensive biblical principle, the immediate context suggests that the divorce in view is that of one Jewish person by another in order to undertake subsequent marriages. The injunction here by no means contradicts Ezra&#8217;s commands to Jewish men to divorce their heathen wives (Ezra 9&#8211;10).</p>
<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=48><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;him who covers his garment with violence&#8221; (similar ASV, NRSV). Here &#8220;garment&#8221; is a metaphor for appearance and &#8220;violence&#8221; a metonymy of effect for cause. God views divorce as an act of violence against the victim.</p>
