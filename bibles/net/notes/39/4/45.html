<A NAME="45"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=86><b>sn</b> The point of the metaphor of <i>healing wings</i> is unclear. The sun seems to be compared to a bird. Perhaps the sun&#8217;s &#8220;wings&#8221; are its warm rays. &#8220;Healing&#8221; may refer to a reversal of the injury done by evildoers (see Mal 3:5).</p>
