<A NAME="410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=91><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;he will turn the heart[s] of [the] fathers to [the] sons, and the heart[s] of [the] sons to their fathers.&#8221; This may mean that the messenger will encourage reconciliation of conflicts within Jewish families in the postexilic community (see Mal 2:10; this interpretation is followed by most English versions). Another option is to translate, &#8220;he will turn the hearts of the fathers together with those of the children [to me], and the hearts of the children together with those of their fathers [to me].&#8221; In this case the prophet encourages both the younger and older generations of sinful society to repent and return to the <sc>Lord (cf. Mal 3:7). This option is preferred in the present translation; see Beth Glazier-McDonald, <i>Malachi </i>(SBLDS), 256.</p>
