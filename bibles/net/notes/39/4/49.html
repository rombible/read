<A NAME="49"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=90><b>sn</b> <i>I will send you Elijah the prophet</i>. In light of the ascension of Elijah to heaven without dying (2 Kgs 2:11), Judaism has always awaited his return as an aspect of the messianic age (see, e.g., John 1:19-28). Jesus identified John the Baptist as Elijah, because he came in the &#8220;spirit and power&#8221; of his prototype Elijah (Matt 11:14; 17:1-13; Mark 9:2-13; Luke 9:28-36). </p>
