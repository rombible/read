<A NAME="1010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=312><b>tc</b> The MT reads the plural <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1506;&#1462;&#1490;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eglot</font>, &#8220;for the calves&#8221;), while some Greek versions (LXX, Theodotion) and the Syriac reflect the singular <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1506;&#1461;&#1490;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (&#8220;for the calf [calf idol]&#8221;). The singular reading is preferred on the basis of internal evidence: the oracle denounces the calf idol worship of Samaria. The plural form probably arose due to the ambiguity of the term &#8220;calf&#8221; when a scribe did not realize that the term was being used as a metonymy for the worship of the Egyptian calf goddess. Most recent English versions adopt the singular form and relate it to the calf goddess cult (RSV, NASB, NIV, NCV, NJPS, TEV, CEV, NLT); however, older English versions follow the MT plural (KJV, ASV).</p>
