<A NAME="927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=294><b>tn</b> Or more literally, &#8220;they are deeply corrupted.&#8221; The two verbs <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1462;&#1506;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1495;&#1461;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">he</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">miqu-shikhetu</font>; literally, &#8220;they have made deep, they act corruptly&#8221;) are coordinated without a conjunction <font face="Scholar">vav</font> to form a verbal hendiadys: the second verb represents the main idea, while the first functions adverbially (GKC 386-87 §120.<i>g</i>). Here Gesenius suggests &#8220;they are deeply/radically corrupted.&#8221; Several translations mirror the syntax of this hendiadys: &#8220;They have deeply corrupted themselves&#8221; (KJV, ASV, NRSV), &#8220;They have been grievously corrupt&#8221; (NJPS), and &#8220;They are hopelessly evil&#8221; (TEV). Others reverse the syntax for the sake of a more graphic English idiom: &#8220;They have gone deep in depravity&#8221; (NASB) and &#8220;They have sunk deep into corruption&#8221; (NIV). Some translations fail to represent the hendiadys at all: &#8220;You are brutal and corrupt&#8221; (CEV). The translation &#8220;They are deeply corrupted&#8221; mirrors the Hebrew syntax, but &#8220;They have sunk deep into corruption&#8221; is a more graphic English idiom and is preferred here (cf. NAB &#8220;They have sunk to the depths of corruption&#8221;).</p>
