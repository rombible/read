<A NAME="1216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=382><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I have found wealth for myself.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">matsa</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to find&#8221;) is repeated in 12:8 to create a wordplay that is difficult to reproduce in translation. The Israelites have &#8220;found&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1488;</font>) wealth for themselves (i.e., become wealthy; v. 8a) through dishonest business practices (v. 7). Nevertheless, they claim that no guilt can be &#8220;found&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1488;</font>) in anything they have done in gaining their wealth (v. 8b).</p>
