Most follow the MT: &#8220;In all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that were sin&#8221; (KJV); &#8220;In all my labors they will find in me no iniquity, which would be sin&#8221; (NASB); &#8220;With all my wealth they will not find in me any iniquity or sin&#8221; (NIV); &#8220;All my gains do not amount to an offense which is real guilt&#8221; (NJPS); &#8220;No one can accuse us [<i>sic</i>] of getting rich dishonestly&#8221; (TEV); &#8220;I earned it all on my own, without committing a sin&#8221; (CEV).
