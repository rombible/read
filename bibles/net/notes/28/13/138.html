<A NAME="138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=411><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Those among men who offer sacrifices.&#8221; The genitive construct <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1465;&#1489;&#1456;&#1495;&#1461;&#1497; &#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zovkhe </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adam</font>, &#8220;the sacrificers of men&#8221;) is misunderstood by NIV as an objective genitive phrase: &#8220;they offer human sacrifice.&#8221; Such a classification is questionable: (1) Nowhere else in the book does Hosea accuse Israel of human sacrifice, and (2) archaeological evidence does not provide any evidence of human sacrifice in the Northern Kingdom during Iron Age I (1200-722 <sc>b.c.). This phrase should be classified as a genitive of species: the genitive represents the whole class or kind of a species (men) and the construct represents a part of the whole or subspecies within the whole (those who sacrifice): &#8220;those among men who offer sacrifice&#8221; (those who offer sacrifices). The expression &#8220;a fool of men&#8221; in Prov 15:20 provides a similar example: the genitive represents the whole class/species (men) and the construct represents a part of the whole/subspecies (a fool): &#8220;a foolish man.&#8221; This is the tactic adopted by most English versions: &#8220;the men that sacrifice&#8221; (KJV), &#8220;the men who sacrifice&#8221; (NASB), &#8220;they appoint men to sacrifice [to them]&#8221; (NJPS).</p>
