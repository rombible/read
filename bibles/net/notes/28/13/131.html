<A NAME="131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=404><b>sn</b> In Hosea the name &#8220;Ephraim&#8221; does not refer to the tribe, but to the region of Mount Ephraim where the royal residence of Samaria was located. It functions as a synecdoche of location (Mount Ephraim) for its inhabitants (the king of Samaria; e.g., 5:13; 8:8, 10).</p>
