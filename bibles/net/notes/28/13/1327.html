<A NAME="1327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=430><b>tn</b> The translation of the first two lines of this verse reflects the interpretation adopted. There are three interpretive options to v. 14: (1) In spite of Israel&#8217;s sins, the <sc>Lord will redeem them from the threat of death and destruction (e.g., 11:8). However, against this view, the last line of 13:14 probably means that the <sc>Lord will not show compassion to Israel. (2) The <sc>Lord announces the triumphant victory over death through resurrection (cf. KJV, ASV, NIV). However, although Paul uses the wording of Hosea 13:14 as an illustration of victory over death, the context of Hosea&#8217;s message is the imminent judgment in 723-722 <sc>b.c. (3) The first two lines of 13:14 are rhetorical questions without explicit interrogative markers, implying negative answers: &#8220;I will not rescue them!&#8221; (cf. NAB, NASB, NCV, NRSV, TEV, CEV, NLT). The next two lines in 13:14 are words of encouragement to Death and Sheol to destroy Israel. The final line announces that the <sc>Lord will not show compassion on Israel; he will not spare her.</p>
