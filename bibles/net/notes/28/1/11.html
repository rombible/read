<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1><b>tc</b> The textual problems in Hosea are virtually unparalleled in the OT. The Masoretic Text (MT), represented by the Leningrad Codex (c. <span class="smallcaps">a.d. </span>1008), which served as the basis for both <i>BHK</i> and <i>BHS</i>, and the Aleppo Codex (c. <span class="smallcaps">a.d. </span>952), are textually corrupt by all accounts and have a multitude of scribal errors. Many medieval Masoretic <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> preserve textual variants that differ from the Leningrad and Aleppo Codices. The Qumran materials (4QXII<sup>c,d,g</sup>) contain numerous textual variants that differ from the MT; unfortunately, these texts are quite fragmentary (frequently in the very place that an important textual problem appears). The textual tradition and translation quality of the LXX and the early Greek recensions (Aquila, Symmachus, Theodotion) is mixed; in some places they are inferior to the MT but in other places they preserve a better reading. The textual apparatus of <i>BHK</i> and <i>BHS</i> contains many proposed emendations based on the ancient versions (Greek, Syriac, Latin, Aramaic) that often appear to be superior readings than what is preserved in the MT. In numerous cases, the MT readings are so difficult morphologically, syntactically, and contextually that conservative conjectural emendations are necessary to make sense of the text. Most major English versions (e.g., KJV, ASV, RSV, NEB, NAB, NASB, NIV, TEV, NKJV, NJPS, NJB, NRSV, REB, NCV, CEV, NLT) adopt (either occasionally or frequently) textual variants reflected in the versions and occasionally adopt conservative conjectural emendations proposed in <i>BHK</i> and/or <i>BHS</i>. However, many of the textual problems in Hosea are so difficult that the English versions frequently are split among themselves. With this in mind, the present translation of Hosea must necessarily be viewed as only preliminary. Further work on the text and translation of Hosea is needed, not only in terms of the <span class="smallcaps">NET Bible</span> but in Hosea studies in general. The text of Hosea should be better clarified when the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project completes work on the book of Hosea. For further study of textual problems in Hosea, see D. Barthélemy, ed.<i>, Preliminary and Interim Report on the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project</i>, 5:228-71.</p>
