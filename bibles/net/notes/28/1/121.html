<a name="121"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=21><b>tn</b> The plural form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dam</font>, &#8220;blood&#8221;) refers to &#8220;bloodshed&#8221; (BDB 196 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> 2.f). This is an example of a plural of abnormal condition (GKC 400 §124.<i>n</i>). The plural is used to represent natural objects which are found in an unnatural or abnormal condition. The plural is used because the natural object is normally found as a whole or in one unit, but in the abnormal condition the object is found in many parts. Normally, blood is contained as a whole within the body. However, when a brutal murder occurs, blood is shed and literally spilled all over the place. Cf. NIV &#8220;the massacre&#8221;; TEV, CEV, NLT &#8220;the murders.&#8221;</p>
