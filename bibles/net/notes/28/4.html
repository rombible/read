<A NAME="41"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=142><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sons of Israel&#8221; (so NASB); KJV &#8220;children of Israel&#8221;; NAB, NRSV &#8220;people of Israel.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="42"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=143><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">riv</font>, &#8220;dispute, lawsuit&#8221;) is used in two contexts: (1) nonlegal contexts: (a) &#8220;dispute&#8221; between individuals (e.g., Gen 13:7; Isa 58:1; Jer 15:10) or (b) &#8220;brawl; quarrel&#8221; between people (e.g., Exod 17:7; Deut 25:1); and (2) legal contexts: (a) &#8220;lawsuit; legal process&#8221; (e.g., Exod 23:3-6; Deut 19:17; 21:5; Ezek 44:24; Ps 35:23), (b) &#8220;lawsuit; legal case&#8221; (e.g., Deut 1:12; 17:8; Prov 18:17; 25:9), and (c) God&#8217;s &#8220;lawsuit&#8221; on behalf of a person or against his own people (Hos 4:1; 12:3; Mic 6:2; <i>HALOT</i> 1225-26 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;</font>). The term in Hosea refers to a covenant lawsuit in which Yahweh the suzerain lodges a legal case against his disobedient vassal, accusing Israel and Judah of breach of covenant which will elicit the covenant curses.</p>
<A NAME="43"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=144><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;with the inhabitants of the land&#8221; (so KJV); NAB, NASB, NRSV &#8220;against the inhabitants of the land.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="44"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=145><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;there is no truthfulness nor loyalty nor knowledge of God in the land.&#8221; Here &#8220;knowledge of God&#8221; refers to recognition of his authority and obedience to his will.</p>
<A NAME="45"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=146><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they break out and bloodshed touches bloodshed.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">parats</font>, &#8220;to break out&#8221;) refers to violent and wicked actions (BDB 829 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1509;</font> 7; <i>HALOT</i> 972 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1512;&#1509;</font> 6.c). It is used elsewhere in a concrete sense to describe breaking through physical barriers. Here it is used figuratively to describe breaking moral barriers and restraints (cf. TEV &#8220;Crimes increase, and there is one murder after another&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="46"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=147><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;languish&#8221; (so KJV, NRSV); NIV &#8220;waste away.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="49"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=150><b>tc</b> The MT reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464; &#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;&#1461;&#1497; &#1499;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ammÿkha kimrive khohen</font>): &#8220;And your people [are] like those who contend against the priest.&#8221; This is reflected in the LXX and the versions; however, it is syntactically awkward and makes little sense in context. Several textual critics suggest emending the text to read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464; &#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497; &#1499;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">immÿkha rivi khohen</font>): &#8220;My contention is with/against you, O priest!&#8221; This involves (1) the revocalization of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (&#8220;your people&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (&#8220;with/against you&#8221;) and (2) positing dittography (a letter written twice instead of once) of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kaf</font>) between original <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464; &#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;</font> to create <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464; &#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (MT). The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest that the MT is corrupt and should be emended. However, the editors of the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project retain the MT reading with a &#8220;B&#8221; rating. Likewise, the English translations are split: (1) KJV &#8220;for thy people are as they that strive with the priest&#8221;; NASB &#8220;for your people are like those who contend with the priest&#8221;; NIV &#8220;for your people are like those who bring charges against a priest&#8221;; (2) RSV &#8220;for with you is my contention, O priest&#8221;; NJPS &#8220;for this your people has a grievance against [you], O priest!&#8221;; TEV &#8220;my complaint is against you priests&#8221;; CEV &#8220;My case is against you, the priests!&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The singular noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">cohen</font>, &#8220;priest&#8221;) may be understood as a singular of number (so KJV, NASB, NRSV), referring to a singular individual (perhaps the high priest); however, it is more likely that it functions as a collective singular, referring to the priesthood as a whole (e.g., 4:7-10, so NAB, NCV, TEV, NLT, CEV). Collective singular forms alternate with plural forms throughout the oracle against the priests in 4:4-10.</p>
<A NAME="410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=151><b>tc</b> The MT reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497; &#1488;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿdamiti </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">immekha</font>, &#8220;and I will destroy your mother&#8221;), and is followed by most English versions; however, the text should probably be emended to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿdamit </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ammekha</font>, &#8220;and you have destroyed your own people&#8221;). The 2nd person masculine singular form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿdamit</font>, &#8220;and you have destroyed&#8221;) is preserved in several medieval Hebrew <sc>mss and reflected in Jerome&#8217;s Vulgate. For discussion in favor of the MT reading, see D. Barthélemy, ed.<i>, Preliminary and Interim Report on the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project</i>, 5:232.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;and I will destroy your mother&#8221; (so NASB, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=152><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they have destroyed&#8221; or &#8220;my people are destroyed&#8221; (so KJV, NIV, NRSV).</p>

<A NAME="415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=156><b>tc</b> The MT reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amir</font>, &#8220;I will change, exchange&#8221;; Hiphil imperfect 1st person common singular from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mur</font>, &#8220;to change, exchange&#8221;). However, an alternate scribal tradition (<i>tiqquneh sopherim</i>, that is, an intentional scribal change when the Masoretes believed that the received consonantal reading was corrupt) preserves the reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1461;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hemiru</font>, &#8220;they have exchanged&#8221;; Hiphil perfect 3rd person common plural from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font>). This alternate scribal tradition is also found in the Targum and reflected in the Syriac Peshitta. Several translations follow the MT: KJV, RSV, NASB &#8220;I will change their glory into shame&#8221; and TEV &#8220;I will turn your honor into disgrace&#8221;; however, others adopt the alternate tradition: NRSV &#8220;they changed their glory into shame&#8221; and NIV &#8220;they exchanged their Glory for something disgraceful.&#8221; For discussion in favor of the MT reading, see D. Barthélemy, ed.<i>, Preliminary and Interim Report on the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project</i>, 5:232.</p>
<A NAME="416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=157><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And it shall be, like people, like priest&#8221; (so ASV); NAB &#8220;The priests shall fare no better than the people.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=158><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;by guarding harlotry.&#8221; The present translation assumes that the first word of v. 11 in the Hebrew text is to be taken with the infinitive at the end of v. 10 (so also NAB, NIV, NCV, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=159><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;take away the heart of my people.&#8221; The present translation assumes that the first word of v. 12 in the Hebrew text is to be construed with the noun at the end of v. 11 (so also TEV, CEV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=160><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;adultery.&#8221; The adjective &#8220;spiritual&#8221; is supplied in the translation to clarify that apostasy is meant here.</p>
<A NAME="420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=161><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;they sacrifice&#8221; is not repeated in the Hebrew text here but is implied by parallelism; it is provided in the translation for the sake of clarity.</p>
<A NAME="421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=162><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;it is true&#8221; are supplied in the translation to indicate that this is a conclusion drawn on the preceding behavior. Cf. NAB &#8220;So must a people&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;thus a people&#8221;; TEV &#8220;As the proverb says, &#8216;A people.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=163><b>sn</b> <i>Beth Aven</i> means &#8220;house of wickedness&#8221; in Hebrew; it is a polemic reference to &#8220;Bethel,&#8221; which means &#8220;house of God.&#8221; Cf. CEV &#8220;at sinful Bethel.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=164><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb &#8220;has rebelled&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">sarar</font>) can also mean &#8220;to be stubborn.&#8221; This is the same root used in the simile: &#8220;like a stubborn (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1465;&#1512;&#1461;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">sorerah</font>) heifer.&#8221; The similarity between Israel and a stubborn heifer is emphasized by the repetition of the same term.</p>
<A NAME="424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=165><b>tn</b> The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">attah</font>) often refers to the imminent or the impending future: &#8220;very soon&#8221; (BDB 774 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> 1.b). In Hosea it normally introduces imminent judgment (Hos 2:12; 4:16; 5:7; 8:8, 13; 10:2).</p>
<A NAME="425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=166><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;How can the <sc>Lord feed them like a lamb in a meadow?&#8221; The syntax of this line is difficult and has been understood in two ways: (1) a declarative statement as an announcement of judgment (BDB 774 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> 1.b): &#8220;Now the <sc>Lord will feed them like a lamb in the broad field&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV, NCV, NLT) or (2) as a rhetorical question lamenting the uncooperative spirit of Israel: &#8220;How can the <sc>Lord feed them like a lamb in a meadow?&#8221;; cf. NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV, TEV), designed to produce a negative answer (&#8220;He cannot feed them&#8230;!&#8221;). However, this statement lacks an explicit interrogative marker. Although Hosea occasionally asks a rhetorical question without an explicit interrogative marker (e.g., 10:9; 13:14a), he normally does use a rhetorical particle to introduce rhetorical questions (e.g., 6:4; 8:5; 9:5, 14; 11:8; 13:9-10, 14b). Elsewhere, Hosea uses the introductory temporal adverb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8220;soon&#8221;) to introduce announcements of imminent future judgment (2:12; 4:16; 5:7; 8:8, 13; 10:2) and accusations of sin (5:3; 13:2). Although Israel has been as rebellious as a stubborn heifer, the <sc>Lord will indeed gain control of Israel: they will be like lambs (weakened and defeated) when he puts them out to pasture in a broad field (exile).</p>
<A NAME="426"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=167><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;their altars&#8221; (so NAB, NRSV) or &#8220;their sacrifices&#8221; (so KJV, NASB, NIV). Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zivkhotam</font>, &#8220;altars; sacrifices&#8221;) is a metonymy of association for Israel&#8217;s apostate idolatrous Baal worship.</p>
