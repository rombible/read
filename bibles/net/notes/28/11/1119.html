<A NAME="1119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=359><b>tn</b> The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1492;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456; &#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1497; &#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nehpakh </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alay libbi</font>) is an idiom that can be taken in two ways: (1) emotional sense: to describe a tumult of emotions, not just a clash of ideas, that are afflicting a person (Lam 1:20; <i>HALOT</i> 253 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1508;&#1498;</font> 1.c) and (2) volitional sense: to describe a decisive change of policy, that is, a reversal of sentiment from amity to hatred (Exod 14:5; Ps 105:25; BDB 245 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> 1; <i>HALOT</i> 253 s.v. 3). The English versions alternate between these two: (1) emotional discomfort and tension over the prospect of destroying Israel: &#8220;mine heart is turned within me&#8221; (KJV), &#8220;my heart recoils within me&#8221; (RSV, NRSV), &#8220;My heart is turned over within Me&#8221; (NASB), &#8220;My heart is torn within me&#8221; (NLT); and (2) volitional reversal of previous decision to totally destroy Israel: &#8220;I have had a change of heart&#8221; (NJPS), &#8220;my heart is changed within me&#8221; (NIV), and &#8220;my heart will not let me do it!&#8221; (TEV). Both BDB 245 s.v. 1.b and <i>HALOT</i> 253 s.v. 3 suggest that the idiom describes a decisive change of heart (reversal of decision to totally destroy Israel once and for all) rather than emotional turbulence of God shifting back and forth between whether to destroy or spare Israel. This volitional nuance is supported by the modal function of the 1st person common singular imperfects in 11:8 (&#8220;I will not carry out my fierce anger&#8230;I will not destroy Ephraim&#8230;I will not come in wrath&#8221;) and by the prophetic announcement of future restoration in 11:10-11. Clearly, a dramatic reversal both in tone and in divine intention occurs between 11:5-11.</p>
