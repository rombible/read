<A NAME="64"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=212><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;on the third day&#8221; (so NASB, NIV, NRSV), which parallels &#8220;after two days&#8221; and means &#8220;in a little while.&#8221; The &#8220;2-3&#8221; sequence is an example of graded numerical parallelism (Prov 30:15-16, 18-19, 21-23, 24-28, 29-31). This expresses the unrepentant overconfidence of Israel that the <sc>Lord&#8217;s discipline of Israel would be relatively short and that he would restore them quickly.</p>
