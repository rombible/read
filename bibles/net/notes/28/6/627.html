<A NAME="627"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=235><b>tc</b> In the verse divisions of the MT (Leningrad Codex and Aleppo Codex), this is the last line of 6:11. However, the <i>BHK</i> and <i>BHS</i> editors suggest that it belongs with the beginning of 7:1. The ancient versions (Greek, Syriac, Latin) all reflect textual traditions that connect it with 6:11. The English versions are divided: some connect it with 6:11 (KJV, NASB, NLT), while others connect it with 7:1 (RSV, NAB, NIV, NRSV, NJPS). The parallelism between this line and 7:1a favors connecting it with 7:1.</p>
