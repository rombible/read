<A NAME="617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=225><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">or</font>, &#8220;light&#8221;) is used here in reference to the morning light or dawn (e.g., Judg 16:2; 19:26; 1 Sam 14:36; 25:34, 36; 2 Sam 17:22; 23:4; 2 Kgs 7:9; Neh 8:3; Job 24:14; Prov 4:18; Mic 2:1; cf. CEV, NLT) rather than lightning (cf. NIV). This continues the early morning imagery used throughout 6:2-5.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In 6:3 unrepentant Israel uttered an over-confident boast that the <sc>Lord would rescue the nation from calamity as certainly as the &#8220;light of the dawn&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shakhar</font>) &#8220;comes forth&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1461;&#1510;&#1461;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yetse</font>&#8217;) every morning. Playing upon the early morning imagery, the <sc>Lord responded in 6:4 that Israel&#8217;s prerequisite repentance was as fleeting as the early morning dew. Now in 6:5, the <sc>Lord announces that he will indeed appear as certainly as the morning; however, it will not be to rescue but to punish Israel: punishment will &#8220;come forth&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1461;&#1510;&#1461;&#1488;</font>) like the &#8220;light of the dawn&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font>).</p>
