Several textual critics suggest emending the text to read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464; &#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497; &#1499;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">immÿkha rivi khohen</font>): &#8220;My contention is with/against you, O priest!&#8221; This involves (1) the revocalization of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (&#8220;your people&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (&#8220;with/against you&#8221;) and (2) positing dittography (a letter written twice instead of once) of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kaf</font>) between original <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464; &#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;</font> to create <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464; &#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (MT). The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest that the MT is corrupt and should be emended. However, the editors of the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project retain the MT reading with a &#8220;B&#8221; rating. Likewise, the English translations are split: (1) KJV &#8220;for thy people are as they that strive with the priest&#8221;; NASB &#8220;for your people are like those who contend with the priest&#8221;; NIV &#8220;for your people are like those who bring charges against a priest&#8221;; (2) RSV &#8220;for with you is my contention, O priest&#8221;; NJPS &#8220;for this your people has a grievance against [you], O priest!&#8221;; TEV &#8220;my complaint is against you priests&#8221;; CEV &#8220;My case is against you, the priests!&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The singular noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">cohen</font>, &#8220;priest&#8221;) may be understood as a singular of number (so KJV, NASB, NRSV), referring to a singular individual (perhaps the high priest); however, it is more likely that it functions as a collective singular, referring to the priesthood as a whole (e.g., 4:7-10, so NAB, NCV, TEV, NLT, CEV). Collective singular forms alternate with plural forms throughout the oracle against the priests in 4:4-10.</p>
