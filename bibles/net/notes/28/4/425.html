<A NAME="425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=166><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;How can the <sc>Lord feed them like a lamb in a meadow?&#8221; The syntax of this line is difficult and has been understood in two ways: (1) a declarative statement as an announcement of judgment (BDB 774 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> 1.b): &#8220;Now the <sc>Lord will feed them like a lamb in the broad field&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV, NCV, NLT) or (2) as a rhetorical question lamenting the uncooperative spirit of Israel: &#8220;How can the <sc>Lord feed them like a lamb in a meadow?&#8221;; cf. NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV, TEV), designed to produce a negative answer (&#8220;He cannot feed them&#8230;!&#8221;). However, this statement lacks an explicit interrogative marker. Although Hosea occasionally asks a rhetorical question without an explicit interrogative marker (e.g., 10:9; 13:14a), he normally does use a rhetorical particle to introduce rhetorical questions (e.g., 6:4; 8:5; 9:5, 14; 11:8; 13:9-10, 14b). Elsewhere, Hosea uses the introductory temporal adverb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8220;soon&#8221;) to introduce announcements of imminent future judgment (2:12; 4:16; 5:7; 8:8, 13; 10:2) and accusations of sin (5:3; 13:2). Although Israel has been as rebellious as a stubborn heifer, the <sc>Lord will indeed gain control of Israel: they will be like lambs (weakened and defeated) when he puts them out to pasture in a broad field (exile).</p>
