<A NAME="415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=156><b>tc</b> The MT reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amir</font>, &#8220;I will change, exchange&#8221;; Hiphil imperfect 1st person common singular from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mur</font>, &#8220;to change, exchange&#8221;). However, an alternate scribal tradition (<i>tiqquneh sopherim</i>, that is, an intentional scribal change when the Masoretes believed that the received consonantal reading was corrupt) preserves the reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1461;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hemiru</font>, &#8220;they have exchanged&#8221;; Hiphil perfect 3rd person common plural from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font>). This alternate scribal tradition is also found in the Targum and reflected in the Syriac Peshitta. Several translations follow the MT: KJV, RSV, NASB &#8220;I will change their glory into shame&#8221; and TEV &#8220;I will turn your honor into disgrace&#8221;; however, others adopt the alternate tradition: NRSV &#8220;they changed their glory into shame&#8221; and NIV &#8220;they exchanged their Glory for something disgraceful.&#8221; For discussion in favor of the MT reading, see D. Barthélemy, ed.<i>, Preliminary and Interim Report on the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project</i>, 5:232.</p>
