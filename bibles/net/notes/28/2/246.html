<A NAME="246"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=87><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to cover her nakedness&#8221; (so KJV and many other English versions); TEV &#8220;for clothing.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This announcement of judgment is extremely ironic and forcefully communicates poetic justice: The punishment will fit the crime. The Israelites were literally uncovering their nakedness in temple prostitution in the Baal fertility cult rituals. Yahweh will, in effect, give them what they wanted (nakedness) but not in the way they wanted it: Yahweh will withhold the agricultural fertility they sought from Baal which would lead to nakedness caused by impoverishment.</p>
