<A NAME="282"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">82</span><note=123><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they.&#8221; In the Hebrew text the plural pronoun is used because it refers back to the term translated &#8220;sky,&#8221; which is a dual form in Hebrew. Many English versions (e.g., NAB, NASB, NRSV) use the plural term &#8220;heavens&#8221; here, which agrees with a plural pronoun (cf. also NIV, NCV &#8220;skies&#8221;).</p>
