<A NAME="266"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=107><b>sn</b> There is a wordplay on the terms <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">li</font>, &#8220;my master&#8221;) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">habbé</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alim</font>, &#8220;the Baals&#8221;) which are derived from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>, &#8220;master; lord&#8221;). This wordplay is especially effective because the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> can refer to one&#8217;s husband and is also the name of the Canaanite storm god Baal. Referring to a spouse the term normally means &#8220;husband; master.&#8221; It was a common, ordinary, nonpejorative term that was frequently used in an interchangeable manner with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ish</font>, &#8220;husband; man&#8221;). Due to its similarity in sound to the abhorrent Canaanite fertility god Baal, the repentant Israelites would be so spiritually sensitive that they would refrain from even uttering this neutral term for fear of recalling their former idolatry. The purpose of the exile is to end Israel&#8217;s worship of Baal and to remove syncretism.</p>
