<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=56><b>tn</b> The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) introduces a parenthetical explanatory clause (however, cf. NCV &#8220;because&#8221;).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The reason that Hosea (representing the <sc>Lord) calls upon his children (representing the children of Israel) to plead with Gomer (representing the nation as a whole), rather than pleading directly with her himself, is because Hosea (the <sc>Lord) has turned his back on his unfaithful wife (Israel). He no longer has a relationship with her (&#8220;for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband&#8221;) because she abandoned him for her lovers.</p>
