<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1><b>sn</b> The date of the book of Obadiah is very difficult to determine. Since there is no direct indication of chronological setting clearly suggested by the book itself, and since the historical identity of the author is uncertain as well, a possible date for the book can be arrived at only on the basis of internal evidence. When did the hostile actions of Edom against Judah that are described in this book take place? Many nineteenth-century scholars linked the events of the book to a historical note found in 2 Kgs 8:20 (cf. 2 Chr 21:16-17): &#8220;In [Jehoram&#8217;s] days Edom rebelled from under the hand of Judah and established a king over themselves.&#8221; If this is the backdrop against which Obadiah should be read, it would suggest a ninth-century <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span> date for the book, since Jehoram reigned ca. 852-841 <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span> But the evidence presented for this view is not entirely convincing, and most contemporary Old Testament scholars reject a ninth-century scenario. A more popular view, held by many biblical scholars from Luther to the present, understands the historical situation presupposed in the book to be the Babylonian invasion of Judah in the sixth century (cf. Ps 137:7; Lam 4:18-22; Ezek 25:12-14; 35:1-15). Understood in this way, Obadiah would be describing a situation in which the Edomites assisted in the Babylonian sack of Jerusalem. Although it must be admitted that a sixth-century setting for the book of Obadiah cannot be proven, the details of the book fit reasonably well into such a context. Other views on the dating of the book, such as an eighth-century date in the time of Ahaz (ca. 732-716 <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span>) or a fifth-century date in the postexilic period, are less convincing. Parallels between the book of Obadiah and Jer 49:1-22 clearly suggest some kind of literary dependence, but it is not entirely clear whether Jeremiah drew on Obadiah or whether Obadiah drew upon Jeremiah, In any case, the close relationship between Obadiah and Jer 49 might suggest the sixth-century setting.</p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2><b>sn</b> The name <i>Obadiah</i> in Hebrew means &#8220;servant of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.&#8221; A dozen or so individuals in the OT have this name, none of whom may be safely identified with the author of this book. In reality we know very little about this prophet with regard to his exact identity or historical circumstances.</p>

<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>tn</b> The Hebrew preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿ</font>) is better translated here &#8220;concerning&#8221; (so KJV, ASV, NASB, NRSV, NLT) or &#8220;about&#8221; (so NIV, NCV, TEV, CEV) Edom rather than &#8220;to&#8221; Edom, although much of the book does speak directly <i>to</i> Edom.</p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=6><b>sn</b> The name <i>Edom</i> derives from a Hebrew root that means &#8220;red.&#8221; Edom was located to the south of the Dead Sea in an area with numerous rocky crags that provided ideal military advantages for protection. Much of the sandstone of this area has a reddish color. The Edomites were descendants of Esau, the brother of Jacob (Gen 25:19-26).</p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=7><b>tn</b> Although the word &#8220;saying&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, it has been supplied in the translation because what follows seems to be the content of the envoy&#8217;s message.

<a name="19"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=9><b>tn</b> The introductory phrase &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> says&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but has been supplied in the translation to clarify the identity of the speaker.</p>
<a name="110"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=10><b>tn</b> The Hebrew perfect verb form used here usually describes past events. However, here and several times in the following verses it is best understood as portraying certain fulfillment of events that at the time of writing were still <i>future</i>. It is the perfect of certitude. See GKC 312-13 §106.<i>n</i>; Joüon 2:363 §112.h.</p>
<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>sn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;I will make you small among the nations&#8221; (so NAB, NASB, NIV); NRSV &#8220;least among the nations&#8221;; NCV &#8220;the smallest of nations.&#8221;</p>

<a name="113"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=13><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the concealed places of the rock&#8221;; KJV, NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV &#8220;in the clefts of the rock&#8221;; NCV &#8220;the hollow places of the cliff&#8221;; CEV &#8220;a mountain fortress.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The word <i>rock</i> in Hebrew (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1462;&#1500;&#1463;&#1506;</font>, <font face="Scholar">sela</font>&#8217;) is a wordplay on Sela, the name of a prominent Edomite city. Its impregnability was a cause for arrogance on the part of its ancient inhabitants.</p>
<a name="114"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=14><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;on high (is) his dwelling&#8221;; NASB &#8220;in the loftiness of your dwelling place&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;whose dwelling (abode NAB) is in the heights.&#8221;</p>
<a name="115"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=15><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the one who says in his heart.&#8221;</p>
<a name="116"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=16><b>tn</b> The Hebrew imperfect verb used here is best understood in a modal sense (&#8220;Who <i>can</i> bring me down?&#8221;) rather than in the sense of a simple future (&#8220;Who <i>will</i> bring me down?&#8221;). So also in v. 4 (&#8220;I <i>can</i> bring you down&#8221;). The question is not so much whether this will happen at some time in the future, but whether it even lies in the realm of possible events. In their hubris the Edomites were boasting that no one had the capability of breaching their impregnable defenses. However, their pride caused them to fail to consider the vast capabilities of Yahweh as warrior.</p>
<a name="117"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=17><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Who can bring me down?&#8221; This rhetorical question implies a negative answer: &#8220;No one!&#8221;</p>
<a name="118"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=18><b>sn</b> The eagle was often used in the ancient Near East as a symbol of strength and swiftness.</p>
<a name="119"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=19><b>tc</b> The present translation follows the reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tasim</font>; active) rather than <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sim</font>; passive) of the MT (&#8220;and your nest be set among the stars,&#8221; NAB). Cf. LXX, Syriac, Vg.</p>
<a name="120"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=20><b>sn</b> Obadiah uses two illustrations to show the totality of Edom&#8217;s approaching destruction. Both robbers and harvesters would have left at least something behind. Such will not be the case, however, with the calamity that is about to befall Edom. A virtually identical saying appears in Jer 49:9-10.</p>
<a name="121"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=21><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;If thieves came to you, or if plunderers of the night&#8221; (NRSV similar). The repetition here adds rhetorical emphasis.</p>
<a name="122"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=22><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Would they not have stolen only their sufficiency?&#8221; The rhetorical question is used to make an emphatic assertion, which is perhaps best represented by the indicative form in the translation.</p>
<a name="123"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=23><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;If grape pickers came to you.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;to harvest your vineyards&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew, but is supplied in the translation to clarify the point of the entire simile which is assumed.</p>
<a name="124"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=24><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Would they not have left some gleanings?&#8221; The rhetorical question makes an emphatic assertion, which for the sake of clarity is represented by the indicative form in the translation. The implied answer to these rhetorical questions is &#8220;yes.&#8221; The fact that something would have remained after the imagined acts of theft or harvest stands in stark contrast to the totality of Edom&#8217;s destruction as predicted by Obadiah. Edom will be so decimated as a result of God&#8217;s judgment that nothing at all will be left</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> According to the Mosaic law, harvesters were required to leave some grain behind in the fields for the poor (Lev 19:9; 23:22; see also Ruth 2); there was a similar practice with grapes and olives (Lev 19:10; Deut 24:21). Regarding gleanings left behind from grapes, see Judg 8:2; Jer 6:9; 49:9; Mic 7:1.</p>
<a name="125"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=25><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;O how you will be cut off.&#8221; This emotional interjection functions rhetorically as the prophet&#8217;s announcement of judgment on Edom. In Hebrew this statement actually appears between the first and second metaphors, that is, in the middle of this verse. As the point of the comparison, one would expect it to follow both of the two metaphors; however, Obadiah interrupts his own sentence to interject his emphatic exclamation that cannot wait until the end of the sentence. This emphatic sentence structure is eloquent in Hebrew but awkward in English. Since this emphatic assertion is the point of his comparison, it appears at the end of the sentence in this translation, where one normally expects to find the concluding point of a metaphorical comparison.</p>
<a name="126"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=26><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;Esau.&#8221; The name Esau here is a synecdoche of part for whole referring to the Edomites. Cf. &#8220;Jacob&#8221; in v. 10, where the meaning is &#8220;Israelites.&#8221;</p>
<a name="127"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=27><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;How Esau will be searched!&#8221;; NAB &#8220;How they search Esau.&#8221; The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khafas</font>, &#8220;to search out&#8221;) is used metonymically here for plundering the hidden valuables of a conquered people (e.g., 1 Kgs 20:6).</p>
<a name="128"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=28><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his&#8221; (so KJV, NASB, NIV, NRSV); this is singular agreeing with &#8220;Esau&#8221; in the previous line.</p>
<a name="129"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=29><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;searched out&#8221; (so NASB, NRSV); NIV &#8220;pillaged&#8221;; TEV &#8220;looted&#8221;; NLT &#8220;found and taken.&#8221; This pictures the violent action of conquering warriors ransacking the city in order to loot and plunder its valuables.</p>
<a name="130"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=30><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;All the men of your covenant&#8221;; KJV, ASV &#8220;the men of thy confederacy.&#8221; In Hebrew &#8220;they will send you unto the border&#8221; and &#8220;all the men of your covenant&#8221; appear in two separate poetic lines (cf. NAB &#8220;To the border they drive you &#8211; all your allies&#8221;). Since the second is a noun clause functioning as the subject of the first clause, the two are rendered as a single sentence in the translation.</p>
<a name="131"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=31><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;send&#8221;; NASB &#8220;send you forth&#8221;; NAB &#8220;drive&#8221;; NIV &#8220;force.&#8221;</p>

The Hebrew word can be revocalized to read &#8220;those who eat bread with you,&#8221; i.e., &#8220;your friends.&#8221; Cf. KJV &#8220;they that eat thy bread&#8221;; NIV &#8220;those who eat your bread&#8221;; TEV &#8220;Those friends who ate with you.&#8221;</p>
<a name="135"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=35><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;set a trap&#8221; (so NIV, NRSV). The meaning of the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1494;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mazor</font>; here translated &#8220;ambush&#8221;) is uncertain; it occurs nowhere else in the Hebrew Bible. The word probably refers to something &#8220;spread out&#8221; for purposes of entrapment, such as a net. Other possibilities include &#8220;trap,&#8221; &#8220;fetter,&#8221; or &#8220;stumbling block.&#8221;</p>

For the sake of clarity this has been represented by the emphatic indicative in the translation. </p>
<a name="140"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=40><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;understanding&#8221;; NIV &#8220;men of understanding.&#8221; This undoubtedly refers to members of the royal court who offered political and military advice to the Edomite kings. In the ancient Near East, such men of wisdom were often associated with divination and occultic practices (cf. Isa 3:3, 47:10, 13). The Edomites were also renown in the ancient Near East as a center of traditional sagacity and wisdom; perhaps that is referred to here (cf. Jer 49:7).</p>
<a name="141"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=41><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and understanding from the mountain of Esau.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;I will remove the men of&#8230;&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew but is supplied in the translation for the sake of clarity and smoothness. Here &#8220;understanding&#8221; is a synecdoche of part for whole; the faculty of understanding is put for the wise men who possess it.</p>
<a name="142"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=42><b>sn</b> <i>Teman</i>, like Sela, was a prominent city of Edom. The name Teman is derived from the name of a grandson of Esau (cf. Gen 36:11). Here it is a synecdoche of part for whole, standing for all of Edom. </p>

KJV, NASB, NIV, NLT). It is preferable, however, to regard it as parallel to the reference to violence at the beginning of v. 11. Both the parallel linguistic structure of the two phrases and the metrical structure of the verse favor connecting this phrase with the beginning of v. 10 (cf. NRSV, TEV).</p>
<a name="148"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=48><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the violence of your brother.&#8221; The genitive construction is to be understood as an objective genitive.

<a name="157"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=57><b>tn</b> In vv. 12-14 there are eight prohibitions which summarize the nature of the Lord&#8217;s complaint against Edom. Each prohibition alludes to something that Edom did to Judah that should not have been done by one &#8220;brother&#8221; to another. It is because of these violations that the Lord has initiated judgment against Edom. In the Hebrew text these prohibitions are expressed by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>, &#8220;not&#8221;) plus the jussive form of the verb, which is common in negative commands of immediate urgency. Such constructions would normally have the sense of prohibiting something either not yet begun (i.e., &#8220;do not start to &#8230;&#8221;) or something already in process at the time of speaking (i.e., &#8220;stop&#8230;&#8221;). Here, however, it seems more likely that the prohibitions refer to a situation in past rather than future time (i.e., &#8220;you should not have &#8230;&#8221;). If so, the verbs are being used in a rhetorical fashion, as though the prophet were vividly projecting himself back into the events that he is describing and urging the Edomites not to do what in fact they have already done.</p>

<a name="178"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=78><b>tn</b> The identification of the referent of &#8220;you&#8221; in v. 16a is uncertain. There are three major options: (1) On the surface, it would appear to be Edom, which is addressed in v. 15b and throughout the prophecy. However, when Edom is addressed, second person singular forms are normally used in the Hebrew. In v. 16a the Hebrew verb &#8220;you drank&#8221; is a plural form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿtitem</font>), perhaps suggesting that Edom is no longer addressed, at least solely. Perhaps Edom and the nations, mentioned in v. 15a, are both addressed in v. 16a. However, since the nations are referred to in the third person in v. 16b, it seems unlikely that they are addressed here. (2) Another option is to take the final <font face="Scholar">mem</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1501;</font>) on the Hebrew verb form (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1462;&#1501;</font>) as an enclitic particle and revocalize the form as a singular verb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shatita</font>) addressed to Edom. In this case v. 16a would allude to the time when Edom celebrated Jerusalem&#8217;s defeat on Mount Zion, God&#8217;s &#8220;holy hill.&#8221; Verse 16b would then make the ironic point that just as Edom once drank in victory, so the nations (Edom included) would someday drink the cup of judgment. However, this interpretation is problematic for it necessitates taking the drinking metaphor in different ways (as signifying celebration and then judgment) within the same verse. (3) Another option is that the exiled people of Judah are addressed. Just as God&#8217;s people were forced to drink the intoxicating wine of divine judgment, so the nations, including those who humiliated Judah, would be forced to drink this same wine. However, the problem here is that God&#8217;s people are never addressed elsewhere in the prophecy, making this approach problematic as well.</p>
<a name="179"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">79</span><note=79><b>sn</b> This reference to drinking portrays the profane activities of those who had violated Jerusalem&#8217;s sanctity. The following reference to drinking on the part of the nations portrays God&#8217;s judgment upon them. They will drink, as it were, from the cup of divine retribution. </p>
<a name="180"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">80</span><note=80><b>sn</b> The judgment is compared here to intoxicating wine, which the nations are forced to keep drinking (v. 16). Just as an intoxicating beverage eventually causes the one drinking it to become disoriented and to stagger, so God&#8217;s judgment would cause the panic-stricken nations to stumble around in confusion. This extended metaphor is paralleled in Jer 49:12 which describes God&#8217;s imminent judgment on Edom, &#8220;If even those who did not deserve to drink from the cup of my wrath have to drink from it, do you think you will go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, but you also will certainly drink from the cup of my wrath.&#8221; There are numerous parallels between Obadiah and the oracle against Edom in Jer 49:1-22, so perhaps the latter should be used to help understand the enigmatic metaphor here in v. 16. </p>
