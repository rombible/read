<a name="178"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=78><b>tn</b> The identification of the referent of &#8220;you&#8221; in v. 16a is uncertain. There are three major options: (1) On the surface, it would appear to be Edom, which is addressed in v. 15b and throughout the prophecy. However, when Edom is addressed, second person singular forms are normally used in the Hebrew. In v. 16a the Hebrew verb &#8220;you drank&#8221; is a plural form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿtitem</font>), perhaps suggesting that Edom is no longer addressed, at least solely. Perhaps Edom and the nations, mentioned in v. 15a, are both addressed in v. 16a. However, since the nations are referred to in the third person in v. 16b, it seems unlikely that they are addressed here. (2) Another option is to take the final <font face="Scholar">mem</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1501;</font>) on the Hebrew verb form (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1462;&#1501;</font>) as an enclitic particle and revocalize the form as a singular verb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shatita</font>) addressed to Edom. In this case v. 16a would allude to the time when Edom celebrated Jerusalem&#8217;s defeat on Mount Zion, God&#8217;s &#8220;holy hill.&#8221; Verse 16b would then make the ironic point that just as Edom once drank in victory, so the nations (Edom included) would someday drink the cup of judgment. However, this interpretation is problematic for it necessitates taking the drinking metaphor in different ways (as signifying celebration and then judgment) within the same verse. (3) Another option is that the exiled people of Judah are addressed. Just as God&#8217;s people were forced to drink the intoxicating wine of divine judgment, so the nations, including those who humiliated Judah, would be forced to drink this same wine. However, the problem here is that God&#8217;s people are never addressed elsewhere in the prophecy, making this approach problematic as well.</p>
