<a name="125"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=25><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;O how you will be cut off.&#8221; This emotional interjection functions rhetorically as the prophet&#8217;s announcement of judgment on Edom. In Hebrew this statement actually appears between the first and second metaphors, that is, in the middle of this verse. As the point of the comparison, one would expect it to follow both of the two metaphors; however, Obadiah interrupts his own sentence to interject his emphatic exclamation that cannot wait until the end of the sentence. This emphatic sentence structure is eloquent in Hebrew but awkward in English. Since this emphatic assertion is the point of his comparison, it appears at the end of the sentence in this translation, where one normally expects to find the concluding point of a metaphorical comparison.</p>
