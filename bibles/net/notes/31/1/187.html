<a name="187"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">87</span><note=87><b>sn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yarash</font>, &#8220;to take possession of [something]&#8221;) which is repeated three times in vv. 19-20 for emphasis, often implies a violent means of acquisition, such as through military conquest. Obadiah here pictures a dramatic reversal: Judah&#8217;s enemies, who conquered them then looted all her valuable possessions, will soon be conquered by the Judeans who will in turn take possession of their valuables. The punishment will fit the crime. </p>
