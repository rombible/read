<a name="197"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">97</span><note=97><b>sn</b> The exact location of <i>Sepharad</i> is uncertain. Suggestions include a location in Spain, or perhaps Sparta in Greece, or perhaps Sardis in Asia Minor. For inscriptional evidence that bears on this question see E. Lipinski, &#8220;Obadiah 20,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 23 (1973): 368-70. The reason for mentioning this location in v. 20 seems to be that even though it was far removed from Jerusalem, the Lord will nonetheless enable the Jewish exiles there to return and participate in the restoration of Israel that Obadiah describes.</p>
