<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2><b>sn</b> The name <i>Obadiah</i> in Hebrew means &#8220;servant of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.&#8221; A dozen or so individuals in the OT have this name, none of whom may be safely identified with the author of this book. In reality we know very little about this prophet with regard to his exact identity or historical circumstances.</p>
