<a name="170"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=70><b>tn</b> The meaning of the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pereq</font>; here translated &#8220;fork in the road&#8221;) is uncertain. The word is found in the Hebrew Bible only here and in Nah 3:1, where it means &#8220;plunder.&#8221; In the present context it seems to refer to a strategic intersection or fork in a road where bands of Edomites apprehended Israelites who were fleeing from the attack on Jerusalem. Cf. NAB, NIV, NLT &#8220;crossroads&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;crossings.&#8221;</p>
