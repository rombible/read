<a name="174"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=74><b>sn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yom</font>, &#8220;day&#8221;) is repeated ten times in vv. 11-14 referring to the time period when Judah/Jerusalem suffered calamity which Edom exploited for its own sinful gain. In each of those cases <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> was qualified by a following genitive to describe Judah&#8217;s plight, e.g., &#8220;in the day of your brother&#8217;s calamity&#8221; (v. 12). Here it appears again but now followed by the divine name to describe the time of God&#8217;s judgment against Edom for its crimes against humanity: &#8220;the day of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.&#8221; In the present translation, the expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿyom</font>; literally, &#8220;In the day of&#8221;) was rendered &#8220;When&#8230;&#8221; in vv. 11-14. However, here it is translated more literally because the expression &#8220;the day of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221; is a well-known technical expression for a time of divine intervention in judgment. While this expression sometimes refers to the final eschatological day of God&#8217;s judgment, it may also refer occasionally to historical acts of judgment.</p>
