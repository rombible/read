<a name="157"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=57><b>tn</b> In vv. 12-14 there are eight prohibitions which summarize the nature of the Lord&#8217;s complaint against Edom. Each prohibition alludes to something that Edom did to Judah that should not have been done by one &#8220;brother&#8221; to another. It is because of these violations that the Lord has initiated judgment against Edom. In the Hebrew text these prohibitions are expressed by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>, &#8220;not&#8221;) plus the jussive form of the verb, which is common in negative commands of immediate urgency. Such constructions would normally have the sense of prohibiting something either not yet begun (i.e., &#8220;do not start to &#8230;&#8221;) or something already in process at the time of speaking (i.e., &#8220;stop&#8230;&#8221;). Here, however, it seems more likely that the prohibitions refer to a situation in past rather than future time (i.e., &#8220;you should not have &#8230;&#8221;). If so, the verbs are being used in a rhetorical fashion, as though the prophet were vividly projecting himself back into the events that he is describing and urging the Edomites not to do what in fact they have already done.</p>
