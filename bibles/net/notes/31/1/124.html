The implied answer to these rhetorical questions is &#8220;yes.&#8221; The fact that something would have remained after the imagined acts of theft or harvest stands in stark contrast to the totality of Edom&#8217;s destruction as predicted by Obadiah. Edom will be so decimated as a result of God&#8217;s judgment that nothing at all will be left</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> According to the Mosaic law, harvesters were required to leave some grain behind in the fields for the poor (Lev 19:9; 23:22; see also Ruth 2); there was a similar practice with grapes and olives (Lev 19:10; Deut 24:21). Regarding gleanings left behind from grapes, see Judg 8:2; Jer 6:9; 49:9; Mic 7:1.</p>
