<a name="147"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=47><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;because of the slaughter and because of the violence.&#8221; These two expressions form a hendiadys meaning &#8220;because of the violent slaughter.&#8221; Traditional understanding connects the first phrase &#8220;because of the slaughter&#8221; with the end of v. 9 (cf. KJV, NASB, NIV, NLT). It is preferable, however, to regard it as parallel to the reference to violence at the beginning of v. 11. Both the parallel linguistic structure of the two phrases and the metrical structure of the verse favor connecting this phrase with the beginning of v. 10 (cf. NRSV, TEV).</p>
