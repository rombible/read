<a name="116"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=16><b>tn</b> The Hebrew imperfect verb used here is best understood in a modal sense (&#8220;Who <i>can</i> bring me down?&#8221;) rather than in the sense of a simple future (&#8220;Who <i>will</i> bring me down?&#8221;). So also in v. 4 (&#8220;I <i>can</i> bring you down&#8221;). The question is not so much whether this will happen at some time in the future, but whether it even lies in the realm of possible events. In their hubris the Edomites were boasting that no one had the capability of breaching their impregnable defenses. However, their pride caused them to fail to consider the vast capabilities of Yahweh as warrior.</p>
