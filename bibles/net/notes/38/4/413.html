<A NAME="413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=78><b>tn</b> The usual word for &#8220;anointed (one),&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mashiakh</font>), is not used here but rather <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿne-hayyitshar</font>), literally, &#8220;sons of fresh oil.&#8221; This is to maintain consistency with the imagery of olive trees. In the immediate context these two olive trees should be identified with Joshua and Zerubbabel, the priest and the governor. Only the high priest and king were anointed for office in the OT and these two were respectively the descendants of Aaron and David.</p>
