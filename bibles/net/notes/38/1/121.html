<a name="121"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=21><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the nations that are at ease&#8221; (so ASV, NRSV). The Hebrew word in question is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anan</font>) which has the idea of a careless, even arrogant attitude (see BDB 983 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1503;</font>); cf. NAB &#8220;the complacent nations.&#8221; Here it suggests that the nations take for granted that God will never punish them just because he hasn't already done so. Thus they presume on the grace and patience of the Lord. The translation attempts to bring out this nuance rather than the more neutral renderings of TEV &#8220;nations that enjoy quiet and peace&#8221; or NLT &#8220;enjoy peace and security.&#8221;</p>
