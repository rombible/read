<a name="127"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=27><b>sn</b> An animal&#8217;s horn is a common OT metaphor for military power (Pss 18:2; 75:10; Jer 48:25; Mic 4:13). The fact that there are four <i>horns</i> here (as well as <i>four blacksmiths</i>, v. 20) shows a correspondence to the four horses of v. 8 which go to four parts of the world, i.e., the whole world.</p>
