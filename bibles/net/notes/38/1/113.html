NIV, NCV, NLT &#8220;brown&#8221;). English translations such as &#8220;speckled&#8221; (KJV) or &#8220;dappled&#8221; (TEV) are based on the reading of the LXX (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#968;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#943;</font>) that attempts to bring the color of this horse into conformity with those described in Zech 6:2-3. However, since these are two different and unrelated visions, this is a methodological fallacy.</p>
