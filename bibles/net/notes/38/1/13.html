A probable explanation is that Zechariah&#8217;s actual father <i>Berechiah</i> had died and the prophet was raised by his grandfather Iddo. The &#8220;Zechariah son of Barachiah&#8221; of whom Jesus spoke (Matt 23:35; Luke 11:51) was probably the martyred prophet by that name who may have been a grandson of the priest Jehoiada (2 Chr 24:20-22).</p>
