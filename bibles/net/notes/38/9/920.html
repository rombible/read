<A NAME="920"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=142><b>sn</b> The whole setting is eschatological as the intensely figurative language shows. The message is that the <sc>Lord will assume his triumphant reign over all the earth and will use his own redeemed and renewed people Israel to accomplish that work. The imagery of v. 15 is the eating and drinking of the flesh and blood of God&#8217;s enemies, that is, Israel&#8217;s complete mastery of them. Like those who drink too much wine, the <sc>Lord&#8217;s warriors will be satiated with the blood of their foes and will exult as though drunk.</p>
