<A NAME="914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=136><b>sn</b> The NT understands this verse to be a prophecy of the triumphal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, and properly so (cf. Matt 21:5; John 12:15), but reference to the universal rule of the king in v. 10 reveals that this is a &#8220;split prophecy,&#8221; that is, it has a two-stage fulfillment. Verse 9 was fulfilled in Jesus&#8217; earthly ministry but v. 10 awaits a millennial consummation (cf. Rev 19:11-16).</p>
