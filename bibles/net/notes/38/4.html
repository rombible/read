<BODY ><p>
<A NAME="41"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=66><b>tn</b> See the note on the expression &#8220;angelic messenger&#8221; in 1:9.</p>
<A NAME="42"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=67><b>tc</b> The present translation (along with most other English versions) follows the reading of the <i>Qere</i> and many ancient versions, &#8220;I said,&#8221; as opposed to the MT <i>Kethib</i> &#8220;he said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="43"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=68><b>sn</b> The vision apparently describes two olive trees providing olive oil by pipes to a large basin atop the menorah. From this basin two pipes extend to each of the seven lamps of the menorah, for a total of fourteen pipes in all. See vv. 11-12.</p>
<A NAME="44"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=69><b>sn</b> Here <i>these</i> must refer to the lamps, since the identification of the olive trees is left to vv. 11-14.</p>
<A NAME="45"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=70><b>sn</b> It is premature to understand the <i>Spirit</i> here as the Holy Spirit (the third Person of the Trinity), though the OT prepares the way for that NT revelation (cf. Gen 1:2; Exod 23:3; 31:3; Num 11:17-29; Judg 3:10; 6:34; 2 Kgs 2:9, 15, 16; Ezek 2:2; 3:12; 11:1, 5).</p>
<A NAME="46"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=71><b>sn</b> In context, the <i>great mountain</i> here must be viewed as a metaphor for the enormous task of rebuilding the temple and establishing the messianic kingdom (cf. TEV &#8220;Obstacles as great as mountains&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="47"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=72><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;temple&#8221; has been supplied in the translation to clarify the referent (cf. NLT &#8220;final stone of the Temple&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="48"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=73><b>sn</b> <i>Grace</i> is a fitting response to the idea that it was &#8220;not by strength and not by power&#8221; but by God&#8217;s gracious Spirit that the work could be done (cf. v. 6).</p>
<A NAME="49"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=74><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;house&#8221; (so NAB, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=75><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;these seven.&#8221; Eyes are clearly intended in the ellipsis as v. 10b shows. As in 3:9 the idea is God&#8217;s omniscience. He who knows the end from the beginning rejoices at the completion of his purposes.</p>
<A NAME="411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=76><b>tn</b> This term is traditionally translated &#8220;plumb line&#8221; (so NASB, NIV, NLT; cf. KJV, NRSV &#8220;plummet&#8221;), but it is more likely that the Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿdil</font>) is to be derived not from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">badal</font>), &#8220;to divide,&#8221; but from a root meaning &#8220;tin.&#8221; This finds support in the ancient Near Eastern custom of placing inscriptions on tin plates in dedicatory foundation deposits.</p>
<A NAME="412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=77><b>tn</b> The usual meaning of the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1500;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿbolet</font>) is &#8220;ears&#8221; (as in ears of grain). Here it probably refers to the produce of the olive trees, i.e., olives. Many English versions render the term as &#8220;branches,&#8221; but cf. NAB &#8220;tufts.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=78><b>tn</b> The usual word for &#8220;anointed (one),&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mashiakh</font>), is not used here but rather <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿne-hayyitshar</font>), literally, &#8220;sons of fresh oil.&#8221; This is to maintain consistency with the imagery of olive trees. In the immediate context these two olive trees should be identified with Joshua and Zerubbabel, the priest and the governor. Only the high priest and king were anointed for office in the OT and these two were respectively the descendants of Aaron and David.</p>
