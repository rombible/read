<BODY ><p>
<A NAME="131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=196><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;house&#8221; (so NIV, NRSV), referring to dynastic descendants.</p>
<A NAME="132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=197><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=198><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;for sin and for impurity.&#8221; The purpose implied here has been stated explicitly in the translation for clarity.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This reference to the <i>fountain opened up&#8230;to cleanse them from sin and impurity</i> is anticipatory of the cleansing from sin that lies at the heart of the NT gospel message (Rom 10:9-10; Titus 3:5). &#8220;In that day&#8221; throughout the passage (vv. 1, 2, 4) locates this cleansing in the eschatological (church) age (John 19:37).</p>
<A NAME="134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=199><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;cut off&#8221; (so NRSV); NAB &#8220;destroy&#8221;; NIV &#8220;banish.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="135"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=200><b>sn</b> Death (in this case being <i>run&#8230;through with a sword</i>) was the penalty required in the OT for prophesying falsely (Deut 13:6-11; 18:20-22).</p>
<A NAME="136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=201><b>tn</b> The &#8220;hairy garment of a prophet&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514; &#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">adderet she</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ar</font>) was the rough clothing of Elijah (1 Kgs 19:13), Elisha (1 Kgs 19:19; 2 Kgs 2:14), and even John the Baptist (Matt 3:4). Yet, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514;</font> alone suggests something of beauty and honor (Josh 7:21). The prophet&#8217;s attire may have been simple the image it conveyed was one of great dignity.</p>
<A NAME="137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=202><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;the people&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text, but are supplied in the translation from context (cf. NCV, TEV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=203><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;for the land has been my possession since my youth&#8221; (so NRSV; similar NAB).</p>
<A NAME="139"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=204><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;wounds between your hands.&#8221; Cf. NIV &#8220;wounds on your body&#8221;; KJV makes this more specific: &#8220;wounds in thine hands.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>These wounds on your chest</i>. Pagan prophets were often self-lacerated (Lev 19:28; Deut 14:1; 1 Kgs 18:28) for reasons not entirely clear, so this false prophet betrays himself as such by these graphic and ineradicable marks.</p>
<A NAME="1310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=205><b>sn</b> Despite the NT use of this text to speak of the scattering of the disciples following Jesus&#8217; crucifixion (Matt 26:31; Mark 14:27), the immediate context of Zechariah suggests that unfaithful shepherds (kings) will be punished by the <sc>Lord precisely so their flocks (disobedient Israel) can be scattered (cf. Zech 11:6, 8, 9, 16). It is likely that Jesus drew on this passage merely to make the point that whenever shepherds are incapacitated, sheep will scatter. Thus he was not identifying himself with the shepherd in this text (the shepherd in the Zechariah text is a character who is portrayed negatively).</p>
<A NAME="1311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=206><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;of the people&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarity (cf. NCV, TEV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="1312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=207><b>sn</b> The fractions mentioned here call to mind the affliction of God&#8217;s people described by Ezekiel, though Ezekiel referred to his own times whereas Zechariah is looking forward to a future eschatological age. Ezekiel spoke of cutting his hair at God&#8217;s command (Ezek 5:1-4) and then of burning a third of it, striking a third with a sword, and scattering the rest. From this last third a few hairs would survive to become the nucleus of a new Israel. It is this &#8220;third&#8221; Zechariah speaks of (v. 9), the remnant who will be purified and reclaimed as God&#8217;s covenant people.</p>
<A NAME="1313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=208><b>sn</b> The expression <i>I will say &#8216;It is my people,&#8217; and they will say &#8216;the <sc>Lord is my God&#8217;</i> is reminiscent of the restoration of Israel predicted by Hosea, who said that those who had been rejected as God&#8217;s people would be reclaimed and once more become his sons and daughters (Hos 2:23).</p>
