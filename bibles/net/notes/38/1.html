<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1><b>sn</b> <i>Darius</i> is Darius Hystaspes, king of Persia from 522-486 <span class="smallcaps">b.c</span>.</p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2><b>sn</b> The <i>eighth month of Darius&#8217; second year</i> was late October &#8211; late November, 520 <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span>, by the modern (Julian) calendar. This is two months later than the date of Haggai&#8217;s first message to the same community (cf. Hag 1:1).</p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3><b>sn</b> Both Ezra (5:1; 6:14) and Nehemiah (12:16) speak of <i>Zechariah</i> as a son of <i>Iddo</i> only. A probable explanation is that Zechariah&#8217;s actual father <i>Berechiah</i> had died and the prophet was raised by his grandfather Iddo. The &#8220;Zechariah son of Barachiah&#8221; of whom Jesus spoke (Matt 23:35; Luke 11:51) was probably the martyred prophet by that name who may have been a grandson of the priest Jehoiada (2 Chr 24:20-22).</p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fathers&#8221; (so KJV, NAB); NIV &#8220;forefathers&#8221; (also in vv. 4, 5).</p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to them&#8221;; the referent (the people) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=6><b>sn</b> The epithet <i><span class="smallcaps">Lord who rules over all</span></i> occurs frequently as a divine title throughout Zechariah (53 times total). This name (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492; &#1510;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yÿhvah tsÿva</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ot</font>), traditionally translated &#8220;<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of hosts&#8221; (so KJV, NAB, NASB; cf. NIV, NLT &#8220;Lord Almighty&#8221;; NCV, CEV &#8220;Lord All-Powerful&#8221;), emphasizes the majestic sovereignty of the Lord, an especially important concept in the postexilic world of great human empires and rulers. For a thorough study of the divine title, see T. N. D. Mettinger, <i>In Search of God</i>, 123-57.</p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=7><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shuv</font>) is common in covenant contexts. To turn from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is to break the covenant and to turn to him (i.e., to repent) is to renew the covenant relationship (cf. 2 Kgs 17:13).</p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=8><b>tc</b> <i>BHS</i> suggests <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1456;&#1499;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">etkhem</font>, &#8220;you&#8221;) for the MT <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1489;&#1465;&#1514;&#1461;&#1497;&#1499;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avotekhem</font>, &#8220;your fathers&#8221;) to harmonize with v. 4. In v. 4 the ancestors would not turn but in v. 6 they appear to have done so. The subject in v. 6, however, is to be construed as Zechariah&#8217;s own listeners.</p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=9><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they turned&#8221; (so ASV). Many English versions have &#8220;they repented&#8221; here; cf. CEV &#8220;they turned back to me.&#8221;</p>
<a name="110"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=10><b>sn</b> The <i>twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month&#8230;in Darius&#8217; second year</i> was February 15, 519 <span class="smallcaps">b.c</span>.</p>
<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;riding,&#8221; but since this verb in English is usually associated with horses in motion rather than standing still, the translation uses &#8220;seated.&#8221; Cf. NAB &#8220;the driver of a red horse.&#8221;</p>
<a name="112"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=12><b>tc</b> The LXX presupposes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1462;&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">heharim</font>, &#8220;mountains&#8221;) rather than the MT <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1491;&#1463;&#1505;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hahadassim</font>, &#8220;myrtles&#8221;), probably because of reference to the ravine. The MT reading is preferred and is followed by most English versions.</p>
<a name="113"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=13><b>sn</b> The Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1467;&#1511;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sÿruqqim</font>) means &#8220;red&#8221; (cf. NIV, NCV, NLT &#8220;brown&#8221;). English translations such as &#8220;speckled&#8221; (KJV) or &#8220;dappled&#8221; (TEV) are based on the reading of the LXX (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#968;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#943;</font>) that attempts to bring the color of this horse into conformity with those described in Zech 6:2-3. However, since these are two different and unrelated visions, this is a methodological fallacy.</p>
<a name="114"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=14><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;messenger&#8221; or &#8220;angel&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1498;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mal</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akh</font>). This being appears to serve as an interpreter to the prophet (cf. vv. 13, 14).</p>
<a name="115"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=15><b>sn</b> The stem used here (Hitpael) with the verb &#8220;walk&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">halakh</font>) suggests the exercise of dominion (cf. Gen 13:17; Job 1:7; 2:2-3; Ezek 28:14; Zech 6:7). The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is here about to claim sovereignty over the nations. Cf. NAB, NASB, NRSV, NLT &#8220;to patrol&#8221;; TEV &#8220;to go and inspect.&#8221;</p>
<a name="116"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=16><b>sn</b> The <i>angel of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span></i> is a special being who throughout the OT represents God himself and on occasion almost approaches divine hypostatization or incarnation (cf. Gen 18:2, 13, 17, 22; Exod 23:20-21; Josh 5:13-15; Judg 6:11-24; 13:2-20).</p>
<a name="117"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=17><b>sn</b> Note that here the <i>angel of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span></i> is clearly distinct from the <i><span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> who rules over all </i>himself.</p>
<a name="118"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=18><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<a name="119"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=19><b>sn</b> The <i>seventy years</i> refers to the predicted period of Babylonian exile, a period with flexible beginning and ending points depending on the particular circumstances in view (cf. Jer 25:1; 28:1; 29:10; Dan 9:2). Here the end of the seventy years appears to be marked by the completion of the temple in 516 <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span>, exactly seventy years after its destruction in 586.</p>
<a name="120"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=20><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;jealous for&#8221; (so KJV, ASV); NIV, NRSV &#8220;very jealous for&#8221;; CEV &#8220;very protective of.&#8221; The meaning is that Jerusalem/Zion is the special object of God&#8217;s grace and purposes. This results in his unusual protection of his people, a protection not accorded others with whom he does not have such a close relationship.</p>
<a name="121"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=21><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the nations that are at ease&#8221; (so ASV, NRSV). The Hebrew word in question is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anan</font>) which has the idea of a careless, even arrogant attitude (see BDB 983 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1503;</font>); cf. NAB &#8220;the complacent nations.&#8221; Here it suggests that the nations take for granted that God will never punish them just because he hasn't already done so. Thus they presume on the grace and patience of the Lord. The translation attempts to bring out this nuance rather than the more neutral renderings of TEV &#8220;nations that enjoy quiet and peace&#8221; or NLT &#8220;enjoy peace and security.&#8221;</p>
<a name="122"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=22><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I have turned.&#8221; This suggests that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has responded to the &#8220;turning&#8221; (i.e., repentance) of the people (v. 6) and now, with great love and forgiveness, allows construction of the temple to proceed.</p>
<a name="123"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=23><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<a name="124"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=24><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;house.&#8221;</p>
<a name="125"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=25><b>sn</b> This marks the beginning of ch. 2 in the Hebrew text. Beginning with <b>1:18</b>, the verse numbers through <b>2:13</b> in the English Bible differ from the verse numbers in the Hebrew text (<i>BHS</i>), with <b>1:18</b> ET = <b>2:1</b> HT, <b>1:19</b> ET = <b>2:2</b> HT, <b>1:20</b> ET = <b>2:3</b> HT, <b>1:21</b> ET = <b>2:4</b> HT, <b>2:1</b> ET = <b>2:5</b> HT, etc., through <b>2:13</b> ET = <b>2:17</b> HT. From <b>3:1</b> the verse numbers in the English Bible and the Hebrew Bible are again the same.</p>
<a name="126"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=26><b>tn</b> See the note on the expression &#8220;angelic messenger&#8221; in v. 9.</p>
<a name="127"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=27><b>sn</b> An animal&#8217;s horn is a common OT metaphor for military power (Pss 18:2; 75:10; Jer 48:25; Mic 4:13). The fact that there are four <i>horns</i> here (as well as <i>four blacksmiths</i>, v. 20) shows a correspondence to the four horses of v. 8 which go to four parts of the world, i.e., the whole world.</p>
<a name="128"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=28><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<a name="129"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=29><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;craftsmen&#8221; (so NASB, NIV; KJV &#8220;carpenters&#8221;), a generic term which can mean &#8220;metalworker, smith, armorer&#8221; (<i>HALOT </i>358 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;</font>). &#8220;Blacksmiths&#8221; was chosen for the present translation because of its relative familiarity among contemporary English readers.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The horns are perhaps made of iron, the strongest of all metals known to the ancient Near Eastern world, since military activity is implied in the context. Only <i>blacksmiths</i> can cut the horns off. If the horns represent oppressive nations, the blacksmiths must represent deliverers whom the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> raises up, kings like Cyrus of Persia (cf. Isa 54:16).</p>
<a name="130"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=30><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;so that no man lifts up his head.&#8221;</p>
