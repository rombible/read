<A NAME="81"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=113><b>sn</b> <i><sc>Lord who rules over all</i>. There is a remarkable concentration of this name of God in this section of Zechariah. Of 53 occurrences of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492; &#1510;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿhvah tsÿva</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ot</font>) in the Hebrew text in the book, 18 are in this chapter. The reason is the sheer human impossibility of accomplishing what lies ahead &#8211; it must be done by the <sc>Lord who rules over all.</p>
<A NAME="82"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=114><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="83"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=115><b>sn</b> The references to longevity and to children living and playing in peace are eschatological in tone. Elsewhere the millennial kingdom is characterized in a similar manner (cf. Isa 65:20; Jer 31:12-13).</p>
<A NAME="84"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=116><b>sn</b> The affirmation <i>They will be my people, and I will be their God</i> speaks of covenant renewal, a restoration of the unbroken fellowship the <sc>Lord desired to have with his people but which their disloyalty had shattered. In the eschaton God and Israel will be in covenant union once again (cf. Jer 31:33).</p>
<A NAME="85"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=117><b>sn</b> These <i>prophets who were there at the founding of the house of the <sc>Lord who rules over all </i>included at least Haggai and Zechariah, and perhaps others. The <i>founding</i> referred to here is not the initial laying of the temple&#8217;s foundations in 536 <sc>b.c. (Ezra 3:8) but the resumption of work two years before the time of the present narrative (i.e., in 520 <sc>b.c.), as vv. 10-12 make clear.</p>
<A NAME="86"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=118><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the heavens&#8221; (so KJV, NAB, NIV). The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shamayim</font>) may be translated &#8220;heavens&#8221; or &#8220;skies&#8221; depending on the context.</p>
<A NAME="87"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=119><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zamam</font>) usually means &#8220;to plot to do evil,&#8221; but with a divine subject (as here), and in light of v. 15 where it means to plan good, the meaning here has to be the implementation of discipline (cf. NCV, CEV &#8220;punish&#8221;). God may bring hurt but its purpose is redemptive and/or pedagogical.</p>
<A NAME="88"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=120><b>sn</b> For a similar reference to <i>true and righteous judgment</i> see Mic 6:8.</p>
<A NAME="89"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=121><b>sn</b> The fasts of the <i>fifth</i> and <i>seventh</i> months, mentioned previously (7:5), are listed here along with the observances of the fourth and tenth months. The latter commemorated the siege of Jerusalem by the Babylonians on January 15, 588 <sc>b.c. (2 Kgs 25:1), and the former the breach of the city walls on or about July 18, 586 <sc>b.c. (Jer 39:2-5).</p>
<A NAME="810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=122><b>sn</b> This scene of universal and overwhelming attraction of the nations to Israel&#8217;s God finds initial fulfillment in the establishment of the church (Acts 2:5-11) but ultimate completion in the messianic age (Isa 45:14, 24; 60:14; Zech 14:16-21).</p>
