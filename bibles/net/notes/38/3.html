<A NAME="31"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=51><b>sn</b> <i>Joshua the high priest</i> mentioned here is the son of the priest Jehozadak, mentioned also in Hag 1:1 (cf. Ezra 2:2; 3:2, 8; 4:3; 5:2; 10:18; Neh 7:7; 12:1, 7, 10, 26). He also appears to have been the grandfather of the high priest contemporary with Nehemiah ca. 445 <sc>b.c. (Neh 12:10).</p>
<A NAME="32"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=52><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1496;&#1464;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hassatan</font>, &#8220;the satan&#8221;) suggests not so much a personal name (as in almost all English translations) but an epithet, namely, &#8220;the adversary.&#8221; This evil being is otherwise thus described in Job 1 and 2 and 1 Chr 21:1. In this last passage the article is dropped and &#8220;the satan&#8221; becomes &#8220;Satan,&#8221; a personal name.</p>
<A NAME="33"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=53><b>sn</b> The juxtaposition of <i>the messenger of the <sc>Lord</></i> in v. 1 and <i>the <sc>Lord</></i> in v. 2 shows that here, at least, they are one and the same. See Zech 1:11, 12 where they are distinguished from each other.</p>
<A NAME="34"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=54><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="35"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=55><b>sn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tso</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>) means &#8220;excrement.&#8221; This disgusting figure of speech suggests Joshua&#8217;s absolute disqualification for priestly service in the flesh, but v. 2 speaks of his having been rescued from that deplorable state by God&#8217;s grace. He is like a <i>burning stick</i> pulled out of the fire before it is consumed. This is a picture of cleansing, saving grace.</p>
<A NAME="36"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=56><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he&#8221;; the referent (the angel, cf. v. 1) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="37"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=57><b>tn</b> The occurrence of the infinitive absolute here for an expected imperfect 1st person common singular (or even imperative 2nd person masculine plural or preterite 3rd person masculine plural) is well-attested elsewhere. Most English translations render this as 1st person singular (&#8220;and I will clothe&#8221;), but cf. NAB &#8220;Take off&#8230;and clothe him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="38"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=58><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;walk,&#8221; a frequent biblical metaphor for lifestyle or conduct; TEV &#8220;If you [+ truly CEV] obey.&#8221; To &#8220;walk&#8221; in the ways of the <sc>Lord is to live life as he intends (cf. Deut 8:6; 10:12-22; 28:9).</p>
<A NAME="39"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=59><b>sn</b> The statement <i>you will be able to preside over my temple</i> (<i>Heb </i>&#8220;house,&#8221; a reference to the Jerusalem temple) is a hint of the increasingly important role the high priest played in the postexilic Jewish community, especially in the absence of a monarchy. It also suggests the messianic character of the eschatological priesthood in which the priest would have royal prerogatives.</p>
<A NAME="310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=60><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;these men.&#8221; The cleansing of Joshua and his elevation to enhanced leadership as a priest signify the coming of the messianic age.</p>
<A NAME="311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=61><b>sn</b> The collocation of <i>servant</i> and <i>branch</i> gives double significance to the messianic meaning of the passage (cf. Isa 41:8, 9; 42:1, 19; 43:10; 44:1, 2, 21; Ps 132:17; Jer 23:5; 33:15).</p>
<A NAME="312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=62><b>sn</b> The <i>stone</i> is also a metaphor for the Messiah, a foundation stone that, at first rejected (Ps 118:22-23; Isa 8:13-15), will become the chief cornerstone of the church (Eph 2:19-22).</p>
<A NAME="313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=63><b>tn</b> Some understand the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ayin</font>) here to refer to facets (cf. NAB, NRSV, NLT) or &#8220;faces&#8221; (NCV, CEV &#8220;seven sides&#8221;) of the stone rather than some representation of organs of sight.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The <i>seven eyes </i>are symbolic of divine omniscience and universal dominion (cf. Zech 1:10; 4:10; 2 Chr 16:9).</p>
<A NAME="314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=64><b>sn</b> Inscriptions were common on ancient Near Eastern cornerstones. This inscription speaks of the redemption achieved by the divine resident of the temple, the Messiah, who will in the day of the <sc>Lord bring salvation to all Israel (cf. Isa 66:7-9).</p>
<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=65><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;under the vine and under the fig tree,&#8221; with the Hebrew article used twice as a possessive pronoun (cf. NASB &#8220;his&#8221;). Some English translations render this as second person rather than third (NRSV &#8220;your vine&#8221;; cf. also NAB, NCV, TEV).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The imagery of <i>fellowship under his vine and under his fig tree </i>describes the peaceful dominion of the <sc>Lord in the coming messianic age (Mic 4:4; cf. 1 Kgs 4:25).</p>
