<A NAME="71"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=103><b>sn</b> The <i>fourth day of Kislev, the ninth month</i> would be December 7, 518 <sc>b.c., 22 months after the previous eight visions.</p>
<A NAME="72"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=104><b>map</b> For location see Map4-G4; Map5-C1; Map6-E3; Map7-D1; Map8-G3.</p>
<A NAME="73"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=105><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;house&#8221; (so NAB, NIV, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="74"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=106><b>sn</b> This lamentation marked the occasion of the destruction of Solomon&#8217;s temple on August 14, 586 <sc>b.c., almost exactly 70 years earlier (cf. 2 Kgs 25:8).</p>
<A NAME="75"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=107><b>tn</b> The <i>seventh</i> month apparently refers to the anniversary of the assassination of Gedaliah, governor of Judah (Jer 40:13-14; 41:1), in approximately 581 <sc>b.c.</p>
<A NAME="76"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=108><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="77"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=109><b>sn</b> The <i>Shephelah</i> is the geographical region between the Mediterranean coastal plain and the Judean hill country. The Hebrew term can be translated &#8220;lowlands&#8221; (cf. ASV), &#8220;foothills&#8221; (NAB, NASB, NLT), or &#8220;steppes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="78"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=110><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shamir</font>) means literally &#8220;hardness&#8221; and since it is said in Ezek 3:9 to be harder than flint, many scholars suggest that it refers to diamond. It is unlikely that diamond was known to ancient Israel, however, so probably a hard stone like emery or corundum is in view. The translation nevertheless uses &#8220;diamond&#8221; because in modern times it has become proverbial for its hardness. A number of English versions use &#8220;flint&#8221; here (e.g., NASB, NIV).</p>
<A NAME="79"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=111><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he.&#8221; Since the third person pronoun refers to the <sc>Lord, it has been translated as a first person pronoun (&#8220;I&#8221;) to accommodate English style, which typically does not exhibit switches between persons of pronouns in the same immediate context as Hebrew does.</p>
<A NAME="710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=112><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;desirable&#8221;; traditionally &#8220;pleasant&#8221; (so many English versions; cf. TEV &#8220;This good land&#8221;).</p>
