<A NAME="210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=42><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;gate&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bavah</font>) of the eye, that is, pupil. The rendering of this term by KJV as &#8220;apple&#8221; has created a well-known idiom in the English language, &#8220;the apple of his eye&#8221; (so ASV, NIV). The pupil is one of the most vulnerable and valuable parts of the body, so for Judah to be considered the &#8220;pupil&#8221; of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s eye is to raise her value to an incalculable price (cf. NLT &#8220;my most precious possession&#8221;).</p>
