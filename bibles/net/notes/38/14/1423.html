<A NAME="1423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=231><b>tn</b> The term translated &#8220;gathered up&#8221; could also be rendered &#8220;collected&#8221; (so NIV, NCV, NRSV, although this might suggest a form of taxation) or &#8220;confiscated&#8221; (which might imply seizure of property against someone&#8217;s will). The imagery in the context, however, suggests the aftermath of a great battle, where the spoils are being picked up by the victors (cf. NLT &#8220;captured&#8221;).</p>
