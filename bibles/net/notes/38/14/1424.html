<A NAME="1424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=232><b>sn</b> Having imposed his sovereignty over the earth following the Battle of Armageddon, the <sc>Lord will receive homage and tribute from <i>all who survive from all the nations</i>. The <i>Feast of Tabernacles</i> was especially associated with covenant institution and renewal so it will be appropriate for all people to acknowledge that they are vassals to the <sc>Lord at that time (cf. Deut 31:9-13; Neh 8:12-18; 9:1-38).</p>
