<A NAME="1219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=194><b>sn</b> By the time of Zechariah the line of descent from David had already been transferred from the Solomon branch to the Nathan branch (<i>the clan of the family of Nathan</i>). Nathan was a son of David (2 Sam 5:14) through whom Jesus eventually came (Luke 3:23-31). Matthew traces Jesus&#8217; ancestry back through Solomon (Matt 1:6-16) but apparently this is to tie Joseph into the Davidic (and thus messianic) line. The &#8220;official&#8221; descent of Jesus may be viewed as passing through Solomon whereas the &#8220;physical&#8221; descent came through Nathan.</p>
