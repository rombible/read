<A NAME="1220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=195><b>sn</b> The <i>Shimeites</i> were Levites (Exod 6:16-17; Num 3:17-18) who presumably were prominent in the postexilic era. Just as David and Nathan represented the political leadership of the community, so Levi and Shimei represented the religious leadership. All will lament the piercing of the Messiah.</p>
