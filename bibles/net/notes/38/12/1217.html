<A NAME="1217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=192><b>tn</b> &#8220;Hadad-Rimmon&#8221; is a compound of the names of two Canaanite deities, the gods of storm and thunder respectively. The grammar (a subjective genitive) allows, and the problem of comparing Israel&#8217;s grief at God&#8217;s &#8220;wounding&#8221; with pagan mourning seems to demand, that this be viewed as a place name, perhaps where Judah lamented the death of good king Josiah (cf. 2 Chr 35:25). However, some translations render this as &#8220;for&#8221; (NRSV, NCV, TEV, CEV), suggesting a person, while others translate as &#8220;of&#8221; (KJV, NAB, NASB, NIV, NLT) which is ambiguous.</p>
