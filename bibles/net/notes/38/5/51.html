<A NAME="51"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=79><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;twenty cubits&#8230;ten cubits&#8221; (so NAB, NRSV). These dimensions (&#8220;thirty feet long and fifteen feet wide&#8221;) can hardly be referring to the scroll when unrolled since that would be all out of proportion to the normal ratio, in which the scroll would be 10 to 15 times as long as it was wide. More likely, the scroll is 15 feet thick when rolled, a hyperbole expressing the enormous amount and the profound significance of the information it contains.</p>
