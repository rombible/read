<A NAME="612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=99><b>sn</b> The <i>priest</i> here in the immediate context is Joshua but the fuller and more distant allusion is to the Messiah, a ruling priest. The notion of the ruler as a priest-king was already apparent in David and his successors (Pss 2:2, 6-8; 110:2, 4), and it finds mature expression in David&#8217;s greater Son, Jesus Christ, who will combine both offices in his kingship (Heb 5:1-10; 7:1-25).</p>
