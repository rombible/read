<A NAME="67"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=94><b>sn</b> The immediate referent of <i>peace about the northland</i> is to the peace brought by Persia&#8217;s conquest of Babylonia, a peace that allowed the restoration of the Jewish people (cf. 2 Chr 36:22-23; Isa 44:28; 45:1-2). However, there is also an eschatological dimension, referring to a time when there will be perfect and universal peace.</p>
