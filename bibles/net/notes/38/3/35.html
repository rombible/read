<A NAME="35"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=55><b>sn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tso</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>) means &#8220;excrement.&#8221; This disgusting figure of speech suggests Joshua&#8217;s absolute disqualification for priestly service in the flesh, but v. 2 speaks of his having been rescued from that deplorable state by God&#8217;s grace. He is like a <i>burning stick</i> pulled out of the fire before it is consumed. This is a picture of cleansing, saving grace.</p>
