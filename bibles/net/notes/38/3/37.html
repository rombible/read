<A NAME="37"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=57><b>tn</b> The occurrence of the infinitive absolute here for an expected imperfect 1st person common singular (or even imperative 2nd person masculine plural or preterite 3rd person masculine plural) is well-attested elsewhere. Most English translations render this as 1st person singular (&#8220;and I will clothe&#8221;), but cf. NAB &#8220;Take off&#8230;and clothe him.&#8221;</p>
