<A NAME="39"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=59><b>sn</b> The statement <i>you will be able to preside over my temple</i> (<i>Heb </i>&#8220;house,&#8221; a reference to the Jerusalem temple) is a hint of the increasingly important role the high priest played in the postexilic Jewish community, especially in the absence of a monarchy. It also suggests the messianic character of the eschatological priesthood in which the priest would have royal prerogatives.</p>
