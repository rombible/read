<A NAME="1312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=207><b>sn</b> The fractions mentioned here call to mind the affliction of God&#8217;s people described by Ezekiel, though Ezekiel referred to his own times whereas Zechariah is looking forward to a future eschatological age. Ezekiel spoke of cutting his hair at God&#8217;s command (Ezek 5:1-4) and then of burning a third of it, striking a third with a sword, and scattering the rest. From this last third a few hairs would survive to become the nucleus of a new Israel. It is this &#8220;third&#8221; Zechariah speaks of (v. 9), the remnant who will be purified and reclaimed as God&#8217;s covenant people.</p>
