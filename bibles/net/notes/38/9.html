<A NAME="91"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=123><b>sn</b> The <i>land of Hadrach</i> was a northern region stretching from Aleppo in the north to Damascus in the south (cf. NLT &#8220;Aram&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="92"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=124><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Damascus its resting place.&#8221; The 3rd person masculine singular suffix on &#8220;resting place&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1504;&#1467;&#1495;&#1464;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mÿnukhato</font>), however, precludes &#8220;land&#8221; or even &#8220;Hadrach,&#8221; both of which are feminine, from being the antecedent. Most likely &#8220;word&#8221; (masculine) is the antecedent, i.e., the &#8220;word of the <sc>Lord&#8221; is finding its resting place, that is, its focus in or on Damascus.</p>
<A NAME="93"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=125><b>tc</b> Though without manuscript and version support, many scholars suggest emendation here to clarify what, to them, is an unintelligible reading. Thus some propose <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1491;&#1461;&#1497; &#1488;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ade </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aram</font>, &#8220;cities of Aram&#8221;; cf. NAB, NRSV) for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1497;&#1503; &#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">en </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adam</font>, &#8220;eye of man&#8221;) or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adamah</font>, &#8220;ground&#8221;) for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adam</font>, &#8220;man&#8221;), &#8220;(surface of) the earth.&#8221; It seems best, however, to see &#8220;eye&#8221; as collective and to understand the passage as saying that the attention of the whole earth will be upon the <sc>Lord (cf. NIV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="94"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=126><b>map</b> For location see Map1-A2; Map2-G2; Map4-A1; JP3-F3; JP4-F3.</p>
<A NAME="95"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=127><b>map</b> For location see Map1-A1; JP3-F3; JP4-F3.</p>
<A NAME="96"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=128><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khayil</font>, &#8220;strength, wealth&#8221;) can, with certain suffixes, look exactly like <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khel</font>, &#8220;fortress, rampart&#8221;). The chiastic pattern here suggests that not Tyre&#8217;s riches but her defenses will be cast into the sea. Thus the present translation renders the term &#8220;fortifications&#8221; (so also NLT) rather than &#8220;wealth&#8221; (NASB, NRSV, TEV) or &#8220;power&#8221; (NAB, NIV).</p>
<A NAME="97"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=129><b>tn</b> The present translation presupposes a Hiphil perfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1489;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yavesh</font>, &#8220;be dry&#8221;; cf. NRSV &#8220;are withered&#8221;) rather than the usually accepted Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bosh</font>, &#8220;be ashamed&#8221;; cf. KJV, ASV), a sense that is less suitable with the removal of hope.</p>
<A NAME="98"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=130><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and I will take away their blood from their mouth and their abominations from between their teeth.&#8221; These expressions refer to some type of abominable religious practices, perhaps eating meat with the blood still in it (less likely NCV &#8220;drinking blood&#8221;) or eating unclean or forbidden foods.</p>
<A NAME="99"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=131><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they will be a remnant for our God&#8221;; cf. NIV &#8220;will belong to our God&#8221;; NLT &#8220;will worship our God.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="910"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=132><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;house&#8221; (so NAB, NIV, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=133><b>tn</b> Though a <i>hapax legomenon</i>, the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mitsavah</font>) of the MT (from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1489;</font>, <font face="Scholar">natsav</font>, &#8220;take a stand&#8221;) is preferable to the suggestion <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1461;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">matsevah</font>, &#8220;pillar&#8221;) or even <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mitsava</font>&#8217;, &#8220;from&#8221; or &#8220;against the army&#8221;). The context favors the idea of the <sc>Lord as a protector.</p>
<A NAME="912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=134><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsadiq</font>) ordinarily translated &#8220;righteous,&#8221; frequently occurs, as here, with the idea of conforming to a standard or meeting certain criteria. The Messianic king riding into Jerusalem is fully qualified to take the Davidic throne (cf. 1 Sam 23:3; Isa 9:5-6; 11:4; 16:5; Jer 22:1-5; 23:5-6).</p>
<A NAME="913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=135><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nosha</font>&#8217;) a Niphal participle of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yasha</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to save&#8221;) could mean &#8220;one delivered&#8221; or, if viewed as active, &#8220;one bringing salvation&#8221; (similar KJV, NIV, NKJV). It is preferable to take the normal passive use of the Niphal and understand that the king, having been delivered, is as a result &#8220;victorious&#8221; (so also NRSV, TEV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=136><b>sn</b> The NT understands this verse to be a prophecy of the triumphal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, and properly so (cf. Matt 21:5; John 12:15), but reference to the universal rule of the king in v. 10 reveals that this is a &#8220;split prophecy,&#8221; that is, it has a two-stage fulfillment. Verse 9 was fulfilled in Jesus&#8217; earthly ministry but v. 10 awaits a millennial consummation (cf. Rev 19:11-16).</p>
<A NAME="915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=137><b>tc</b> The MT first person pronoun (&#8220;I&#8221;), which seems to shift the subject too abruptly, becomes 3rd person masculine singular (&#8220;he&#8221;) in the LXX (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hikhrit</font>, presupposed for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hikhratti</font>). However, the <sc>Lord is the subject of v. 8, which speaks of his protection of Jerusalem, so it is not surprising that he is the subject in v. 10 as well.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;cut off&#8221; (so NASB, NRSV; also later in this verse); NAB &#8220;banish&#8221;; NIV, CEV &#8220;take away.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=138><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the river.&#8221; The Hebrew expression typically refers to the Euphrates, so the referent has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="917"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=139><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;my arrow&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text, but are supplied in the translation to clarify the imagery for the modern reader (cf. NRSV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=140><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;Zion&#8221; is not repeated here in the Hebrew text, but is supplied in the translation to indicate that the statement refers to Zion and not to Greece.</p>
<A NAME="919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=141><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they will drink and roar as with wine&#8221;; the LXX (followed here by NAB, NRSV) reads &#8220;they will drink blood like wine&#8221; (referring to a figurative &#8220;drinking&#8221; of the blood of their enemies).</p>
<A NAME="920"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=142><b>sn</b> The whole setting is eschatological as the intensely figurative language shows. The message is that the <sc>Lord will assume his triumphant reign over all the earth and will use his own redeemed and renewed people Israel to accomplish that work. The imagery of v. 15 is the eating and drinking of the flesh and blood of God&#8217;s enemies, that is, Israel&#8217;s complete mastery of them. Like those who drink too much wine, the <sc>Lord&#8217;s warriors will be satiated with the blood of their foes and will exult as though drunk.</p>
<A NAME="921"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=143><b>sn</b> This expostulation best fits the whole preceding description of God&#8217;s eschatological work on behalf of his people. His goodness is especially evident in his nurturing of the young men and women of his kingdom.</p>
