<A NAME="78"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=110><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shamir</font>) means literally &#8220;hardness&#8221; and since it is said in Ezek 3:9 to be harder than flint, many scholars suggest that it refers to diamond. It is unlikely that diamond was known to ancient Israel, however, so probably a hard stone like emery or corundum is in view. The translation nevertheless uses &#8220;diamond&#8221; because in modern times it has become proverbial for its hardness. A number of English versions use &#8220;flint&#8221; here (e.g., NASB, NIV).</p>
