<BODY ><p>
<A NAME="21"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=33><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="22"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=34><b>tn</b> See the note on the expression &#8220;angelic messenger&#8221; in 1:9.</p>
<A NAME="23"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=35><b>sn</b> That is, to Zechariah.</p>
<A NAME="24"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=36><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Jerusalem will dwell as open regions (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1494;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">pÿrazot</font>)&#8221;; cf. NAB &#8220;in open country&#8221;; CEV &#8220;won&#8217;t have any boundaries.&#8221; The population will be so large as to spill beyond the ancient and normal enclosures. The people need not fear, however, for the <sc>Lord will be an invisible but strong wall (v. 5).</p>
<A NAME="25"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=37><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;her&#8221;; the referent (Jerusalem) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="26"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=38><b>sn</b> These are the scattered Jews of eschatological times (as the expression <i>four winds of heaven</i> makes clear) and not those of Zechariah&#8217;s time who have, for the most part, already returned by 520 <sc>b.c. This theme continues and is reinforced in vv. 10-13.</p>
<A NAME="27"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=39><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;of the sky.&#8221; The same Hebrew term, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shamayim</font>), may be translated &#8220;heaven(s)&#8221; or &#8220;sky&#8221; depending on the context.</p>
<A NAME="28"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=40><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;live in [or &#8220;with&#8221; (cf. NASB), i.e., &#8220;among&#8221;] the daughter of Babylon&#8221; (so NIV; NAB &#8220;dwell in daughter Babylon&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="29"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=41><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;After glory has he sent me&#8221; (similar KJV, NASB). What is clearly in view is the role of Zechariah who, by faithful proclamation of the message, will glorify the <sc>Lord.</p>
<A NAME="210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=42><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;gate&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bavah</font>) of the eye, that is, pupil. The rendering of this term by KJV as &#8220;apple&#8221; has created a well-known idiom in the English language, &#8220;the apple of his eye&#8221; (so ASV, NIV). The pupil is one of the most vulnerable and valuable parts of the body, so for Judah to be considered the &#8220;pupil&#8221; of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s eye is to raise her value to an incalculable price (cf. NLT &#8220;my most precious possession&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=43><b>tc</b> A scribal emendation (<i>tiqqun sopherim</i>) has apparently altered an original &#8220;my eye&#8221; to &#8220;his eye&#8221; in order to allow the prophet to be the speaker throughout vv. 8-9. This alleviates the problem of the <sc>Lord saying, in effect, that he has sent himself on the mission to the nations.</p>
<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=44><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will wave my hand over them&#8221; (so NASB); NIV, NRSV &#8220;raise my hand against them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=45><b>sn</b> This individualizing of <i>Zion</i> as a <i>daughter</i> draws attention to the corporate nature of the covenant community and also to the tenderness with which the <sc>Lord regards his chosen people.</p>
<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=46><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;on that day.&#8221; The descriptive phrase &#8220;of salvation&#8221; has been supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=47><b>tc</b> The LXX and Syriac have the 3rd person masculine singular suffix in both places (&#8220;his people&#8221; and &#8220;he will settle&#8221;; cf. NAB, TEV) in order to avoid the <sc>Lord&#8217;s speaking of himself in the third person. Such resort is unnecessary, however, in light of the common shifting of person in Hebrew narrative (cf. 3:2).</p>
<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=48><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;will inherit&#8221; (so NIV, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=49><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all flesh&#8221;; NAB, NIV &#8220;all mankind.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=50><b>sn</b> The sense here is that God in heaven is about to undertake an occupation of his earthly realm (v. 12) by restoring his people to the promised land.</p>
