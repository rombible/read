<A NAME="105"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=148><b>sn</b> The metaphor of the <i>wall peg </i>(Heb. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1514;&#1461;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yated</font>), together<i> </i>with the others in this list, describes the remarkable change that will take place at the inauguration of God&#8217;s eschatological kingdom. Israel, formerly sheep-like, will be turned into a mighty warhorse. The peg refers to a wall hook (although frequently translated &#8220;tent peg,&#8221; but cf. ASV &#8220;nail&#8221;; <i>TWOT </i>1:419) from which tools and weapons were suspended, but figuratively also to the promise of God upon which all of Israel&#8217;s hopes were hung (cf. Isa 22:15-25; Ezra 9:8).</p>
