<A NAME="118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=167><b>sn</b> Zechariah is only dramatizing what God had done historically (see the note on the word &#8220;cedars&#8221; in 11:1). The &#8220;one month&#8221; probably means just any short period of time in which three kings ruled in succession. Likely candidates are Elah, Zimri, Tibni (1 Kgs 16:8-20); Zechariah, Shallum, Menahem (2 Kgs 15:8-16); or Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin, Zedekiah (2 Kgs 24:1&#8211;25:7).</p>
