<A NAME="1114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=173><b>sn</b> The grammar (e.g., the incipient participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">maqim</font>, &#8220;about to raise up,&#8221; v. 16) and overall sense of vv. 15-17 give the incident a future orientation. Zechariah once more is role-playing but this time he is a &#8220;foolish&#8221; shepherd, i.e., one who does not know God and who is opposed to him (cf. Prov 1:7; 15:5; 20:3; 27:22). The individual who best represents this eschatological enemy of God and his people is the Antichrist (cf. Matt 24:5, 24; 2 Thess 2:3-4; 1 John 2:18, 22; 4:3; 2 John 7).</p>
