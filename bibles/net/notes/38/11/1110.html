<A NAME="1110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=169><b>sn</b> If taken at face value, <i>thirty pieces</i> (shekels) <i>of silver</i> was worth about two and a half years&#8217; wages for a common laborer. The Code of Hammurabi prescribes a monthly wage for a laborer of one shekel. If this were the case in Israel, 30 shekels would be the wages for 2 1/2 years (R. de Vaux, <i>Ancient Israel</i>, pp. 76, 204-5). For other examples of &#8220;thirty shekels&#8221; as a conventional payment, see K. Luke, &#8220;The Thirty Pieces of Silver (Zech. 11:12f.), <i>Ind</i> <i>TS </i>19 (1982): 26-30. Luke, on the basis of Sumerian analogues, suggests that &#8220;thirty&#8221; came to be a term meaning anything of little or no value (p. 30). In this he follows Erica Reiner, &#8220;Thirty Pieces of Silver,&#8221; in <i>Essays in Memory of E</i>. <i>A</i>. <i>Speiser</i>, AOS 53, ed. William W. Hallo (New Haven, Conn.: American Oriental Society, 1968), 186-90. Though the 30 shekels elsewhere in the OT may well be taken literally, the context of Zech. 11:12 may indeed support Reiner and Luke in seeing it as a pittance here, not worth considering (cf. Exod 21:32; Lev 27:4; Matt 26:15).</p>
