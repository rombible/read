<A NAME="112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=161><b>sn</b> The expression <i>those who buy them</i> appears to be a reference to the foreign nations to whom Israel&#8217;s own kings &#8220;sold&#8221; their subjects. Far from being good shepherds, then, they were evil and profiteering. The whole section (vv. 4-14) refers to the past when the <sc>Lord, the Good Shepherd, had in vain tried to lead his people to salvation and life.</p>
