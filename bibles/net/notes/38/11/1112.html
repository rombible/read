<A NAME="1112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=171><b>tn</b> The Syriac presupposes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1510;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">otsar</font>, &#8220;treasury&#8221;) for the MT <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1510;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hayyotser</font>, &#8220;potter&#8221;) perhaps because of the lack of evidence for a potter&#8217;s shop in the area of the temple. The Syriac reading is followed by NAB, NRSV, TEV. Matthew seems to favor this when he speaks of Judas having thrown the thirty shekels for which he betrayed Jesus into the temple treasury (27:5-6). However, careful reading of the whole gospel pericope makes it clear that the money actually was used to purchase a &#8220;potter&#8217;s field,&#8221; hence Zechariah&#8217;s reference to a potter. The MT reading is followed by most other English versions.</p>
