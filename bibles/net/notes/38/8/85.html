<A NAME="85"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=117><b>sn</b> These <i>prophets who were there at the founding of the house of the <sc>Lord who rules over all </i>included at least Haggai and Zechariah, and perhaps others. The <i>founding</i> referred to here is not the initial laying of the temple&#8217;s foundations in 536 <sc>b.c. (Ezra 3:8) but the resumption of work two years before the time of the present narrative (i.e., in 520 <sc>b.c.), as vv. 10-12 make clear.</p>
