<A NAME="87"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=119><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zamam</font>) usually means &#8220;to plot to do evil,&#8221; but with a divine subject (as here), and in light of v. 15 where it means to plan good, the meaning here has to be the implementation of discipline (cf. NCV, CEV &#8220;punish&#8221;). God may bring hurt but its purpose is redemptive and/or pedagogical.</p>
