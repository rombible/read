<A NAME="51"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=79><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;twenty cubits&#8230;ten cubits&#8221; (so NAB, NRSV). These dimensions (&#8220;thirty feet long and fifteen feet wide&#8221;) can hardly be referring to the scroll when unrolled since that would be all out of proportion to the normal ratio, in which the scroll would be 10 to 15 times as long as it was wide. More likely, the scroll is 15 feet thick when rolled, a hyperbole expressing the enormous amount and the profound significance of the information it contains.</p>
<A NAME="52"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=80><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word translated &#8220;curse&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">alah</font>) alludes to the covenant sanctions that attend the violation of God&#8217;s covenant with Israel (cf. Deut 29:12, 14, 20-21).</p>
<A NAME="53"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=81><b>sn</b> Stealing and swearing falsely (mentioned later in this verse) are sins against mankind and God respectively and are thus violations of the two major parts of the Ten Commandments. These two stipulations (commandments 8 and 3) represent the whole law.</p>
<A NAME="54"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=82><b>tn</b> See the note on the expression &#8220;angelic messenger&#8221; in 1:9.</p>
<A NAME="55"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=83><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[This is] the ephah.&#8221; An ephah was a liquid or solid measure of about a bushel (five gallons or just under twenty liters). By metonymy it refers here to a measuring container (probably a basket) of that quantity.</p>
<A NAME="56"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=84><b>tc</b> The LXX and Syriac read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avonam</font>, &#8220;their iniquity,&#8221; so NRSV; NIV similar) for the MT <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1497;&#1504;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">enam</font>, &#8220;their eye&#8221;), a reading that is consistent with the identification of the woman in v. 8 as wickedness, but one that is unnecessary. In 4:10 the &#8220;eye&#8221; represented divine omniscience and power; here it represents the demonic counterfeit.</p>
<A NAME="57"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=85><b>sn</b> Here <i>two women</i> appear as the agents of the <sc>Lord because the whole scene is feminine in nature. The Hebrew word for &#8220;wickedness&#8221; in v. 8 (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font>) is grammatically feminine, so feminine imagery is appropriate throughout.</p>
<A NAME="58"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=86><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;house&#8221; (so NIV, NRSV, CEV).</p>
<A NAME="59"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=87><b>sn</b> The <i>land of Babylonia</i> (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;the land of Shinar&#8221;) is another name for Sumer and Akkad, where Babylon was located (Gen 10:10). Babylon throughout the Bible symbolizes the focus of anti-God sentiment and activity (Gen 11:4; 14:1; Isa 13&#8211;14; 47:1-3; Jer 50&#8211;51; Rev 14:8; 17:1, 5, 18; 18:21).</p>
