<A NAME="61"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=88><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;two mountains, and the mountains [were] mountains of bronze.&#8221; This has been simplified in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Bronze</i>, a hard, almost impenetrable metal, is an apt figure to speak of the obstacles standing in the way of the accomplishment of God&#8217;s purposes for the postexilic Jewish community (cf. 4:7). The cleft between the two from which the chariots emerge might be related to the eschatological triumph of the <sc>Lord who will return to the Mount of Olives and divide it into two mountains, one on the north and the other on the south (cf. Zech 14:1-8; Ezek 47:1-12).</p>
<A NAME="62"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=89><b>tc</b> For the MT reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1502;&#1467;&#1510;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amutsim</font>, &#8220;strong&#8221;) Aquila and Syriac presuppose <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1467;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adummim</font>, &#8220;red&#8221;), thus giving the red horse an assignment and eliminating the problem of a fifth, &#8220;spotted&#8221; horse. The fourth would be a mottled red horse according to this view. There is, however, no manuscript support for this interpretation.</p>
<A NAME="63"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=90><b>tn</b> See the note on the expression &#8220;angelic messenger&#8221; in 1:9.</p>
<A NAME="64"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=91><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term translated &#8220;spirit&#8221; here may also be translated &#8220;wind&#8221; or &#8220;breath&#8221; depending on the context (cf. ASV, NRSV, CEV &#8220;the four winds of heaven&#8221;; NAB similar).</p>
<A NAME="65"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=92><b>tn</b> The present translation takes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1502;&#1467;&#1510;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amutsim</font>, &#8220;strong&#8221;) to be a descriptive of all the horses &#8211; white, black, red, and spotted (cf. NAB, NIV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="66"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=93><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my spirit.&#8221; The subject appears to be the <sc>Lord who exclaims here that the horsemen have accomplished their task of bringing peace.</p>
<A NAME="67"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=94><b>sn</b> The immediate referent of <i>peace about the northland</i> is to the peace brought by Persia&#8217;s conquest of Babylonia, a peace that allowed the restoration of the Jewish people (cf. 2 Chr 36:22-23; Isa 44:28; 45:1-2). However, there is also an eschatological dimension, referring to a time when there will be perfect and universal peace.</p>
<A NAME="68"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=95><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;some people&#8221; are supplied in the translation. The Hebrew verb translated &#8220;choose&#8221; (alternatively &#8220;take&#8221; [NAB, NIV]; &#8220;collect&#8221; [NRSV, CEV]) has no direct object specified in the text. Some translations supply &#8220;silver and gold&#8221; (NIV, NRSV) or &#8220;an offering&#8221; (NASB).</p>
<A NAME="69"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=96><b>sn</b> Except for Joshua (v. 11) none of these individuals is otherwise mentioned and therefore they cannot be further identified.</p>
<A NAME="610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=97><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;crowns&#8221; (so KJV, ASV; also in v. 14). The Hebrew word for &#8220;crown&#8221; here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1496;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ateret</font>), a term never used in the OT for the priestly crown or mitre. Thus, the scene here describes the investing of the priest with royal authority.</p>
<A NAME="611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=98><b>tn</b> The epithet &#8220;Branch&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1462;&#1502;&#1463;&#1495;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tsemakh</font>) derives from the verb used here (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1495;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yitsmakh</font>, &#8220;will sprout up&#8221;) to describe the rise of the Messiah, already referred to in this manner in Zech 3:8 (cf. Isa 11:1; 53:2; Jer 33:15). In the immediate context this refers to Zerubbabel, but the ultimate referent is Jesus (cf. John 19:5).</p>
<A NAME="612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=99><b>sn</b> The <i>priest</i> here in the immediate context is Joshua but the fuller and more distant allusion is to the Messiah, a ruling priest. The notion of the ruler as a priest-king was already apparent in David and his successors (Pss 2:2, 6-8; 110:2, 4), and it finds mature expression in David&#8217;s greater Son, Jesus Christ, who will combine both offices in his kingship (Heb 5:1-10; 7:1-25).</p>
<A NAME="613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=100><b>tn</b> &#8220;Helem&#8221; is probably the same individual as &#8220;Heldai&#8221; in v. 10. Since the MT and the major ancient versions leave the apparent conflict unresolved it is probably best to view &#8220;Helem&#8221; as interchangeable with &#8220;Heldai&#8221; (cf. &#8220;Heled&#8221; in 1 Chr 11:30 with &#8220;Heleb&#8221; [2 Sam 23:29] and &#8220;Heldai&#8221; [1 Chr 27:15]). A number of modern English versions use &#8220;Heldai&#8221; here (e.g., NAB, NIV, NRSV, TEV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=101><b>tn</b> Since the &#8220;son of Zephaniah&#8221; in v. 10 is Josiah, it might be best here to understand &#8220;Hen&#8221; in its meaning &#8220;grace&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1461;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khen</font>); that is, &#8220;Hen&#8221; is a nickname for Josiah &#8211; &#8220;the gracious one.&#8221; A number of modern English translations use &#8220;Josiah&#8221; here (e.g., NCV, NRSV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=102><b>sn</b> <i>Those who are far away</i> is probably a reference to later groups of returning exiles under Ezra, Nehemiah, and others.</p>
