<A NAME="121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=176><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;who forms the spirit of man within him&#8221; (so NIV).</p>

<A NAME="123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=178><b>sn</b> The image of <i>a cup that brings dizziness</i> is that of drunkenness. The <sc>Lord will force the nations to drink of his judgment and in doing so they will become so intoxicated by his wrath that they will stumble and become irrational.</p>
<A NAME="124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=179><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;heavy stone&#8221; (so NRSV, TEV, NLT); KJV &#8220;burdensome stone&#8221;; NIV &#8220;an immovable rock.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=180><b>sn</b> In Israel&#8217;s and Judah&#8217;s past they had been uprooted by various conquerors such as the Assyrians and the Babylonians. In the eschaton, however, they will be so &#8220;heavy&#8221; with God&#8217;s glory and so rooted in his promises that no nation will be able to move them.</p>
<A NAME="126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=181><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;every horse.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=182><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;peoples&#8221; (so NAB, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=183><b>sn</b> <i>On</i> <i>that day</i> (referring to the day of the <sc>Lord) the Davidic monarchy will be restored and the <sc>Lord&#8217;s people will recognize once more the legitimacy and divine sanction of David&#8217;s dynasty. But there will also be a democratizing that will not give Jerusalem and its rulers undue priority over the people of the countryside (v. 7).</p>
<A NAME="129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=184><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a firepot&#8221; (so NASB, NIV); NRSV &#8220;a blazing pot&#8221;; NLT &#8220;a brazier.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=185><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the tents&#8221; (so NAB, NRSV); NIV &#8220;the dwellings.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=186><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;house,&#8221; referring here to the dynastic line. Cf. NLT &#8220;the royal line&#8221;; CEV &#8220;the kingdom.&#8221; The same expression is translated &#8220;dynasty&#8221; in the following verse.</p>
<A NAME="1212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=187><b>sn</b> The statement <i>the dynasty of David will be like God</i> is hyperbole to show the remarkable enhancements that will accompany the inauguration of the millennial age.</p>
<A NAME="1213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=188><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;peoples.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=189><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;dynasty&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;house.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=190><b>tc</b> Because of the difficulty of the concept of the mortal piercing of God, the subject of this clause, and the shift of pronoun from &#8220;me&#8221; to &#8220;him&#8221; in the next, many <sc>mss read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1461;&#1497; &#1488;&#1461;&#1514; &#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ale </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asher</font>, &#8220;to the one whom,&#8221; a reading followed by NAB, NRSV) rather than the MT&#8217;s <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1463;&#1497; &#1488;&#1461;&#1514; &#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ela </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asher</font>, &#8220;to me whom&#8221;). The reasons for such alternatives, however, are clear &#8211; they are motivated by scribes who found such statements theologically objectionable &#8211; and they should be rejected in favor of the more difficult reading (<i>lectio difficilior</i>) of the MT.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;on me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=191><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿkhor</font>, &#8220;firstborn&#8221;), translated usually in the LXX by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#972;&#964;&#959;&#954;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">prwtotokos</font>), has unmistakable messianic overtones as the use of the Greek term in the NT to describe Jesus makes clear (cf. Col 1:15, 18). Thus, the idea of God being pierced sets the stage for the fatal wounding of Jesus, the Messiah and the Son of God (cf. John 19:37; Rev 1:7). Note that some English translations supply &#8220;son&#8221; from the context (e.g., NIV, TEV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="1217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=192><b>tn</b> &#8220;Hadad-Rimmon&#8221; is a compound of the names of two Canaanite deities, the gods of storm and thunder respectively. The grammar (a subjective genitive) allows, and the problem of comparing Israel&#8217;s grief at God&#8217;s &#8220;wounding&#8221; with pagan mourning seems to demand, that this be viewed as a place name, perhaps where Judah lamented the death of good king Josiah (cf. 2 Chr 35:25). However, some translations render this as &#8220;for&#8221; (NRSV, NCV, TEV, CEV), suggesting a person, while others translate as &#8220;of&#8221; (KJV, NAB, NASB, NIV, NLT) which is ambiguous.</p>
<A NAME="1218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=193><b>map</b> For location see Map1-D4; Map2-C1; Map4-C2; Map5-F2; Map7-B1.</p>
<A NAME="1219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=194><b>sn</b> By the time of Zechariah the line of descent from David had already been transferred from the Solomon branch to the Nathan branch (<i>the clan of the family of Nathan</i>). Nathan was a son of David (2 Sam 5:14) through whom Jesus eventually came (Luke 3:23-31). Matthew traces Jesus&#8217; ancestry back through Solomon (Matt 1:6-16) but apparently this is to tie Joseph into the Davidic (and thus messianic) line. The &#8220;official&#8221; descent of Jesus may be viewed as passing through Solomon whereas the &#8220;physical&#8221; descent came through Nathan.</p>
<A NAME="1220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=195><b>sn</b> The <i>Shimeites</i> were Levites (Exod 6:16-17; Num 3:17-18) who presumably were prominent in the postexilic era. Just as David and Nathan represented the political leadership of the community, so Levi and Shimei represented the religious leadership. All will lament the piercing of the Messiah.</p>
