<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1><b>sn</b> In ancient Judaism Ezra and Nehemiah were regarded as a single book with dual authorship. According to the Talmud, &#8220;Ezra wrote his book&#8221; (<i>b. Bava Batra</i> 15a). The Gemara then asks and answers, &#8220;And who finished it? Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah.&#8221; Accordingly, the two are joined in the Leningrad Codex (ca. <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> 1008), the manuscript upon which modern printed editions of the Hebrew Bible (e.g., <i>BHK</i> and <i>BHS</i>) are based.</p>
