<A NAME="812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=213><b>tn</b> The exact meaning of the pual participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1508;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿforash</font>) in this verse is uncertain. The basic sense of the Hebrew word seems to be &#8220;to make distinct.&#8221; The word may also have the sense of &#8220;to divide in parts,&#8221; &#8220;to interpret,&#8221; or &#8220;to translate.&#8221; The context of Neh 8:8 does not decisively clarify how the participle is to be understood here. It probably refers to the role of the Levites as those who explained or interpreted the portions of biblical text that had been publicly read on this occasion. A different option, however, is suggested by the translation <i>distincte</i> (&#8220;distinctly&#8221;) of the Vulgate (cf. KJV, ASV). If the Hebrew word means &#8220;distinctly&#8221; here, it would imply that the readers paid particular attention to such things as word-grouping and pronunciation so as to be sure that the listeners had every opportunity to understand the message that was being read. Yet another view is found in the Talmud, which understands translation of the Hebrew text into Aramaic to be what is in view here. The following explanation of Neh 8:8 is found in <i>b. Megillah</i> 3a: &#8220;<i>&#8216;And they read in the book, in the law of God&#8217;</i>: this indicates the [Hebrew] text; <i>&#8216;with an interpretation&#8217;</i>: this indicates the <i>targum</i>; <i>&#8216;and they gave the sense&#8217;</i>: this indicates the verse stops; <i>&#8216;and caused them to understand the reading&#8217;</i>: this indicates the accentuation, or, according to another version, the Masoretic notes.&#8221; However, this ancient rabbinic view that the origins of the Targum are found in Neh 8:8 is debatable. It is not clear that the practice of paraphrasing the Hebrew biblical text into Aramaic in order to accommodate the needs of those Jews who were not at home in the Hebrew language developed this early. The translation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1508;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;</font> adopted above (i.e., &#8220;explaining it&#8221;) understands the word to have in mind an explanatory function (cf. NAB, NCV, TEV, NLT) rather than one of translation.</p>
