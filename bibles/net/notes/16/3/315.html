<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=64><b>tc</b> The reference to daughters, while not impossible, is odd in light of the cultural improbability that young women would participate in the strenuous labor of rebuilding city walls. All other such references in the Book of Nehemiah presuppose male laborers. Not surprisingly, some scholars suspect a textual problem. One medieval Hebrew <sc>MS and the Syriac Peshitta read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">uvanayv</font>, &#8220;and his sons&#8221;) rather than the MT reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">uvÿnotayv</font>, &#8220;and his daughters&#8221;). Some scholars emend the MT to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">uvonayv</font>, &#8220;and his builders&#8221;). On the other hand, the MT is clearly the more difficult reading, and so it is preferred.</p>
