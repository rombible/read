<A NAME="97"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=240><b>tc</b> The MT reads here only &#8220;from age to age,&#8221; without the preceding words &#8220;May you be blessed, O <sc>LORD our God&#8221; which are included in the present translation. But apparently something has dropped out of the text. This phrase occurs elsewhere in the OT as a description of the Lord (see Ps 41:13; 106:48), and it seems best to understand it here in that light. The LXX adds &#8220;And Ezra said&#8221; at the beginning of v. 6 as a transition: &#8220;And Ezra said, &#8216;You alone are the <sc>LORD.&#8221; Without this addition (which is not included by most modern English translations) the speakers of vv. 9:5b-10:1 continue to be the Levites of v. 5a.</p>
