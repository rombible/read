<A NAME="44"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=79><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text is difficult here. The present translation follows the MT, but the text may be corrupt. H. G. M. Williamson (<i>Ezra, Nehemiah</i> [WBC], 213-14) translates these words as &#8220;Will they commit their cause to God?&#8221; suggesting that MT <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lahem</font>, &#8220;to them&#8221;) should be emended to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1461;&#1488;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lelohim</font>, &#8220;to God&#8221;), a proposal also found in the apparatus of <i>BHS</i>. In his view later scribes altered the phrase out of theological motivations. J. Blenkinsopp&#8217;s translation is similar: &#8220;Are they going to leave it all to God?&#8221; (<i>Ezra&#8211;Nehemiah</i> [OTL], 242-44). However, a problem for this view is the absence of external evidence to support the proposed emendation. The sense of the MT reading may be the notion that the workers &#8211; if left to their own limited resources &#8211; could not possibly see such a demanding and expensive project through to completion. This interpretation understands the collocation <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">azav</font>, &#8220;to leave&#8221;) plus <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿ</font>, &#8220;to&#8221;) to mean &#8220;commit a matter to someone,&#8221; with the sense in this verse &#8220;Will they leave the building of the fortified walls to themselves?&#8221;</p>
