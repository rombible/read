<A NAME="81"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=202><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the sons of Israel.&#8221; So also in vv. 14, 17; 9:1.</p>
<A NAME="82"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=203><b>tn</b> The traditional understanding of the chapter and verse division here is probably incorrect. The final part of v. 73 is best understood as belonging with 8:1.</p>
<A NAME="83"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=204><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;like one man.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="84"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=205><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;said [to].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="85"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=206><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from the light till the noon of the day.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="86"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=207><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all who could hear with understanding.&#8221; The word &#8220;children&#8221; is understood to be implied here by a number of English versions (e.g., NAB, TEV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="87"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=208><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the ears of all the people were toward.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="88"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=209><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a tower of wood.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="89"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=210><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to the eyes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=211><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;it&#8221;; the referent (the book) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=212><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;and the Levites.&#8221; The conjunction (&#8220;and&#8221;) should be deleted, following the LXX, Aquila, and the Vulgate. That the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) of the MT is the <i>vav explicativum</i> (&#8220;<i>even</i> the Levites&#8221;) is unlikely here.</p>
<A NAME="812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=213><b>tn</b> The exact meaning of the pual participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1508;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿforash</font>) in this verse is uncertain. The basic sense of the Hebrew word seems to be &#8220;to make distinct.&#8221; The word may also have the sense of &#8220;to divide in parts,&#8221; &#8220;to interpret,&#8221; or &#8220;to translate.&#8221; The context of Neh 8:8 does not decisively clarify how the participle is to be understood here. It probably refers to the role of the Levites as those who explained or interpreted the portions of biblical text that had been publicly read on this occasion. A different option, however, is suggested by the translation <i>distincte</i> (&#8220;distinctly&#8221;) of the Vulgate (cf. KJV, ASV). If the Hebrew word means &#8220;distinctly&#8221; here, it would imply that the readers paid particular attention to such things as word-grouping and pronunciation so as to be sure that the listeners had every opportunity to understand the message that was being read. Yet another view is found in the Talmud, which understands translation of the Hebrew text into Aramaic to be what is in view here. The following explanation of Neh 8:8 is found in <i>b. Megillah</i> 3a: &#8220;<i>&#8216;And they read in the book, in the law of God&#8217;</i>: this indicates the [Hebrew] text; <i>&#8216;with an interpretation&#8217;</i>: this indicates the <i>targum</i>; <i>&#8216;and they gave the sense&#8217;</i>: this indicates the verse stops; <i>&#8216;and caused them to understand the reading&#8217;</i>: this indicates the accentuation, or, according to another version, the Masoretic notes.&#8221; However, this ancient rabbinic view that the origins of the Targum are found in Neh 8:8 is debatable. It is not clear that the practice of paraphrasing the Hebrew biblical text into Aramaic in order to accommodate the needs of those Jews who were not at home in the Hebrew language developed this early. The translation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1508;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;</font> adopted above (i.e., &#8220;explaining it&#8221;) understands the word to have in mind an explanatory function (cf. NAB, NCV, TEV, NLT) rather than one of translation.</p>

<A NAME="814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=215><b>tc</b> The unexpected reference to Nehemiah here has led some scholars to suspect that the phrase &#8220;Nehemiah the governor&#8221; is a later addition to the text and not original.</p>
