<A NAME="727"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=199><b>tc</b> Most Hebrew <sc>MSS omit <b>7:68</b> ET, which reads &#8220;They had 736 horses, 245 mules,&#8221; and thus have one less verse in chap. 7, ending the chapter at <b>7:72</b>. This verse is included in the LXX and most English versions. Cf. Ezra 2:66.</p>
