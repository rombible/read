<A NAME="74"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=176><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;until the heat of the sun.&#8221; The phrase probably means that the gates were to be opened only after the day had progressed a bit, not at the first sign of morning light (cf. KJV, NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV, TEV, CEV). It is possible, however, that the Hebrew preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ad</font>), here translated as &#8220;until,&#8221; has a more rare sense of &#8220;during.&#8221; If so, this would mean that the gates were not to be left open and unattended during the hot part of the day when people typically would be at rest (cf. NLT).</p>
