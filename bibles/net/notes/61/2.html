Although the preferable interpretation is a genitive of destination, especially because of the elaboration given at the end of the verse (&#8220;bringing swift destruction on themselves&#8221;), translating it attributively is less cumbersome in English. Either way, the net result is the same.</p>

<a name="115"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=84><b>tn</b> The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#951;&#963;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jamarthsantwn</font>) could either be attributive (&#8220;who sinned&#8221;) or adverbial (&#8220;when they sinned&#8221;). The relation to the judgment of the false teachers in v. 3 suggests that the objects of God&#8217;s judgment are not in question, but the time frame for the execution of justice is. If the participle is taken temporally, the point of comparison is not as acute. The objection that the illustrations following (the flood, Sodom and Gomorrah) are viewed temporally does not mitigate this translation, for in both instances only the time of executing judgment is in view. Further, in both instances the OT notes that God withheld punishment for a long time.</p>
<a name="116"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=85><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;casting them into Tartarus&#8221; or &#8220;holding them captive in Tartarus.&#8221; This verb, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#945;&#961;&#972;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">tartarow</font>), occurs only here in the NT, but its meaning is clearly established in both Hellenistic and Jewish literature. &#8220;Tartarus [was] thought of by the Greeks as a subterranean place lower than Hades where divine punishment was meted out, and so regarded in Israelite apocalyptic as well&#8221; (BDAG 991 s.v.). Grammatically, it has been translated as an indicative because it is an attendant circumstance participle.</p>
<a name="117"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=86><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;handed them over.&#8221;</p>
<a name="118"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=87><b>tc</b> The reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#945;&#8150;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">seirai&quot;</font>, &#8220;chains&#8221;) is found in <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>72</sup> P <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 33 1739 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> vg sy, while <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#953;&#961;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">sirois </font>[or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">seirois</font>], &#8220;pits&#8221;) is found in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A B C 81 <i>pc</i>. The evidence is thus fairly evenly divided. Internally, the reading adopted here (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#945;&#8150;&#962;</font>) is a rarer term, perhaps prompting some scribes to replace it with the more common word. However, this more common term is not a synonym and hence does not follow the normal pattern of scribes. As well, the use of the genitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#950;&#972;&#966;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">zofou</font>) in &#8220;chains of darkness&#8221; is a bit awkward (a rare genitive of place), perhaps prompting some scribes to change the imagery to &#8220;pits of darkness&#8221; (in which case <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#950;&#972;&#966;&#959;&#965;</font> is an attributive genitive). A further point that complicates the issue is the relationship of 2 Peter to Jude. Jude&#8217;s parallel (v. 6) has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#949;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">desmois</font>, &#8220;chains&#8221;). Apart from the issue of whether 2 Peter used Jude or Jude used 2 Peter, this parallel suggests one of two possibilities: either (1) since these two books obviously have a literary relationship, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#945;&#8150;&#962;</font> is original, or (2) early scribes, recognizing that these two books shared their material, changed <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</font> to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#945;&#8150;&#962;</font> to conform the wording, at least conceptually, to Jude 6. On balance, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#945;&#8150;&#962;</font> looks to be original because scribes were not prone to harmonize extensively between books other than the Gospels (although 2 Peter and Jude do display some of this harmonizing). Further, such harmonization is often, if not usually, verbally exact, but <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#949;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</font> is not a variant here.</p>

In order to show this connection more clearly, a resumptive summary protasis &#8211; &#8220;if so,&#8221; or &#8220;if God did these things&#8221; &#8211; is needed in English translation.</p>
<a name="132"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=101><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;from trial,&#8221; or possibly &#8220;from temptation&#8221; (though this second meaning for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#956;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">peirasmo&quot;</font>) does not fit the context in which Noah and Lot are seen as in the midst of trials, not temptation).</p>
<a name="133"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=102><b>tn</b> The adverbial participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#959;&#955;&#945;&#950;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kolazomenou&quot;</font>) can refer either to contemporaneous time or subsequent time. At stake is the meaning of the following prepositional phrase (<i>at the day of judgment</i> or <i>until the day of judgment</i>). If the participle is contemporaneous, the idea is &#8220;to keep the ungodly<i> in a state of punishment</i> until the day of judgment.&#8221; If subsequent, the meaning is &#8220;to keep the ungodly <i>to be punished</i> at the day of judgment.&#8221; Many commentators/translations opt for the first view, assuming that the present participle cannot be used of subsequent time. However, the present participle is the normal one used for result, and is often used of purpose (cf., e.g., for present participles suggesting result, Mark 9:7; Luke 4:15; John 5:18; Eph 2:15; 2 Pet 2:1, mentioned above; for present participles indicating purpose, note Luke 10:25; John 12:33; Acts 3:26; 2 Pet 2:10 [as even most translations render it]). Further, the context supports this: 2:1-10 forms something of an <i>inclusio</i>, in which the final end of the false teachers is mentioned specifically in v. 1, then as a general principle in v. 9. The point of v. 3 &#8211; that the punishment of the false teachers is certain, even though the sentence has not yet been carried out, is underscored by a participle of purpose in v. 9.</p>

However, it is also possible to see this temporally (thus, &#8220;they do not tremble when they blaspheme&#8221;).</p>
<a name="137"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=106><b>tn</b> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;&#972;&#958;&#945;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">doxas</font>) almost certainly refers to angelic beings rather than mere human authorities, though it is difficult to tell whether good or bad angels are in view. Verse 11 seems to suggest that wicked angels is what the author intends.</p>
<a name="138"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=107><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;whereas.&#8221;</p>

<a name="140"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=109><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;insulting.&#8221; The word comes from the same root as the term found in v. 10 (&#8220;insult&#8221;), v. 12 (&#8220;insulting&#8221;), and v. 2 (&#8220;will be slandered&#8221;). The author is fond of building his case by the repetition of a word in a slightly different context so that the readers make the necessary connection. English usage cannot always convey this connection because a given word in one language cannot always be translated the same way in another.</p>
<a name="141"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=110><b>tc</b> &#8225; Some witnesses lack <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#8048; &#954;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#8179;</font> (<font face="Greektl">para kuriw</font>; so A <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 33 81 1505 1881 2464 <i>al</i> vg co), while others have the genitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#8048; &#954;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">para kuriou</font>; so <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>72</sup> 1241 <i>al</i> sy<sup>ph,h**</sup>).

The genitive expression suggests that angels would not pronounce a judgment on &#8220;the glorious ones&#8221; <i>from the Lord</i>, while the dative indicates that angels would not pronounce a judgment on &#8220;the glorious ones&#8221; <i>in the presence of the Lord. </i>The parallel in Jude 9 speaks of a reviling judgment against the devil in which the prepositional phrase is entirely absent. At the same time, in that parallel Michael does say, &#8220;The Lord rebuke you.&#8221; (Hence, he is offering something of a judgment <i>from the Lord.</i>) The best options externally are the dative or the omission of the phrase, but a decision is difficult. Internally, the omission may possibly be a motivated reading in that it finds a parallel in Jude 9 (where no prepositional phrase is used). All things considered, the dative is to be preferred, though with much reservation.</p>
<a name="142"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=111><b>tn</b> 2 Pet 2:12 through 16 constitute one cumbersome sentence in Greek. It is difficult to tell whether a hard break belongs in the middle of v. 13, as the translation has it, or whether the compounding of participles is meant in a loosely descriptive sort of way, without strong grammatical connection. Either way, the sentence rambles in a way that often betrays a great &#8220;vehemence of spirit&#8221; (A. T. Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, 435). The author is obviously agitated at these false teachers who are to come.</p>
<a name="143"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=112><b>tn</b> The false teachers could conceivably be men or women, but in v. 14 they are said to have eyes &#8220;full of an adulteress.&#8221; This can only refer to men.

<a name="147"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=116><b>tn</b> This cryptic expression has been variously interpreted. (1) It could involve a simple cognate dative in which case the idea is &#8220;they will be utterly destroyed.&#8221; But the presence of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8182;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">autwn</font>; <i>their, of them</i>) is problematic for this view. Other, more plausible views are: (2) the false teachers will be destroyed at the same time as the irrational beasts, or (3) in the same manner as these creatures (i.e., by being caught); or (4) the false teachers will be destroyed together with the evil angels whom they insult. Because of the difficulties of the text, it was thought best to leave it ambiguous, as the Greek has it.</p>
<a name="148"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=117><b>tn</b> There is a play on words in Greek, but this is difficult to express adequately in English. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#948;&#953;&#954;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">adikew</font>) as a passive means &#8220;to suffer harm,&#8221; <i>or</i> &#8220;to suffer an injustice.&#8221; The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#948;&#953;&#954;&#943;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">adikia</font>) means &#8220;unrighteousness.&#8221; Since the Greek verb has a wider field of meaning than the English, to translate it as <i>suffer an injustice</i> is unwarranted, for it implicitly attributes evil to God. As R.

At the same time, it functions subordinately to the following participle, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#967;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Juparconte&quot;</font>, &#8220;while being&#8221;). </p>

The main verbal components of these two verses are: &#8220;uttering&#8230;they entice&#8230;promising&#8230;being (enslaved).&#8221; The main verb is (<i>they</i>)<i> entice</i>. The three participles are adverbial and seem to indicate an instrumental relation (by uttering), a concessive relation (although promising), and a temporal relation (while being [enslaved]). For the sake of English usage, in the translation of the text this is broken down into two sentences.</p>
<a name="175"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">75</span><note=144><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;for by what someone is overcome, to this he is enslaved.&#8221;</p>

<a name="181"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">81</span><note=150><b>tn</b> The quotation is a loose rendering of Prov 26:11. This proverb involves a participle that is translated like a finite verb (&#8220;returns&#8221;). In the LXX this line constitutes a subordinate and dependent clause. But since the line has been lifted from its original context, it has been translated as an independent statement.</p>
<a name="182"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">82</span><note=151><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;after being washed.&#8221; The middle verb may be direct (&#8220;wash oneself&#8221;) or permissive (&#8220;allow oneself to be washed&#8221;). </p>
<a name="183"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">83</span><note=152><b>tn</b> The source of this quotation is uncertain. Heraclitus has often been mentioned as a possible source, but this is doubtful. Other options on the translation of the second line include <i>a sow, having (once) bathed herself (in mud), (returns) to wallowing in the mire</i>, or <i>a sow that washes herself by wallowing in the mire</i> (BDAG 181 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#946;&#972;&#961;&#946;&#959;&#961;&#959;&#962;</font>). The advantage of this last translation is that no verbs need to be supplied for it to make sense. The disadvantage is that in this context it does not make any contribution to the argument. Since the source of the quotation is not known, there is some guesswork involved in the reconstruction. Most commentators prefer a translation similar to the one in the text above.</p>
