<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=153><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;I am already writing this [as] a second letter.&#8221; The object-complement construction is more smoothly rendered in English a bit differently. Further, although the present tense <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">grafw</font>) is used here, English convention employs an epistolary past tense. (The Greek epistolary aorist might have been expected here, but it also occurs in situations unlike its English counterparts.)</p>

<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=155><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I have stirred up, aroused.&#8221; The translation treats the present tense verb as a conative present.</p>

<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=157><b>tn</b> &#8220;Both&#8221; is not in Greek; it is supplied to show more clearly that there are two objects of the infinitive &#8220;to remember&#8221; &#8211; predictions and commandment.</p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=158><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;words.&#8221; In conjunction with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#972;&#949;&#953;&#960;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">proeipon</font>), however, the meaning of the construction is that the prophets uttered prophecies.</p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=159><b>sn</b> <i>Holy prophets&#8230;apostles. </i>The first chapter demonstrated that the OT prophets were trustworthy guides (1:19-21) and that the NT apostles were also authoritative (1:16-18). Now, using the same catch phrase found in the Greek text of 1:20 (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959; &#960;&#961;&#8182;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#947;&#953;&#957;&#8061;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">touto prwton ginwskontes</font>), Peter points to specific prophecies of the prophets as an argument against the false teachers.</p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=160><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;knowing this [to be] foremost.&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#932;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959; &#960;&#961;&#8182;&#964;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">touto prwton</font>) constitute the object and complement of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#953;&#957;&#8061;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ginwskonte&quot;</font>). The participle is loosely dependent on the infinitive in v. 2 (&#8220;[I want you] to recall&#8221;), perhaps in a telic sense (thus, &#8220;[I want you] to recall&#8230;[and especially] to understand this as foremost&#8221;). The following statement then would constitute the main predictions with which the author was presently concerned. An alternative is to take it imperativally: &#8220;Above all, know this.&#8221; In this instance, however, there is little semantic difference (since a telic participle and imperatival participle end up urging an action). Cf. also 2 Pet 1:20.</p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=161><b>tn</b> The Greek reads &#8220;scoffers in their scoffing&#8221; for &#8220;blatant scoffers.&#8221; The use of the cognate dative is a Semitism designed to intensify the word it is related to. The idiom is foreign to English. As a Semitism, it is further incidental evidence of the authenticity of the letter (see the note on &#8220;Simeon&#8221; in 1:1 for other evidence). </p>
<a name="110"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=162><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;going according to their own evil urges.&#8221;</p>
<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=163><b>tn</b> The present participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">legontes</font>, &#8220;saying&#8221;) most likely indicates result. Thus, their denial of the Lord&#8217;s return is the result of their lifestyle. The connection to the false teachers of chapter 2 is thus made clear.</p>
<a name="112"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=164><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;Where is the promise of his coming?&#8221; The genitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">parousia&quot;</font>, &#8220;coming, advent, return&#8221;) is best taken as an attributed genitive (in which the head noun, <i>promise</i>, functions semantically as an adjective; see <i>ExSyn</i> 89-91). </p>
<a name="113"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=165><b>tn</b> The prepositional phrase with the relative pronoun, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#966;&#8127; &#7975;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">af</font>&#8217;<font face="Greektl"> |h&quot;</font>), is used adverbially or conjunctively without antecedent (see BDAG 727 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#962;</font> 1.k.).</p>
<a name="114"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=166><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;fathers.&#8221; The reference could be either to the OT patriarchs or first generation Christians. This latter meaning, however, is unattested in any other early Christian literature.</p>
<a name="115"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=167><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#959;&#953;&#956;&#940;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">koimaw</font>) literally means &#8220;sleep,&#8221; but it is often used in the Bible as a euphemism for the death of a believer.</p>
<a name="116"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=168><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;thus,&#8221; &#8220;in the same manner.&#8221;</p>
<a name="117"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=169><b>tn</b> The Greek is difficult at this point. An alternative is &#8220;Even though they maintain this, it escapes them that&#8230;&#8221; Literally<i> </i>the idea seems to be: &#8220;For this escapes these [men] who wish [it to be so].&#8221; </p>
<a name="118"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=170><b>tn</b> The word order in Greek places &#8220;the word of God&#8221; at the end of the sentence. See discussion in the note on &#8220;these things&#8221; in v. 6.</p>

<a name="120"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=172><b>tn</b> The antecedent is ambiguous. It could refer to the heavens, the heavens and earth, or the water and the word. If the reference is to the heavens, the author is reflecting on the Genesis account about &#8220;the floodgates of the heavens&#8221; being opened (Gen 7:11). If the reference is to the heavens and earth, he is also thinking about the cosmic upheaval that helped to produce the flood (Gen 6:11). If the reference is to the water and the word, he is indicating both the means (water) and the cause (word of God). This last interpretation is the most likely since the final nouns of v. 5 are &#8220;water&#8221; and &#8220;word of God,&#8221; making them the nearest antecedents. </p>
<a name="121"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=173><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;the ungodly people.&#8221;</p>
<a name="122"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=174><b>tn</b> The same verb, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#945;&#957;&#952;&#940;&#957;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">lanqanw</font>, &#8220;escape&#8221;) used in v. 5 is found here (there, translated &#8220;suppress&#8221;).</p>
<a name="123"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=175><b>tn</b> Or perhaps, &#8220;the Lord is not delaying [the fulfillment of] his promise,&#8221; or perhaps &#8220;the Lord of the promise is not delaying.&#8221; The verb can mean &#8220;to delay,&#8221; &#8220;to be slow,&#8221; or &#8220;to be hesitant.&#8221;</p>
<a name="124"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=176><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;not wishing.&#8221; The participle most likely has a causal force, explaining why the Lord is patient.</p>
<a name="125"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=177><b>sn</b> <i>He does not wish for any to perish. </i>This verse has been a battleground between Arminians and Calvinists. The former argue that God wants all people to be saved, but either through inability or restriction of his own sovereignty does not interfere with peoples&#8217; wills. Some of the latter argue that the &#8220;any&#8221; here means &#8220;any <i>of you</i>&#8221; and that all the elect will repent before the return of Christ, because this is God&#8217;s will. Both of these positions have problems. The &#8220;any&#8221; in this context means &#8220;any of you.&#8221; (This can be seen by the dependent participle which gives the reason why the Lord is patient &#8220;toward you.&#8221;) There are hints throughout this letter that the readership may be mixed, including both true believers and others who are &#8220;sitting on the fence&#8221; as it were. But to make the equation of this readership with the elect is unlikely. This would seem to require, in its historical context, that all of these readers would be saved. But not all who attend church know the Lord or will know the Lord. Simon the Magician, whom Peter had confronted in Acts 8, is a case in point. This is evident in contemporary churches when a pastor addresses the congregation as &#8220;brothers, sisters, saints, etc.,&#8221; yet concludes the message with an evangelistic appeal. When an apostle or pastor addresses a group as &#8220;Christian&#8221; he does not necessarily think that every individual in the congregation is truly a Christian. Thus, the literary context seems to be against the Arminian view, while the historical context seems to be against (one representation of) the Calvinist view. The answer to this conundrum is found in the term &#8220;wish&#8221; (a participle in Greek from the verb <font face="Greektl">boulomai</font>). It often represents a mere wish, or one&#8217;s desiderative will, rather than one&#8217;s resolve. Unless God&#8217;s will is viewed on the two planes of his desiderative and decretive will (what he desires and what he decrees), hopeless confusion will result. The scriptures amply illustrate both that God sometimes decrees things that he does not desire and desires things that he does not decree. It is not that his will can be thwarted, nor that he has limited his sovereignty. But the mystery of God&#8217;s dealings with humanity is best seen if this tension is preserved. Otherwise, either God will be perceived as good but impotent or as a sovereign taskmaster. Here the idea that God does not <i>wish</i> for any to perish speaks only of God's desiderative will, without comment on his decretive will.</p>
<a name="126"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=178><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;reach to repentance.&#8221; Repentance thus seems to be a quantifiable state, or turning point. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#967;&#969;&#961;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">cwrew</font>, &#8220;reach&#8221;) typically involves the connotation of &#8220;obtain the full measure of&#8221; something. It is thus most appropriate as referring to the repentance that accompanies conversion.</p>
<a name="127"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=179><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;in which.&#8221;</p>

It was often used of the crackle of a fire, as would appear appropriate in this context.</p>

<a name="134"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=186><b>tc</b> One of the most difficult textual problems in the NT is found in v. 10. The reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8017;&#961;&#949;&#952;&#8053;&#963;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jeureqhsetai</font>), which enjoys by far the best support (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B K P 0156<sup>vid</sup> 323 1241 1739<sup>txt</sup> <i>pc</i>) is nevertheless so difficult a reading that many scholars regard it as nonsensical. (NA<sup>27</sup> lists five conjectures by scholars, from Hort to Mayor, in this text.) As R. Bauckham has pointed out, solutions to the problem are of three sorts: (1) conjectural emendation (which normally speaks more of the ingenuity of the scholar who makes the proposal than of the truth of the conjecture, e.g., changing one letter in the previous word, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#961;&#947;&#945;</font> [<font face="Greektl">erga</font>] becomes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#961;&#947;&#945;</font> [<font face="Greektl">arga</font>] with the meaning, &#8220;the earth and the things in it will be found <i>useless</i>&#8221;); (2) adoption of one of several variant readings (all of which, however, are easier than this one and simply cannot explain how this reading arose, e.g., the reading of <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>72</sup> which adds <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#965;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;</font> [<font face="Greektl">luomena</font>] to the verb &#8211; a reading suggested no doubt by the threefold occurrence of this verb in the surrounding verses: &#8220;the earth and its works will be found dissolved&#8221;; or the simplest variant, the reading of the Sahidic <span class="smallcaps">mss</span>, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016;&#967;</font> [<font face="Greektl">ouc</font>] preceding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7953;&#965;&#961;&#949;&#952;&#8053;&#963;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;</font> &#8211; &#8220;will not be found&#8221;); or (3) interpretive gymnastics which regards the text as settled but has to do some manipulation to its normal meaning. Bauckham puts forth an excellent case that the third option is to be preferred and that the meaning of the term is virtually the equivalent of &#8220;will be disclosed,&#8221; &#8220;will be manifested.&#8221; (That this meaning is not readily apparent may in fact have been the reason for so many variants and conjectures.) Thus, the force of the clause is that &#8220;the earth and the works [done by men] in it will be stripped bare [before God].&#8221; In addition, the unusualness of the expression is certainly in keeping with the author&#8217;s style throughout this little book. Hence, what looks to be suspect because of its abnormalities, upon closer inspection is actually in keeping with the author&#8217;s stylistic idiosyncrasies. The meaning of the text then is that all but the earth and men&#8217;s works will be destroyed. Everything will be removed so that humanity will stand naked before God. Textually, then, on both external and internal grounds, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8017;&#961;&#949;&#952;&#8053;&#963;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;</font> commends itself as the preferred reading.</p>

But the shorter reading (with no pronoun) has the support of <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>72*,74vid</sup> B <i>pc</i>. Though slim, the evidence for the omission is nevertheless the earliest. Further, the addition of some pronoun, especially the second person pronoun, seems to be a clarifying variant. It would be difficult to explain the pronoun&#8217;s absence in some witnesses if the pronoun were original. That three different pronouns have shown up in the <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> is testimony for the omission. Thus, on external and internal grounds, the omission is preferred. For English style requirements, however, <i>some</i> pronoun has to be added.

The point of these two verses thus becomes clear: When the heavens disappear and the earth and its inhabitants are stripped bare before the throne of God, they should strive to make sure that their lives are pure and that they have nothing to hide.</p>

However, the dative pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</font> (<font face="Greektl">autw</font>) does not indicate agency (&#8220;by him&#8221;), but presence or sphere. The idea is &#8220;strive to found {before him/in his presence}.&#8221;</p>
<a name="151"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=203><b>tn</b> The language here is cryptic. It probably means &#8220;regard the patience of our Lord as an opportunity for salvation.&#8221; In the least, Peter is urging his audience to take a different view of the delay of the <i>parousia</i> than that of the false teachers.</p>
<a name="152"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=204><b>sn</b> Critics generally assume that 2 Peter is not authentic, partially because in vv. 15-16 <i>Paul</i> is said to have written scripture. It is assumed that a recognition of Paul&#8217;s writings as scripture could not have happened until early in the 2nd century. However, in the same breath that Paul is canonized, Peter also calls him &#8220;<i>brother</i>.&#8221; This is unparalleled in the 2nd century apocryphal works, as well as early patristic writings, in which the apostles are universally elevated <i>above</i> the author and readers; here, Peter simply says &#8220;he&#8217;s one of us.&#8221;</p>
<a name="153"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=205><b>sn</b> <i>Paul wrote to you. </i>That Paul had written to these people indicates that they are most likely Gentiles. Further, that Peter is now writing to them suggests that Paul had already died, for Peter was the apostle to the circumcised. Peter apparently decided to write his two letters to Paul&#8217;s churches shortly after Paul&#8217;s death, both to connect with them personally and theologically (Paul&#8217;s gospel is Peter&#8217;s gospel) and to warn them of the wolves in sheep&#8217;s clothing that would come in to destroy the flock. Thus, part of Peter&#8217;s purpose seems to be to anchor his readership on the written documents of the Christian community (both the Old Testament and Paul&#8217;s letters) as a safeguard against heretics.</p>
