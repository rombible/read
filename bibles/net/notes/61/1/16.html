<a name="16"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=6><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#945;&#947;&#967;&#940;&#957;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">lancanw</font>) means &#8220;obtain by lot,&#8221; &#8220;receive.&#8221; A literal translation would put it in the active, but some of the richness of the term would thereby be lost. It is used in collocation with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#955;&#8134;&#961;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">klhros</font>, &#8220;lot&#8221;) frequently enough in the LXX to suggest the connotation of reception of a gift, or in the least reception of something that one does not deserve. H. Hanse&#8217;s statement (<i>TDNT</i> 4:1) that &#8220;Even where there is no casting of lots, the attainment is not by one&#8217;s own effort or as a result of one&#8217;s own exertions, but is like ripe fruit falling into one&#8217;s lap&#8221; is apt for this passage. The author&#8217;s opening line is a reminder that our position in Christ is not due to merit, but grace.</p>
