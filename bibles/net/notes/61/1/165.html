<a name="165"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=65><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>in your hearts</i> is sometimes considered an inappropriate image for the <i>parousia</i>, since the coming of Christ will be visible to all. But Peter&#8217;s point has to do with full comprehension of the revelation of Christ, something only believers will experience. Further, his use of light imagery is doing double-duty, suggesting two things at once (i.e., internal guidance to truth or illumination, and OT prophecy about Christ&#8217;s return) and hence can not be expected to be consistent with every point he wishes to make. </p>
