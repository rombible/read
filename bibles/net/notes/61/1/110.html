<a name="110"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=10><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#943;&#947;&#957;&#969;&#963;&#953;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">epignwsis</font>) could simply mean knowledge, but J. B. Mayor (<i>Jude and Second Peter</i>, 171-74) has suggested that it is often a fuller knowledge, especially in reference to things pertaining to spiritual truth. R. Bauckham (<i>Jude, 2 Peter</i> [WBC], 169-70) argues that it refers to the knowledge of God that is borne of conversion, but this is probably saying too much and is asking questions of the author that are foreign to his way of thinking. The term is used in 1:2, 3, 8; 2:20 (the verb form occurs twice, both in 2:21). In every instance it evidently involves being in the inner circle of those who connect to God, though it does not necessarily imply such a direct and <i>relational</i> knowledge of God for each individual within that circle. An analogy would be Judas Iscariot: Even though he was a disciple of the Lord, he was not converted. </p>
