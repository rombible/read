<a name="164"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=64><b>sn</b> The reference to <i>the morning star</i> constitutes a double entendre. First, the term was normally used to refer to Venus. But the author of course has a metaphorical meaning in mind, as is obvious from the place where the morning star is to rise &#8211; &#8220;in your hearts.&#8221; Most commentators see an allusion to Num 24:17 (&#8220;a star shall rise out of Jacob&#8221;) in Peter&#8217;s words. Early Christian exegesis saw in that passage a prophecy about Christ&#8217;s coming. Hence, in this verse Peter tells his audience to heed the OT scriptures which predict the return of Christ, then alludes to one of the passages that does this very thing, all the while running the theme of light on a parallel track. In addition, it may be significant that Peter&#8217;s choice of terms here is not the same as is found in the LXX. He has used a Hellenistic word that was sometimes used of emperors and deities, perhaps as a further polemic against the paganism of his day.</p>
