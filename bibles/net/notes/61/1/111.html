<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>tn</b> A comma properly belongs at the end of v. 2 instead of a period, since v. 3 is a continuation of the same sentence. With the optative in v. 2, the author has departed from Paul&#8217;s normal greeting (in which no verb is used), rendering the greeting a full-blown sentence. Nevertheless, this translation divides the verses up along thematic lines in spite of breaking up the sentence structure. For more explanation, see note on &#8220;power&#8221; in v. 3.</p>
