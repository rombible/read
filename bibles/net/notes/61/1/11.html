However, this appears to be a motivated reading as it is the more common spelling. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#931;&#965;&#956;&#949;&#8061;&#957;</font> occurs only here and in Acts 15:14 as a spelling for the apostle&#8217;s name. The reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#931;&#965;&#956;&#949;&#8061;&#957;</font> enjoys ample and widespread support among the <span class="smallcaps">mss</span>, strongly suggesting its authenticity. Further, this Hebraic spelling is a subtle argument for the authenticity of this letter, since a forger would almost surely follow the normal spelling of the name (1 Peter begins only with &#8220;Peter&#8221; giving no help either way).</p>
