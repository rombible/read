<a name="112"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=12><b>tn</b> The verse in Greek starts out with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8033;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jws</font>) followed by a genitive absolute construction, dependent on the main verb in v. 2. Together, they form a subordinate causal clause. A more literal rendering would be &#8220;because his divine power&#8230;&#8221; The idea is that the <i>basis</i> or authority for the author&#8217;s prayer in v. 2 (that grace and peace would abound to the readers) was that God&#8217;s power was manifested in their midst. The author&#8217;s sentence structure is cumbersome even in Greek; hence, the translation has broken this up into two sentences. </p>
