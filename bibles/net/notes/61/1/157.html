<a name="157"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=57><b>tn</b> 2 Pet 1:17-18 comprise one sentence in Greek, with the main verb &#8220;heard&#8221; in v. 18. All else is temporally subordinate to that statement. Hence, more literally these verses read as follows: &#8220;For when he received honor and glory from God the Father, when that voice was conveyed to him by the Majestic Glory: &#8216;This is my beloved Son, in whom I am delighted,&#8217; we ourselves heard this voice when it was conveyed from heaven, when we were with him on the holy mountain.&#8221;</p>
