<a name="169"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=69><b>tn</b> If, as seems probable, the &#8220;prophecy&#8221; mentioned here is to be identified with the &#8220;prophecy of scripture&#8221; mentioned in the previous verse, then the Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anqrwpoi</font>, &#8220;men&#8221;) would refer specifically to the human authors of scripture, who (as far as we know) were all men. Thus &#8220;men&#8221; has been used here in the translation. If, on the other hand, the &#8220;prophecy&#8221; mentioned in the present verse is not limited to scripture but refers to oral prophecy as well, then women would be included, since Joel 2:20 specifically mentions &#8220;sons and daughters&#8221; as having the ability to prophesy, and the NT clearly mentions prophetesses (Luke 2:36; Acts 21:9).</p>
