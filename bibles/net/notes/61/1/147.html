<a name="147"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=47><b>sn</b> There are various interpretations of v. 15. For example, the author could be saying simply, &#8220;I will make every effort that you remember these things.&#8221; But the collocation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#948;&#940;&#950;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">spoudazw</font>) with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#957;&#8053;&#957;&#951;</font> (<font face="Greektl">mnhnh</font>) suggests a more specific image. R. Bauckham (<i>Jude, 2 Peter</i> [WBC], 201-2) is right when he notes that these two words together suggest a desire to write some sort of letter or testament. Most commentators recognize the difficulty in seeing the future verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#948;&#940;&#963;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">spoudasw</font>) as referring to 2 Peter itself (the present or aorist would have been expected, i.e., &#8220;I have made every effort,&#8221; or &#8220;I am making every effort&#8221;). Some have suggested that Mark&#8217;s Gospel is in view. The difficulty with this is threefold: (1) Mark is probably to be dated before 2 Peter, (2) early patristic testimony seems to imply that Peter was the unwitting source behind Mark&#8217;s Gospel; and (3) &#8220;these things&#8221; would seem to refer, in the least, to the prophecy about Peter&#8217;s death (absent in Mark). A more plausible suggestion might be that the author was thinking of the ending of John&#8217;s Gospel. This is possible because (1) John 21:18-19 is the only other place in the NT that refers to Peter&#8217;s death; indeed, it fleshes out the cryptic statement in v. 14 a bit more; (2) both 2 Peter and John were apparently written to Gentiles in and around Asia Minor; (3) both books were probably written after Paul&#8217;s death and perhaps even to Paul&#8217;s churches (cf. 2 Pet 3:1-2, 15-16); and (4) John 21 gives the appearance of being added to the end of a finished work. There is thus some possibility that this final chapter was added at the author&#8217;s request, in part to encourage Gentile Christians to face impending persecution, knowing that the martyrdom of even (Paul and) Peter was within the purview of God&#8217;s sovereignty. That 2 Pet 1:15 alludes to John 21 is of course by no means certain, but remains at least the most plausible of the suggestions put forth thus far.</p>
