<a name="123"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=23><b>tn</b> The participle is either means (&#8220;by making every effort&#8221;) or attendant circumstance (&#8220;make every effort&#8221;). Although it fits the normal contours of attendant circumstance participles, the semantics are different. Normally, attendant circumstance is used of an action that is a necessary prelude to the action of the main verb. But &#8220;making every effort&#8221; is what energizes the main verb here. Hence it is best taken as means. However, for the sake of smoothness the translation has rendered it as a command with the main verb translated as an infinitive. This is in accord with English idiom.</p>
