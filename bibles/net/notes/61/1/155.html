However, the author&#8217;s version is markedly different from the synoptic accounts (in particular his introductory phrase, &#8220;when that voice was conveyed to him,&#8221; an unusual expression [perhaps used to avoid naming God directly as the one who spoke from heaven]). The most natural explanation for such differences is that he was unaware of the exact wording of the Gospels. This is, of course, easier to explain if 2 Peter is authentic than if it is a late document, written in the 2nd century.</p>
