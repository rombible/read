What appears to be a synergism of effort or even a contradiction (God supplies the basis, the promises, the grace, the power, etc., while believers must also provide the faith, excellence, etc.) in reality encapsulates the mystery of sanctification. Each believer is responsible before God for his conduct and spiritual growth, yet that growth could not take place without God&#8217;s prior work and constant enabling. We must not neglect our responsibility, yet the enabling and the credit is God&#8217;s. Paul says the same thing: &#8220;Continue working out your salvation with humility and dependence, for the one bringing forth in you both the desire and the effort&#8230;is God&#8221; (Phil 2:12-13).</p>
