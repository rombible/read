<a name="119"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=19><b>sn</b> Although the author has borrowed the expression <i>partakers of the divine nature</i> from paganism, his meaning is clearly Christian. He does not mean apotheosis (man becoming a god) in the pagan sense, but rather that believers have an organic connection with God. Because of such a connection, God can truly be called our Father. Conceptually, this bears the same meaning as Paul&#8217;s &#8220;in Christ&#8221; formula. The author&#8217;s statement, though startling at first, is hardly different from Paul&#8217;s prayer for the Ephesians that they &#8220;may be filled up to all the fullness of God&#8221; (3:19).</p>
