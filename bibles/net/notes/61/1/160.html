<a name="160"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=60><b>tn</b> The comparative adjective <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#946;&#949;&#946;&#945;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">bebaioteron</font>) is the complement to the object <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#957; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ton profhtikon logon</font>). As such, the construction almost surely has the force &#8220;The prophetic word is (more certain/altogether certain) &#8211; and this is something that we all have.&#8221; Many scholars prefer to read the construction as saying &#8220;we have the prophetic word <i>made</i> more sure,&#8221; but such a nuance is unparalleled in object-complement constructions (when the construction has this force, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#953;&#941;&#969;</font> [<font face="Greektl">poiew</font>] is present [as in 2 Pet 1:10]). The meaning, as construed in the translation, is that the Bible (in this case, the OT) that these believers had in their hands was a thoroughly reliable guide. Whether it was <i>more certain</i> than was even Peter&#8217;s experience on the Mount of Transfiguration depends on whether the adjective should be taken as a true comparative (&#8220;more certain&#8221;) or as an elative (&#8220;very certain, altogether certain&#8221;). Some would categorically object to any experience functioning as a confirmation of the scriptures and hence would tend to give the adjective a comparative force. Yet the author labors to show that his gospel is trustworthy precisely because he was an eyewitness of this great event. Further, to say that the OT scriptures (the most likely meaning of &#8220;the prophetic word&#8221;) were more trustworthy an authority than an apostle&#8217;s own experience of Christ is both to misconstrue how prophecy took place in the OT (did not the prophets have visions or other <i>experiences</i>?) and to deny the final revelation of God <i>in Christ</i> (cf. Heb 1:2). In sum, since syntactically the meaning that &#8220;we have confirmed the prophetic word by our experience&#8221; is improbable, and since contextually the meaning that &#8220;we have something that is a more reliable authority than experience, namely, the Bible&#8221; is unlikely, we are left with the meaning &#8220;we have a very reliable authority, the Old Testament, as a witness to Christ&#8217;s return.&#8221; No comparison is thus explicitly made. This fits both the context and normal syntax quite well. The introductory <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) suggests that the author is adding to his argument. He makes the statement that Christ will return, and backs it up with two points: (1) Peter himself (as well as the other apostles) was an eyewitness to the Transfiguration, which is a precursor to the Parousia; and (2) the Gentile believers, who were not on the Mount of Transfiguration, nevertheless have the Old Testament, a wholly reliable authority that also promises the return of Christ.</p>
