<a name="120"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=20><b>tn</b> The aorist participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#966;&#965;&#947;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">apofugonte&quot;</font>) is often taken as attendant circumstance to the preceding verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#941;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#952;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">genhsqe</font>). As such, the sense is &#8220;that you might become partakers&#8230;and might escape&#8230;&#8221; However, it does not follow the contours of the vast majority of attendant circumstance participles (in which the participle <i>precedes</i> the main verb, among other things). Further, attendant circumstance participles are frequently confused with result participles (which <i>do</i> follow the verb). Many who take this as attendant circumstance are probably viewing it semantically as result (&#8220;that you might become partakers&#8230;and [thereby] escape&#8230;&#8221;). But this is next to impossible since the participle is <i>aorist</i>: Result participles are categorically present tense.</p>
