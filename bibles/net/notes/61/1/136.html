One might expect the author to have said &#8220;he is nearsighted and blind&#8221; (as the NIV has so construed it), but this is not the word order in Greek. Perhaps the author begins with a strong statement followed by a clarification, i.e., that being nearsighted in regard to these virtues is as good as being blind.</p>
