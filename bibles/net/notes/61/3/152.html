<a name="152"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=204><b>sn</b> Critics generally assume that 2 Peter is not authentic, partially because in vv. 15-16 <i>Paul</i> is said to have written scripture. It is assumed that a recognition of Paul&#8217;s writings as scripture could not have happened until early in the 2nd century. However, in the same breath that Paul is canonized, Peter also calls him &#8220;<i>brother</i>.&#8221; This is unparalleled in the 2nd century apocryphal works, as well as early patristic writings, in which the apostles are universally elevated <i>above</i> the author and readers; here, Peter simply says &#8220;he&#8217;s one of us.&#8221;</p>
