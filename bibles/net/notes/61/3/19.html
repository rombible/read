<a name="19"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=161><b>tn</b> The Greek reads &#8220;scoffers in their scoffing&#8221; for &#8220;blatant scoffers.&#8221; The use of the cognate dative is a Semitism designed to intensify the word it is related to. The idiom is foreign to English. As a Semitism, it is further incidental evidence of the authenticity of the letter (see the note on &#8220;Simeon&#8221; in 1:1 for other evidence). </p>
