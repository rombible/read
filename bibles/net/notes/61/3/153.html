<a name="153"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=205><b>sn</b> <i>Paul wrote to you. </i>That Paul had written to these people indicates that they are most likely Gentiles. Further, that Peter is now writing to them suggests that Paul had already died, for Peter was the apostle to the circumcised. Peter apparently decided to write his two letters to Paul&#8217;s churches shortly after Paul&#8217;s death, both to connect with them personally and theologically (Paul&#8217;s gospel is Peter&#8217;s gospel) and to warn them of the wolves in sheep&#8217;s clothing that would come in to destroy the flock. Thus, part of Peter&#8217;s purpose seems to be to anchor his readership on the written documents of the Christian community (both the Old Testament and Paul&#8217;s letters) as a safeguard against heretics.</p>
