<a name="120"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=172><b>tn</b> The antecedent is ambiguous. It could refer to the heavens, the heavens and earth, or the water and the word. If the reference is to the heavens, the author is reflecting on the Genesis account about &#8220;the floodgates of the heavens&#8221; being opened (Gen 7:11). If the reference is to the heavens and earth, he is also thinking about the cosmic upheaval that helped to produce the flood (Gen 6:11). If the reference is to the water and the word, he is indicating both the means (water) and the cause (word of God). This last interpretation is the most likely since the final nouns of v. 5 are &#8220;water&#8221; and &#8220;word of God,&#8221; making them the nearest antecedents. </p>
