<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=153><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;I am already writing this [as] a second letter.&#8221; The object-complement construction is more smoothly rendered in English a bit differently. Further, although the present tense <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">grafw</font>) is used here, English convention employs an epistolary past tense. (The Greek epistolary aorist might have been expected here, but it also occurs in situations unlike its English counterparts.)</p>
