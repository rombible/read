<a name="18"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=160><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;knowing this [to be] foremost.&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#932;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959; &#960;&#961;&#8182;&#964;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">touto prwton</font>) constitute the object and complement of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#953;&#957;&#8061;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ginwskonte&quot;</font>). The participle is loosely dependent on the infinitive in v. 2 (&#8220;[I want you] to recall&#8221;), perhaps in a telic sense (thus, &#8220;[I want you] to recall&#8230;[and especially] to understand this as foremost&#8221;). The following statement then would constitute the main predictions with which the author was presently concerned. An alternative is to take it imperativally: &#8220;Above all, know this.&#8221; In this instance, however, there is little semantic difference (since a telic participle and imperatival participle end up urging an action). Cf. also 2 Pet 1:20.</p>
