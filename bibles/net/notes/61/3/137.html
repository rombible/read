But the shorter reading (with no pronoun) has the support of <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>72*,74vid</sup> B <i>pc</i>. Though slim, the evidence for the omission is nevertheless the earliest. Further, the addition of some pronoun, especially the second person pronoun, seems to be a clarifying variant. It would be difficult to explain the pronoun&#8217;s absence in some witnesses if the pronoun were original. That three different pronouns have shown up in the <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> is testimony for the omission. Thus, on external and internal grounds, the omission is preferred. For English style requirements, however, <i>some</i> pronoun has to be added.
