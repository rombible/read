<a name="134"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=186><b>tc</b> One of the most difficult textual problems in the NT is found in v. 10. The reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8017;&#961;&#949;&#952;&#8053;&#963;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jeureqhsetai</font>), which enjoys by far the best support (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B K P 0156<sup>vid</sup> 323 1241 1739<sup>txt</sup> <i>pc</i>) is nevertheless so difficult a reading that many scholars regard it as nonsensical. (NA<sup>27</sup> lists five conjectures by scholars, from Hort to Mayor, in this text.) As R. Bauckham has pointed out, solutions to the problem are of three sorts: (1) conjectural emendation (which normally speaks more of the ingenuity of the scholar who makes the proposal than of the truth of the conjecture, e.g., changing one letter in the previous word, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#961;&#947;&#945;</font> [<font face="Greektl">erga</font>] becomes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#961;&#947;&#945;</font> [<font face="Greektl">arga</font>] with the meaning, &#8220;the earth and the things in it will be found <i>useless</i>&#8221;); (2) adoption of one of several variant readings (all of which, however, are easier than this one and simply cannot explain how this reading arose, e.g., the reading of <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>72</sup> which adds <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#965;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;</font> [<font face="Greektl">luomena</font>] to the verb &#8211; a reading suggested no doubt by the threefold occurrence of this verb in the surrounding verses: &#8220;the earth and its works will be found dissolved&#8221;; or the simplest variant, the reading of the Sahidic <span class="smallcaps">mss</span>, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016;&#967;</font> [<font face="Greektl">ouc</font>] preceding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7953;&#965;&#961;&#949;&#952;&#8053;&#963;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;</font> &#8211; &#8220;will not be found&#8221;); or (3) interpretive gymnastics which regards the text as settled but has to do some manipulation to its normal meaning. Bauckham puts forth an excellent case that the third option is to be preferred and that the meaning of the term is virtually the equivalent of &#8220;will be disclosed,&#8221; &#8220;will be manifested.&#8221; (That this meaning is not readily apparent may in fact have been the reason for so many variants and conjectures.) Thus, the force of the clause is that &#8220;the earth and the works [done by men] in it will be stripped bare [before God].&#8221; In addition, the unusualness of the expression is certainly in keeping with the author&#8217;s style throughout this little book. Hence, what looks to be suspect because of its abnormalities, upon closer inspection is actually in keeping with the author&#8217;s stylistic idiosyncrasies. The meaning of the text then is that all but the earth and men&#8217;s works will be destroyed. Everything will be removed so that humanity will stand naked before God. Textually, then, on both external and internal grounds, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8017;&#961;&#949;&#952;&#8053;&#963;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;</font> commends itself as the preferred reading.</p>
