<a name="149"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=201><b>sn</b><i> </i>The Greek verb used in the phrase <i>strive to be found</i> is the same as is found in v. 10, translated &#8220;laid bare.&#8221; In typical Petrine fashion, a conceptual link is made by the same linkage of terms. The point of these two verses thus becomes clear: When the heavens disappear and the earth and its inhabitants are stripped bare before the throne of God, they should strive to make sure that their lives are pure and that they have nothing to hide.</p>
