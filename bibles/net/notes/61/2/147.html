<a name="147"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=116><b>tn</b> This cryptic expression has been variously interpreted. (1) It could involve a simple cognate dative in which case the idea is &#8220;they will be utterly destroyed.&#8221; But the presence of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8182;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">autwn</font>; <i>their, of them</i>) is problematic for this view. Other, more plausible views are: (2) the false teachers will be destroyed at the same time as the irrational beasts, or (3) in the same manner as these creatures (i.e., by being caught); or (4) the false teachers will be destroyed together with the evil angels whom they insult. Because of the difficulties of the text, it was thought best to leave it ambiguous, as the Greek has it.</p>
