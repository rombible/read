<a name="160"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=129><b>tn</b> The Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#966;&#969;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">afwno&quot;</font>) means &#8220;mute, silent&#8221; or &#8220;incapable of speech.&#8221; For reasons of English style the word &#8220;dumb&#8221; was used in the translation. Despite the potential for misunderstanding (since &#8220;dumb&#8221; can refer to a lack of intellectual capability) more dynamic glosses were judged to be inelegant.</p>
