<a name="133"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=102><b>tn</b> The adverbial participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#959;&#955;&#945;&#950;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kolazomenou&quot;</font>) can refer either to contemporaneous time or subsequent time. At stake is the meaning of the following prepositional phrase (<i>at the day of judgment</i> or <i>until the day of judgment</i>). If the participle is contemporaneous, the idea is &#8220;to keep the ungodly<i> in a state of punishment</i> until the day of judgment.&#8221; If subsequent, the meaning is &#8220;to keep the ungodly <i>to be punished</i> at the day of judgment.&#8221; Many commentators/translations opt for the first view, assuming that the present participle cannot be used of subsequent time. However, the present participle is the normal one used for result, and is often used of purpose (cf., e.g., for present participles suggesting result, Mark 9:7; Luke 4:15; John 5:18; Eph 2:15; 2 Pet 2:1, mentioned above; for present participles indicating purpose, note Luke 10:25; John 12:33; Acts 3:26; 2 Pet 2:10 [as even most translations render it]). Further, the context supports this: 2:1-10 forms something of an <i>inclusio</i>, in which the final end of the false teachers is mentioned specifically in v. 1, then as a general principle in v. 9. The point of v. 3 &#8211; that the punishment of the false teachers is certain, even though the sentence has not yet been carried out, is underscored by a participle of purpose in v. 9.</p>
