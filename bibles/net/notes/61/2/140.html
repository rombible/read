<a name="140"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=109><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;insulting.&#8221; The word comes from the same root as the term found in v. 10 (&#8220;insult&#8221;), v. 12 (&#8220;insulting&#8221;), and v. 2 (&#8220;will be slandered&#8221;). The author is fond of building his case by the repetition of a word in a slightly different context so that the readers make the necessary connection. English usage cannot always convey this connection because a given word in one language cannot always be translated the same way in another.</p>
