<a name="181"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">81</span><note=150><b>tn</b> The quotation is a loose rendering of Prov 26:11. This proverb involves a participle that is translated like a finite verb (&#8220;returns&#8221;). In the LXX this line constitutes a subordinate and dependent clause. But since the line has been lifted from its original context, it has been translated as an independent statement.</p>
