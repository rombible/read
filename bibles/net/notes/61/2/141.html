The majority of witnesses (including <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B C P 1739 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>) read the dative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#8048; &#954;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#8179;</font>. The genitive expression suggests that angels would not pronounce a judgment on &#8220;the glorious ones&#8221; <i>from the Lord</i>, while the dative indicates that angels would not pronounce a judgment on &#8220;the glorious ones&#8221; <i>in the presence of the Lord. </i>The parallel in Jude 9 speaks of a reviling judgment against the devil in which the prepositional phrase is entirely absent. At the same time, in that parallel Michael does say, &#8220;The Lord rebuke you.&#8221; (Hence, he is offering something of a judgment <i>from the Lord.</i>) The best options externally are the dative or the omission of the phrase, but a decision is difficult. Internally, the omission may possibly be a motivated reading in that it finds a parallel in Jude 9 (where no prepositional phrase is used). All things considered, the dative is to be preferred, though with much reservation.</p>
