<a name="174"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=143><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;corruption,&#8221; &#8220;depravity.&#8221; Verse 19 constitutes a subordinate clause to v. 18 in Greek. The main verbal components of these two verses are: &#8220;uttering&#8230;they entice&#8230;promising&#8230;being (enslaved).&#8221; The main verb is (<i>they</i>)<i> entice</i>. The three participles are adverbial and seem to indicate an instrumental relation (by uttering), a concessive relation (although promising), and a temporal relation (while being [enslaved]). For the sake of English usage, in the translation of the text this is broken down into two sentences.</p>
