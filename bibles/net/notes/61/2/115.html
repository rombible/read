<a name="115"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=84><b>tn</b> The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#951;&#963;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jamarthsantwn</font>) could either be attributive (&#8220;who sinned&#8221;) or adverbial (&#8220;when they sinned&#8221;). The relation to the judgment of the false teachers in v. 3 suggests that the objects of God&#8217;s judgment are not in question, but the time frame for the execution of justice is. If the participle is taken temporally, the point of comparison is not as acute. The objection that the illustrations following (the flood, Sodom and Gomorrah) are viewed temporally does not mitigate this translation, for in both instances only the time of executing judgment is in view. Further, in both instances the OT notes that God withheld punishment for a long time.</p>
