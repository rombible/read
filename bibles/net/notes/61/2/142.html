<a name="142"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=111><b>tn</b> 2 Pet 2:12 through 16 constitute one cumbersome sentence in Greek. It is difficult to tell whether a hard break belongs in the middle of v. 13, as the translation has it, or whether the compounding of participles is meant in a loosely descriptive sort of way, without strong grammatical connection. Either way, the sentence rambles in a way that often betrays a great &#8220;vehemence of spirit&#8221; (A. T. Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, 435). The author is obviously agitated at these false teachers who are to come.</p>
