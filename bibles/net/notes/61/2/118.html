<a name="118"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=87><b>tc</b> The reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#945;&#8150;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">seirai&quot;</font>, &#8220;chains&#8221;) is found in <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>72</sup> P <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 33 1739 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> vg sy, while <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#953;&#961;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">sirois </font>[or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">seirois</font>], &#8220;pits&#8221;) is found in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A B C 81 <i>pc</i>. The evidence is thus fairly evenly divided. Internally, the reading adopted here (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#945;&#8150;&#962;</font>) is a rarer term, perhaps prompting some scribes to replace it with the more common word. However, this more common term is not a synonym and hence does not follow the normal pattern of scribes. As well, the use of the genitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#950;&#972;&#966;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">zofou</font>) in &#8220;chains of darkness&#8221; is a bit awkward (a rare genitive of place), perhaps prompting some scribes to change the imagery to &#8220;pits of darkness&#8221; (in which case <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#950;&#972;&#966;&#959;&#965;</font> is an attributive genitive). A further point that complicates the issue is the relationship of 2 Peter to Jude. Jude&#8217;s parallel (v. 6) has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#949;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">desmois</font>, &#8220;chains&#8221;). Apart from the issue of whether 2 Peter used Jude or Jude used 2 Peter, this parallel suggests one of two possibilities: either (1) since these two books obviously have a literary relationship, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#945;&#8150;&#962;</font> is original, or (2) early scribes, recognizing that these two books shared their material, changed <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</font> to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#945;&#8150;&#962;</font> to conform the wording, at least conceptually, to Jude 6. On balance, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#945;&#8150;&#962;</font> looks to be original because scribes were not prone to harmonize extensively between books other than the Gospels (although 2 Peter and Jude do display some of this harmonizing). Further, such harmonization is often, if not usually, verbally exact, but <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#949;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</font> is not a variant here.</p>
