<a name="157"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=126><b>tn</b> Although many modern translations (e.g., NASB, TEV, NIV, CEV, NLT) read &#8220;Beor&#8221; here, this is due to harmonization with the OT rather than following a variant textual reading. The Greek text of NA<sup>27</sup> reads &#8220;Bosor,&#8221; an otherwise unattested form of the name of Balaam&#8217;s father.</p>
