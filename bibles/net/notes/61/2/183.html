<a name="183"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">83</span><note=152><b>tn</b> The source of this quotation is uncertain. Heraclitus has often been mentioned as a possible source, but this is doubtful. Other options on the translation of the second line include <i>a sow, having (once) bathed herself (in mud), (returns) to wallowing in the mire</i>, or <i>a sow that washes herself by wallowing in the mire</i> (BDAG 181 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#946;&#972;&#961;&#946;&#959;&#961;&#959;&#962;</font>). The advantage of this last translation is that no verbs need to be supplied for it to make sense. The disadvantage is that in this context it does not make any contribution to the argument. Since the source of the quotation is not known, there is some guesswork involved in the reconstruction. Most commentators prefer a translation similar to the one in the text above.</p>
