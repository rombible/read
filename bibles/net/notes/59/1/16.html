The word for &#8220;man&#8221; or &#8220;individual&#8221; is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#8053;&#961;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anhr</font>), which often means &#8220;male&#8221; or &#8220;man (as opposed to woman).&#8221; But it sometimes is used generically to mean &#8220;anyone,&#8221; &#8220;a person,&#8221; as here (cf. BDAG 79 s.v. 2).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> A <i>double-minded man</i> is one whose devotion to God is less than total. His attention is divided between God and other things, and as a consequence he is unstable and therefore unable to receive from God.</p>
