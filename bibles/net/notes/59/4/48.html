<A NAME="48"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=107><b>tn</b> Interpreters debate the referent of the word &#8220;spirit&#8221; in this verse: (1) The translation takes &#8220;spirit&#8221; to be the lustful capacity within people that produces a divided mind (1:8, 14) and inward conflicts regarding God (4:1-4). God has allowed it to be in man since the fall, and he provides his grace (v. 6) and the new birth through the gospel message (1:18-25) to counteract its evil effects. (2) On the other hand the word &#8220;spirit&#8221; may be taken positively as the Holy Spirit and the sense would be, &#8220;God yearns jealously for the Spirit he caused to live within us.&#8221; But the word for &#8220;envious&#8221; or &#8220;jealous&#8221; is generally negative in biblical usage and the context before and after seems to favor the negative interpretation.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> No OT verse is worded exactly this way. This is either a statement about the general teaching of scripture or a quotation from an ancient translation of the Hebrew text that no longer exists today.</p>
