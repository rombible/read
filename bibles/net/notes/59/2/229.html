<A NAME="229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=61><b>tn</b> There is considerable doubt about where the words of the &#8220;someone&#8221; end and where James&#8217; reply begins. Some see the quotation running to the end of v. 18; others to the end of v. 19. But most punctuate as shown above. The &#8220;someone&#8221; is then an objector, and the sense of his words is something like, &#8220;Some have faith; others have works; don&#8217;t expect everyone to have both.&#8221; James&#8217; reply is that faith cannot exist or be seen without works.</p>
