<A NAME="261"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1067><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;In that day&#8221; (so KJV).</p>
<A NAME="262"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1068><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;his&#8221;; the referent (the Lord) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="263"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1069><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;deliverance he makes walls and a rampart.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="264"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1070><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[one of] firm purpose you will keep [in] peace, peace, for in you he possesses trust.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1461;&#1510;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yetser</font>) refers to what one devises in the mind; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">samukh</font>) probably functions here like an attributive adjective and carries the nuance &#8220;firm.&#8221; So the phrase literally means, &#8220;a firm purpose,&#8221; but as the object of the verb &#8220;keep, guard,&#8221; it must stand by metonymy for the one(s) who possess a firm purpose. In this context the &#8220;righteous nation&#8221; (v. 2) is probably in view and the &#8220;firm purpose&#8221; refers to their unwavering faith in God&#8217;s vindication (see 25:9). In this context <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shalom</font>, &#8220;peace&#8221;), which is repeated for emphasis, likely refers to national security, not emotional or psychological composure (see vv. 1-2). The passive participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">batuakh</font>) expresses a state that results from the subject&#8217;s action.</p>
<A NAME="265"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1071><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;forevermore.&#8221; For other uses of the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1491;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ade-</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ad</font>) see Isa 65:18 and Pss 83:17; 92:7.</p>
<A NAME="266"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1072><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text has &#8220;for in Yah, the Lord, an everlasting rock.&#8221; Some have suggested that the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">beyah</font>, &#8220;in Yah&#8221;) is the result of dittography. A scribe seeing <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497; &#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki yÿhvah</font>) in his original text would somehow have confused the letters and accidentally inserted <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;&#1468;</font> between the words (<font face="Scholar">bet</font> and <font face="Scholar">kaf</font> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;</font>] can be confused in later script phases). A number of English versions retain both divine names for emphasis (ESV, NIV, NKJV, NRSV, NLT). One of the Qumran texts (1QIsa<sup>a</sup>) confirms the MT reading as well.</p>
<A NAME="267"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1073><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;For&#8221; (KJV, ASV, NASB, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="268"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1074><b>tn</b> The translation assumes that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1462;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yashpilennah</font>) goes with the preceding words &#8220;an elevated town,&#8221; and that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yashpilah</font>) belongs with the following words, &#8220;to the ground.&#8221; See J. N. Oswalt, <i>Isaiah</i> (NICOT), 1:469, n. 7.</p>
<A NAME="269"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1075><b>sn</b> The literary structure of chap. 26 is not entirely clear. The chapter begins with an eschatological song of praise and ends with a lament and prophetic response (vv. 16-21). It is not certain where the song of praise ends or how vv. 7-15 fit into the structure. Verses 10-11a seem to lament the presence of evil and v. 11b anticipates the arrival of judgment, so it is possible that vv. 7-15 are a prelude to the lament and announcement that conclude the chapter. </p>
<A NAME="2610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1076><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text has, &#8220;upright, the path of the righteous you make level.&#8221; There are three possible ways to translate this line. Some take <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yashar</font>) as a divine title: &#8220;O Upright One&#8221; (cf. NASB, NIV, NKJV, NRSV, NLT). Others regard <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;</font> as the result of dittography (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; &#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512; &#1463;&#1502;&#1506;&#1456;&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mesharim yashar ma</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">gal</font>) and do not include it in the translation. Another possibility is to keep <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;</font> and render the line as &#8220;the path of the righteous that you prepare is straight.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The metaphor of a level/smooth road/path may refer to their morally upright manner of life (see v. 8a), but verse 7b, which attributes the smooth path to the Lord, suggests that the Lord&#8217;s vindication and blessing may be the reality behind the metaphor here.</p>
<A NAME="2611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1077><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has, &#8220;yes, the way of your judgments.&#8221; The translation assumes that &#8220;way&#8221; is related to the verb &#8220;we wait&#8221; as an adverbial accusative (&#8220;in the way of your judgments we wait&#8221;). <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1496;&#1462;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mishpatekha</font>, &#8220;your judgments&#8221;) could refer to the Lord&#8217;s commandments, in which case one might translate, &#8220;as we obey your commands.&#8221; However, in verse 9 the same form refers to divine acts of judgment on evildoers.</p>
<A NAME="2612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1078><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;your name and your remembrance [is] the desire of [our?] being.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1079><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;with my soul I.&#8221; This is a figure for the speaker himself (&#8220;I&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="2614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1080><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;long for, desire.&#8221; The speaker acknowledges that he is eager to see God come in judgment (see vv. 8, 9b).</p>
<A NAME="2615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1081><b>tn</b> The translation understands <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1462;&#1491;&#1462;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsedeq</font>) in the sense of &#8220;justice,&#8221; but it is possible that it carries the nuance &#8220;righteousness,&#8221; in which case one might translate, &#8220;those who live in the world learn to live in a righteous manner&#8221; (cf. NCV).</p>
<A NAME="2616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1082><b>tn</b> As in verse 9b, the translation understands <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1462;&#1491;&#1462;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsedeq</font>) in the sense of &#8220;justice,&#8221; but it is possible that it carries the nuance &#8220;righteousness,&#8221; in which case one might translate, &#8220;they do not learn to live in a righteous manner.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1083><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;in a land of uprightness they act unjustly&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;they deal perversely.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1084><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;O Lord, your hand is lifted up.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1085><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;They will see and be ashamed of zeal of people.&#8221; Some take the prefixed verbs as jussives and translate the statement as a prayer, &#8220;Let them see and be put to shame.&#8221; The meaning of the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qin</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">at-</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">am</font>, &#8220;zeal of people&#8221;) is unclear. The translation assumes that this refers to God&#8217;s angry judgment upon people. Another option is to understand the phrase as referring to God&#8217;s zealous, protective love of his covenant people. In this case one might translate, &#8220;by your zealous devotion to your people.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1086><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;yes, fire, your enemies, will consume them.&#8221; Many understand the prefixed verb form to be jussive and translate, &#8220;let [fire] consume&#8221; (cf. NAB, NIV, NRSV). The <i>mem</i> suffixed to the verb may be enclitic; if a pronominal suffix, it refers back to &#8220;your enemies.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1087><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;O Lord, you establish peace for us.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1088><b>tc</b> Some suggest emending <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gam kol</font>, &#8220;even all&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1502;&#1467;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kigmul</font>, &#8220;according to the deed[s] of&#8221;) One might then translate &#8220;for according to what our deeds deserve, you have acted on our behalf.&#8221; Nevertheless, accepting the MT as it stands, the prophet affirms that Yahweh deserved all the credit for anything Israel had accomplished.</p>
<A NAME="2623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1089><b>sn</b> In light of what is said in verse 14b, the &#8220;dead&#8221; here may be the &#8220;masters&#8221; mentioned in verse 13.</p>
<A NAME="2624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1090><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lakhen</font>) normally indicates a cause-effect relationship between what precedes and follows and is translated, &#8220;therefore.&#8221; Here, however, it infers the cause from the effect and brings out what is implicit in the previous statement. See BDB 487 s.v.</p>
<A NAME="2625"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1091><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;visited [for harm]&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV); NAB, NRSV &#8220;you have punished.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2626"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1092><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;you have added to the nation.&#8221; The last line of the verse suggests that geographical expansion is in view. &#8220;The nation&#8221; is Judah. </p>
<A NAME="2627"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1093><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;brought honor to yourself.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2628"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1094><b>tn</b> The meaning of this verse is unclear. It appears to read literally, &#8220;O Lord, in distress they visit you, they pour out [?] an incantation, your discipline to them.&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">paqad</font>) may here carry the sense of &#8220;seek with interest&#8221; (cf. Ezek 23:21 and BDB 823 s.v.) or &#8220;seek in vain&#8221; (cf. Isa 34:16), but it is peculiar for the Lord to be the object of this verb. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsaqun</font>) may be a Qal perfect third plural form from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsuq</font>, &#8220;pour out, melt&#8221;), though the verb is not used of pouring out words in its two other occurrences. Because of the appearance of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsar</font>, &#8220;distress&#8221;) in the preceding line, it is tempting to emend the form to a noun and derive it from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;</font> (&#8220;be in distress&#8221;) The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lakhash</font>) elsewhere refers to an incantation (Isa 3:3; Jer 8:17; Eccl 10:11) or amulet (Isa 3:20). Perhaps here it refers to ritualistic prayers or to magical incantations used to ward off evil. </p>
<A NAME="2629"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1095><b>tn</b> On the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kÿmo</font>, &#8220;like, as&#8221;) here, see BDB 455 s.v. Israel&#8217;s distress and suffering, likened here to the pains of childbirth, seemed to be for no purpose. A woman in labor endures pain with the hope that a child will be born; in Israel&#8217;s case no such positive outcome was apparent. The nation was like a woman who strains to bring forth a child, but can&#8217;t push the baby through to daylight. All her effort produces nothing. </p>
<A NAME="2630"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1096><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and the inhabitants of the world do not fall.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nafal</font>) apparently means here, &#8220;be born,&#8221; though the Qal form of the verb is not used with this nuance anywhere else in the OT. (The Hiphil appears to be used in the sense of &#8220;give birth&#8221; in v. 19, however.) The implication of verse 18b seems to be that Israel hoped its suffering would somehow end in deliverance and an increase in population. The phrase &#8220;inhabitants of the world&#8221; seems to refer to the human race in general, but the next verse, which focuses on Israel&#8217;s dead, suggests the referent may be more limited. </p>
<A NAME="2631"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1097><b>sn</b> At this point the Lord (or prophet) gives the people an encouraging oracle.</p>
<A NAME="2632"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1098><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;dust&#8221; (so KJV, NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="2633"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1099><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for the dew of lights [is] your dew.&#8221; The pronominal suffix on &#8220;dew&#8221; is masculine singular, like the suffixes on &#8220;your dead&#8221; and &#8220;your corpses&#8221; in the first half of the verse. The statement, then, is addressed to collective Israel, the speaker in verse 18. The plural form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">orot</font>) is probably a plural of respect or magnitude, meaning &#8220;bright light&#8221; (i.e., morning&#8217;s light). Dew is a symbol of fertility and life. Here Israel&#8217;s &#8220;dew,&#8221; as it were, will soak the dust of the ground and cause the corpses of the dead to spring up to new life, like plants sprouting up from well-watered soil. </p>
<A NAME="2634"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1100><b>sn</b> It is not certain whether the resurrection envisioned here is intended to be literal or figurative. A comparison with 25:8 and Dan 12:2 suggests a literal interpretation, but Ezek 37:1-14 uses resurrection as a metaphor for deliverance from exile and the restoration of the nation (see Isa 27:12-13).</p>
<A NAME="2635"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1101><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;until anger passes by.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2636"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1102><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;out of his place&#8221; (so KJV, ASV).</p>
<A NAME="2637"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1103><b>sn</b> This implies that rampant bloodshed is one of the reasons for divine judgment. See the note at 24:5. </p>
