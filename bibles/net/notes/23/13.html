<A NAME="131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=586><b>sn</b> Isa 13-23 contains a series of judgment oracles against various nations. It is likely that Israel, not the nations mentioned, actually heard these oracles. The oracles probably had a twofold purpose. For those leaders who insisted on getting embroiled in international politics, these oracles were a reminder that Judah need not fear foreign nations or seek international alliances for security reasons. For the righteous remnant within the nation, these oracles were a reminder that Israel&#8217;s God was indeed the sovereign ruler of the earth, worthy of his people&#8217;s trust.</p>

<A NAME="137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=592><b>sn</b> In vv. 4-10 the prophet appears to be speaking, since the Lord is referred to in the third person. However, since the Lord refers to himself in the third person later in this chapter (see v. 13), it is possible that he speaks throughout the chapter. </p>

<A NAME="1312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=597><b>tn</b> Or perhaps, &#8220;land&#8221; (so KJV, NAB, NASB, NLT). Even though the heading and subsequent context (see v. 17) indicate Babylon&#8217;s judgment is in view, the chapter has a cosmic flavor that suggests that the coming judgment is universal in scope. Perhaps Babylon&#8217;s downfall occurs in conjunction with a wider judgment, or the cosmic style is poetic hyperbole used to emphasize the magnitude and importance of the coming event.</p>
<A NAME="1313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=598><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the day of the Lord&#8221; (so KJV, NAB).</p>
<A NAME="1314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=599><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;like destruction from the sovereign judge it comes.&#8221; The comparative preposition (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kÿ</font>) has here the rhetorical nuance, &#8220;in every way like.&#8221; The point is that the destruction unleashed will have all the earmarks of divine judgment. One could paraphrase, &#8220;it comes as only destructive divine judgment can.&#8221; On this use of the preposition in general, see GKC 376 §118.<i>x</i>.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The divine name used here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shaddai</font>, &#8220;Shaddai&#8221;). Shaddai (or El Shaddai) is the sovereign king/judge of the world who grants life/blesses and kills/judges. In Genesis he blesses the patriarchs with fertility and promises numerous descendants. Outside Genesis he both blesses/protects and takes away life/happiness. The patriarchs knew God primarily as El Shaddai (Exod 6:3). While the origin and meaning of this name is uncertain (see discussion below) its significance is clear. The name is used in contexts where God appears as the source of fertility and life. In Gen 17:1-8 he appears to Abram, introduces himself as El Shaddai, and announces his intention to make the patriarch fruitful. In the role of El Shaddai God repeats these words (now elevated to the status of a decree) to Jacob (35:11). Earlier Isaac had pronounced a blessing upon Jacob in which he asked El Shaddai to make Jacob fruitful (28:3). Jacob later prays that his sons will be treated with mercy when they return to Egypt with Benjamin (43:14). The fertility theme is not as apparent here, though one must remember that Jacob viewed Benjamin as the sole remaining son of the favored and once-barren Rachel (cf. 29:31; 30:22-24; 35:16-18). It is quite natural that he would appeal to El Shaddai to preserve Benjamin&#8217;s life, for it was El Shaddai&#8217;s miraculous power which made it possible for Rachel to give him sons in the first place. In 48:3 Jacob, prior to blessing Joseph&#8217;s sons, tells him how El Shaddai appeared to him at Bethel (cf. chapter 28) and promised to make him fruitful. When blessing Joseph on his deathbed Jacob refers to Shaddai (we should probably read &#8220;El Shaddai,&#8221; along with a few Hebrew <sc>mss, the Samaritan Pentateuch, LXX, and Syriac) as the one who provides abundant blessings, including &#8220;blessings of the breast and womb&#8221; (49:25). (The direct association of the name with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</font> [<font face="Scholar">shadayim</font>, &#8220;breasts&#8221;] suggests the name might mean &#8220;the one of the breast&#8221; [i.e., the one who gives fertility], but the juxtaposition is probably better explained as wordplay. Note the wordplay involving the name and the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1491;</font> [<font face="Scholar">shadad</font>, &#8220;destroy&#8221;] here in Isa 13:6 and in Joel 1:15.) Outside Genesis the name Shaddai (minus El, &#8220;God&#8221;) is normally used when God is viewed as the sovereign king who blesses/protects or curses/brings judgment. The name appears in the introduction to two of Balaam&#8217;s oracles (Num 24:4, 16) of blessing upon Israel. Naomi employs the name when accusing the Lord of treating her bitterly by taking the lives of her husband and sons (Ruth 1:20-21). In Ps 68:14; Isa 13:6; and Joel 1:15 Shaddai judges his enemies through warfare, while Ps 91:1 depicts him as the protector of his people. (In Ezek 1:24 and 10:5 the sound of the cherubs&#8217; wings is compared to Shaddai&#8217;s powerful voice. The reference may be to the mighty divine warrior&#8217;s battle cry which accompanies his angry judgment.) Last but not least, the name occurs 31 times in the Book of Job. Job and his &#8220;friends&#8221; assume that Shaddai is the sovereign king of the world (11:7; 37:23a) who is the source of life (33:4b) and is responsible for maintaining justice (8:3; 34:10-12; 37:23b). He provides abundant blessings, including children (22:17-18; 29:4-6), but can also discipline, punish, and destroy (5:17; 6:4; 21:20; 23:16). It is not surprising to see the name so often in this book, where the theme of God&#8217;s justice is primary and even called into question (24:1; 27:2). The most likely proposal is that the name means &#8220;God, the one of the mountain&#8221; (an Akkadian cognate means &#8220;mountain,&#8221; to which Heb. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1491;</font> [<font face="Scholar">shad</font>, &#8220;breast&#8221;] is probably related). For a discussion of proposed derivations see T. N. D. Mettinger, <i>In Search of God</i>, 70-71. The name may originally depict God as the sovereign judge who, in Canaanite style, rules from a sacred mountain. Isa 14:13 and Ezek 28:14, 16 associate such a mountain with God, while Ps 48:2 refers to Zion as &#8220;Zaphon,&#8221; the Canaanite Olympus from which the high god El ruled. (In Isa 14 the Canaanite god El may be in view. Note that Isaiah pictures pagan kings as taunting the king of Babylon, suggesting that pagan mythology may provide the background for the language and imagery.)</p>

The use of &#8220;widows&#8221; may represent an intentional wordplay on &#8220;fortresses,&#8221; indicating that the fortresses are like dejected widows (J. N.

<A NAME="1352"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=637><b>sn</b> When was the prophecy of Babylon&#8217;s fall fulfilled? Some argue that the prophecy was fulfilled in 689 <sc>b.c. when the Assyrians under Sennacherib sacked and desecrated the city (this event is alluded to in 23:13). This may have been an initial phase in the fulfillment of the prophecy, but the reference to the involvement of the Medes (v. 17) and the suggestion that Babylon&#8217;s demise will bring about the restoration of Israel (14:1-2) indicate that the fall of Babylon to the Medes and Persians in 538 <sc>b.c. is the primary focus of the prophecy. (After all, the Lord did reveal to Isaiah that the Chaldeans [not the Assyrians] would someday conquer Jerusalem and take the people into exile [see 39:5-7].) However, the vivid picture of destruction in vv. 15-22 raises a problem. The Medes and Persians did not destroy the city; in fact Cyrus&#8217; takeover of Babylon, though preceded by a military campaign, was relatively peaceful and even welcomed by some Babylonian religious officials. How then does one explain the prophecy&#8217;s description of the city&#8217;s violent fall? As noted above, the events of 689 <sc>b.c. and 538 <sc>b.c. may have been merged in the prophecy. However, it is more likely that the language is stylized and exaggerated for rhetorical effect. See Isa 34:11-15; Jer 50:39-40 (describing Babylon&#8217;s fall in 538 <sc>b.c.); 51:36-37 (describing Babylon&#8217;s fall in 538 <sc>b.c.); Zeph 2:13-15; the extra-biblical Sefire treaty curses; and Ashurbanipal&#8217;s description of the destruction of Elam in his royal annals. In other words, the events of 538 <sc>b.c. essentially, though not necessarily literally, fulfill the prophecy.</p>
