<A NAME="2433"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1008><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text reads literally, &#8220;in the lights,&#8221; interpreted by some to mean &#8220;in the region of light,&#8221; referring to the east. Some scholars have suggested the emendation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1467;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">urim</font>) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497; &#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">iyyey hayyam</font>, &#8220;along the seacoasts&#8221;), a phrase that is repeated in the next line. In this case, the two lines form synonymous parallelism. If one retains the MT reading (as above), &#8220;in the east&#8221; and &#8220;along the seacoasts&#8221; depict the two ends of the earth to refer to all the earth (as a merism).</p>
