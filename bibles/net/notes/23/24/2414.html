<A NAME="2414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=989><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;everlasting covenant&#8221; (KJV, NASB, NIV, NRSV, NLT); NAB &#8220;the ancient covenant&#8221;; CEV &#8220;their agreement that was to last forever.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> For a lengthy discussion of the identity of this covenant/treaty, see R. Chisholm, &#8220;The &#8216;Everlasting Covenant&#8217; and the &#8216;City of Chaos&#8217;: Intentional Ambiguity and Irony in Isaiah 24,&#8221; <i>CTR</i> 6 (1993): 237-53. In this context, where judgment comes upon both the pagan nations and God&#8217;s covenant community, the phrase &#8220;permanent treaty&#8221; is intentionally ambiguous. For the nations this treaty is the Noahic mandate of Gen 9:1-7 with its specific stipulations and central regulation (Gen 9:7). By shedding blood, the warlike nations violated this treaty, which promotes population growth and prohibits murder. For Israel, which was also guilty of bloodshed (see Isa 1:15, 21; 4:4), this &#8220;permanent treaty&#8221; would refer more specifically to the Mosaic Law and its regulations prohibiting murder (Exod 20:13; Num 35:6-34), which are an extension of the Noahic mandate. </p>
