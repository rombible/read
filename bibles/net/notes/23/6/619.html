<A NAME="619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=297><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;a holy offspring [is] its sacred pillar.&#8221; If <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">matsevet</font>) is taken as &#8220;stump,&#8221; one can see in this statement a brief glimpse of hope. The tree (the nation) is chopped down, but the stump (a righteous remnant) remains from which God can restore the nation. However, if <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1514;</font> is taken as &#8220;sacred pillar&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1462;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">matsevah;</font> see the previous note), it is much more difficult to take the final statement in a positive sense. In this case &#8220;holy offspring&#8221; alludes to God&#8217;s ideal for his covenant people, the offspring of the patriarchs. Ironically that &#8220;holy&#8221; nation is more like a &#8220;sacred pillar&#8221; and it will be thrown down like a sacred pillar from a high place and its land destroyed like the sacred trees located at such shrines. Understood in this way, the ironic statement is entirely negative in tone, just like the rest of the preceding announcement of judgment. It also reminds the people of their failure; they did not oppose pagan religion, instead they embraced it. Now they will be destroyed in the same way they should have destroyed paganism. </p>
