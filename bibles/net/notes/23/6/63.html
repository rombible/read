<A NAME="63"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=281><b>tn</b> Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">saraf</font>, &#8220;seraph&#8221;) literally means &#8220;burning one,&#8221; perhaps suggesting that these creatures had a fiery appearance (cf. TEV, CEV &#8220;flaming creatures&#8221;; NCV &#8220;heavenly creatures of fire&#8221;). Elsewhere in the OT the word &#8220;seraph&#8221; refers to poisonous snakes (Num 21:6; Deut 8:15; Isa 14:29; 30:6). Perhaps they were called &#8220;burning ones&#8221; because of their appearance or the effect of their venomous bites, which would cause a victim to burn up with fever. It is possible that the seraphs seen by Isaiah were at least partially serpentine in appearance. Though it might seem strange for a snake-like creature to have wings, two of the texts where &#8220;seraphs&#8221; are snakes describe them as &#8220;flying&#8221; (Isa 14:29; 30:6), perhaps referring to their darting movements. See the note at 14:29.</p>
