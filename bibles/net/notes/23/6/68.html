<A NAME="68"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=286><b>tn</b> Isaiah uses the suffixed (perfect) form of the verb for rhetorical purposes. In this way his destruction is described as occurring or as already completed. Rather than understanding the verb as derived from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">damah</font>, &#8220;be destroyed&#8221;), some take it from a proposed homonymic root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1502;&#1492;</font>, which would mean &#8220;be silent.&#8221; In this case, one might translate, &#8220;I must be silent.&#8221;</p>
