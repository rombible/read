<A NAME="725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=322><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the young woman.&#8221; The Hebrew article has been rendered as a demonstrative pronoun (&#8220;this&#8221;) in the translation to bring out its force. It is very likely that Isaiah pointed to a woman who was present at the scene of the prophet&#8217;s interview with Ahaz. Isaiah&#8217;s address to the &#8220;house of David&#8221; and his use of second plural forms suggests other people were present, and his use of the second feminine singular verb form (&#8220;you will name&#8221;) later in the verse is best explained if addressed to a woman who is present. </p>
