<A NAME="712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=309><b>tn</b> This sentence opens with the conjunction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503; &#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">an ki</font>, &#8220;because&#8221;). Consequently some take vv. 5-6 with what precedes, as another reason why Ahaz might be tempted to fear (see v. 4). However, it is more likely that vv. 5-6 give the basis for the Lord&#8217;s announcement in vv. 7-9. The conjunction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503; &#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> here introduces the basis for judgment (as in 3:16; 8:6; 29:13), which is then followed by the formal announcement of judgment.</p>
