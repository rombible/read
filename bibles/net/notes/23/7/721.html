<A NAME="721"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=318><b>tn</b> The verb is second plural in form, because the prophet addresses the whole family of David. He continues to use the plural in v. 14 (with one exception, see the notes on that verse), but then switches back to the second singular (addressing Ahaz specifically) in vv. 16-17.</p>
