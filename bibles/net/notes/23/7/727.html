<A NAME="727"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=324><b>tn</b> Elsewhere the adjective <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">harah</font>), when used predicatively, refers to a past pregnancy (from the narrator&#8217;s perspective, 1 Sam 4:19), to a present condition (Gen 16:11; 38:24; 2 Sam 11:5), and to a conception that is about to occur in the near future (Judg 13:5, 7). (There is some uncertainty about the interpretation of Judg 13:5, 7, however. See the notes to those verses.) In Isa 7:14 one could translate, &#8220;the young woman is pregnant.&#8221; In this case the woman is probably a member of the royal family. Another option, the one followed in the present translation, takes the adjective in an imminent future sense, &#8220;the young woman is about to conceive.&#8221; In this case the woman could be a member of the royal family, or, more likely, the prophetess with whom Isaiah has sexual relations shortly after this (see 8:3). </p>
