<A NAME="726"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=323><b>tn</b> Traditionally, &#8220;virgin.&#8221; Because this verse from Isaiah is quoted in Matt 1:23 in connection with Jesus&#8217; birth, the Isaiah passage has been regarded since the earliest Christian times as a prophecy of Christ&#8217;s virgin birth. Much debate has taken place over the best way to translate this Hebrew term, although ultimately one&#8217;s view of the doctrine of the virgin birth of Christ is unaffected. Though the Hebrew word used here (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">almah</font>) can sometimes refer to a woman who is a virgin (Gen 24:43), it does not carry this meaning inherently. The word is simply the feminine form of the corresponding masculine noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elem</font>, &#8220;young man&#8221;; cf. 1 Sam 17:56; 20:22). The Aramaic and Ugaritic cognate terms are both used of women who are not virgins. The word seems to pertain to age, not sexual experience, and would normally be translated &#8220;young woman.&#8221; The LXX translator(s) who later translated the Book of Isaiah into Greek sometime between the second and first century <sc>b.c., however, rendered the Hebrew term by the more specific Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">parqenos</font>), which does mean &#8220;virgin&#8221; in a technical sense. This is the Greek term that also appears in the citation of Isa 7:14 in Matt 1:23. Therefore, regardless of the meaning of the term in the OT context, in the NT Matthew&#8217;s usage of the Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> clearly indicates that from his perspective a virgin birth has taken place.</p>
