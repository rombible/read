<A NAME="724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=321><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ot</font>, &#8220;sign&#8221;) can refer to a miraculous event (see v. 11), but it does not carry this sense inherently. Elsewhere in Isaiah the word usually refers to a natural occurrence or an object/person vested with special significance (see 8:18; 19:20; 20:3; 37:30; 55:13; 66:19). Only in 38:7-8, 22 does it refer to a miraculous deed that involves suspending or overriding natural laws. The sign outlined in vv. 14-17 involves God&#8217;s providential control over events and their timing, but not necessarily miraculous intervention. </p>
