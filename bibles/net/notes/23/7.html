<A NAME="73"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=300><b>tn</b> Or perhaps, &#8220;but they were unable to attack it.&#8221; This statement sounds like a summary of the whole campaign. The following context explains why they were unable to defeat the southern kingdom. The parallel passage (2 Kgs 16:5; cf. Num 22:11; 1 Sam 17:9 for a similar construction) affirms that Syria and Israel besieged Ahaz. Consequently, the statement that &#8220;they were not able to battle against them&#8221; must refer to the inability to conquer Ahaz.</p>

Consequently some take vv. 5-6 with what precedes, as another reason why Ahaz might be tempted to fear (see v. 4). However, it is more likely that vv. 5-6 give the basis for the Lord&#8217;s announcement in vv. 7-9. The conjunction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503; &#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> here introduces the basis for judgment (as in 3:16; 8:6; 29:13), which is then followed by the formal announcement of judgment.</p>

<A NAME="715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=312><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term translated &#8220;sovereign master&#8221; here and in vv. 14, 19 is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adonay</font>).</p>
<A NAME="716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=313><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Ephraim will be too shattered to be a nation&#8221;; NIV &#8220;to be a people.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This statement is problematic for several reasons. It seems to intrude stylistically, interrupting the symmetry of the immediately preceding and following lines. Furthermore, such a long range prophecy lacks punch in the midst of the immediate crisis. After all, even if Israel were destroyed sometime within the next 65 years, a lot could still happen during that time, including the conquest of Judah and the demise of the Davidic family. Finally the significance of the time frame is uncertain. Israel became an Assyrian province within the next 15 years and ceased to exist as a nation. For these reasons many regard the statement as a later insertion, but why a later editor would include the reference to &#8220;65 years&#8221; remains a mystery. Some try to relate the prophecy to the events alluded to in Ezra 4:2, 10, which refers to how the Assyrian kings Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal settled foreigners in former Israelite territory, perhaps around 670 <sc>b.c. However, even if the statement is referring to these events, it lacks rhetorical punch in its immediate context and has the earmarks of a later commentary that has been merged with the text in the process of transmission.</p>
<A NAME="717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=314><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;if you do not believe, you will not endure.&#8221; The verb forms are second plural; the Lord here addresses the entire Davidic family and court. (Verse 4 was addressed to the king.) There is a wordplay in the Hebrew text, designed to draw attention to the alternatives set before the king (cf. 1:20). &#8220;Believe&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1463;&#1488;&#1459;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ta</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aminu</font>) is a Hiphil form of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aman</font>); &#8220;endure&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1461;&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1461;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</font>, <font face="Scholar">te</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amenu</font>) is a Niphal form of this same verb.</p>
<A NAME="718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=315><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Make it as deep as Sheol or make it high upwards.&#8221; These words suggest that Ahaz can feel free to go beyond the bounds of ordinary human experience. </p>
<A NAME="719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=316><b>tn</b> Ahaz uses the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nasah</font>, &#8220;test&#8221;) in its negative sense of &#8220;challenge, provoke.&#8221; However, this is false piety, a smokescreen designed to cover up his lack of faith in the Lord.</p>
<A NAME="720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=317><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and he said.&#8221; The subject is unexpressed, but the reference to &#8220;my God&#8221; at the end of the verse indicates the prophet is speaking. </p>
<A NAME="721"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=318><b>tn</b> The verb is second plural in form, because the prophet addresses the whole family of David. He continues to use the plural in v. 14 (with one exception, see the notes on that verse), but then switches back to the second singular (addressing Ahaz specifically) in vv. 16-17.</p>
<A NAME="722"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=319><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;house.&#8221; See the note at v. 2.</p>
<A NAME="723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=320><b>sn</b> The address to the &#8220;house of David&#8221; is designed to remind Ahaz and his royal court of the protection promised to them through the Davidic covenant. The king&#8217;s refusal to claim God&#8217;s promise magnifies his lack of faith.</p>
<A NAME="724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=321><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ot</font>, &#8220;sign&#8221;) can refer to a miraculous event (see v. 11), but it does not carry this sense inherently. Elsewhere in Isaiah the word usually refers to a natural occurrence or an object/person vested with special significance (see 8:18; 19:20; 20:3; 37:30; 55:13; 66:19). Only in 38:7-8, 22 does it refer to a miraculous deed that involves suspending or overriding natural laws. The sign outlined in vv. 14-17 involves God&#8217;s providential control over events and their timing, but not necessarily miraculous intervention. </p>
<A NAME="725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=322><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the young woman.&#8221; The Hebrew article has been rendered as a demonstrative pronoun (&#8220;this&#8221;) in the translation to bring out its force. It is very likely that Isaiah pointed to a woman who was present at the scene of the prophet&#8217;s interview with Ahaz. Isaiah&#8217;s address to the &#8220;house of David&#8221; and his use of second plural forms suggests other people were present, and his use of the second feminine singular verb form (&#8220;you will name&#8221;) later in the verse is best explained if addressed to a woman who is present. </p>
<A NAME="726"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=323><b>tn</b> Traditionally, &#8220;virgin.&#8221; Because this verse from Isaiah is quoted in Matt 1:23 in connection with Jesus&#8217; birth, the Isaiah passage has been regarded since the earliest Christian times as a prophecy of Christ&#8217;s virgin birth. Much debate has taken place over the best way to translate this Hebrew term, although ultimately one&#8217;s view of the doctrine of the virgin birth of Christ is unaffected. Though the Hebrew word used here (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">almah</font>) can sometimes refer to a woman who is a virgin (Gen 24:43), it does not carry this meaning inherently. The word is simply the feminine form of the corresponding masculine noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elem</font>, &#8220;young man&#8221;; cf. 1 Sam 17:56; 20:22). The Aramaic and Ugaritic cognate terms are both used of women who are not virgins. The word seems to pertain to age, not sexual experience, and would normally be translated &#8220;young woman.&#8221; The LXX translator(s) who later translated the Book of Isaiah into Greek sometime between the second and first century <sc>b.c., however, rendered the Hebrew term by the more specific Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">parqenos</font>), which does mean &#8220;virgin&#8221; in a technical sense. This is the Greek term that also appears in the citation of Isa 7:14 in Matt 1:23. Therefore, regardless of the meaning of the term in the OT context, in the NT Matthew&#8217;s usage of the Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> clearly indicates that from his perspective a virgin birth has taken place.</p>
<A NAME="727"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=324><b>tn</b> Elsewhere the adjective <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">harah</font>), when used predicatively, refers to a past pregnancy (from the narrator&#8217;s perspective, 1 Sam 4:19), to a present condition (Gen 16:11; 38:24; 2 Sam 11:5), and to a conception that is about to occur in the near future (Judg 13:5, 7). (There is some uncertainty about the interpretation of Judg 13:5, 7, however. See the notes to those verses.) In Isa 7:14 one could translate, &#8220;the young woman is pregnant.&#8221; In this case the woman is probably a member of the royal family. Another option, the one followed in the present translation, takes the adjective in an imminent future sense, &#8220;the young woman is about to conceive.&#8221; In this case the woman could be a member of the royal family, or, more likely, the prophetess with whom Isaiah has sexual relations shortly after this (see 8:3). </p>
<A NAME="728"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=325><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and you will call his name.&#8221; The words &#8220;young lady&#8221; are supplied in the translation to clarify the identity of the addressee. The verb is normally taken as an archaic third feminine singular form here, and translated, &#8220;she will call.&#8221; However the form (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">qara</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">t</font>) is more naturally understood as second feminine singular, in which case the words would be addressed to the young woman mentioned just before this. In the three other occurrences of the third feminine singular perfect of I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qara</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to call&#8221;), the form used is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qar</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>; see Gen 29:35; 30:6; 1 Chr 4:9). A third feminine singular perfect <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1514;</font> does appear in Deut 31:29 and Jer 44:23, but the verb here is the homonym II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (&#8220;to meet, encounter&#8221;). The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1514;</font> (from I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;</font>, &#8220;to call&#8221;) appears in three other passages (Gen 16:11; Isa 60:18; Jer 3:4 [<i>Qere</i>]) and in each case is second feminine singular.</p>
<A NAME="729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=326><b>sn</b> The name <i>Immanuel</i> means &#8220;God [is] with us.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="730"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=327><b>tn</b> Or, perhaps &#8220;cream,&#8221; frequently, &#8220;curds&#8221; (NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV, NLT); KJV, ASV &#8220;butter&#8221;; CEV &#8220;yogurt.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="731"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=328><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;for his knowing.&#8221; Traditionally the preposition has been translated in a temporal sense, &#8220;when he knows.&#8221; However, though the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lamed</font>) can sometimes have a temporal force, it never carries such a nuance in any of the 40 other passages where it is used with the infinitive construct of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yada</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to know&#8221;). Most often the construction indicates purpose/result. This sense is preferable here. The following context indicates that sour milk and honey will epitomize the devastation that God&#8217;s judgment will bring upon the land. Cultivated crops will be gone and the people will be forced to live off the milk produced by their goats and the honey they find in the thickets. As the child is forced to eat a steady diet of this sour milk and honey, he will be reminded of the consequences of sin and motivated to make correct moral decisions in order to avoid further outbreaks of divine discipline. </p>
<A NAME="732"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=329><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;for, because.&#8221; The particle introduces the entire following context (vv. 16-25), which explains why Immanuel will be an appropriate name for the child, why he will eat sour milk and honey, and why experiencing such a diet will contribute to his moral development.</p>
<A NAME="733"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=330><b>sn</b> Since &#8220;two kings&#8221; are referred to later in the verse, the &#8220;land&#8221; must here refer to Syria-Israel.</p>
<A NAME="734"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=331><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the land will be abandoned, which you fear because of its two kings.&#8221; After the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">quts</font>, &#8220;loathe, dread&#8221;) the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mipney</font>, &#8220;from before&#8221;) introduces the cause of loathing/dread (see Gen 27:46; Exod 1:12; Num 22:3).</p>
<A NAME="735"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=332><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;days&#8221; (so KJV, NAB); NASB, NRSV &#8220;such days.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="736"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=333><b>sn</b> Initially the prophecy appears to be a message of salvation. Immanuel seems to have a positive ring to it, sour milk and honey elsewhere symbolize prosperity and blessing (see Deut 32:13-14; Job 20:17), verse 16 announces the defeat of Judah&#8217;s enemies, and verse 17a could be taken as predicting a return to the glorious days of David and Solomon. However, the message turns sour in verses 17b-25. God will be with his people in judgment, as well as salvation. The curds and honey will be signs of deprivation, not prosperity, the relief announced in verse 16 will be short-lived, and the new era will be characterized by unprecedented humiliation, not a return to glory. Because of Ahaz&#8217;s refusal to trust the Lord, potential blessing would be transformed into a curse, just as Isaiah turns an apparent prophecy of salvation into a message of judgment. Because the words &#8220;the king of Assyria&#8221; are rather awkwardly tacked on to the end of the sentence, some regard them as a later addition. However, the very awkwardness facilitates the prophet&#8217;s rhetorical strategy here, as he suddenly turns what sounds like a positive message into a judgment speech. Actually, &#8220;the king of Assyria,&#8221; stands in apposition to the earlier object &#8220;days,&#8221; and specifies who the main character of these coming &#8220;days&#8221; will be.</p>

<A NAME="738"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=335><b>sn</b> Swarming flies are irritating; bees are irritating and especially dangerous because of the pain they inflict with their sting (see Deut 1:44; Ps 118:12). The metaphors are well chosen, for the Assyrians (symbolized by the bees) were much more powerful and dangerous than the Egyptians (symbolized by the flies). Nevertheless both would put pressure on Judah, for Egypt wanted Judah as a buffer state against Assyrian aggression, while Assyrian wanted it as a base for operations against Egypt. Following the reference to sour milk and honey, the metaphor is especially apt, for flies are attracted to dairy products and bees can be found in the vicinity of honey. </p>

How would this situation come about and how would it constitute a sign? Before this situation developed, the Israelites and Syrians would be defeated. But then the Lord would usher in a period of time unlike any since the division of the kingdom almost 200 years before. The Assyrians would overrun the land, destroy the crops, and force the people to subsist on goats&#8217; milk and honey. At that time, as the people saw Immanuel eating his sour milk and honey, the Davidic family would be forced to acknowledge that God was indeed with them. He was present with them in the Syrian-Israelite crisis, fully capable of rescuing them; but he was also present with them in judgment, disciplining them for their lack of trust. The moral of the story is quite clear: Failure to appropriate God&#8217;s promises by faith can turn potential blessing into disciplinary judgment.</p>
