<A NAME="4240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1823><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Who is blind but my servant, and deaf like my messenger I send? Who is blind like my commissioned one, blind like the servant of the Lord?&#8221; The point of the rhetorical questions is that no one is as blind/deaf as this servant. In this context the Lord&#8217;s &#8220;servant&#8221; is exiled Israel (cf. 41:8-9), which is spiritually blind and deaf and has failed to fulfill God&#8217;s purpose for it. This servant stands in contrast to the ideal &#8220;Israel&#8221; of the servant songs.</p>
