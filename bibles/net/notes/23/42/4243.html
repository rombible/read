<A NAME="4243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1826><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;The Lord was pleased for the sake of his righteousness [or &#8220;justice&#8221;], he was magnifying [the] law and was making [it] glorious.&#8221; The Lord contrasts his good intentions for the people with their present crisis (v. 22). To demonstrate his just character and attract the nations, the Lord wanted to showcase his law among and through Israel (Deut 4:5-8). But Israel disobeyed (v. 24) and failed to carry out their commission.</p>
