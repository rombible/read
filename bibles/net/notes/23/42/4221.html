<A NAME="4221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1804><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;before they sprout up, I cause you to hear.&#8221; The pronoun &#8220;you&#8221; is plural, referring to the people of Israel. In this verse &#8220;the former things&#8221; are the Lord&#8217;s earlier predictive oracles which have come to pass, while &#8220;the new things&#8221; are predicted events that have not yet begun to take place. &#8220;The former things&#8221; are earlier events in Israel&#8217;s history which God announced beforehand, such as the Exodus (see 43:16-18). &#8220;The new things&#8221; are the predictions about the servant (42:1-7). and may also include Cyrus&#8217; conquests (41:25-27). </p>
