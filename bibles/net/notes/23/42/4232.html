<A NAME="4232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1815><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text reads, &#8220;I will turn streams into coastlands [or &#8220;islands&#8221;].&#8221; Scholars who believe that this reading makes little sense have proposed an emendation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">iyyim</font>, &#8220;islands&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsiyyot</font>, &#8220;dry places&#8221;; cf. NCV, NLT, TEV). However, since all the versions support the MT reading, there is insufficient grounds for an emendation here. Although the imagery of changing rivers into islands is somewhat strange, J. N. Oswalt describes this imagery against the backdrop of rivers of the Near East. The receding of these rivers at times occasioned the appearance of previously submerged islands (<i>Isaiah</i> [NICOT], 2:126).</p>
