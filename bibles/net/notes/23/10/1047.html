<A NAME="1047"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=501><b>sn</b> The twofold appearance of the statement &#8220;a remnant will come back&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1512; &#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font>, <font face="Scholar">she</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ar yashuv</font>) in vv. 21-22 echoes and probably plays off the name of Isaiah&#8217;s son Shear-jashub (see 7:3). In its original context the name was meant to encourage Ahaz (see the note at 7:3), but here it has taken on new dimensions. In light of Ahaz&#8217;s failure and the judgment it brings down on the land, the name Shear-jashub now foreshadows the destiny of the nation. According to vv. 21-22, there is good news and bad news. The good news is that a remnant of God&#8217;s people will return; the bad news is that only a remnant will be preserved and come back. Like the name Immanuel, this name foreshadows both judgment (see the notes at 7:25 and 8:8) and ultimate restoration (see the note at 8:10).</p>
