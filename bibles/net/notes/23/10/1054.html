<A NAME="1054"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=508><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text has simply &#8220;fury,&#8221; but the pronominal element can be assumed on the basis of what immediately follows (see &#8220;my anger&#8221; in the clause). It is possible that the suffixed <font face="Scholar">yod</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font>) has been accidentally dropped by virtual haplography. Note that a <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) is prefixed to the form that immediately follows; <font face="Scholar">yod</font> and <font face="Scholar">vav</font> are very similar in later script phases.</p>
