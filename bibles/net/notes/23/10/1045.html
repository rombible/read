<A NAME="1045"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=499><b>tn</b> The referent of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el gibbor</font>, &#8220;mighty God&#8221;) is uncertain. The title appears only here and in 9:6, where it is one of the royal titles of the coming ideal Davidic king. (Similar titles appear in Deut 10:17 and Neh 9:32 [&#8220;the great, mighty, and awesome God&#8221;] and in Jer 32:18 [&#8220;the great and mighty God&#8221;]. Both titles refer to God.) Though Hos 3:5 pictures Israel someday seeking &#8220;David their king,&#8221; and provides some support for a messianic interpretation of Isa 10:21, the Davidic king is not mentioned in the immediate context of Isa 10:21 (see Isa 11, however). The preceding verse mentions Israel relying on the Lord, so it is likely that the title refers to God here.</p>
