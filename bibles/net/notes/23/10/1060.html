<A NAME="1060"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=514><b>tc</b> The meaning of this line is uncertain. The Hebrew text reads literally, &#8220;and the yoke will be destroyed (or perhaps, &#8220;pulled down&#8221;) because of fatness.&#8221; Perhaps this is a bizarre picture of an ox growing so fat that it breaks the yoke around its neck or can no longer fit into its yoke. Fatness would symbolize the Lord&#8217;s restored blessings; the removal of the yoke would symbolize the cessation of Assyrian oppression. Because of the difficulty of the metaphor, many prefer to emend the text at this point. Some emend <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1495;&#1467;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿkhubbal</font>, &#8220;and it will be destroyed,&#8221; a perfect with prefixed <i>vav</i>), to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1495;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yikhbol</font>, &#8220;[it] will be destroyed,&#8221; an imperfect), and take the verb with what precedes, &#8220;and their yoke will be destroyed from your neck.&#8221; Proponents of this view (cf. NAB, NRSV) then emend <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1465;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ol</font>, &#8220;yoke&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alah</font>, &#8220;he came up&#8221;) and understand this verb as introducing the following description of the Assyrian invasion (vv. 28-32). <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1462;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mippÿney-shamen</font>, &#8220;because of fatness&#8221;) is then emended to read &#8220;from before Rimmon&#8221; (NAB, NRSV), &#8220;from before Samaria,&#8221; or &#8220;from before Jeshimon.&#8221; Although this line may present difficulties, it appears best to regard the line as a graphic depiction of God&#8217;s abundant blessings on his servant nation. </p>
