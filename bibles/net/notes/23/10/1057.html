<A NAME="1057"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=511><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text reads literally, &#8220;and his staff [will be] against the sea, and he will lift it in the way [or &#8220;manner&#8221;] of Egypt.&#8221; If the text is retained, &#8220;the sea&#8221; symbolizes Assyria&#8217;s hostility, the metaphor being introduced because of the reference to Egypt. The translation above assumes an emendation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500; &#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al hayyam</font>, &#8220;against the sea&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alehem</font>, &#8220;against them&#8221;). The proposed shift from the third singular pronoun (note &#8220;beat him&#8221; earlier in the verse) to the plural is not problematic, for the singular is collective. Note that a third plural pronoun is used at the end of v. 25 (&#8220;their destruction&#8221;). The final phrase, &#8220;in the way/manner of Egypt,&#8221; probably refers to the way in which God used the staff of Moses to bring judgment down on Egypt. </p>
