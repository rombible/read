<A NAME="1062"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=516><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;he,&#8221; that is, the Assyrians (as the preceding context suggests). Cf. NCV &#8220;The army of Assyria.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Verses 28-32 describe an invasion of Judah from the north. There is no scholarly consensus on when this particular invasion took place, if at all. J. H. Hayes and S. A. Irvine (<i>Isaiah</i>, 209-10) suggest the text describes the Israelite-Syrian invasion of Judah (ca. 735 <sc>b.c.), but this proposal disregards the preceding context, which prophesies the destruction of Assyria. Some suggest that this invasion occurred in conjunction with Sargon&#8217;s western campaign of 713-711 <sc>b.c., but there is no historical evidence of such an invasion at that time. Many others identify the invasion as Sennacherib&#8217;s in 701 <sc>b.c., but historical records indicate Sennacherib approached Jerusalem from the southwest. J. N. Oswalt (<i>Isaiah</i> [NICOT], 1:274-75) prefers to see the description as rhetorical and as not corresponding to any particular historical event, but Hayes and Irvine argue that the precise geographical details militate against such a proposal. Perhaps it is best to label the account as rhetorical-prophetic. The prophecy of the invasion was not necessarily intended to be a literal itinerary of the Assyrians&#8217; movements; rather its primary purpose was to create a foreboding mood. Geographical references contribute to this purpose, but they merely reflect how one would expect an Assyrian invasion to proceed, not necessarily how the actual invasion would progress. Despite its rhetorical nature, the prophecy does point to the invasion of 701 <sc>b.c., as the announcement of the invaders&#8217; downfall in vv. 33-34 makes clear; it was essentially fulfilled at that time. For further discussion of the problem, see R. E. Clements, <i>Isaiah </i>(NCBC), 117-19. On the geographical details of the account, see Y. Aharoni, <i>Land of the Bible</i>, 393.</p>
