<A NAME="663"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2741><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and to this one I look&#8221; (KJV and NASB both similar).</p>
<A NAME="664"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2742><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;to the humble and the lowly in spirit and the one who trembles at my words.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="665"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2743><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;one who slaughters a bull, one who strikes down a man.&#8221; Some understand a comparison here and in the following lines. In God&#8217;s sight the one who sacrifices is like (i.e., regarded as) a murderer or one whose worship is ritually defiled or idolatrous. The translation above assumes that the language is not metaphorical, but descriptive of the sinners&#8217; hypocritical behavior. (Note the last two lines of the verse, which suggests they are guilty of abominable practices.) On the one hand, they act pious and offer sacrifices; but at the same time they commit violent crimes against men, defile their sacrifices, and worship other gods. </p>
<A NAME="666"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2744><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;one who sacrifices a lamb, one who breaks a dog&#8217;s neck.&#8221; Some understand a comparison, but see the previous note.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The significance of breaking a dog&#8217;s neck is uncertain, though the structure of the statement when compared to the preceding and following lines suggests the action is viewed in a negative light. According to Exod 13:13 and 34:20, one was to &#8220;redeem&#8221; a firstborn donkey by offering a lamb; if one did not &#8220;redeem&#8221; the firstborn donkey in this way, then its neck must be broken. According to Deut 21:1-9 a heifer&#8217;s neck was to be broken as part of the atonement ritual to purify the land from the guilt of bloodshed. It is not certain if these passages relate in any way to the action described in Isa 66:3. </p>
<A NAME="667"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2745><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;one who offers an offering, pig&#8217;s blood.&#8221; Some understand a comparison, but see the note at the end of the first line.</p>
<A NAME="668"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2746><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;one who offers incense as a memorial offering, one who blesses something false.&#8221; Some understand a comparison, but see the note at the end of the first line. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1493;&#1462;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aven</font>), which has a wide variety of attested nuances, here refers metonymically to an idol.

<A NAME="6611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2749><b>tn</b> The precise meaning of the noun is uncertain. It occurs only here and in 3:4 (but see the note there). It appears to be derived from the verbal root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alal</font>), which can carry the nuance &#8220;deal severely.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="6634"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2772><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text reads literally &#8220;and I, their deeds and their thoughts, am coming.&#8221; The syntax here is very problematic, suggesting that the text may have suffered corruption. Some suggest that the words &#8220;their deeds and their thoughts&#8221; have been displaced from v. 17. This line presents two primary challenges. In the first place, the personal pronoun &#8220;I&#8221; has no verb after it. Most translations insert &#8220;know&#8221; for the sake of clarity (NASB, NRSV, NLT, ESV). The NIV has &#8220;I, because of their actions and their imaginations&#8230;&#8221; Since God&#8217;s &#8220;knowledge&#8221; of Israel&#8217;s sin occasions judgment, the verb &#8220;hate&#8221; is an option as well (see above translation). The feminine form of the next verb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>) could be understood in one of two ways. One could provide an implied noun &#8220;time&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1514;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">et</font>) and render the next line &#8220;the time is coming/has come&#8221; (NASB, ESV). One could also emend the feminine verb to the masculine <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;) and have the &#8220;I&#8221; at the beginning of the line govern this verb as well (for the Lord is speaking here): &#8220;I am coming&#8221; (cf. NIV, NCV, NRSV, TEV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="6635"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2773><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and the tongues&#8221;; KJV, NASB, NIV, NRSV &#8220;and tongues.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="6636"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2774><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and I will set a sign among them.&#8221; The precise meaning of this statement is unclear. Elsewhere &#8220;to set a sign&#8221; means &#8220;perform a mighty act&#8221; (Ps 78:43; Jer 32:20), &#8220;make [someone] an object lesson&#8221; (Ezek 14:8), and &#8220;erect a [literal] standard&#8221; (Ps 74:4).</p>
