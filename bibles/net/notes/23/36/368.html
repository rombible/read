<A NAME="368"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1539><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;How can you turn back the face of an official [from among] the least of my master&#8217;s servants and trust in Egypt for chariots and horsemen?&#8221; In vv. 8-9 the chief adviser develops further the argument begun in v. 6. His reasoning seems to be as follows: &#8220;In your weakened condition you obviously need military strength. Agree to the king&#8217;s terms and I will personally give you more horses than you are capable of outfitting. If I, a mere minor official, am capable of giving you such military might, just think what power the king has. There is no way the Egyptians can match our strength. It makes much better sense to deal with us.&#8221; </p>
