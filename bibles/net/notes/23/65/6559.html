<A NAME="6559"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=2737><b>sn</b> Some see an allusion to Gen 3:14 (note &#8220;you will eat dirt&#8221;). The point would be that even in this new era the snake (often taken as a symbol of Satan) remains under God&#8217;s curse. However, it is unlikely that such an allusion exists. Even if there is an echo of Gen 3:14, the primary allusion is to 11:8, where snakes are pictured as no longer dangerous. They will no longer attack other living creatures, but will be content to crawl along the ground. (The statement &#8220;you will eat dirt&#8221; in Gen 3:14 means &#8220;you will crawl on the ground.&#8221; In the same way the statement &#8220;dirt will be its food&#8221; in Isa 65:25 means &#8220;it will crawl on the ground.&#8221;) </p>
