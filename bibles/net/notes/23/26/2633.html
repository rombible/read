<A NAME="2633"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1099><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for the dew of lights [is] your dew.&#8221; The pronominal suffix on &#8220;dew&#8221; is masculine singular, like the suffixes on &#8220;your dead&#8221; and &#8220;your corpses&#8221; in the first half of the verse. The statement, then, is addressed to collective Israel, the speaker in verse 18. The plural form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">orot</font>) is probably a plural of respect or magnitude, meaning &#8220;bright light&#8221; (i.e., morning&#8217;s light). Dew is a symbol of fertility and life. Here Israel&#8217;s &#8220;dew,&#8221; as it were, will soak the dust of the ground and cause the corpses of the dead to spring up to new life, like plants sprouting up from well-watered soil. </p>
