<A NAME="2629"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1095><b>tn</b> On the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kÿmo</font>, &#8220;like, as&#8221;) here, see BDB 455 s.v. Israel&#8217;s distress and suffering, likened here to the pains of childbirth, seemed to be for no purpose. A woman in labor endures pain with the hope that a child will be born; in Israel&#8217;s case no such positive outcome was apparent. The nation was like a woman who strains to bring forth a child, but can&#8217;t push the baby through to daylight. All her effort produces nothing. </p>
