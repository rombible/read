<A NAME="2630"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1096><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and the inhabitants of the world do not fall.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nafal</font>) apparently means here, &#8220;be born,&#8221; though the Qal form of the verb is not used with this nuance anywhere else in the OT. (The Hiphil appears to be used in the sense of &#8220;give birth&#8221; in v. 19, however.) The implication of verse 18b seems to be that Israel hoped its suffering would somehow end in deliverance and an increase in population. The phrase &#8220;inhabitants of the world&#8221; seems to refer to the human race in general, but the next verse, which focuses on Israel&#8217;s dead, suggests the referent may be more limited. </p>
