<A NAME="2619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1085><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;They will see and be ashamed of zeal of people.&#8221; Some take the prefixed verbs as jussives and translate the statement as a prayer, &#8220;Let them see and be put to shame.&#8221; The meaning of the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qin</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">at-</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">am</font>, &#8220;zeal of people&#8221;) is unclear. The translation assumes that this refers to God&#8217;s angry judgment upon people. Another option is to understand the phrase as referring to God&#8217;s zealous, protective love of his covenant people. In this case one might translate, &#8220;by your zealous devotion to your people.&#8221;</p>
