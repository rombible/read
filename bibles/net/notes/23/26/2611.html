<A NAME="2611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1077><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has, &#8220;yes, the way of your judgments.&#8221; The translation assumes that &#8220;way&#8221; is related to the verb &#8220;we wait&#8221; as an adverbial accusative (&#8220;in the way of your judgments we wait&#8221;). <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1496;&#1462;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mishpatekha</font>, &#8220;your judgments&#8221;) could refer to the Lord&#8217;s commandments, in which case one might translate, &#8220;as we obey your commands.&#8221; However, in verse 9 the same form refers to divine acts of judgment on evildoers.</p>
