<A NAME="6634"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2772><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text reads literally &#8220;and I, their deeds and their thoughts, am coming.&#8221; The syntax here is very problematic, suggesting that the text may have suffered corruption. Some suggest that the words &#8220;their deeds and their thoughts&#8221; have been displaced from v. 17. This line presents two primary challenges. In the first place, the personal pronoun &#8220;I&#8221; has no verb after it. Most translations insert &#8220;know&#8221; for the sake of clarity (NASB, NRSV, NLT, ESV). The NIV has &#8220;I, because of their actions and their imaginations&#8230;&#8221; Since God&#8217;s &#8220;knowledge&#8221; of Israel&#8217;s sin occasions judgment, the verb &#8220;hate&#8221; is an option as well (see above translation). The feminine form of the next verb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>) could be understood in one of two ways. One could provide an implied noun &#8220;time&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1514;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">et</font>) and render the next line &#8220;the time is coming/has come&#8221; (NASB, ESV). One could also emend the feminine verb to the masculine <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;) and have the &#8220;I&#8221; at the beginning of the line govern this verb as well (for the Lord is speaking here): &#8220;I am coming&#8221; (cf. NIV, NCV, NRSV, TEV, NLT).</p>
