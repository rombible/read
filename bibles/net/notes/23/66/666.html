<A NAME="666"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2744><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;one who sacrifices a lamb, one who breaks a dog&#8217;s neck.&#8221; Some understand a comparison, but see the previous note.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The significance of breaking a dog&#8217;s neck is uncertain, though the structure of the statement when compared to the preceding and following lines suggests the action is viewed in a negative light. According to Exod 13:13 and 34:20, one was to &#8220;redeem&#8221; a firstborn donkey by offering a lamb; if one did not &#8220;redeem&#8221; the firstborn donkey in this way, then its neck must be broken. According to Deut 21:1-9 a heifer&#8217;s neck was to be broken as part of the atonement ritual to purify the land from the guilt of bloodshed. It is not certain if these passages relate in any way to the action described in Isa 66:3. </p>
