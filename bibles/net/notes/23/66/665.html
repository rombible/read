<A NAME="665"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2743><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;one who slaughters a bull, one who strikes down a man.&#8221; Some understand a comparison here and in the following lines. In God&#8217;s sight the one who sacrifices is like (i.e., regarded as) a murderer or one whose worship is ritually defiled or idolatrous. The translation above assumes that the language is not metaphorical, but descriptive of the sinners&#8217; hypocritical behavior. (Note the last two lines of the verse, which suggests they are guilty of abominable practices.) On the one hand, they act pious and offer sacrifices; but at the same time they commit violent crimes against men, defile their sacrifices, and worship other gods. </p>
