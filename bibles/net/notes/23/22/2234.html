<A NAME="2234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=910><b>tn</b> The prophet here quotes what the fatalistic people are saying. The introductory &#8220;you say&#8221; is supplied in the translation for clarification; the concluding verb &#8220;we die&#8221; makes it clear the people are speaking. The six verbs translated as imperatives are actually infinitives absolute, functioning here as finite verbs.</p>
