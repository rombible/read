<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=881><b>tn</b> Verse 3 reads literally, &#8220;All your leaders ran away, apart from a bow they were captured, all your found ones were captured together, to a distant place they fled.&#8221; J. N. Oswalt (<i>Isaiah</i> [NICOT], 1:403, n. 3) suggests that the lines of the verse are arranged chiastically; lines 1 and 4 go together, while lines 2 and 3 are parallel. To translate the lines in the order they appear in the Hebrew text is misleading to the English reader, who is likely unfamiliar with, or at least insensitive to, chiastic parallelism. Consequently, the translation above arranges the lines as follows: line 1 (Hebrew) = line 1 (in translation); line 2 (Hebrew) = line 4 (in translation); line 3 (Hebrew) = line 3 (in translation); line 4 (Hebrew) = line 2 (in translation).</p>
