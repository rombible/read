<A NAME="2230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=906><b>tn</b> The antecedent of the third feminine singular suffix here and in the next line is unclear. The closest feminine noun is &#8220;pool&#8221; in the first half of the verse. Perhaps this &#8220;old pool&#8221; symbolizes the entire city, which had prospered because of God&#8217;s provision and protection through the years.</p>
