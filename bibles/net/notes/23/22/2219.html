<A NAME="2219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=895><b>sn</b> The Elamites and men of Kir may here symbolize a fierce army from a distant land. If this oracle anticipates a Babylonian conquest of the city (see 39:5-7), then the Elamites and men of Kir are perhaps viewed here as mercenaries in the Babylonian army. See J. N. Oswalt, <i>Isaiah</i> (NICOT), 1:410. </p>
