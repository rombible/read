<A NAME="2214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=890><b>tn</b> The precise meaning of this statement is unclear. Some take <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1460;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qir</font>) as &#8220;wall&#8221; and interpret the verb to mean &#8220;tear down.&#8221; However, tighter parallelism (note the reference to crying for help in the next line) is achieved if one takes both the verb and noun from a root, attested in Ugaritic and Arabic, meaning &#8220;make a sound.&#8221; See J. N. Oswalt, <i>Isaiah</i> (NICOT), 1:404, n. 5. </p>
