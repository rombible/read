<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=877><b>sn</b> The following message pertains to Jerusalem. The significance of referring to the city as <i>the Valley of Vision</i> is uncertain. Perhaps the Hinnom Valley is in view, but why it is associated with a prophetic revelatory &#8220;vision&#8221; is not entirely clear. Maybe the Hinnom Valley is called this because the destruction that will take place there is the focal point of this prophetic message (see v. 5). </p>
