<A NAME="3041"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1296><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Therefore the Lord waits to show you mercy, and therefore he is exalted to have compassion on you.&#8221; The logical connection between this verse and what precedes is problematic. The point seems to be that Judah&#8217;s impending doom does not bring God joy. Rather the prospect of their suffering stirs within him a willingness to show mercy and compassion, if they are willing to seek him on his terms. </p>
