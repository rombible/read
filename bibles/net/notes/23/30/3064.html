<A NAME="3064"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=1319><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;his breath is like a flooding river.&#8221; This might picture the Lord breathing heavily as he runs down his enemy, but in light of the preceding verse, which mentions his lips and tongue, &#8220;breath&#8221; probably stands metonymically for the word or battle cry that he expels from his mouth as he shouts. In Isa 34:16 and Ps 33:6 the Lord&#8217;s &#8220;breath&#8221; is associated with his command.</p>
