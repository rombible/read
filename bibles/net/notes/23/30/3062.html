<A NAME="3062"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=1317><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;his anger burns, and heaviness of elevation.&#8221; The meaning of the phrase &#8220;heaviness of elevation&#8221; is unclear, for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">masa</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>, &#8220;elevation&#8221;) occurs only here. Some understand the term as referring to a cloud (elevated above the earth&#8217;s surface), in which case one might translate, &#8220;and in heavy clouds&#8221; (cf. NAB &#8220;with lowering clouds&#8221;). Others relate the noun to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">masa</font>&#8217;, &#8220;burden&#8221;) and interpret it as a reference to judgment. In this case one might translate, &#8220;and with severe judgment.&#8221; The present translation assumes that the noun refers to his glory and that &#8220;heaviness&#8221; emphasizes its degree.</p>
