<A NAME="3077"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=1332><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text reads literally, &#8220;for arranged from before [or &#8220;yesterday&#8221;] is [?].&#8221; The meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1508;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tafÿteh</font>), which occurs only here, is unknown. The translation above (as with most English versions) assumes an emendation to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1508;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tofet</font>, &#8220;Topheth&#8221;; cf. NASB, NIV, NLT) and places the final <font face="Scholar">hey </font>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;</font>) on the beginning of the next word as an interrogative particle. Topheth was a place near Jerusalem used as a burial ground (see Jer 7:32; 19:11). </p>
