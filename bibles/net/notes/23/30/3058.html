<A NAME="3058"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=1313><b>sn</b> Light here symbolizes restoration of divine blessing and prosperity. The number &#8220;seven&#8221; is used symbolically to indicate intensity. The exact meaning of the phrase &#8220;the light of seven days&#8221; is uncertain; it probably means &#8220;seven times brighter&#8221; (see the parallel line). </p>
