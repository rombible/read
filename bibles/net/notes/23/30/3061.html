<A NAME="3061"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=1316><b>sn</b> The &#8220;name&#8221; of the Lord sometimes stands by metonymy for the Lord himself, see Exod 23:21; Lev 24:11; Pss 54:1 (54:3 HT); 124:8. In Isa 30:27 the point is that he reveals that aspect of his character which his name suggests &#8211; he comes as Yahweh (&#8220;he is present&#8221;), the ever present helper of his people who annihilates their enemies and delivers them. The name &#8220;Yahweh&#8221; originated in a context where God assured a fearful Moses that he would be with him as he confronted Pharaoh and delivered Israel from slavery in Egypt. See Exod 3. </p>
