<A NAME="1115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=537><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Justice will be the belt [or &#8220;undergarment&#8221;] on his waist, integrity the belt [or &#8220;undergarment&#8221;] on his hips.&#8221; The point of the metaphor is uncertain. If a belt worn outside the robe is in view, then the point might be that justice/integrity will be readily visible or that these qualities will give support to his rule. If an undergarment is in view, then the idea might be that these characteristics support his rule or that they are basic to everything else. </p>
