<A NAME="111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=523><b>sn</b> The text mentions David&#8217;s father Jesse, instead of the great king himself. Perhaps this is done for rhetorical reasons to suggest that a new David, not just another disappointing Davidic descendant, will arise. Other prophets call the coming ideal Davidic king &#8220;David&#8221; or picture him as the second coming of David, as it were. See Jer 30:9; Ezek 34:23-24; 37:24-25; Hos 3:5; and Mic 5:2 (as well as the note there). </p>
