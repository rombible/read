<A NAME="117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=529><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text reads literally, &#8220;and his smelling is in the fear of the Lord.&#8221; In Amos 5:21 the Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ruakh</font>, &#8220;smell&#8221;) carries the nuance of &#8220;smell with delight, get pleasure from.&#8221; There the Lord declares that he does not &#8220;smell with delight&#8221; (i.e., get pleasure from) Israel&#8217;s religious assemblies, which probably stand by metonymy for the incense offered during these festivals. In Isa 11:3 there is no sacrificial context to suggest such a use, but it is possible that &#8220;the fear of the Lord&#8221; is likened to incense. This coming king will get the same kind of delight from obeying (fearing) the Lord, as a deity does in the incense offered by worshipers. Some regard such an explanation as strained in this context, and prefer to omit this line from the text as a virtual dittograph of the preceding statement. </p>
