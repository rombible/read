<A NAME="1124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=546><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;in all my holy mountain.&#8221; In the most basic sense the Lord&#8217;s &#8220;holy mountain&#8221; is the mountain from which he rules over his kingdom (see Ezek 28:14, 16). More specifically it probably refers to Mount Zion/Jerusalem or to the entire land of Israel (see Pss 2:6; 15:1; 43:3; Isa 56:7; 57:13; Ezek 20:40; Ob 16; Zeph 3:11). If the Lord&#8217;s universal kingdom is in view in this context (see the note on &#8220;earth&#8221; at v. 4), then the phrase would probably be metonymic here, standing for God&#8217;s worldwide dominion (see the next line). </p>
