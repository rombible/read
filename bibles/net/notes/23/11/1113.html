<A NAME="1113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=535><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text reads literally, &#8220;and he will strike the earth with the scepter of his mouth.&#8221; Some have suggested that in this context <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">erets</font>, &#8220;earth&#8221;) as an object of judgment seems too broad in scope. The parallelism is tighter if one emends the word to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1509;</font>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font>)<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arits</font>, &#8220;potentate, tyrant&#8221;). The phrase &#8220;scepter of his mouth&#8221; refers to the royal (note &#8220;scepter&#8221;) decrees that he proclaims with his mouth. Because these decrees will have authority and power (see v. 2) behind them, they can be described as &#8220;striking&#8221; the tyrants down. Nevertheless, the MT reading may not need emending. Isaiah refers to the entire &#8220;earth&#8221; as the object of God&#8217;s judgment in several places without specifying the wicked as the object of the judgment (Isa 24:17-21; 26:9, 21; 28:22; cf. 13:11).</p>
