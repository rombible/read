<A NAME="116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=528><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;a spirit of knowledge and fear of the Lord.&#8221; &#8220;Knowledge&#8221; is used here in its covenantal sense and refers to a recognition of God&#8217;s authority and a willingness to submit to it. See Jer 22:16. &#8220;Fear&#8221; here refers to a healthy respect for God&#8217;s authority which produces obedience. Taken together the two terms emphasize the single quality of loyalty to the Lord. This loyalty guarantees that he will make just legal decisions and implement just policies (vv. 4-5).</p>
