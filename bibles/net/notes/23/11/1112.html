<A NAME="1112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=534><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;land&#8221; (NAB, NCV, CEV). It is uncertain if the passage is picturing universal dominion or focusing on the king&#8217;s rule over his covenant people. The reference to God&#8217;s &#8220;holy mountain&#8221; in v. 9 and the description of renewed Israelite conquests in v. 14 suggest the latter, though v. 10 seems to refer to a universal kingdom (see 2:2-4).</p>
