In the myths Death is portrayed as having &#8220;a lip to the earth, a lip to the heavens &#8230; and a tongue to the stars.&#8221; (G. R. Driver, <i>Canaanite Myths and Legends</i>, 69, text 5 ii 2-3.) Death describes his own appetite as follows: &#8220;But my appetite is the appetite of lions in the waste&#8230;If it is in very truth my desire to consume &#8216;clay&#8217; [a reference to his human victims], then in truth by the handfuls I must eat it, whether my seven portions [indicating fullness and completeness] are already in the bowl or whether Nahar [the god of the river responsible for ferrying victims from the land of the living to the land of the dead] has to mix the cup.&#8221; (Driver, 68-69, text 5 i 14-22).</p>
