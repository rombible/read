<A NAME="542"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=246><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;The holy God will be set apart by fairness.&#8221; In this context God&#8217;s holiness is his sovereign royal authority, which implies a commitment to justice (see the note on the phrase &#8220;the sovereign king of Israel&#8221; in 1:4). When God judges evildoers as they deserve, his sovereignty will be acknowledged.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The appearance of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1464;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mishpat</font>, &#8220;justice&#8221;) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsÿdaqah</font>, &#8220;fairness&#8221;) here is rhetorically significant, when one recalls v. 7. There God denounces his people for failing to produce a society where &#8220;justice&#8221; and &#8220;fairness&#8221; are valued and maintained. God will judge his people for their failure, taking &#8220;justice&#8221; and &#8220;fairness&#8221; into his own hands.</p>
