<A NAME="51"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=205><b>tn</b> It is uncertain who is speaking here. Possibly the prophet, taking the role of best man, composes a love song for his friend on the occasion of his wedding. If so, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yadid</font>) should be translated &#8220;my friend.&#8221; The present translation assumes that Israel is singing to the Lord. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dod</font>, &#8220;lover&#8221;) used in the second line is frequently used by the woman in the Song of Solomon to describe her lover. </p>
