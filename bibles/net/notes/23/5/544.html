<A NAME="544"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=248><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text reads literally, &#8220;and ruins, fatlings, resident aliens, will eat.&#8221; This part of the verse has occasioned various suggestions of emendation. The parallelism is tighter if the second line refers to animals grazing. The translation, &#8220;amid the ruins the fatlings and young sheep graze,&#8221; assumes an emendation of &#8220;resident aliens&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">garim</font>) to &#8220;young goats/sheep&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">gÿdayim</font>) &#8211; confusion of dalet and resh is quite common &#8211; and understands &#8220;fatlings&#8221; and &#8220;young sheep&#8221; taken as a compound subject or as in apposition as the subject of the verb. However, no emendations are necessary if the above translation is correct. The meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mekhim</font>) has a significant impact on one&#8217;s textual decision and translation. The noun can refer to a sacrificial (&#8220;fat&#8221;) animal as it does in its only other occurrence (Ps 66:15). However, it could signify the rich of the earth (&#8220;the fat ones of the earth&#8221;; Ps 22:29 [MT 30]) using a different word for &#8220;fatness&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">dashen</font>). If so, it serves a figurative reference to the rich. Consequently, the above translation coheres with the first half of the verse. Just as the sheep are out of place grazing in these places (&#8220;as in their pasture&#8221;), the sojourners would not have expected to have the chance to eat in these locations. Both animals and itinerant foreigners would eat in places not normal for them.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The image completes the picture begun in v. 14 and adds to the irony. When judgment comes, Sheol will eat up the sinners who frequent the feasts; then the banqueting halls will lie in ruins and only sheep will eat there.</p>
