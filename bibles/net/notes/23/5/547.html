<A NAME="547"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=251><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;let his work hurry, let it hasten.&#8221; The pronoun &#8220;his&#8221; refers to God, as the parallel line makes clear. The reference to his &#8220;work&#8221; alludes back to v. 12, which refers to his &#8216;work&#8221; of judgment. With these words the people challenged the prophet&#8217;s warning of approaching judgment. They were in essence saying that they saw no evidence that God was about to work in such a way. </p>
