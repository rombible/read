<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;The vision of Isaiah son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, [and] Hezekiah, kings of Judah.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Isaiah&#8217;s prophetic career probably began in the final year of Uzziah&#8217;s reign (ca. 740 <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span>, see Isa 6:1) and extended into the later years of Hezekiah&#8217;s reign, which ended in 686 <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span> </p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3><b>sn</b> The personified <i>heavens</i> and <i>earth</i> are summoned to God&#8217;s courtroom as witnesses against God&#8217;s covenant people. Long before this Moses warned the people that the heavens and earth would be watching their actions (see Deut 4:26; 30:19; 31:28; 32:1).</p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;sons&#8221; (NAB, NASB).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> &#8220;Father&#8221; and &#8220;son&#8221; occur as common terms in ancient Near Eastern treaties and covenants, delineating the suzerain and vassal as participants in the covenant relationship. The prophet uses these terms, the reference to heavens and earth as witnesses, and allusions to deuteronomic covenant curses (1:7-9, 19-20) to set his prophecy firmly against the backdrop of Israel&#8217;s covenantal relationship with Yahweh.</p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>sn</b> The normal word pair for giving birth to and raising children is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yalad</font>, &#8220;to give birth to&#8221;) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gadal</font>, &#8220;to grow, raise&#8221;). The pair <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1500;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</font> (<i>rum</i>, &#8220;to raise up&#8221;) probably occur here to highlight the fact that Yahweh made something important of Israel (cf. R. Mosis, <i>TDOT</i> 2:403).</p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=6><b>sn</b> Against the backdrop of Yahweh&#8217;s care for his chosen people, Israel&#8217;s rebellion represents abhorrent treachery. The conjunction prefixed to a nonverbal element highlights the sad contrast between Yahweh&#8217;s compassionate care for His people and Israel&#8217;s thankless rebellion.</p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=7><b>sn</b> To rebel carries the idea of &#8220;covenant treachery.&#8221; Although an act of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pesha</font>&#8217;, &#8220;rebellion&#8221;) often signifies a breach of the law, the legal offense also represents a violation of an existing covenantal relationship (E. Carpenter and M. Grisanti, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 3:707).</p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=8><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and the donkey the feeding trough of its owner.&#8221; The verb in the first line does double duty in the parallelism.</p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=9><b>tn</b> Although both verbs have no object, the parallelism suggests that Israel fails to recognize the Lord as the one who provides for their needs. In both clauses, the placement of &#8220;Israel&#8221; and &#8220;my people&#8221; at the head of the clause focuses the reader&#8217;s attention on the rebellious nation (C. van der Merwe, J. Naudé, J. Kroeze, <i>A Biblical Hebrew Reference Grammar</i>, 346-47).</p>
<a name="110"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=10><b>sn</b> Having summoned the witnesses and announced the Lord&#8217;s accusation against Israel, Isaiah mourns the nation&#8217;s impending doom. The third person references to the Lord in the second half of the verse suggest that the quotation from the Lord (cf. vv. 2-3) has concluded.</p>
<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Woe [to the] sinful nation.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497;</font>, (<font face="Scholar">hoy</font><i>,</i> &#8220;woe, ah&#8221;) was used in funeral laments (see 1 Kgs 13:30; Jer 22:18; 34:5) and carries the connotation of death. In highly dramatic fashion the prophet acts out Israel&#8217;s funeral in advance, emphasizing that their demise is inevitable if they do not repent soon.</p>
<a name="112"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=12><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;sons&#8221; (NASB). The prophet contrasts four terms of privilege &#8211; nation, people, offspring, children &#8211; with four terms that depict Israel&#8217;s sinful condition in Isaiah&#8217;s day &#8211; sinful, evil, wrong, wicked (see J. A. Motyer, <i>The Prophecy of Isaiah</i>, 43).</p>
<a name="113"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=13><b>sn</b> <i>Holy One of Israel </i>is one of Isaiah&#8217;s favorite divine titles for God. It pictures the Lord as the sovereign king who rules over his covenant people and exercises moral authority over them.</p>
<a name="114"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=14><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;they are estranged backward.&#8221; The LXX omits this statement, which presents syntactical problems and seems to be outside the synonymous parallelistic structure of the verse.</p>
<a name="115"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=15><b>sn</b> In vv. 5-9 Isaiah addresses the battered nation (5-8) and speaks as their representative (9). </p>
<a name="116"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=16><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Why are you still beaten? [Why] do you continue rebellion?&#8221; The rhetorical questions express the prophet&#8217;s disbelief over Israel&#8217;s apparent masochism and obsession with sin. The interrogative construction in the first line does double duty in the parallelism. H. Wildberger (<i>Isaiah</i>, 1:18) offers another alternative by translating the two statements with one question: &#8220;Why do you still wish to be struck that you persist in revolt?&#8221; </p>
<a name="117"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=17><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;all the head is ill&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;the whole head is sick&#8221;; CEV &#8220;Your head is badly bruised.&#8221;</p>
<a name="118"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=18><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and all the heart is faint.&#8221; The &#8220;heart&#8221; here stands for bodily strength and energy, as suggested by the context and usage elsewhere (see Jer 8:18; Lam 1:22).</p>
<a name="119"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=19><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;there is not in it health&#8221;; NAB &#8220;there is no sound spot.&#8221;</p>
<a name="120"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=20><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;pressed out.&#8221;</p>
<a name="121"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=21><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;softened&#8221; (so NASB, NRSV); NIV &#8220;soothed.&#8221;</p>
<a name="122"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=22><b>sn</b> This verse describes wounds like those one would receive in battle. These wounds are comprehensive and without remedy.</p>
<a name="123"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=23><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;As for your land, before you foreigners are devouring it.&#8221;</p>
<a name="124"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=24><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and [there is] devastation like an overthrow by foreigners.&#8221; The comparative preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kÿ</font>, &#8220;like, as&#8221;) has here the rhetorical nuance, &#8220;in every way like.&#8221; The point is that the land has all the earmarks of a destructive foreign invasion because that is what has indeed happened. One could paraphrase, &#8220;it is desolate as it can only be when foreigners destroy.&#8221; On this use of the preposition in general, see GKC 376 §118.<i>x</i>. Many also prefer to emend &#8220;foreigners&#8221; here to &#8220;Sodom,&#8221; though there is no external attestation for such a reading in the <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> or ancient versions. Such an emendation finds support from the following context (vv. 9-10) and usage of the preceding noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1492;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1461;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mahpekhah</font>, &#8220;overthrow&#8221;). In its five other uses, this noun is associated with the destruction of Sodom. If one accepts the emendation, then one might translate, &#8220;the devastation resembles the destruction of Sodom.&#8221; </p>
<a name="125"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=25><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;daughter of Zion&#8221; (so KJV, NASB, NIV). The genitive is appositional, identifying precisely which daughter is in view. By picturing Zion as a daughter, the prophet emphasizes her helplessness and vulnerability before the enemy.</p>
<a name="126"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=26><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;like a city besieged.&#8221; Unlike the preceding two comparisons, which are purely metaphorical, this third one identifies the reality of Israel&#8217;s condition. In this case the comparative preposition, as in v. 7b, has the force, &#8220;in every way like,&#8221; indicating that all the earmarks of a siege are visible because that is indeed what is taking place. The verb form in MT is Qal passive participle of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">natsar</font>, &#8220;guard&#8221;), but since this verb is not often used of a siege (see BDB 666 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1512;</font>), some prefer to repoint the form as a Niphal participle from II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsur</font>, &#8220;besiege&#8221;). However, the latter is not attested elsewhere in the Niphal (see BDB 848 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font>).</p>
<a name="127"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=27><b>tn</b> Traditionally, &#8220;the Lord of hosts.&#8221; The title pictures God as the sovereign king who has at his disposal a multitude of attendants, messengers, and warriors to do his bidding. In some contexts, like this one, the military dimension of his rulership is highlighted. In this case, the title pictures him as one who leads armies into battle against his enemies.</p>
<a name="128"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=28><b>tc</b> The translation assumes that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kim</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">at</font>, &#8220;quickly,&#8221; literally, &#8220;like a little&#8221;) goes with what follows, contrary to the MT accents, which take it with what precedes. In this case, one could translate the preceding line, &#8220;If the Lord who commands armies had not left us a few survivors.&#8221; If <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1496;</font> goes with the preceding line (following the MT accents), this expression highlights the idea that there would only be a few survivors (H. Wildberger, <i>Isaiah</i>, 1:20; H. Zobel, <i>TDOT</i> 8:456). Israel would not be almost like Sodom but exactly like Sodom.</p>
<a name="129"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=29><b>sn</b> Building on the simile of v. 9, the prophet sarcastically addresses the leaders and people of Jerusalem as if they were leaders and residents of ancient Sodom and Gomorrah. The sarcasm is appropriate, for if the judgment is comparable to Sodom&#8217;s, that must mean that the sin which prompted the judgment is comparable as well. </p>
<a name="130"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=30><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;to the instruction of our God.&#8221; In this context, which is highly accusatory and threatening, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">torah</font>, &#8220;law, instruction&#8221;) does not refer to mere teaching, but to corrective teaching and rebuke.</p>
<a name="131"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=31><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Why to me the multitude of your sacrifices?&#8221; The sarcastic rhetorical question suggests that their many sacrifices are of no importance to the Lord. This phrase answers the possible objection that an Israelite could raise in response to God&#8217;s indictment: &#8220;But we are offering the sacrifices you commanded!&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In this section the Lord refutes a potential objection that his sinful people might offer in their defense. He has charged them with rebellion (vv. 2-3), but they might respond that they have brought him many sacrifices. So he points out that he requires social justice first and foremost, not empty ritual.</p>
<a name="132"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=32><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sava</font>&#8217;, &#8220;be satisfied, full&#8221;) is often used of eating and/or drinking one&#8217;s fill. See BDB 959 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1506;</font>. Here sacrifices are viewed, in typical ancient Near Eastern fashion, as food for the deity. God here declares that he has eaten and drunk, as it were, his fill.</p>
<a name="133"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=33><b>sn</b> In the chiastic structure of the verse, the verbs at the beginning and end highlight God&#8217;s displeasure, while the heaping up of references to animals, fat, and blood in the middle lines hints at why God wants no more of their sacrifices. They have, as it were, piled the food on his table and he needs no more.</p>
<a name="134"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=34><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;When you come to appear before me, who requires this from your hand, trampling of my courtyards?&#8221; The rhetorical question sarcastically makes the point that God does not require this parade of livestock. The verb &#8220;trample&#8221; probably refers to the eager worshipers and their sacrificial animals walking around in the temple area. </p>
<a name="135"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=35><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;worthless&#8221; (NASB, NCV, CEV); KJV, ASV &#8220;vain.&#8221;</p>
<a name="136"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=36><b>sn</b> Notice some of the other practices that Yahweh regards as &#8220;detestable&#8221;: homosexuality (Lev 18:22-30; 20:13), idolatry (Deut 7:25; 13:15), human sacrifice (Deut 12:31), eating ritually unclean animals (Deut 14:3-8), sacrificing defective animals (Deut 17:1), engaging in occult activities (Deut 18:9-14), and practicing ritual prostitution (1 Kgs 14:23).</p>
<a name="137"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=37><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;sin and assembly&#8221; (these two nouns probably represent a hendiadys). The point is that their attempts at worship are unacceptable to God because the people&#8217;s everyday actions in the socio-economic realm prove they have no genuine devotion to God (see vv. 16-17). </p>
<a name="138"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=38><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;I close my eyes from you.&#8221;</p>
<a name="139"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=39><b>sn</b> This does not just refer to the blood of sacrificial animals, but also the blood, as it were, of their innocent victims. By depriving the poor and destitute of proper legal recourse and adequate access to the economic system, the oppressors have, for all intents and purposes, &#8220;killed&#8221; their victims. </p>
<a name="140"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=40><b>sn</b> Having demonstrated the people&#8217;s guilt, the Lord calls them to repentance, which will involve concrete action in the socio-economic realm, not mere emotion. </p>
<a name="141"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=41><b>sn</b> This phrase refers to Israel&#8217;s covenant treachery (cf. Deut 28:10; Jer 4:4; 21:12; 23:2, 22; 25:5; 26:3; 44:22; Hos 9:15; Ps 28:4). In general, the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1463;&#1502;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1500;&#1461;&#1497;&#1499;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ma</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alleykhem</font>) can simply be a reference to deeds, whether good or bad. However, Isaiah always uses it with a negative connotation (cf. 3:8, 10).</p>
<a name="142"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=42><b>tn</b> The precise meaning of this line is uncertain. The translation assumes an emendation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khamots</font>, &#8220;oppressor [?]&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khamuts</font>, &#8220;oppressed&#8221;), a passive participle from II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khamats</font>, &#8220;oppress&#8221;; <i>HALOT</i> 329 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1502;&#1509;</font>) and takes the verb II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ashar</font>) in the sense of &#8220;make happy&#8221; (the delocutive Piel, meaning &#8220;call/pronounce happy,&#8221; is metonymic here, referring to actually effecting happiness). The parallelism favors this interpretation, for the next two lines speak of positive actions on behalf of the destitute. The other option is to retain the MT pointing and translate, &#8220;set right the oppressor,&#8221; but the nuance &#8220;set right&#8221; is not clearly attested elsewhere for the verb I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;</font>. This verb does appear as a participle in Isa 3:12 and 9:16 with the meaning &#8220;to lead or guide.&#8221; If it can mean to &#8220;lead&#8221; or &#8220;rebuke/redirect&#8221; in this verse, the prophet could be contrasting this appeal for societal reformation (v. 17c) with a command to reorder their personal lives (v. 17a-b). J. A. Motyer (<i>The Prophecy of Isaiah</i>, 47) suggests that these three statements (v. 17a-c) provide &#8220;the contrast between the two ends of imperfect society, the oppressor and the needy, the one inflicting and the other suffering the hurt. Isaiah looks for a transformed society wherever it needs transforming.&#8221;</p>
<a name="143"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=43><b>tn</b> This word refers to a woman who has lost her husband, by death or divorce. The orphan and widow are often mentioned in the OT as epitomizing the helpless and impoverished who have been left without the necessities of life due to the loss of a family provider. </p>
<a name="144"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=44><b>sn</b> The Lord concludes his case against Israel by offering them the opportunity to be forgiven and by setting before them the alternatives of renewed blessing (as a reward for repentance) and final judgment (as punishment for persistence in sin).</p>

The metaphorical language must be allowed some flexibility and should not be pressed into a rigid literalistic mold. The people&#8217;s sins will be removed and replaced by ethical purity.

They were members of the royal military and judicial bureaucracies in Israel and Judah. As these bureaucracies grew, they acquired more and more land and gradually commandeered the economy and legal system. At various administrative levels bribery and graft become commonplace. The common people outside the urban administrative centers were vulnerable to exploitation in such a system, especially those, like widows and orphans, who had lost their family provider through death. Through confiscatory taxation, conscription, excessive interest rates, and other oppressive governmental measures and policies, they were gradually disenfranchised and lost their landed property, and with it, their rights as citizens. The socio-economic equilibrium envisioned in the law of Moses was radically disturbed.</p>

<a name="173"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=73><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Zion will be ransomed with justice.&#8221; Both cola in this verse end with similar terms: justice and righteousness (and both are preceded by a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font> [<font face="Scholar">bet</font>] preposition). At issue is whether these virtues describe the means or result of the deliverance and whether they delineate God&#8217;s justice/righteousness or that of the covenant people. If the righteousness of Israelite returnees is in view, the point seems to be that the reestablishment of Zion as a center of justice (God&#8217;s people living in conformity with God&#8217;s demand for equity and justice) will deliver the city from its past humiliation and restore it to a place of prominence (see 2:2-4; cf. E. Kissane, <i>Isaiah,</i> 1:19). Most scholars conclude that &#8220;righteousness and &#8220;justice&#8221; refers to God alone (J. Ridderbos, <i>Isaiah </i>[BSC], 50; J. Watts, <i>Isaiah </i>[WBC], 1:25; E. J. Young, <i>Isaiah</i> [NICOT], 1:89; cf. NLT, TEV) or serves as a double reference to both divine and human justice and righteousness (J. A. Motyer, <i>The Prophecy of Isaiah,</i> 51; J. N. Oswalt, <i>Isaiah</i> [NICOT], 1:10; H. Wildberger, <i>Isaiah</i>, 1:72). If it refers to both sides of the coin, these terms highlight the objective divine work of redemption and the subjective human response of penitence (Motyer, 51).</p>
<a name="174"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=74><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text has, &#8220;her repentant ones/returnees with righteousness.&#8221; The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;&#1462;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shaveha</font>, &#8220;her repentant ones&#8221;), as pointed in MT, is a masculine plural Qal participle from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shuv</font>, &#8220;return&#8221;). Used substantivally, it refers to the &#8220;returning (i.e., repentant) ones.&#8221; It is possible that the parallel line (with its allusion to being freed by a ransom payment) suggests that the form be repointed to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shivyah</font>, &#8220;her captivity&#8221;), a reading that has support from the LXX. Some slightly emend the form to read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿshavah</font>, &#8220;and will return&#8221;). According to this view, the verb from the first line applies to the second line as well with the following translation as a result: &#8220;she will be released when fairness is restored.&#8221; Regardless, it makes best sense in the context to regard this as a reference to repentant Israelites returning to the land of promise. This understanding provides a better contrast with the rebels and sinners in 1:28.</p>

<a name="176"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">76</span><note=76><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text (and the Qumran scroll 1QIsa<sup>a</sup>) has the third person here, though a few Hebrew <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> (and Targums) read the second person, which is certainly more consistent with the following context. The third person form is the more difficult reading and probably original. This disagreement in person has caused some to emend the first verb (3rd plural) to a 2nd plural form (followed by most English translations). The BHS textual apparatus suggests that the 2nd plural form be read even though there is only sparse textual evidence. LXX, Syriac, and the Vulgate change all the 2nd person verbs in 1:29-31 to 3rd person verbs. It is likely that the change to a 2nd person form represents an attempt at syntactical harmonization (J. de Waard, <i>Isaiah</i>, 10). The abrupt change from 3rd person to 2nd person may have been intentional for rhetorical impact (GKC 462 §144.<i>p</i>). The rapid change from exclamation (they did!) to reproach (you desired!) might be regarded as a rhetorical figure focusing attention on the addressees and their conditions (de Waard, 10; E. König, <i>Stilistik, Rhetorik, Poetik</i>, 239). This use of the 3rd person could also be understood as an impersonal third person: &#8220;one will be ashamed&#8221; (de Waard, 10). In v. 29 the prophet continues his description of the sinners (v. 28), but then suddenly makes a transition to direct address (switching from 3<sup>rd</sup> to 2<sup>nd</sup> person) in the middle of his sentence.</p>
