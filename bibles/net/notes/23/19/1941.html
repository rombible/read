<A NAME="1941"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=838><b>tn</b> The text could be translated, &#8220;and Egypt will serve Assyria&#8221; (cf. NAB), but subjugation of one nation to the other does not seem to be a theme in vv. 23-25. Rather the nations are viewed as equals before the Lord (v. 25). Therefore it is better to take <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et</font>) in v. 23b as a preposition, &#8220;together with,&#8221; rather than the accusative sign. The names of the two countries are understood to refer by metonymy to their respective inhabitants.</p>
