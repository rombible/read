<A NAME="1919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=816><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;A son of wise men am I, a son of ancient kings.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ben</font>, &#8220;son of&#8221;) could refer to literal descent, but many understand the word, at least in the first line, in its idiomatic sense of &#8220;member [of a guild].&#8221; See <i>HALOT</i> 138 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;</font> and J. N. Oswalt, <i>Isaiah</i> (NICOT), 1:371. If this is the case, then one can take the word in a figurative sense in the second line as well, the &#8220;son of ancient kings&#8221; being one devoted to their memory as preserved in their literature.</p>
