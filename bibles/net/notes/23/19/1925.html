<A NAME="1925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=822><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;And there will not be for Egypt a deed, which head and tail, shoot and stalk can do.&#8221; In 9:14-15 the phrase &#8220;head or tail&#8221; refers to leaders and prophets, respectively. This interpretation makes good sense in this context, where both leaders and advisers (probably including prophets and diviners) are mentioned (vv. 11-14). Here, as in 9:14, &#8220;shoots and stalk&#8221; picture a reed, which symbolizes the leadership of the nation in its entirety.</p>
