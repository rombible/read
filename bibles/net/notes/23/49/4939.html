<A NAME="4939"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2129><b>sn</b> The argument of v. 15 seems to develop as follows: The Lord has an innate attachment to Zion, just like a mother does for her infant child. But even if mothers were to suddenly abandon their children, the Lord would never forsake Zion. In other words, the Lord&#8217;s attachment to Zion is like a mother&#8217;s attachment to her infant child, but even stronger.</p>
