<A NAME="495"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2095><b>sn</b> The figurative language emphasizes the servant&#8217;s importance as the Lord&#8217;s effective instrument. The servant&#8217;s mouth, which stands metonymically for his words, is compared to a sharp sword because he will be an effective spokesman on God&#8217;s behalf (see 50:4). The Lord holds his hand on the servant, ready to draw and use him at the appropriate time. The servant is like a sharpened arrow reserved in a quiver for just the right moment.</p>
