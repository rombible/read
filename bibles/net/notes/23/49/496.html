<A NAME="496"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2096><b>sn</b> This verse identifies the servant as <i>Israel</i>. This seems to refer to the exiled nation (cf. 41:8-9; 44:1-2, 21; 45:4; 48:20), but in vv. 5-6 this servant says he has been commissioned to reconcile Israel to God, so he must be distinct from the exiled nation. This servant is an ideal &#8220;Israel&#8221; who, like Moses of old, mediates a covenant for the nation (see v. 8), leads them out of bondage (v. 9a), and carries out God&#8217;s original plan for Israel by positively impacting the pagan nations (see v. 6b). By living according to God&#8217;s law, Israel was to be a model of God&#8217;s standards of justice to the surrounding nations (Deut 4:6-8). The sinful nation failed, but the servant, the ideal &#8220;Israel,&#8221; will succeed by establishing justice throughout the earth. </p>
