<A NAME="628"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2598><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text has &#8220;your sons,&#8221; but this produces an odd metaphor and is somewhat incongruous with the parallelism. In the context (v. 4b, see also 54:5-7) the Lord is the one who &#8220;marries&#8221; Zion. Therefore several prefer to emend &#8220;your sons&#8221; to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;&#1460;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bonayikh</font>, &#8220;your builder&#8221;; e.g., NRSV). In Ps 147:2 the Lord is called the &#8220;builder of Jerusalem.&#8221; However, this emendation is not the best option for at least four reasons. First, although the Lord is never called the &#8220;builder&#8221; of Jerusalem in Isaiah, the idea of Zion&#8217;s children possessing the land does occur (Isa 49:20; 54:3; cf. also 14:1; 60:21). Secondly, all the ancient versions support the MT reading. Thirdly, although the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) can mean &#8220;to marry,&#8221; its basic idea is &#8220;to possess.&#8221; Consequently, the verb stresses a relationship more than a state. All the ancient versions render this verb &#8220;to dwell in&#8221; or &#8220;to dwell with.&#8221; The point is not just that the land will be reinhabited, but that it will be in a relationship of &#8220;belonging&#8221; to the Israelites. Hence a relational verb like <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> is used (J. N. Oswalt, <i>Isaiah</i> [NICOT], 2:581). Finally, &#8220;sons&#8221; is a well-known metaphor for &#8220;inhabitants&#8221; (J. de Waard, <i>Isaiah</i>, 208).</p>
