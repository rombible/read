<A NAME="4315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1850><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text reads literally, &#8220;as for the Babylonians, in ships their joyful shout.&#8221; This might be paraphrased, &#8220;even the Babylonians in the ships [over which] they joyfully shouted.&#8221; The point would be that the Lord caused the Babylonians to flee for safety in the ships in which they took such great pride. A slight change in vocalization yields the reading &#8220;into mourning songs,&#8221; which provides a good contrast with &#8220;joyful shout.&#8221; The prefixed <i>bet</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font>) would indicate identity. </p>
