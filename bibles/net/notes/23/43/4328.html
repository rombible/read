<A NAME="4328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1863><b>sn</b> In vv. 22-24 the Lord appears to be condemning his people for failure to bring the proper sacrifices. However, this is problematic. If this refers to the nation&#8217;s behavior while in exile, such cultic service was impossible and could hardly be expected by the Lord. If this refers to the nation&#8217;s conduct before the exile, it contradicts other passages that depict Israel as bringing excessive sacrifices (see, e.g., Isa 1:11-14; Jer 6:20; Amos 4:4-5, 5:21-23). Rather than being a condemnation of Israel&#8217;s failure to bring sacrifices, these verses are better taken as a highly rhetorical comment on the worthlessness of Israel&#8217;s religious ritual. They may have brought sacrifices, but not to the Lord, for he did not accept them or even want them. See C. R. North, <i>Second Isaiah</i>, 127, and R. Whybray, <i>Isaiah 40-66 </i>(NCBC), 91.</p>
