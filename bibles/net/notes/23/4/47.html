<A NAME="47"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=190><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and the vegetation of the Lord will become beauty and honor.&#8221; Many English versions understand the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1462;&#1502;&#1463;&#1495; &#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsemakh yÿhvah</font>) as a messianic reference and render it, &#8220;the Branch of the Lord&#8221; (so KJV, NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV, NLT, and others). Though <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1462;&#1502;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsemakh</font>) is used by later prophets of a royal descendant (Jer 23;5; 33:15; Zech 3:8; 6:12), those passages contain clear contextual indicators that a human ruler is in view and that the word is being used in a metaphorical way of offspring. However, in Isa 4:2 there are no such contextual indicators. To the contrary, in the parallel structure of the verse <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1462;&#1502;&#1463;&#1495; &#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> corresponds to &#8220;produce of the land,&#8221; a phrase that refers elsewhere exclusively to literal agricultural produce (see Num 13:20, 26; Deut 1:25). In the majority of its uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1462;&#1502;&#1463;&#1495;</font> refers to literal crops or vegetation (in Ps 65:10 the Lord is the source of this vegetation). A reference to the Lord restoring crops would make excellent sense in Isa 4 and the prophets frequently included this theme in their visions of the future age (see Isa 30:23-24; 32:20; Jer 31:12; Ezek 34:26-29; and Amos 9:13-14).</p>
