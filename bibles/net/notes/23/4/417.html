<A NAME="417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=200><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;by a spirit of judgment and by a spirit of burning.&#8221; The precise meaning of the second half of the verse is uncertain. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ruakh</font>) can be understood as &#8220;wind&#8221; in which case the passage pictures the Lord using a destructive wind as an instrument of judgment. However, this would create a mixed metaphor, for the first half of the verse uses the imagery of washing and rinsing to depict judgment. Perhaps the image would be that of a windstorm accompanied by heavy rain. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> can also mean &#8220;spirit,&#8221; in which case the verse may be referring to the Lord&#8217;s Spirit or, more likely, to a disposition that the Lord brings to the task of judgment. It is also uncertain if <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ar</font>) here means &#8220;burning&#8221; or &#8220;sweeping away, devastating.&#8221; </p>
