<A NAME="415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=198><b>tn</b> The word refers elsewhere to vomit (Isa 28:8) and fecal material (Isa 36:12). Many English versions render this somewhat euphemistically as &#8220;filth&#8221; (e.g., NAB, NIV, NRSV). Ironically in God&#8217;s sight the beautiful jewelry described earlier is nothing but vomit and feces, for it symbolizes the moral decay of the city&#8217;s residents (cf. NLT &#8220;moral filth&#8221;).</p>
