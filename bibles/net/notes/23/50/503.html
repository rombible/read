<A NAME="503"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2147><b>sn</b> The Lord admits he did divorce Zion, but that too was the result of the nation&#8217;s sins. The force of the earlier rhetorical question comes into clearer focus now. The question does not imply that a certificate does not exist and that no divorce occurred. Rather, the question asks for the certificate to be produced so the accuser can see the reason for the divorce in black and white. The Lord did not put Zion away arbitrarily.</p>
