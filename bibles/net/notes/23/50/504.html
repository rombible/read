<A NAME="504"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2148><b>sn</b> The present tense translation of the verbs assumes that the Lord is questioning why Israel does not attempt to counter his arguments. Another possibility is to take the verbs as referring to past events: &#8220;Why did no one meet me when I came? Why did no one answer when I called?&#8221; In this case the Lord might be asking why Israel rejected his calls to repent and his offer to deliver them.</p>
