<A NAME="4434"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1901><b>tc</b> The verb in the Hebrew text is a Niphal imperfect with a pronominal suffix. Although the Niphal ordinarily has the passive sense, it can have a reflexive nuance as well (see above translation). Some have suggested an emendation to a Qal form: &#8220;Do not forget me&#8221; (all the ancient versions, NEB, REB; see GKC 369 §117.<i>x</i>). &#8220;Do not forget me&#8221; would make a good parallel with &#8220;remember these things&#8221; in the first line. Since the MT is the harder reading and fits with Israel&#8217;s complaint that God had forgotten her (Isa 40:27), the MT reading should be retained (NASB, NKJV, NRSV, ESV). The passive has been rendered as an active in the translation in keeping with contemporary English style (so also NIV, NCV, TEV, NLT).</p>
