<A NAME="449"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1876><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text reads, &#8220;from (the time) I established an ancient people, and the coming things.&#8221; Various emendations have been proposed. One of the options assumes the reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1461;&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1501; &#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mashmi</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im me</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">olam </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">otiyyot</font>); This literally reads &#8220;the ones causing to hear from antiquity coming things,&#8221; but more idiomatically would read &#8220;as for those who predict from antiquity what will happen&#8221; (cf. NAB, NEB, REB). The emendation directs the attention of the reader to those who claim to be able to predict the future, challenging them to actually do what they claim they can do. The MT presents Yahweh as an example to whom these alleged &#8220;predictors of the future&#8221; can compare themselves. Since the ancient versions are unanimous in their support of the MT, the emendations should be set aside.</p>
