<A NAME="4444"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1911><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">baddim</font>), perhaps meaning &#8220;empty talkers&#8221; (BDB 95 s.v. III <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1491;</font>). In the four other occurrences of this word (Job 11:3; Isa 16:6; Jer 48:30; 50:36) the context does not make the meaning of the term very clear. Its primary point appears to be that the words spoken are meaningless or false. In light of its parallelism with &#8220;omen readers,&#8221; some have proposed an emendation to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">barim</font>, &#8220;seers&#8221;). The Mesopotamian <i>baru</i>-priests were divination specialists who played an important role in court life. See R. Wilson, <i>Prophecy and Society in Ancient Israel</i>, 93-98. Rather than supporting an emendation, J. N. Oswalt (<i>Isaiah</i> [NICOT], 2:189, n. 79) suggests that Isaiah used <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> purposively as a derisive wordplay on the Akkadian word <i>baru</i> (in light of the close similarity of the <i>d</i> and <i>r</i> consonants).</p>
