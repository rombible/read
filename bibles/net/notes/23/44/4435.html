<A NAME="4435"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1902><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;I blot out like a cloud your rebellious deeds, and like a cloud your sins.&#8221; &#8220;Rebellious deeds&#8221; and &#8220;sins&#8221; stand by metonymy for the guilt they produce. Both <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">av</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anan</font>) refer to the clouds in the sky. It is tempting for stylistic purposes to translate the second with &#8220;fog&#8221; or &#8220;mist&#8221; (cf. NAB, NRSV &#8220;cloud&#8230;mist&#8221;; NIV &#8220;cloud&#8230;morning mist&#8221;; NLT &#8220;morning mists&#8230;clouds&#8221;), but this distinction between the synonyms is unwarranted here. The point of the simile seems to be this: The Lord forgives their sins, causing them to vanish just as clouds disappear from the sky (see Job 7:9; 30:15). </p>
