<A NAME="6113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2573><b>sn</b> The Lord speaks in vv. 7-8 (and possibly v. 9). It is not clear where the servant&#8217;s speech (see vv. 1-3a) ends and the Lord&#8217;s begins. Perhaps the direct address to the people signals the beginning of the Lord&#8217;s speech.</p>
