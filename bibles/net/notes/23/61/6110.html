<A NAME="6110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2570><b>tn</b> Rather than referring to the character of the people, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1462;&#1491;&#1462;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsedeq</font>) may carry the nuance &#8220;vindication&#8221; here, suggesting that God&#8217;s restored people are a testimony to his justice. See v. 2, which alludes to the fact that God will take vengeance against the enemies of his people. Cf. NAB &#8220;oaks of justice.&#8221;</p>
