<A NAME="51"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=205><b>tn</b> It is uncertain who is speaking here. Possibly the prophet, taking the role of best man, composes a love song for his friend on the occasion of his wedding.

The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dod</font>, &#8220;lover&#8221;) used in the second line is frequently used by the woman in the Song of Solomon to describe her lover. </p>
<A NAME="52"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=206><b>sn</b> Israel, viewing herself as the Lord&#8217;s lover, refers to herself as his vineyard.

Isaiah&#8217;s choice of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1503;</font>, a rare word for hill, may have been driven by paronomastic concerns, i.e., because <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1503;</font> sounds like <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kerem</font>, &#8220;vineyard&#8221;).</p>

<A NAME="544"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=248><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text reads literally, &#8220;and ruins, fatlings, resident aliens, will eat.&#8221; This part of the verse has occasioned various suggestions of emendation. The parallelism is tighter if the second line refers to animals grazing. The translation, &#8220;amid the ruins the fatlings and young sheep graze,&#8221; assumes an emendation of &#8220;resident aliens&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">garim</font>) to &#8220;young goats/sheep&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">gÿdayim</font>) &#8211; confusion of dalet and resh is quite common &#8211; and understands &#8220;fatlings&#8221; and &#8220;young sheep&#8221; taken as a compound subject or as in apposition as the subject of the verb. However, no emendations are necessary if the above translation is correct. The meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mekhim</font>) has a significant impact on one&#8217;s textual decision and translation. The noun can refer to a sacrificial (&#8220;fat&#8221;) animal as it does in its only other occurrence (Ps 66:15). However, it could signify the rich of the earth (&#8220;the fat ones of the earth&#8221;; Ps 22:29 [MT 30]) using a different word for &#8220;fatness&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">dashen</font>). If so, it serves a figurative reference to the rich. Consequently, the above translation coheres with the first half of the verse. Just as the sheep are out of place grazing in these places (&#8220;as in their pasture&#8221;), the sojourners would not have expected to have the chance to eat in these locations. Both animals and itinerant foreigners would eat in places not normal for them.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The image completes the picture begun in v. 14 and adds to the irony. When judgment comes, Sheol will eat up the sinners who frequent the feasts; then the banqueting halls will lie in ruins and only sheep will eat there.</p>

<A NAME="546"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=250><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text reads literally, &#8220;Woe to those who pull evil with the ropes of emptiness, and, as [with] ropes of a cart, sin.&#8221; Though several textual details are unclear, the basic idea is apparent. The sinners are so attached to their sinful ways (compared here to a heavy load) that they strain to drag them along behind them. If <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shavÿ</font>&#8217;, &#8220;emptiness&#8221;) is retained, it makes a further comment on their lifestyle, denouncing it as one that is devoid of what is right and destined to lead to nothing but destruction. Because &#8220;emptiness&#8221; does not form a very tight parallel with &#8220;cart&#8221; in the next line, some emend <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;</font> to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">she</font>, &#8220;sheep&#8221;) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1490;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">agalah</font>, &#8220;cart&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1490;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">egel</font>, &#8220;calf&#8221;): &#8220;Those who pull evil along with a <i>sheep halter</i> are as good as dead who pull sin with a <i>calf rope</i>&#8221; (following the lead of the LXX and improving the internal parallelism of the verse). In this case, the verse pictures the sinners pulling sin along behind them as one pulls an animal with a halter. For a discussion of this view, see J. N. Oswalt, <i>Isaiah</i> (NICOT), 1:163, n. 1. Nevertheless, this emendation is unnecessary. The above translation emphasizes the folly of the Israelites who hold on to their sin (and its punishment) even while they hope for divine intervention. </p>

The reference to his &#8220;work&#8221; alludes back to v. 12, which refers to his &#8216;work&#8221; of judgment. With these words the people challenged the prophet&#8217;s warning of approaching judgment. They were in essence saying that they saw no evidence that God was about to work in such a way. </p>

<A NAME="553"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=257><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;[who] before their faces are understanding.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Verses 18-21 contain three &#8220;woe-sayings&#8221; that are purely accusatory and have no formal announcement of judgment attached (as in the &#8220;woe-sayings&#8221; recorded in vv. 8-17). While this lack of symmetry is odd, it has a clear rhetorical purpose. Having established a pattern in vv. 8-17, the prophet deviates from it in vv. 18-21 to grab his audience&#8217;s attention. By placing the &#8220;woes&#8221; in rapid succession and heaping up the accusatory elements, he highlights the people&#8217;s guilt and introduces an element of tension and anticipation. One is reasonably certain that judgment will come, and when it does, it will be devastating. This anticipated devastation is described in frightening detail after the sixth and final woe (see vv. 22-30). </p>
<A NAME="554"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=258><b>tn</b> The language used here is quite sarcastic and paves the way for the shocking description of the enemy army in vv. 25-30.

The accusatory elements of vv. 8, 11-12, 18-23 are arranged in a chiastic manner: (A) social injustice (8), (B) carousing (11-12a), (C) spiritual insensitivity (12b) // (C') spiritual insensitivity (18-21), (B') carousing (22), (A') social injustice (23).</p>
