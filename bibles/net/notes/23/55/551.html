<A NAME="551"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2320><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hoy</font>, &#8220;woe, ah&#8221;) was used in funeral laments and is often prefixed to judgment oracles for rhetorical effect.
