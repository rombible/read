<A NAME="5511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2330><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the reliable expressions of loyalty of David.&#8221; The syntactical relationship of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1505;&#1456;&#1491;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khasde</font>, &#8220;expressions of loyalty&#8221;) to the preceding line is unclear. If the term is appositional to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿrit</font>, &#8220;covenant&#8221;), then the Lord here transfers the promises of the Davidic covenant to the entire nation. Another option is to take <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1505;&#1456;&#1491;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khasde</font>) as an adverbial accusative and to translate &#8220;according to the reliable covenantal promises.&#8221; In this case the new covenantal arrangement proposed here is viewed as an extension or perhaps fulfillment of the Davidic promises. A third option, the one reflected in the above translation, is to take the last line as comparative. In this case the new covenant being proposed is analogous to the Davidic covenant. Verses 4-5, which compare David&#8217;s international prominence to what Israel will experience, favors this view. In all three of these interpretations, &#8220;David&#8221; is an objective genitive; he is the recipient of covenantal promises. A fourth option would be to take David as a subjective genitive and understand the line as giving the basis for the preceding promise: &#8220;Then I will make an unconditional covenantal promise to you, because of David&#8217;s faithful acts of covenantal loyalty.&#8221;</p>
