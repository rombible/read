Israel can be certain that repentance will bring forgiveness and a new covenantal relationship because God&#8217;s promises are reliable. In contrast to human plans (or &#8220;thoughts&#8221;), which are destined to fail (Ps 94:11) apart from divine approval (Prov 19:21), and human deeds (or &#8220;ways&#8221;), which are evil and lead to destruction (Prov 1:15-19; 3:31-33; 4:19), God&#8217;s plans are realized and his deeds accomplish something positive. </p>
