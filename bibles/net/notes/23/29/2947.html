<A NAME="2947"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1248><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;So this is what the Lord says to the house of Jacob, the one who ransomed Abraham.&#8221; The relative pronoun must refer back to &#8220;the Lord,&#8221; not to the immediately preceding &#8220;Jacob.&#8221; It is uncertain to what event in Abraham&#8217;s experience this refers. Perhaps the name &#8220;Abraham&#8221; stands here by metonymy for his descendants through Jacob. If so, the Exodus is in view. </p>
