<A NAME="2938"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1239><b>sn</b> The meaning of this verse is debated, but it seems to depict a reversal in fortunes. The mighty forest of Lebanon (symbolic of the proud and powerful, see 2:13; 10:34) will be changed into a common orchard, while the common orchard (symbolic of the oppressed and lowly) will grow into a great forest. See J. N. Oswalt, <i>Isaiah</i> (NICOT), 1:538. </p>
