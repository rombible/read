<A NAME="334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1405><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Be their arm each morning.&#8221; &#8220;Arm&#8221; is a symbol for strength. The <i>mem</i> suffixed to the noun has been traditionally understood as a third person suffix, but this is contrary to the context, where the people speak of themselves in the first person. The <i>mem</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;</font>) is probably enclitic with ellipsis of the pronoun, which can be supplied from the context. See J. N. Oswalt, <i>Isaiah</i> (NICOT), 1:589, n. 1. </p>
