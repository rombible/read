<A NAME="3317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1418><b>tn</b> The meaning of the Hebrew word is unknown. Proposals include &#8220;heroes&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV &#8220;valiant ones&#8221;; NASB, NIV &#8220;brave men&#8221;); &#8220;priests,&#8221; &#8220;residents [of Jerusalem].&#8221; The present translation assumes that the term is synonymous with &#8220;messengers of peace,&#8221; with which it corresponds in the parallel structure of the verse.</p>
