<A NAME="501"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2145><b>sn</b> The Lord challenges the exiles (Zion&#8217;s children) to bring incriminating evidence against him. The rhetorical questions imply that Israel accused the Lord of divorcing his wife (Zion) and selling his children (the Israelites) into slavery to pay off a debt. </p>
<A NAME="502"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2146><b>sn</b> The Lord admits that he did sell the Israelites, but it was because of their sins, not because of some debt he owed. If he had sold them to a creditor, they ought to be able to point him out, but the preceding rhetorical question implies they would not be able to do so. </p>
<A NAME="503"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2147><b>sn</b> The Lord admits he did divorce Zion, but that too was the result of the nation&#8217;s sins. The force of the earlier rhetorical question comes into clearer focus now. The question does not imply that a certificate does not exist and that no divorce occurred. Rather, the question asks for the certificate to be produced so the accuser can see the reason for the divorce in black and white. The Lord did not put Zion away arbitrarily.</p>
<A NAME="504"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2148><b>sn</b> The present tense translation of the verbs assumes that the Lord is questioning why Israel does not attempt to counter his arguments. Another possibility is to take the verbs as referring to past events: &#8220;Why did no one meet me when I came? Why did no one answer when I called?&#8221; In this case the Lord might be asking why Israel rejected his calls to repent and his offer to deliver them.</p>
<A NAME="505"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2149><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;short&#8221; (so NAB, NASB, NIV).</p>
<A NAME="506"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2150><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;ransom&#8221; (NAB, NASB, NIV).</p>
<A NAME="507"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2151><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;with my rebuke.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="508"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2152><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the fish stink from lack of water and die from thirst.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="509"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2153><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;has given to me a tongue of disciples.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Verses 4-11 contain the third of the so-called servant songs, which depict the career of the Lord&#8217;s special servant, envisioned as an ideal Israel (49:3) who rescues the exiles and fulfills God&#8217;s purposes for the world. Here the servant alludes to opposition (something hinted at in 49:4), but also expresses his determination to persevere with the Lord&#8217;s help. </p>
<A NAME="5010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2154><b>tc</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;to know [?] the weary with a word.&#8221; Comparing it with Arabic and Aramaic cognates yields the meaning of &#8220;help, sustain.&#8221; Nevertheless, the meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ut</font>) is uncertain. The word occurs only here in the OT (see BDB 736 s.v.). Various scholars have suggested an emendation to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anot</font>) from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anah</font>, &#8220;answer&#8221;): &#8220;so that I know how to respond kindly to the weary.&#8221; Since the Qumran scroll 1QIsa<sup>a</sup> and the Vulgate support the MT reading, that reading is retained.</p>
<A NAME="5011"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2155><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;he arouses for me an ear, to hear like disciples.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5012"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2156><b>tn</b> Or perhaps, &#8220;makes me obedient.&#8221; The text reads literally, &#8220;has opened for me an ear.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5013"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2157><b>tn</b> Or perhaps, &#8220;who beat [me].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5014"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2158><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Therefore I set my face like flint.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5015"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2159><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Let us stand together!&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2160><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Who is the master of my judgment?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5017"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2161><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;let him approach me&#8221;; NAB, NIV &#8220;Let him confront me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5018"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2162><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;[who] listens to the voice of his servant?&#8221; The interrogative is understood by ellipsis (note the preceding line).</p>
<A NAME="5019"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2163><b>tn</b> The plural indicates degree. Darkness may refer to exile and/or moral evil.</p>
<A NAME="5020"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2164><b>tc</b> Several more recent commentators have proposed an emendation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1494;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">azzÿre</font>, &#8220;who put on&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">iri</font>, &#8220;who light&#8221;). However, both Qumran scrolls of Isaiah and the Vulgate support the MT reading (cf. NIV, ESV).</p>
<A NAME="5021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2165><b>tn</b> On the meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1460;&#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ziqot</font>, &#8220;flaming arrows&#8221;), see <i>HALOT</i> 268 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1460;&#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font>.</p>
<A NAME="5022"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2166><b>tn</b> The imperative is probably rhetorical and has a predictive force.</p>
<A NAME="5023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2167><b>tn</b> Or perhaps, &#8220;flame&#8221; (so ASV).</p>
<A NAME="5024"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2168><b>sn</b> Perhaps the servant here speaks to his enemies and warns them that they will self-destruct.</p>
<A NAME="5025"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2169><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;from my hand&#8221; (so NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="5026"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2170><b>sn</b> The imagery may be that of a person who becomes ill and is forced to lie down in pain on a sickbed. Some see this as an allusion to a fiery place of damnation because of the imagery employed earlier in the verse. </p>
