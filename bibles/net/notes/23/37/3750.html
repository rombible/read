<A NAME="3750"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1601><b>tc</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;your going out and your coming in and how you have raged against me.&#8221; Several scholars have suggested that this line is probably dittographic (note the beginning of the next line). However, most English translations include the statement in question at the end of v. 28 and the beginning of v. 29. Interestingly, the LXX does not have this clause at the end of v. 28 and the Qumran scroll 1QIsa<sup>a</sup> does not have it at the beginning of v. 29. In light of this ambiguous manuscript evidence, it appears best to retain the clause in both verses.</p>
