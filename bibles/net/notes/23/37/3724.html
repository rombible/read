<A NAME="3724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1575><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text has the plural, &#8220;letters.&#8221; The final <i>mem</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1501;</font>) may be dittographic (note the initial <i>mem</i> on the form that immediately follows). Some Greek and Aramaic witnesses have the singular. If so, one still has to deal with the yod that is part of the plural ending. J. N. Oswalt refers to various commentators who have suggested ways to understand the plural form (<i>Isaiah</i> [NICOT], 1:652).</p>
