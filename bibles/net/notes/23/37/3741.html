<A NAME="3741"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1592><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text has simply, &#8220;I dug and drank water.&#8221; But the parallel text in 2 Kgs 19:24 has &#8220;foreign waters.&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zarim</font>, &#8220;foreign&#8221;) may have accidentally dropped out of the Isaianic text by homoioteleuton (cf. NCV, NIV, NLT). Note that the preceding word, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mayim</font>, &#8220;water) also ends in <i>mem</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1501;</font>). The Qumran scroll 1QIsa<sup>a</sup> has &#8220;foreign waters&#8221; for this line. However, in several other passages the 1QIsa<sup>a</sup> scroll harmonizes with 2 Kgs 19 against the MT (Isa 36:5; 37:9, 20). Since the addition of &#8220;foreign&#8221; to this text in Isaiah by a later scribe would be more likely than its deletion, the MT reading should be accepted.</p>
