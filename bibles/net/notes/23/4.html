<A NAME="41"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=184><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;in that day&#8221; (ASV).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The seven to one ratio emphasizes the great disparity that will exist in the population due to the death of so many men in battle.</p>
<A NAME="42"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=185><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;eat&#8221; (so NASB, NIV, NRSV); CEV &#8220;buy.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="43"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=186><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;wear&#8221; (so NASB, NRSV); NCV &#8220;make.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="44"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=187><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;only let your name be called over us.&#8221; The Hebrew idiom &#8220;call the name over&#8221; indicates ownership. See 2 Sam 12:28, and BDB 896 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1464;&#1511;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;</font> Niph. 2.d.(4). The language reflects the cultural reality of ancient Israel, where women were legally the property of their husbands. </p>
<A NAME="45"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=188><b>sn</b> This refers to the humiliation of being unmarried and childless. The women&#8217;s words reflect the cultural standards of ancient Israel, where a woman&#8217;s primary duties were to be a wife and mother. </p>
<A NAME="46"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=189><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;in that day&#8221; (KJV).</p>
<A NAME="47"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=190><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and the vegetation of the Lord will become beauty and honor.&#8221; Many English versions understand the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1462;&#1502;&#1463;&#1495; &#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsemakh yÿhvah</font>) as a messianic reference and render it, &#8220;the Branch of the Lord&#8221; (so KJV, NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV, NLT, and others). Though <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1462;&#1502;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsemakh</font>) is used by later prophets of a royal descendant (Jer 23;5; 33:15; Zech 3:8; 6:12), those passages contain clear contextual indicators that a human ruler is in view and that the word is being used in a metaphorical way of offspring. However, in Isa 4:2 there are no such contextual indicators. To the contrary, in the parallel structure of the verse <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1462;&#1502;&#1463;&#1495; &#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> corresponds to &#8220;produce of the land,&#8221; a phrase that refers elsewhere exclusively to literal agricultural produce (see Num 13:20, 26; Deut 1:25). In the majority of its uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1462;&#1502;&#1463;&#1495;</font> refers to literal crops or vegetation (in Ps 65:10 the Lord is the source of this vegetation). A reference to the Lord restoring crops would make excellent sense in Isa 4 and the prophets frequently included this theme in their visions of the future age (see Isa 30:23-24; 32:20; Jer 31:12; Ezek 34:26-29; and Amos 9:13-14).</p>
<A NAME="48"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=191><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and the fruit of the land will become pride and beauty for the remnant of Israel.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="49"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=192><b>tn</b> The verb that introduces this verse serves as a discourse particle and is untranslated; see note on &#8220;in the future&#8221; in 2:2.</p>
<A NAME="410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=193><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=194><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;set apart,&#8221; cf. CEV &#8220;special.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=195><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;all who are written down for life in Jerusalem.&#8221; A city register is envisioned; everyone whose name appears on the roll will be spared. This group comprises the remnant of the city referred to earlier in the verse. </p>
<A NAME="413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=196><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;when&#8221; (so KJV, NAB, NASB); CEV &#8220;after&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;once.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=197><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term translated &#8220;sovereign master&#8221; here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adonai</font>).</p>
<A NAME="415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=198><b>tn</b> The word refers elsewhere to vomit (Isa 28:8) and fecal material (Isa 36:12). Many English versions render this somewhat euphemistically as &#8220;filth&#8221; (e.g., NAB, NIV, NRSV). Ironically in God&#8217;s sight the beautiful jewelry described earlier is nothing but vomit and feces, for it symbolizes the moral decay of the city&#8217;s residents (cf. NLT &#8220;moral filth&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=199><b>sn</b> See 1:21 for a related concept.</p>
<A NAME="417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=200><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;by a spirit of judgment and by a spirit of burning.&#8221; The precise meaning of the second half of the verse is uncertain. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ruakh</font>) can be understood as &#8220;wind&#8221; in which case the passage pictures the Lord using a destructive wind as an instrument of judgment. However, this would create a mixed metaphor, for the first half of the verse uses the imagery of washing and rinsing to depict judgment. Perhaps the image would be that of a windstorm accompanied by heavy rain. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> can also mean &#8220;spirit,&#8221; in which case the verse may be referring to the Lord&#8217;s Spirit or, more likely, to a disposition that the Lord brings to the task of judgment. It is also uncertain if <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ar</font>) here means &#8220;burning&#8221; or &#8220;sweeping away, devastating.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=201><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;over all the place, Mount Zion.&#8221; Cf. NLT &#8220;Jerusalem&#8221;; CEV &#8220;the whole city.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=202><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;a cloud by day, and smoke, and brightness of fire, a flame by night.&#8221; Though the accents in the Hebrew text suggest otherwise, it might be preferable to take &#8220;smoke&#8221; with what follows, since one would expect smoke to accompany fire.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The imagery of the cloud by day and fire by night recalls the days of Moses, when a cloud and fire were tangible reminders that the Lord was guiding and protecting his people (Exod 13:21-22; 14:19, 24). In the future age envisioned in Isa 4, the Lord&#8217;s protective presence will be a reality. </p>
<A NAME="420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=203><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;indeed (or &#8220;for&#8221;) over all the glory, a canopy.&#8221; This may allude to Exod 40:34-35, where a cloud overshadows the meeting tent as it is filled with God&#8217;s glory.</p>
<A NAME="421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=204><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;a shelter it will be for shade by day from heat, and for a place of refuge and for a hiding place from cloudburst and rain.&#8221; Since both of the last nouns of this verse can mean rain, they can either refer to the rain storm and the rain as distinct items or together refer to a heavy downpour. Regardless, they do not represent unrelated phenomena.</p>
