<A NAME="91"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=384><b>tn</b> It is uncertain if the prophet or the Lord is speaking in vv. 19-22. If the latter, then vv. 19-22 resume the speech recorded in vv. 12-15, after the prophet&#8217;s response in vv. 16-18. </p>
<A NAME="92"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=385><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;inquire of the ritual pits and of the magicians who chirp and mutter.&#8221; The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ov</font>, &#8220;ritual pit&#8221;) refers to a pit used by a magician to conjure up underworld spirits. In 1 Sam 28:7 the witch of Endor is called a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;</font>-<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alat-</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ov</font>, &#8220;owner of a ritual pit&#8221;). See H. Hoffner, &#8220;Second Millennium Antecedents to the Hebrew &#8217;<font face="Scholar">OñBù</font>,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 86 (1967): 385-401.</p>
<A NAME="93"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=386><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Should a nation not inquire of its gods on behalf of the living, (by inquiring) of the dead?&#8221; These words appear to be a continuation of the quotation begun in the first part of the verse. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohayv</font>) may be translated &#8220;its gods&#8221; or &#8220;its God.&#8221; Some take the second half of the verse as the prophet&#8217;s (or the Lord&#8217;s) rebuke of the people who advise seeking oracles at the ritual pits, but in this case the words &#8220;the dead on behalf of the living&#8221; are difficult to explain.</p>
<A NAME="94"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=387><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;to [the] instruction and to [the] testimony.&#8221; The words &#8220;then you must recall&#8221; are supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons. In the Hebrew text vv. 19-20a are one long sentence, reading literally, &#8220;When they say to you&#8230;, to the instruction and to the testimony.&#8221; On the identity of the &#8220;instruction&#8221; and &#8220;testimony&#8221; see the notes at v. 16.</p>
<A NAME="95"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=388><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;If they do not speak according to this word, [it is] because it has no light of dawn.&#8221; The literal translation suggests that &#8220;this word&#8221; refers to the instruction/testimony. However, it is likely that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im-lo</font>&#8217;) is asseverative here, as in 5:9. In this case &#8220;this word&#8221; refers to the quotation recorded in v. 19. For a discussion of the problem see J. N. Oswalt, <i>Isaiah</i> (NICOT), 230, n. 9. The singular pronoun in the second half of the verse is collective, referring back to the nation (see v. 19b).</p>
<A NAME="96"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=389><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;he will pass through it.&#8221; The subject of the collective singular verb is the nation. (See the preceding note.) The immediately preceding context supplies no antecedent for &#8220;it&#8221; (a third feminine singular suffix in the Hebrew text); the suffix may refer to the land, which would be a reasonable referent with a verb of motion. Note also that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">erets</font>, &#8220;land&#8221;) does appear at the beginning of the next verse.</p>
<A NAME="97"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=390><b>tn</b> The verb that introduces this verse serves as a discourse particle and is untranslated; see note on &#8220;in the future&#8221; in 2:2.</p>

<A NAME="910"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=393><b>tn</b> The precise meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">uf</font>) is uncertain; the word occurs only here.

<A NAME="911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=394><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220; and darkness, pushed.&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1504;&#1467;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿnudakh</font>) appears to be a Pual participle from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1491;&#1495;</font> (&#8220;push&#8221;), but the Piel is unattested for this verb and the Pual occurs only here.</p>
<A NAME="912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=395><b>sn</b> In the Hebrew text (<i>BHS</i>) the chapter division comes one verse later than in the English Bible; 9:1 (8:23 HT). Thus 9:2-21 in the English Bible = 9:1-20 in the Hebrew text. Beginning with <b>10:1</b> the verse numbers in the English Bible and the Hebrew Bible are again the same.</p>
<A NAME="913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=396><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text reads, &#8220;Indeed there is no gloom for the one to whom there was anxiety for her.&#8221; The feminine singular pronominal suffix &#8220;her&#8221; must refer to the land (cf. vv. 22a, 23b). So one could translate, &#8220;Indeed there will be no gloom for the land which was anxious.&#8221; In this case the statement introduces the positive message to follow. Some assume an emendation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;, &#8220;no&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>, &#8220;to him&#8221;) and of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lah</font>, &#8220;to her&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>, &#8220;to him&#8221;), yielding this literal reading: &#8220;indeed there is gloom for him, for the one to whom there was anxiety for him.&#8221; In this case the statement concludes the preceding description of judgment.</p>
<A NAME="914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=397><b>tn</b> The Lord must be understood as the subject of the two verbs in this verse.</p>
<A NAME="915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=398><b>sn</b> The statement probably alludes to the Assyrian conquest of Israel in ca. 734-733 <sc>b.c., when Tiglath-pileser III annexed much of Israel&#8217;s territory and reduced Samaria to a puppet state. </p>
<A NAME="916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=399><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>Just as in earlier times he humiliated&#8230;, [in] the latter times he has brought honor.&#8221; The main verbs in vv. 1b-4 are Hebrew perfects. The prophet takes his rhetorical stance in the future age of restoration and describes future events as if they have already occurred. To capture the dramatic effect of the original text, the translation uses the English present or present perfect. </p>
<A NAME="917"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=400><b>sn</b> These three geographical designations may refer to provinces established by the Assyrians in 734-733 <sc>b.c. The &#8220;way of the sea&#8221; is the province of Dor, along the Mediterranean coast, the &#8220;region beyond the Jordan&#8221; is the province of Gilead in Transjordan, and &#8220;Galilee of the nations&#8221; (a title that alludes to how the territory had been overrun by foreigners) is the province of Megiddo located west of the Sea of Galilee. See Y. Aharoni, <i>Land of the Bible</i>, 374.</p>
<A NAME="918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=401><b>sn</b> The darkness symbolizes judgment and its effects (see 8:22); the light represents deliverance and its effects, brought about by the emergence of a conquering Davidic king (see vv. 3-6).</p>
<A NAME="919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=402><b>tn</b> Traditionally <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1493;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsalmavet</font>) has been interpreted as a compound noun, meaning &#8220;shadow of death&#8221; (so KJV, ASV, NIV), but usage indicates that the word, though it sometimes refers to death, means &#8220;darkness.&#8221; The term should probably be repointed as an abstract noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsalmut</font>). See the note at Ps 23:4.</p>
<A NAME="920"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=403><b>sn</b> The Lord is addressed directly in vv. 3-4.</p>
<A NAME="921"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=404><b>tc</b> The Hebrew consonantal text reads &#8220;You multiply the nation, you do not make great the joy.&#8221; The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;, &#8220;not&#8221;) is obviously incorrect; the marginal reading has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>, &#8220;to him&#8221;). In this case, one should translate, &#8220;You multiply the nation, you increase his (i.e., their) joy.&#8221; However, the parallelism is tighter if one emends <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497; &#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hagoy lo</font>, &#8220;the nation, to him&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">haggilah</font>, &#8220;the joy,&#8221; a noun attested in Isa 65:18), which corresponds to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hasimkhah</font>, &#8220;the joy&#8221;) later in the verse (H. Wildberger, <i>Isaiah</i>, 1:386). As attractive as this reading is, it has not textual evidence supporting it. The MT reading (accepting the marginal reading &#8220;to him&#8221; for the negative particle &#8220;not&#8221;) affirms that Yahweh caused the nation to grow in population and increased their joy.</p>
<A NAME="922"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=405><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;as they are happy.&#8221; The word &#8220;warriors&#8221; is supplied in the translation to clarify the word picture. This last simile comes close to reality, for vv. 4-5 indicate that the people have won a great military victory over their oppressors.</p>
<A NAME="923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=406><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;for the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the scepter of the oppressor against him.&#8221; The singular pronouns are collective, referring to the people. The oppressed nation is compared to an ox weighed down by a heavy yoke and an animal that is prodded and beaten. </p>
<A NAME="924"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=407><b>sn</b> This alludes to Gideon&#8217;s victory over Midian (Judg 7-8), when the Lord delivered Israel from an oppressive foreign invader.</p>
<A NAME="925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=408><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Indeed every boot marching with shaking.&#8221; On the meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">on</font>, &#8220;boot&#8221;) and the related denominative verb, both of which occur only here, see <i>HALOT</i> 738 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font>.</p>
<A NAME="926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=409><b>tn</b> The Hebrew perfect (translated &#8220;has been born&#8221; and &#8220;has been given&#8221;) is used here as the prophet takes a rhetorical stance in the future. See the note at 9:1.</p>
<A NAME="927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=410><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;and dominion was on his shoulders and he called his name.&#8221; The prefixed verbs with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive are used with the same rhetorical sense as the perfects in v. 6a. See the preceding note. There is great debate over the syntactical structure of the verse. No subject is indicated for the verb &#8220;he called.&#8221; If all the titles that follow are ones given to the king, then the subject of the verb must be indefinite, &#8220;one calls.&#8221; However, some have suggested that one to three of the titles that follow refer to God, not the king. For example, the traditional punctuation of the Hebrew text suggests the translation, &#8220;and the Extraordinary Strategist, the Mighty God calls his name, &#8216;Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.&#8217;&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="928"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=411><b>tn</b> Some have seen two titles here (&#8220;Wonderful&#8221; and &#8220;Counselor,&#8221; cf. KJV, ASV). However, the pattern of the following three titles (each contains two elements) and the use of the roots <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pala</font>&#8217;) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ats</font>) together in Isa 25:1 (cf. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497; &#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464; &#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1488; &#1506;&#1461;&#1510;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514; &#1502;&#1461;&#1512;&#1464;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1511; &#1488;&#1457;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492; &#1488;&#1465;&#1502;&#1462;&#1503;</font>) and 28:29 (cf. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488; &#1506;&#1461;&#1510;&#1464;&#1492;</font>) suggest otherwise. The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1506;&#1461;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ets</font>) could be taken as appositional (genitive or otherwise) of species (&#8220;a wonder, i.e., a wonder as a counselor,&#8221; cf. NAB &#8220;Wonder-Counselor&#8221;) or as a substantival participle for which <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1488;</font> provides the direct object (&#8220;one who counsels wonders&#8221;). <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1506;&#1461;&#1509;</font> is used as a royal title elsewhere (cf. Mic 4:9). Here it probably refers to the king&#8217;s ability to devise military strategy, as suggested by the context (cf. vv. 3-4 and the following title <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">el gibor</font>). In Isa 11:2 (also a description of this king) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1510;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">etsah</font>) is linked with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gÿvurah</font>, the latter being typically used of military might, cf. BDB 150 s.v.). Note also <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1510;&#1464;&#1492; &#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492; &#1500;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> in Isa 36:5. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pele</font>&#8217;) is typically used of God (cf. however Lam 1:9). Does this suggest the deity of the messianic ruler? The NT certainly teaches he is God, but did Isaiah necessarily have this in mind over 700 years before his birth? Since Isa 11:2 points out that this king will receive the spirit of the Lord, which will enable him to counsel, it is possible to argue that the king&#8217;s counsel is &#8220;extraordinary&#8221; because it finds its source in the divine spirit. Thus this title does not necessarily suggest that the ruler is deity.</p>
<A NAME="929"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=412><b>tn</b> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gibbor</font>) is probably an attributive adjective (&#8220;mighty God&#8221;), though one might translate &#8220;God is a warrior&#8221; or &#8220;God is mighty.&#8221; Scholars have interpreted this title is two ways. A number of them have argued that the title portrays the king as God&#8217;s representative on the battlefield, whom God empowers in a supernatural way (see J. H. Hayes and S. A. Irvine, <i>Isaiah</i>, 181-82). They contend that this sense seems more likely in the original context of the prophecy. They would suggest that having read the NT, we might in retrospect interpret this title as indicating the coming king&#8217;s deity, but it is unlikely that Isaiah or his audience would have understood the title in such a bold way. Ps 45:6 addresses the Davidic king as &#8220;God&#8221; because he ruled and fought as God&#8217;s representative on earth. Ancient Near Eastern art and literature picture gods training kings for battle, bestowing special weapons, and intervening in battle. According to Egyptian propaganda, the Hittites described Rameses II as follows: &#8220;No man is he who is among us, It is Seth great-of-strength, Baal in person; Not deeds of man are these his doings, They are of one who is unique&#8221; (See Miriam Lichtheim, <i>Ancient Egyptian Literature</i>, 2:67). According to proponents of this view, Isa 9:6 probably envisions a similar kind of response when friends and foes alike look at the Davidic king in full battle regalia. When the king&#8217;s enemies oppose him on the battlefield, they are, as it were, fighting against God himself. The other option is to regard this title as a reference to God, confronting Isaiah&#8217;s readers with the divinity of this promised &#8220;child.&#8221; The use of this same title that clearly refers to God in a later passage (Isa 10:21) supports this interpretation. Other passages depict Yahweh as the great God and great warrior (Deut 10:17; Jer. 32:18). Although this connection of a child who is born with deity is unparalleled in any earlier biblical texts, Isaiah&#8217;s use of this title to make this connection represents Isaiah&#8217;s attempt (at God&#8217;s behest) to advance Israel in their understanding of the ideal Davidic king for whom they long.</p>
<A NAME="930"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=413><b>tn</b> This title must not be taken in an anachronistic Trinitarian sense. (To do so would be theologically problematic, for the &#8220;Son&#8221; is the messianic king and is distinct in his person from God the &#8220;Father.&#8221;) Rather, in its original context the title pictures the king as the protector of his people. For a similar use of &#8220;father&#8221; see Isa 22:21 and Job 29:16. This figurative, idiomatic use of &#8220;father&#8221; is not limited to the Bible. In a Phoenician inscription (ca. 850-800 <sc>b.c.) the ruler Kilamuwa declares: &#8220;To some I was a father, to others I was a mother.&#8221; In another inscription (ca. 800 <sc>b.c.) the ruler Azitawadda boasts that the god Baal made him &#8220;a father and a mother&#8221; to his people. (See <i>ANET</i> 499-500.) The use of &#8220;everlasting&#8221; might suggest the deity of the king (as the one who has total control over eternity), but Isaiah and his audience may have understood the term as royal hyperbole emphasizing the king&#8217;s long reign or enduring dynasty (for examples of such hyperbolic language used of the Davidic king, see 1 Kgs 1:31; Pss 21:4-6; 61:6-7; 72:5, 17). The New Testament indicates that the hyperbolic language (as in the case of the title &#8220;Mighty God&#8221;) is literally realized in the ultimate fulfillment of the prophecy, for Jesus will rule eternally.</p>
<A NAME="931"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=414><b>tn</b> This title pictures the king as one who establishes a safe socio-economic environment for his people. It hardly depicts him as a meek individual, for he establishes peace through military strength (as the preceding context and the first two royal titles indicate). His people experience safety and prosperity because their invincible king destroys their enemies. See Pss 72 and 144 for parallels to these themes. </p>

It may have been written prior to the Assyrian conquest of the northern kingdom in 734-733 <sc>b.c., or sometime between that invasion and the downfall of Samaria in 722 <sc>b.c.

Since the Syrians and Israelites were allies by 735 <sc>b.c. (see 7:1), the hostilities described probably occurred earlier, while Israel was still pro-Assyrian.

In either case, the metaphor is that of a desperately hungry man who resorts to an almost unthinkable act to satisfy his appetite. He eats everything he can find to his right, but still being unsatisfied, then turns to his left and eats everything he can find there. Still being desperate for food, he then resorts to eating his own flesh (or offspring, as this phrase is metaphorically understood by some English versions, e.g., NIV, NCV, TEV, NLT). The reality behind the metaphor is the political turmoil of the period, as the next verse explains. There was civil strife within the northern kingdom; even the descendants of Joseph were at each other&#8217;s throats. Then the northern kingdom turned on their southern brother, Judah.</p>
