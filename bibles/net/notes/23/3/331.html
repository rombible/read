<A NAME="331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=158><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text has &#8220;nations,&#8221; but the preceding and following contexts make it clear that the Lord is judging his covenant people. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amim</font>) should be changed (with support from the LXX) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1502;&#1493;</font>. The final <i>mem</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1501;</font>) on the form in the Hebrew is either dittographic or enclitic. When the <i>mem</i> was added or read as a plural ending, the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) was then misread as a <i>yod</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font>). </p>
