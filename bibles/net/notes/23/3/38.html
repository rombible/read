<A NAME="38"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=135><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;the Lord says&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarification. The prophet speaks in vv. 1-3 (note the third person reference to the Lord in v. 1), but here the Lord himself announces that he will intervene in judgment. It is unclear where the Lord&#8217;s words end and the prophet&#8217;s pick up again. The prophet is apparently speaking again by v. 8, where the Lord is referred to in the third person. Since vv. 4-7 comprise a thematic unity, the quotation probably extends through v. 7.</p>
