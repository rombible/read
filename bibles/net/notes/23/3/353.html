<A NAME="353"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=180><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and it will be in place of spices there will be a stench.&#8221; The nouns for &#8220;spices&#8221; and &#8220;stench&#8221; are right next to each other in the MT for emphatic contrast. The verb that introduces this verse serves as a discourse particle and is untranslated; see note on &#8220;in the future&#8221; in 2:2.</p>
