<A NAME="39"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=136><b>tn</b> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ta</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alulim</font>) is often understood as an abstract plural meaning &#8220;wantonness, cruelty&#8221; (cf. NLT). In this case the chief characteristic of these leaders is substituted for the leaders themselves. However, several translations make the parallelism tighter by emending the form to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">olÿlim</font>, &#8220;children&#8221;; cf. ESV, NASB, NCV, NIV, NKJV, NRSV). This emendation is unnecessary for at least two reasons. The word in the MT highlights the cruelty or malice of the &#8220;leaders&#8221; who are left behind in the wake of God&#8217;s judgment. The immediate context makes clear the fact that they are mere youths. The coming judgment will sweep away the leaders, leaving a vacuum which will be filled by incompetent, inexperienced youths.</p>
