<A NAME="1463"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=700><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;flying burning one.&#8221; The designation &#8220;burning one&#8221; may allude to the serpent&#8217;s appearance or the effect of its poisonous bite. (See the note at 6:2.) The qualifier &#8220;flying&#8221; probably refers to the serpent&#8217;s quick, darting movements, though one might propose a homonym here, meaning &#8220;biting.&#8221; (See J. N. Oswalt, <i>Isaiah</i> [NICOT], 1:332, n. 18.) Some might think in terms of a mythological flying, fire breathing dragon (cf. NAB &#8220;a flying saraph&#8221;; CEV &#8220;a flying fiery dragon&#8221;), but this proposal does not make good sense in 30:6, where the phrase &#8220;flying burning one&#8221; appears again in a list of desert animals. </p>
