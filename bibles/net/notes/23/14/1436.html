<A NAME="1436"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=673><b>sn</b> It is unclear where the quotation of the kings, begun in v. 10b, ends. However, the reference to the &#8220;kings of the nations&#8221; in v. 18 (see also v. 9) seems to indicate that the quotation has ended at this point and that Israel&#8217;s direct taunt (cf. vv. 4b-10a) has resumed. In fact the references to the &#8220;kings of the nations&#8221; may form a stylistic inclusio or frame around the quotation.</p>
