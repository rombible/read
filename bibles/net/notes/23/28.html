<A NAME="2820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1163><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Who is he teaching knowledge? For whom is he explaining a message?&#8221; The translation assumes that the Lord is the subject of the verbs &#8220;teaching&#8221; and &#8220;explaining,&#8221; and that the prophet is asking the questions. See v. 12. According to some vv. 9-10 record the people&#8217;s sarcastic response to the Lord&#8217;s message through Isaiah. </p>
<A NAME="2821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1164><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;from the breasts.&#8221; The words &#8220;their mother&#8217;s&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarification. The translation assumes that this is the prophet&#8217;s answer to the questions asked in the first half of the verse. The Lord is trying to instruct people who are &#8220;infants&#8221; morally and ethically.</p>
<A NAME="2822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1165><b>tn</b> The meaning of this verse has been debated. The text has literally &#8220;indeed [or &#8220;for&#8221;] a little there, a little there&#8221; ( <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497; &#1510;&#1463;&#1493; &#1500;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1493; &#1510;&#1463;&#1493; &#1500;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1493; &#1511;&#1463;&#1493; &#1500;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1493; &#1511;&#1463;&#1493;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ki tsav latsav</font>,<font face="Scholar"> tsav latsav</font>,<font face="Scholar"> qav laqav</font>,<font face="Scholar"> qav laqav</font>). The present translation assumes that the repetitive syllables are gibberish that resembles baby talk (cf v. 9b) and mimics what the people will hear when foreign invaders conquer the land (v. 11). In this case <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1456;&#1506;&#1461;&#1497;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">er</font>, &#8220;a little&#8221;) refers to the short syllabic structure of the babbling (cf. CEV). Some take <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1463;&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsav</font>) as a derivative of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsavah</font>, &#8220;command&#8221;) and translate the first part of the statement as &#8220;command after command, command after command.&#8221; Proponents of this position (followed by many English versions) also take <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1463;&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qav</font>) as a noun meaning &#8220;measuring line&#8221; (see v. 17), understood here in the abstract sense of &#8220;standard&#8221; or &#8220;rule.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1166><b>sn</b> This verse alludes to the coming Assyrian invasion, when the people will hear a foreign language that sounds like gibberish to them. The Lord is the subject of the verb &#8220;will speak,&#8221; as v. 12 makes clear. He once spoke in meaningful terms, but in the coming judgment he will speak to them, as it were, through the mouth of foreign oppressors. The apparent gibberish they hear will be an outward reminder that God has decreed their defeat. </p>
<A NAME="2824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1167><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;who said to them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1168><b>sn</b> This message encapsulates the Lord&#8217;s invitation to his people to find security in his protection and blessing.</p>
<A NAME="2826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1169><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;And the word of the Lord will be to them, &#8216;tsahv latsahv,&#8217; etc.&#8221; See the note at v. 10. In this case the &#8220;Lord&#8217;s word&#8221; is not the foreigner&#8217;s strange sounding words (as in v. 10), but the Lord&#8217;s repeated appeals to them (like the one quoted in v. 12). As time goes on, the Lord&#8217;s appeals through the prophets will have no impact on the people; they will regard prophetic preaching as gibberish. </p>
<A NAME="2827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1170><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;as a result they will go and stumble backward.&#8221; Perhaps an infant falling as it attempts to learn to walk is the background image here (cf. v. 9b). The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿma</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">an</font>) could be taken as indicating purpose (&#8220;in order that&#8221;), rather than simple result. In this case the people&#8217;s insensitivity to the message is caused by the Lord as a means of expediting their downfall.</p>
<A NAME="2828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1171><b>sn</b> When divine warnings and appeals become gibberish to the spiritually insensitive, they have no guidance and are doomed to destruction.</p>
<A NAME="2829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1172><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="2830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1173><b>sn</b> Sheol is the underworld, land of the dead, according to the OT world view.</p>
<A NAME="2831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1174><b>tn</b> Elsewhere the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1494;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khozeh</font>) refers to a prophet who sees visions. In v. 18 the related term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khazut</font>, &#8220;vision&#8221;) is used. The parallelism in both verses (note &#8220;treaty&#8221;) seems to demand a meaning &#8220;agreement&#8221; for both nouns. Perhaps <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1494;&#1462;&#1492;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</font> are used in a metonymic sense in vv. 15 and 18. Another option is to propose a homonymic root. See J. N. Oswalt, <i>Isaiah</i> (NICOT), 1:514, and <i>HALOT</i> 301 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1494;&#1462;&#1492;</font>.</p>
<A NAME="2832"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1175><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the overwhelming scourge, when it passes by&#8221; (NRSV similar).</p>
<A NAME="2833"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1176><b>sn</b> &#8220;Lie&#8221; and &#8220;deceitful word&#8221; would not be the terms used by the people. They would likely use the words &#8220;promise&#8221; and &#8220;reliable word,&#8221; but the prophet substitutes &#8220;lie&#8221; and &#8220;deceitful word&#8221; to emphasize that this treaty with death will really prove to be disappointing.</p>
<A NAME="2834"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1177><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text has a third person verb form, which does not agree with the first person suffix that precedes. The form should be emended to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1465;&#1505;&#1461;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yosed</font>), a Qal active participle used in a present progressive or imminent future sense.</p>
<A NAME="2835"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1178><b>tn</b> Traditionally &#8220;tested,&#8221; but the implication is that it has passed the test and stands approved.</p>
<A NAME="2836"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1179><b>sn</b> The reality behind the metaphor is not entirely clear from the context. The stone appears to represent someone or something that gives Zion stability. Perhaps the ideal Davidic ruler is in view (see 32:1). Another option is that the image of beginning a building project by laying a precious cornerstone suggests that God is about to transform Zion through judgment and begin a new covenant community that will experience his protection (see 4:3-6; 31:5; 33:20-24; 35:10). </p>
<A NAME="2837"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1180><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;will not hurry,&#8221; i.e., act in panic.</p>

<A NAME="2839"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1182><b>tn</b> On the meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kafar</font>) in this context, see <i>HALOT</i> 494 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1508;&#1512;</font> and J. N. Oswalt, <i>Isaiah</i> (NICOT), 1:515, n. 9.</p>
<A NAME="2840"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1183><b>tn</b> Normally the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khazut</font>) means &#8220;vision.&#8221; See the note at v. 15.</p>
<A NAME="2841"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1184><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;will not stand&#8221; (NIV, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="2842"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1185><b>tn</b> See the note at v. 15.</p>

<A NAME="2845"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1188><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;it will come through&#8221; are supplied in the translation. The verb &#8220;will sweep by&#8221; does double duty in the parallel structure.</p>
<A NAME="2846"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1189><b>sn</b> The bed and blanket probably symbolize their false sense of security. A bed that is too short and a blanket that is too narrow may promise rest and protection from the cold, but in the end they are useless and disappointing. In the same way, their supposed treaty with death will prove useless and disappointing. </p>
<A NAME="2847"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1190><b>sn</b> This probably alludes to David&#8217;s victory over the Philistines at Baal Perazim. See 2 Sam 5:20.</p>
<A NAME="2848"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1191><b>sn</b> This probably alludes to the Lord&#8217;s victory over the Canaanites at Gibeon, during the days of Joshua. See Josh 10:10-11.</p>
<A NAME="2849"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1192><b>sn</b> God&#8217;s judgment of his own people is called &#8220;his peculiar work&#8221; and &#8220;his strange task,&#8221; because he must deal with them the way he treated their enemies in the past.</p>
<A NAME="2850"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1193><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the whole earth&#8221; (KJV, ASV, NAB, NCV).</p>
<A NAME="2851"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1194><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;to my voice.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="2854"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1197><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text reads literally, &#8220;place wheat [?], and barley [?], and grain in its territory.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shorah</font>) is sometimes translated &#8220;[in] its place,&#8221; but the word is unattested elsewhere. It is probably due to dittography of the immediately following <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sÿo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">rah</font>, &#8220;barley&#8221;). The meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1505;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nisman</font>) is also uncertain. It may be due to dittography of the immediately following <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1467;&#1505;&#1468;&#1462;&#1502;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kussemet</font>, &#8220;grain&#8221;).</p>

<A NAME="2858"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=1201><b>sn</b> Verses 23-29 emphasize that God possesses great wisdom and has established a natural order. Evidence of this can be seen in the way farmers utilize divinely imparted wisdom to grow and harvest crops. God&#8217;s dealings with his people will exhibit this same kind of wisdom and order. Judgment will be accomplished according to a divinely ordered timetable and, while severe enough, will not be excessive. Judgment must come, just as planting inevitably follows plowing. God will, as it were, thresh his people, but he will not crush them to the point where they will be of no use to him.</p>
