<A NAME="551"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2320><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hoy</font>, &#8220;woe, ah&#8221;) was used in funeral laments and is often prefixed to judgment oracles for rhetorical effect. But here it appears to be a simple interjection, designed to grab the audience&#8217;s attention. Perhaps there is a note of sorrow or pity. See BDB 223 s.v.</p>
<A NAME="552"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2321><b>sn</b> The statement is an oxymoron. Its ironic quality adds to its rhetorical impact. The statement reminds one of the norm (one must normally buy commodities) as it expresses the astounding offer. One might paraphrase the statement: &#8220;Come and take freely what you normally have to pay for.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="553"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2322><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;for what is not food.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="554"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2323><b>tn</b> The interrogative particle and the verb &#8220;spend&#8221; are understood here by ellipsis (note the preceding line).</p>
<A NAME="555"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2324><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;your labor,&#8221; which stands by metonymy for that which one earns.</p>
<A NAME="556"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2325><b>tn</b> The infinitive absolute follows the imperative and lends emphasis to the exhortation.</p>
<A NAME="557"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2326><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;good&#8221; (so NASB, NIV, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="558"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2327><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Let your appetite delight in fine food.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Nourishing, fine food here represents the blessings God freely offers. These include forgiveness, a new covenantal relationship with God, and national prominence (see vv. 3-6).</p>
<A NAME="559"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2328><b>tn</b> The jussive with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) conjunctive following the imperative indicates purpose/result.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> To <i>live</i> here refers to covenantal blessing, primarily material prosperity and national security (see vv. 4-5, 13, and Deut 30:6, 15, 19-20).</p>
<A NAME="5510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2329><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;an eternal covenant with.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2330><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the reliable expressions of loyalty of David.&#8221; The syntactical relationship of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1505;&#1456;&#1491;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khasde</font>, &#8220;expressions of loyalty&#8221;) to the preceding line is unclear. If the term is appositional to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿrit</font>, &#8220;covenant&#8221;), then the Lord here transfers the promises of the Davidic covenant to the entire nation. Another option is to take <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1505;&#1456;&#1491;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khasde</font>) as an adverbial accusative and to translate &#8220;according to the reliable covenantal promises.&#8221; In this case the new covenantal arrangement proposed here is viewed as an extension or perhaps fulfillment of the Davidic promises. A third option, the one reflected in the above translation, is to take the last line as comparative. In this case the new covenant being proposed is analogous to the Davidic covenant. Verses 4-5, which compare David&#8217;s international prominence to what Israel will experience, favors this view. In all three of these interpretations, &#8220;David&#8221; is an objective genitive; he is the recipient of covenantal promises. A fourth option would be to take David as a subjective genitive and understand the line as giving the basis for the preceding promise: &#8220;Then I will make an unconditional covenantal promise to you, because of David&#8217;s faithful acts of covenantal loyalty.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2331><b>sn</b> Ideally the Davidic king was to testify to the nations of God&#8217;s greatness (cf. Pss 18:50 HT [18:49 ET]; 22:28 HT [22:27 ET]). See J. H. Eaton, <i>Kingship in the Psalms </i>(SBT), 182-84. </p>
<A NAME="5513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2332><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;a nation,&#8221; but the singular is collective here, as the plural verbs in the next line indicate (note that both &#8220;know&#8221; and &#8220;run&#8221; are third plural forms).</p>
<A NAME="5514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2333><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;a nation,&#8221; but the singular is collective here, as the plural verbs that follow indicate.</p>
<A NAME="5515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2334><b>sn</b> See the note on the phrase &#8220;the Holy One of Israel&#8221; in 1:4.</p>
<A NAME="5516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2335><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;while he allows himself to be found.&#8221; The Niphal form has a tolerative force here.</p>
<A NAME="5517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2336><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Let the wicked one abandon his way.&#8221; The singular is collective.</p>
<A NAME="5518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2337><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and the man of evil his thoughts.&#8221; The singular is collective. </p>
<A NAME="5519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2338><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;let him return.&#8221; The singular is collective, meaning &#8220;let them.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="5520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2339><b>tn</b> The imperfect with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) conjunctive after the jussive indicates purpose/result.</p>
<A NAME="5521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2340><b>sn</b> The appeal and promise of vv. 6-7 echoes the language of Deut 4:25-31; 30:1-10; and 1 Kgs 8:46-53, all of which anticipate the exile and speak of the prerequisites for restoration.</p>
<A NAME="5522"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2341><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;For&#8221; (KJV, NAB, NASB, NIV).</p>

<A NAME="5527"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2346><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the heavens.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shamayim</font>) may be translated &#8220;heavens&#8221; or &#8220;sky&#8221; depending on the context.</p>
<A NAME="5528"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2347><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;ways&#8221; (so many English versions).</p>

<A NAME="5530"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2349><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;thoughts&#8221; (so many English versions).</p>
<A NAME="5531"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2350><b>tn</b> This verse begins in the Hebrew text with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki ka</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asher</font>, &#8220;for, just as&#8221;), which is completed by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ken</font>, &#8220;so, in the same way&#8221;) at the beginning of v. 11. For stylistic reasons, this lengthy sentence is divided up into separate sentences in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="5532"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2351><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;so is the word which goes out from my mouth, it does not return to empty.&#8221; &#8220;Word&#8221; refers here to divine promises, like the ones made just prior to and after this (see vv. 7b, 12-13). </p>
<A NAME="5533"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2352><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;but it accomplishes what I desire, and succeeds [on the mission] which I send it.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Verses 8-11 focus on the reliability of the divine word and support the promises before (vv. 3-5, 7b) and after (vv. 12-13) this. Israel can be certain that repentance will bring forgiveness and a new covenantal relationship because God&#8217;s promises are reliable. In contrast to human plans (or &#8220;thoughts&#8221;), which are destined to fail (Ps 94:11) apart from divine approval (Prov 19:21), and human deeds (or &#8220;ways&#8221;), which are evil and lead to destruction (Prov 1:15-19; 3:31-33; 4:19), God&#8217;s plans are realized and his deeds accomplish something positive. </p>
<A NAME="5534"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2353><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;to the Lord for a name.&#8221; For <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shem</font>) used in the sense of &#8220;monument,&#8221; see also 56:5, where it stands parallel to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yad</font>).</p>
<A NAME="5535"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2354><b>tn</b> Or, more literally, &#8220;a permanent sign that will not be cut off.&#8221;</p>
