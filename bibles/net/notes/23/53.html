<A NAME="531"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2253><b>tn</b> The perfect has a hypothetical force in this rhetorical question. For another example, see Gen 21:7.</p>
<A NAME="532"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2254><b>sn</b> The speaker shifts here from God to an unidentified group (note the first person plural pronouns throughout vv. 1-6). The content of the speech suggests that the prophet speaks here as representative of the sinful nation Israel. The group acknowledges its sin and recognizes that the servant suffered on their behalf. </p>
<A NAME="533"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2255><b>tn</b> The first half of v. 1 is traditionally translated, &#8220;Who has believed our report?&#8221; or &#8220;Who has believed our message?&#8221; as if the group speaking is lamenting that no one will believe what they have to say. But that doesn&#8217;t seem to be the point in this context. Here the group speaking does not cast itself in the role of a preacher or evangelist. No, they are repentant sinners, who finally see the light. The phrase &#8220;our report&#8221; can mean (1) the report which we deliver, or (2) the report which was delivered to us. The latter fits better here, where the report is most naturally taken as the announcement that has just been made in 52:13-15.</p>
<A NAME="534"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2256><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;to whom&#8221; (so KJV, NASB, NIV, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="535"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2257><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the arm of the Lord.&#8221; The &#8220;arm of the Lord&#8221; is a metaphor of military power; it pictures the Lord as a warrior who bares his arm, takes up his weapon, and crushes his enemies (cf. 51:9-10; 63:5-6). But Israel had not seen the Lord&#8217;s military power at work in the servant.</p>
<A NAME="536"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2258><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;before him.&#8221; Some suggest an emendation to &#8220;before us.&#8221; If the third singular suffix of the Hebrew text is retained, it probably refers to the Lord (see v. 1b). For a defense of this reading, see R. Whybray, <i>Isaiah 40-66 </i>(NCBC), 173-74.</p>
<A NAME="537"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2259><b>sn</b> The metaphor in this verse suggests insignificance.</p>
<A NAME="538"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2260><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;that we might see him.&#8221; The <i>vav</i> conjunctive prefixed to the imperfect introduces a result clause here. See GKC 504-5 §166.<i>a</i>. </p>
<A NAME="539"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2261><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;that we should desire him.&#8221; The <i>vav</i> conjunctive prefixed to the imperfect introduces a result clause here. See GKC 504-5 §166.<i>a</i>.</p>
<A NAME="5310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2262><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;lacking of men.&#8221; If the genitive is taken as specifying (&#8220;lacking with respect to men&#8221;), then the idea is that he lacked company because he was rejected by people. Another option is to take the genitive as indicating genus or larger class (i.e., &#8220;one lacking among men&#8221;). In this case one could translate, &#8220;he was a transient&#8221; (cf. the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1491;&#1461;&#1500;</font> [<font face="Scholar">khadel</font>] in Ps 39:5 HT [39:4 ET]).</p>
<A NAME="5311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2263><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;like a hiding of the face from him,&#8221; i.e., &#8220;like one before whom the face is hidden&#8221; (see BDB 712 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1505;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;</font>). </p>
<A NAME="5312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2264><b>sn</b> The servant is likened to a seriously ill person who is shunned by others because of his horrible disease. </p>
<A NAME="5313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2265><b>sn</b> Illness and pain stand by metonymy (or perhaps as metaphors) for sin and its effects, as vv. 11-12 make clear. </p>
<A NAME="5314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2266><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;for something he had done&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarification. The group now realizes he suffered because of his identification with them, not simply because he was a special target of divine anger.</p>
<A NAME="5315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2267><b>tn</b> The preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">min</font>) has a causal sense (translated &#8220;because of&#8221;) here and in the following clause.</p>
<A NAME="5316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2268><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the punishment of our peace [was] on him.&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shalom</font>, &#8220;peace&#8221;) is here a genitive of result, i.e., &#8220;punishment that resulted in our peace.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2269><b>sn</b> Continuing to utilize the imagery of physical illness, the group acknowledges that the servant&#8217;s willingness to carry their illnesses (v. 4) resulted in their being healed. Healing is a metaphor for forgiveness here.</p>
<A NAME="5318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2270><b>tn</b> Elsewhere the Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">paga</font>&#8217;) means &#8220;to intercede verbally&#8221; (Jer 15:11; 36:25) or &#8220;to intervene militarily&#8221; (Isa 59:16), but neither nuance fits here. Apparently here the Hiphil is the causative of the normal Qal meaning, &#8220;encounter, meet, touch.&#8221; The Qal sometimes refers to a hostile encounter or attack; when used in this way the object is normally introduced by the preposition -<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet</font>, see Josh 2:16; Judg 8:21; 15:12, etc.). Here the causative Hiphil has a double object &#8211; the Lord makes &#8220;sin&#8221; attack &#8220;him&#8221; (note that the object attacked is introduced by the preposition -<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font>. In their sin the group was like sheep who had wandered from God&#8217;s path. They were vulnerable to attack; the guilt of their sin was ready to attack and destroy them. But then the servant stepped in and took the full force of the attack. </p>
<A NAME="5319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2271><b>tn</b> The translation assumes the Niphal is passive; another option is take the clause (note the subject + verb pattern) as concessive and the Niphal as reflexive, &#8220;though he humbled himself.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2272><b>sn</b> This verse emphasizes the servant&#8217;s silent submission. The comparison to a sheep does not necessarily suggest a sacrificial metaphor. Sheep were slaughtered for food as well as for sacrificial rituals, and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1462;&#1489;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tevakh</font>) need not refer to sacrificial slaughter (see Gen 43:16; Prov 7:22; 9:2; Jer 50:27; note also the use of the related verb in Exod 21:37; Deut 28:31; 1 Sam 25:11). </p>
<A NAME="5321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2273><b>tn</b> The precise meaning of this line is uncertain. The present translation assumes that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">min</font>) here has an instrumental sense (&#8220;by, through&#8221;) and understands <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1465;&#1510;&#1462;&#1512; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1496;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">otser umimmishpat</font>, &#8220;coercion and legal decision&#8221;) as a hendiadys meaning &#8220;coercive legal decision,&#8221; thus &#8220;an unjust trial.&#8221; Other interpretive options include: (1) &#8220;without [for this sense of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font>, see BDB 578 s.v. 1.b] hindrance and proper judicial process,&#8221; i.e., &#8220;unfairly and with no one to defend him,&#8221; (2) &#8220;from [in the sense of &#8220;after,&#8221; see BDB 581 s.v. 4.b] arrest and judgment.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="5322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2274><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and his generation, who considers?&#8221; (NASB similar). Some understand &#8220;his generation&#8221; as a reference to descendants. In this case the question would suggest that he will have none. However, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et</font>) may be taken here as specifying a new subject (see BDB 85 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1514;</font> 3). If &#8220;his generation&#8221; refers to the servant&#8217;s contemporary generation, one may then translate, &#8220;As for his contemporary generation, who took note?&#8221; The point would be that few were concerned about the harsh treatment he received.</p>
<A NAME="5323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2275><b>sn</b> The &#8220;land of the living&#8221; is an idiom for the sphere where people live, in contrast to the underworld realm of the dead. See, for example, Ezek 32:23-27. </p>
<A NAME="5324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2276><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text reads &#8220;my people,&#8221; a reading followed by most English versions, but this is problematic in a context where the first person plural predominates, and where God does not appear to speak again until v. 11b. Therefore, it is preferable to read with the Qumran scroll 1QIsa<sup>a</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew" size="-2">&#1506;&#1502;&#1493;</font> (&#8220;his people&#8221;). In this case, the group speaking in these verses is identified as the servant&#8217;s people (compare <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew" size="-2">&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1506;&#1461;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</font> [<font face="Scholar" size="-2">pÿsha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar" size="-2">enu</font>, &#8220;our rebellious deeds&#8221;] in v. 5 with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew" size="-2">&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1506; &#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> [<font face="Scholar" size="-2">pesha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar" size="-2"> </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar" size="-2">ammi</font>, &#8220;the rebellion of his people&#8221;] in v. 8). </p>
<A NAME="5325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2277><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;one assigned his grave with criminals.&#8221; The subject of the singular is impersonal; English typically uses &#8220;they&#8221; in such constructions.</p>
<A NAME="5326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2278><b>tn</b> This line reads literally, &#8220;and with the rich in his death.&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿmotayv</font>) combines a preposition, a plural form of the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mot</font>), and a third masculine singular suffix. The plural of the noun is problematic and the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;</font> may be the result of virtual dittography. The form should probably be emended to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bamato</font>, singular noun). The relationship between this line and the preceding one is uncertain. The parallelism appears to be synonymous (note &#8220;his grave&#8221; and &#8220;in his death&#8221;), but &#8220;criminals&#8221; and &#8220;the rich&#8221; hardly make a compatible pair in this context, for they would not be buried in the same kind of tomb. Some emend <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ashir</font>, &#8220;rich&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1461;&#1497; &#1512;&#1464;&#1506;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ase ra</font>&#8217;, &#8220;doers of evil&#8221;) but the absence of the <i>ayin</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;</font>) is not readily explained in this graphic environment. Others suggest an emendation to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">irim</font>, &#8220;he-goats, demons&#8221;), but the meaning in this case is not entirely transparent and the proposal assumes that the form suffered from both transposition and the inexplicable loss of a final <i>mem</i>. Still others relate <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ashir</font>) to an alleged Arabic cognate meaning &#8220;mob.&#8221; See <i>HALOT</i> 896 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font>. Perhaps the parallelism is antithetical, rather than synonymous. In this case, the point is made that the servant&#8217;s burial in a rich man&#8217;s tomb, in contrast to a criminal&#8217;s burial, was appropriate, for he had done nothing wrong.</p>
<A NAME="5327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2279><b>tn</b> If the second line is antithetical, then <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) is probably causal here, explaining why the servant was buried in a rich man&#8217;s tomb, rather than that of criminal. If the first two lines are synonymous, then <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> is probably concessive: &#8220;even though&#8230;.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="5328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2280><b>tn</b> The meaning of this line is uncertain. It reads literally, &#8220;if you/she makes, a reparation offering, his life.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tasim</font>) could be second masculine singular,in which case it would have to be addressed to the servant or to God. However, the servant is only addressed once in this servant song (see 52:14a), and God either speaks or is spoken about in this servant song; he is never addressed. Furthermore, the idea of God himself making a reparation offering is odd. If the verb is taken as third feminine singular, then the feminine noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>) at the end of the line is the likely subject. In this case one can take the suffixed form of the noun as equivalent to a pronoun and translate, &#8220;if he [literally, &#8220;his life&#8221;] makes a reparation offering.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> What constitutes the servant&#8217;s reparation offering? Some might think his suffering, but the preceding context views this as past, while the verb here is imperfect in form. The offering appears to be something the servant does after his suffering has been completed. Perhaps the background of the language can be found in the Levitical code, where a healed leper would offer a reparation offering as part of the ritual to achieve ceremonial cleanliness (see Lev 14). The servant was pictured earlier in the song as being severely ill. This illness (a metaphor for the effects of the people&#8217;s sin) separated him from God. However, here we discover the separation is not final; once reparation is made, so to speak, he will again experience the Lord&#8217;s favor.</p>
<A NAME="5329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2281><b>sn</b> The idiomatic and stereotypical language emphasizes the servant&#8217;s restoration to divine favor. Having numerous descendants and living a long life are standard signs of divine blessing. See Job 42:13-16. </p>
<A NAME="5330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2282><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;he will be satisfied by his knowledge,&#8221; i.e., &#8220;when he knows.&#8221; The preposition is understood as temporal and the suffix as a subjective genitive. Some take <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿda</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">to</font>, &#8220;by his knowledge&#8221;) with what follows and translate &#8220;by knowledge of him,&#8221; understanding the preposition as instrumental and the suffix as objective.</p>
<A NAME="5331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2283><b>sn</b> The song ends as it began (cf. 52:13-15), with the Lord announcing the servant&#8217;s vindication and exaltation.</p>
<A NAME="5332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2284><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;he will acquit, a righteous one, my servant, many.&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsadiq</font>) may refer to the servant, but more likely it is dittographic (note the preceding verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1510;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1511;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yatsdiq</font>). The precise meaning of the verb (the Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1511;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tsadaq</font>) is debated. Elsewhere the Hiphil is used at least six times in the sense of &#8220;make righteous&#8221; in a legal sense, i.e., &#8220;pronounce innocent, acquit&#8221; (see Exod 23:7; Deut 25:1; 1 Kgs 8:32 = 2 Chr 6:23; Prov 17:15; Isa 5:23). It can also mean &#8220;render justice&#8221; (as a royal function, see 2 Sam 15:4; Ps 82:3), &#8220;concede&#8221; (Job 27:5), &#8220;vindicate&#8221; (Isa 50:8), and &#8220;lead to righteousness&#8221; (by teaching and example, Dan 12:3). The preceding context and the next line suggest a legal sense here. Because of his willingness to carry the people&#8217;s sins, the servant is able to &#8220;acquit&#8221; them. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Some (e.g., H. M. Orlinsky, &#8220;The So-called &#8216;Suffering Servant&#8217; in Isaiah 53,22,&#8221; VTSup 14 [1967]: 3-133) object to this legal interpretation of the language, arguing that it would be unjust for the righteous to suffer for the wicked and for the wicked to be declared innocent. However, such a surprising development is consistent with the ironic nature of this song. It does seem unfair for the innocent to die for the guilty. But what is God to do when all have sinned and wandered off like stray sheep (cf. v. 6)? Covenant law demands punishment, but punishment in this case would mean annihilation of what God has created. God&#8217;s justice, as demanded by the law, must be satisfied. To satisfy his justice, he does something seemingly unjust. He punishes his sinless servant, the only one who has not strayed off! In the progress of biblical revelation, we discover that the sinless servant is really God in the flesh, who offers himself because he is committed to the world he has created. If his justice can only be satisfied if he himself endures the punishment, then so be it. What appears to be an act of injustice is really love satisfying the demands of justice!</p>
<A NAME="5333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2285><b>tn</b> The circumstantial clause (note the <i>vav</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>] + object + subject + verb pattern) is understood as causal here. The prefixed verb form is either a preterite or an imperfect used in a customary manner.</p>
<A NAME="5334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2286><b>tn</b> Scholars have debated the precise meaning of the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rabbim</font>) that occurs five times in this passage (Isa 52:14, 15; 53:11, 12 [2x]). Its two broad categories of translation are &#8220;much&#8221;/&#8220;many&#8221; and &#8220;great&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 1171-72 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;</font>). Unlike other Hebrew terms for might or strength, this term is linked with numbers or abundance. In all sixteen uses outside of Isaiah 52:13-53:12 (articular and plural) it signifies an inclusive meaning: &#8220;the majority&#8221; or &#8220;the multitude&#8221; (J. Jeremias, <i>TDNT</i> 6:536-37). This term occurs in parallelism with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">atsumim</font>), which normally signifies &#8220;numerous&#8221; or &#8220;large&#8221; or &#8220;powerful&#8221; (through large numbers). Like <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rabbim</font>), it refers to greatness in numbers (cf. Deut 4:38; 7:1; 9:1; 11:34). It emphasizes the multitudes with whom the Servant will share the spoil of his victory. As J. Olley wrote: &#8220;Yahweh has won the victory and vindicates his Servant, giving to him many subservient people, together with their spoils. These numerous peoples in turn receive blessing, sharing in the &#8220;peace&#8221; resulting from Yahweh&#8217;s victory and the Servant&#8217;s suffering&#8221; (John W. Olley, &#8220;&#8216;The Many&#8217;: How Is Isa 53,12a to Be Understood,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 68 [1987]: 330-56).</p>
