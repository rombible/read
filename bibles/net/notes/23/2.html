<A NAME="22"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=82><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the word which Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="23"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=83><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;in the end of the days.&#8221; This phrase may refer generally to the future, or more technically to the final period of history. See BDB 31 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1463;&#1488;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;</font>. The verse begins with a verb that functions as a &#8220;discourse particle&#8221; and is not translated. In numerous places throughout the OT, the &#8220;to be&#8221; verb with a prefixed conjunction (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">vÿhayah</font>] and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;</font> [<font face="Scholar">vayÿhi</font>]) occurs in this fashion to introduce a circumstantial clause and does not require translation.</p>
<A NAME="24"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=84><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;be established&#8221; (KJV, NIV, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="25"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=85><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;as the chief of the mountains, and will be lifted up above the hills.&#8221; The image of Mount Zion being elevated above other mountains and hills pictures the prominence it will attain in the future.</p>
<A NAME="26"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=86><b>tn</b> The prefixed verb form with simple <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) introduces a purpose/result clause after the preceding prefixed verb form (probably to be taken as a cohortative; see <i>IBHS </i>650 §39.2.2a).</p>
<A NAME="27"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=87><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;his ways.&#8221; In this context God&#8217;s &#8220;ways&#8221; are the standards of moral conduct he decrees that people should live by.</p>
<A NAME="28"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=88><b>tn</b> The cohortative with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) after the prefixed verb form indicates the ultimate purpose/goal of their action.</p>
<A NAME="29"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=89><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;walk in his ways.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=90><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;for out of Zion will go instruction.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=91><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=92><b>sn</b> Instead of referring to the large plow as a whole, the plowshare is simply the metal tip which actually breaks the earth and cuts the furrow.</p>
<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=93><b>sn</b> This implement was used to prune the vines, i.e., to cut off extra leaves and young shoots (H. Wildberger, <i>Isaiah</i>, 1:93; M. Klingbeil, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 1:1117-18). It was a short knife with a curved hook at the end sharpened on the inside like a sickle. Breaking weapons and fashioning agricultural implements indicates a transition from fear and stress to peace and security.</p>
<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=94><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;house,&#8221; referring to the family line or descendants (likewise in v. 6).</p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=95><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;let&#8217;s walk in the light of the Lord.&#8221; In this context, which speaks of the Lord&#8217;s instruction and commands, the &#8220;light of the Lord&#8221; refers to his moral standards by which he seeks to guide his people. One could paraphrase, &#8220;let&#8217;s obey the Lord&#8217;s commands.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=96><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;O Lord&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarification. Isaiah addresses the Lord in prayer.</p>
<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=97><b>tc</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;they are full from the east.&#8221; Various scholars retain the BHS reading and suggest that the prophet makes a general statement concerning Israel&#8217;s reliance on foreign customs (J. Watts, <i>Isaiah</i> [WBC], 1:32; J. de Waard, <i>Isaiah</i>, 12-13). Nevertheless, it appears that a word is missing. Based on the parallelism (note &#8220;omen readers&#8221; in 5:6c), many suggest that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1465;&#1505;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qosÿmim</font>, &#8220;diviners&#8221;) or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1505;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">miqsam</font>, &#8220;divination&#8221;) has been accidentally omitted. Homoioteleuton could account for the omission of an original <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1465;&#1505;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (note how this word and the following <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1511;&#1462;&#1468;&#1491;&#1462;&#1501;</font> [<font face="Scholar">miqqedem</font>, &#8220;from the east&#8221;] both end in <i>mem</i>); an original <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1505;&#1464;&#1501;</font> could have fallen out by homoioarcton (note how this word and the following <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1462;&#1491;&#1462;&#1501;</font> both begin with <i>mem</i>). </p>
<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=98><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and omen readers like the Philistines.&#8221; Through this line and the preceding, the prophet contends that Israel has heavily borrowed the pagan practices of the east and west (in violation of Lev 19:26; Deut 18:9-14).</p>
<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=99><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and with the children of foreigners they [?].&#8221; The precise meaning of the final word is uncertain. Some take this verb (I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1511;</font>, <font face="Scholar">safaq</font>) to mean &#8220;slap,&#8221; supply the object &#8220;hands,&#8221; and translate, &#8220;they slap [hands] with foreigners&#8221;; <i>HALOT</i> 1349 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1511;</font>. This could be a reference to foreign alliances. This translation has two disadvantages: It requires the conjectural insertion of &#8220;hands&#8221; and the use of this verb with its object prefixed with a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet</font>) preposition with this meaning does not occur elsewhere. The other uses of this verb refer to clapping at someone, an indication of hostility. The translation above assumes the verb is derived from II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1511;</font> (&#8220;to suffice,&#8221; attested in the Qal in 1 Kgs 20:10; <i>HALOT</i> 1349 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1511;</font>). In this case the point is that a sufficient number of foreigners (in this case, too many!) live in the land. The disadvantage of this option is that the preposition prefixed to &#8220;the children of foreigners&#8221; does not occur with this verb elsewhere. The chosen translation is preferred since it continues the idea of abundant foreign influence and does not require a conjectural insertion or emendation.</p>
<A NAME="220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=100><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;treasuries&#8221;; KJV &#8220;treasures.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=101><b>sn</b> Judah&#8217;s royal bureaucracy had accumulated great wealth and military might, in violation of Deut 17:16-17.</p>
<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=102><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;bow down to&#8221; (NIV, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=103><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;men bow down, men are low.&#8221; Since the verbs <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shakhakh</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shafal</font>) are used later in this discourse to describe how God will humiliate proud men (see vv. 11, 17), some understand v. 9a as a prediction of judgment, &#8220;men will be brought down, men will be humiliated.&#8221; However, these prefixed verbal forms with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive appear to carry on the description that precedes and are better taken with the accusation. They draw attention to the fact that human beings actually bow down and worship before the lifeless products of their own hands. </p>
<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=104><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;don&#8217;t lift them up.&#8221; The idiom &#8220;lift up&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1488;</font> with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nasa</font>&#8217; with preposition <font face="Scholar">lamed</font>) can mean &#8220;spare, forgive&#8221; (see Gen 18:24, 26). Here the idiom plays on the preceding verbs. The idolaters are bowed low as they worship their false gods; the prophet asks God not to &#8220;lift them up.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=105><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;from the dread of the Lord,&#8221; that is, from the dread that he produces in the objects of his judgment.&#8221; The words &#8220;get away&#8221; are supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=106><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and the eyes of the pride of men will be brought low, and the arrogance of men will be brought down.&#8221; The repetition of the verbs <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shafal</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shakhakh</font>) from v. 9 draws attention to the appropriate nature of the judgment. Those proud men who &#8220;bow low&#8221; before idols will be forced to &#8220;bow low&#8221; before God when he judges their sin. </p>
<A NAME="227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=107><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;elevated&#8221;; CEV &#8220;honored.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=108><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;indeed [or &#8220;for&#8221;] the Lord who commands armies [traditionally, the Lord of hosts] has a day.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=109><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;against&#8221; (NAB, NASB, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=110><b>sn</b> The <i>cedars of Lebanon</i> and <i>oaks of Bashan</i> were well-known for their size and prominence. They make apt symbols here for powerful men who think of themselves as prominent and secure.</p>
<A NAME="231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=111><b>sn</b> The high mountains and hills symbolize the apparent security of proud men, as do the high tower and fortified wall of v. 15.</p>
<A NAME="232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=112><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the ships of Tarshish.&#8221; This probably refers to large ships either made in or capable of traveling to the distant western port of Tarshish.</p>
<A NAME="233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=113><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;desirable&#8221;; NAB, NIV &#8220;stately&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=114><b>tn</b> On the meaning of this word, which appears only here in the Hebrew Bible, see H. R. Cohen, <i>Biblical Hapax Legomena</i> (SBLDS), 41-42.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The ships mentioned in this verse were the best of their class, and therefore an apt metaphor for the proud men being denounced in this speech.</p>
<A NAME="235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=115><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and the pride of men will be brought down, and the arrogance of men will be brought low.&#8221; As in v. 11, the repetition of the verbs <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shafal</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shakhakh</font>) from v. 9 draws attention to the appropriate nature of the judgment. Those proud men who &#8220;bow low&#8221; before idols will be forced to &#8220;bow low&#8221; before God when he judges their sin. </p>
<A NAME="236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=116><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;elevated&#8221;; NCV &#8220;praised&#8221;; CEV &#8220;honored.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=117><b>tc</b> The verb &#8220;pass away&#8221; is singular in the Hebrew text, despite the plural subject (&#8220;worthless idols&#8221;) that precedes. The verb should be emended to a plural; the final <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) has been accidentally omitted by haplography (note the <i>vav</i> at the beginning of the immediately following form).</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;will completely pass away&#8221;; ASV &#8220;shall utterly pass away.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=118><b>tn</b> The identity of the grammatical subject is unclear. The &#8220;idols&#8221; could be the subject; they will &#8220;go&#8221; into the caves and holes when the idolaters throw them there in their haste to escape God&#8217;s judgment (see vv. 20-21). The picture of the idols, which represent the foreign deities worshiped by the people, fleeing from the Lord would be highly polemical and fit the overall mood of the chapter. However it seems more likely that the idolaters themselves are the subject, for v. 10 uses similar language in sarcastically urging them to run from judgment.</p>
<A NAME="239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=119><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;dust&#8221;; ASV &#8220;into the holes of the earth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=120><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;from the dread of the Lord,&#8221; that is, from the dread that he produces in the objects of his judgment.&#8221; The words &#8220;trying to escape&#8221; are supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=121><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;land.&#8221; It is not certain if these verses are describing the judgment of Judah (see vv. 6-9) or a more universal judgment on all proud men. </p>
<A NAME="242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=122><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;in that day&#8221; (KJV).</p>
<A NAME="243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=123><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;bow down to.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="244"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=124><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;to the shrews and to the bats.&#8221; On the meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1458;&#1508;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khafarparah</font>, &#8220;shrew&#8221;), see <i>HALOT</i> 341 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1458;&#1508;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font>. The BHS text as it stands (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1465;&#1512;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">perot lakhpor</font>), makes no sense. Based on Theodotion&#8217;s transliteration and a similar reading in the Qumran scroll 1QIsa<sup>a</sup>, most scholars suggest that the MT mistakenly divided a noun (a <i>hapax legomenon</i>) that should be translated &#8220;moles,&#8221; &#8220;shrews,&#8221; or &#8220;rodents.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=125><b>sn</b> The precise point of vv. 20-21 is not entirely clear. Are they taking the idols into their hiding places with them, because they are so attached to their man-made images? Or are they discarding the idols along the way as they retreat into the darkest places they can find? In either case it is obvious that the gods are incapable of helping them. </p>
<A NAME="246"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=126><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;from the dread of the Lord,&#8221; that is, from the dread that he produces in the objects of his judgment.&#8221; The words &#8220;trying to escape&#8221; are supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="247"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=127><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;land.&#8221; It is not certain if these verses are describing the judgment of Judah (see vv. 6-9) or a more universal judgment on all proud men. Almost all English versions translate &#8220;earth,&#8221; taking this to refer to universal judgment.</p>
