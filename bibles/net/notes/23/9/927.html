<A NAME="927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=410><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;and dominion was on his shoulders and he called his name.&#8221; The prefixed verbs with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive are used with the same rhetorical sense as the perfects in v. 6a. See the preceding note. There is great debate over the syntactical structure of the verse. No subject is indicated for the verb &#8220;he called.&#8221; If all the titles that follow are ones given to the king, then the subject of the verb must be indefinite, &#8220;one calls.&#8221; However, some have suggested that one to three of the titles that follow refer to God, not the king. For example, the traditional punctuation of the Hebrew text suggests the translation, &#8220;and the Extraordinary Strategist, the Mighty God calls his name, &#8216;Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.&#8217;&#8221; </p>
