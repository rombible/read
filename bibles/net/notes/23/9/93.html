<A NAME="93"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=386><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Should a nation not inquire of its gods on behalf of the living, (by inquiring) of the dead?&#8221; These words appear to be a continuation of the quotation begun in the first part of the verse. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohayv</font>) may be translated &#8220;its gods&#8221; or &#8220;its God.&#8221; Some take the second half of the verse as the prophet&#8217;s (or the Lord&#8217;s) rebuke of the people who advise seeking oracles at the ritual pits, but in this case the words &#8220;the dead on behalf of the living&#8221; are difficult to explain.</p>
