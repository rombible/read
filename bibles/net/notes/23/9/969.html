<A NAME="969"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=452><b>tn</b> Some suggest that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1456;&#1512;&#1465;&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zÿro</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">o</font>, &#8220;his arm&#8221;) be repointed <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zar</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">o</font>, &#8220;his offspring&#8221;). In either case, the metaphor is that of a desperately hungry man who resorts to an almost unthinkable act to satisfy his appetite. He eats everything he can find to his right, but still being unsatisfied, then turns to his left and eats everything he can find there. Still being desperate for food, he then resorts to eating his own flesh (or offspring, as this phrase is metaphorically understood by some English versions, e.g., NIV, NCV, TEV, NLT). The reality behind the metaphor is the political turmoil of the period, as the next verse explains. There was civil strife within the northern kingdom; even the descendants of Joseph were at each other&#8217;s throats. Then the northern kingdom turned on their southern brother, Judah.</p>
