<A NAME="941"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=424><b>tn</b> The present translation assumes that this verse refers to judgment that had already fallen. Both verbs (perfects) are taken as indicating simple past; the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) on the second verb is understood as a simple <i>vav</i> conjunctive. Another option is to understand the verse as describing a future judgment (see 10:1-4). In this case the first verb is a perfect of certitude; the <i>vav</i> on the second verb is a <i>vav</i> consecutive. </p>
