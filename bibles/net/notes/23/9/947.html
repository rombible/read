<A NAME="947"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=430><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text reads literally, &#8220;adversaries of Rezin against him [i.e., them].&#8221; The next verse describes how the Syrians (over whom Rezin ruled, see 7:1, 8) and the Philistines encroached on Israel&#8217;s territory. Since the Syrians and Israelites were allies by 735 <sc>b.c. (see 7:1), the hostilities described probably occurred earlier, while Israel was still pro-Assyrian. In this case one might understand the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497; &#1512;&#1456;&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsare rÿtsin</font>, &#8220;adversaries of Rezin&#8221;) as meaning &#8220;adversaries sent from Rezin.&#8221; However, another option, the one chosen in the translation above, is to emend the phrase to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsarayv</font>, &#8220;his [i.e., their] adversaries&#8221;). This creates tighter parallelism with the next line (note &#8220;his [i.e., their] enemies&#8221;). The phrase in the Hebrew text may be explained as virtually dittographic.</p>
