<A NAME="95"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=388><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;If they do not speak according to this word, [it is] because it has no light of dawn.&#8221; The literal translation suggests that &#8220;this word&#8221; refers to the instruction/testimony. However, it is likely that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im-lo</font>&#8217;) is asseverative here, as in 5:9. In this case &#8220;this word&#8221; refers to the quotation recorded in v. 19. For a discussion of the problem see J. N. Oswalt, <i>Isaiah</i> (NICOT), 230, n. 9. The singular pronoun in the second half of the verse is collective, referring back to the nation (see v. 19b).</p>
