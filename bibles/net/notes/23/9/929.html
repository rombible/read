<A NAME="929"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=412><b>tn</b> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gibbor</font>) is probably an attributive adjective (&#8220;mighty God&#8221;), though one might translate &#8220;God is a warrior&#8221; or &#8220;God is mighty.&#8221; Scholars have interpreted this title is two ways. A number of them have argued that the title portrays the king as God&#8217;s representative on the battlefield, whom God empowers in a supernatural way (see J. H. Hayes and S. A. Irvine, <i>Isaiah</i>, 181-82). They contend that this sense seems more likely in the original context of the prophecy. They would suggest that having read the NT, we might in retrospect interpret this title as indicating the coming king&#8217;s deity, but it is unlikely that Isaiah or his audience would have understood the title in such a bold way. Ps 45:6 addresses the Davidic king as &#8220;God&#8221; because he ruled and fought as God&#8217;s representative on earth. Ancient Near Eastern art and literature picture gods training kings for battle, bestowing special weapons, and intervening in battle. According to Egyptian propaganda, the Hittites described Rameses II as follows: &#8220;No man is he who is among us, It is Seth great-of-strength, Baal in person; Not deeds of man are these his doings, They are of one who is unique&#8221; (See Miriam Lichtheim, <i>Ancient Egyptian Literature</i>, 2:67). According to proponents of this view, Isa 9:6 probably envisions a similar kind of response when friends and foes alike look at the Davidic king in full battle regalia. When the king&#8217;s enemies oppose him on the battlefield, they are, as it were, fighting against God himself. The other option is to regard this title as a reference to God, confronting Isaiah&#8217;s readers with the divinity of this promised &#8220;child.&#8221; The use of this same title that clearly refers to God in a later passage (Isa 10:21) supports this interpretation. Other passages depict Yahweh as the great God and great warrior (Deut 10:17; Jer. 32:18). Although this connection of a child who is born with deity is unparalleled in any earlier biblical texts, Isaiah&#8217;s use of this title to make this connection represents Isaiah&#8217;s attempt (at God&#8217;s behest) to advance Israel in their understanding of the ideal Davidic king for whom they long.</p>
