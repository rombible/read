<A NAME="913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=396><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text reads, &#8220;Indeed there is no gloom for the one to whom there was anxiety for her.&#8221; The feminine singular pronominal suffix &#8220;her&#8221; must refer to the land (cf. vv. 22a, 23b). So one could translate, &#8220;Indeed there will be no gloom for the land which was anxious.&#8221; In this case the statement introduces the positive message to follow. Some assume an emendation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;, &#8220;no&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>, &#8220;to him&#8221;) and of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lah</font>, &#8220;to her&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>, &#8220;to him&#8221;), yielding this literal reading: &#8220;indeed there is gloom for him, for the one to whom there was anxiety for him.&#8221; In this case the statement concludes the preceding description of judgment.</p>
