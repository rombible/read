<A NAME="930"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=413><b>tn</b> This title must not be taken in an anachronistic Trinitarian sense. (To do so would be theologically problematic, for the &#8220;Son&#8221; is the messianic king and is distinct in his person from God the &#8220;Father.&#8221;) Rather, in its original context the title pictures the king as the protector of his people. For a similar use of &#8220;father&#8221; see Isa 22:21 and Job 29:16. This figurative, idiomatic use of &#8220;father&#8221; is not limited to the Bible. In a Phoenician inscription (ca. 850-800 <sc>b.c.) the ruler Kilamuwa declares: &#8220;To some I was a father, to others I was a mother.&#8221; In another inscription (ca. 800 <sc>b.c.) the ruler Azitawadda boasts that the god Baal made him &#8220;a father and a mother&#8221; to his people. (See <i>ANET</i> 499-500.) The use of &#8220;everlasting&#8221; might suggest the deity of the king (as the one who has total control over eternity), but Isaiah and his audience may have understood the term as royal hyperbole emphasizing the king&#8217;s long reign or enduring dynasty (for examples of such hyperbolic language used of the Davidic king, see 1 Kgs 1:31; Pss 21:4-6; 61:6-7; 72:5, 17). The New Testament indicates that the hyperbolic language (as in the case of the title &#8220;Mighty God&#8221;) is literally realized in the ultimate fulfillment of the prophecy, for Jesus will rule eternally.</p>
