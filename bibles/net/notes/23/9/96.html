<A NAME="96"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=389><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;he will pass through it.&#8221; The subject of the collective singular verb is the nation. (See the preceding note.) The immediately preceding context supplies no antecedent for &#8220;it&#8221; (a third feminine singular suffix in the Hebrew text); the suffix may refer to the land, which would be a reasonable referent with a verb of motion. Note also that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">erets</font>, &#8220;land&#8221;) does appear at the beginning of the next verse.</p>
