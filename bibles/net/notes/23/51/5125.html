<A NAME="5125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2195><b>tn</b> This title (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;</font>, <font face="Scholar">rahav</font>, &#8220;proud one&#8221;) is sometimes translated as a proper name: &#8220;Rahab&#8221; (cf. NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV). It is used here of a symbolic sea monster, known elsewhere in the Bible and in Ugaritic myth as Leviathan. This sea creature symbolizes the forces of chaos that seek to destroy the created order. In the Bible &#8220;the Proud One&#8221; opposes God&#8217;s creative work, but is defeated (see Job 26:12; Ps 89:10). Here the title refers to Pharaoh&#8217;s Egyptian army that opposed Israel at the Red Sea (see v. 10, and note also Isa 30:7 and Ps 87:4, where the title is used of Egypt).</p>
