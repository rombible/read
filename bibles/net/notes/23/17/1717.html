<A NAME="1717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=767><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;a vine, a strange one.&#8221; The substantival adjective <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zar</font>) functions here as an appositional genitive. It could refer to a cultic plant of some type, associated with a pagan rite. But it is more likely that it refers to an exotic, or imported, type of vine, one that is foreign (i.e., &#8220;strange&#8221;) to Israel.</p>
