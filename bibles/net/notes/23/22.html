<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=877><b>sn</b> The following message pertains to Jerusalem. The significance of referring to the city as <i>the Valley of Vision</i> is uncertain. Perhaps the Hinnom Valley is in view, but why it is associated with a prophetic revelatory &#8220;vision&#8221; is not entirely clear. Maybe the Hinnom Valley is called this because the destruction that will take place there is the focal point of this prophetic message (see v. 5). </p>
<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=878><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;What to you, then?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=879><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the boisterous town.&#8221; The phrase is parallel to &#8220;the noisy city&#8221; in the preceding line.</p>
<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=880><b>sn</b> Apparently they died from starvation during the siege that preceded the final conquest of the city. See J. N. Oswalt, <i>Isaiah</i> (NICOT), 1:409. </p>
<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=881><b>tn</b> Verse 3 reads literally, &#8220;All your leaders ran away, apart from a bow they were captured, all your found ones were captured together, to a distant place they fled.&#8221; J. N. Oswalt (<i>Isaiah</i> [NICOT], 1:403, n. 3) suggests that the lines of the verse are arranged chiastically; lines 1 and 4 go together, while lines 2 and 3 are parallel. To translate the lines in the order they appear in the Hebrew text is misleading to the English reader, who is likely unfamiliar with, or at least insensitive to, chiastic parallelism. Consequently, the translation above arranges the lines as follows: line 1 (Hebrew) = line 1 (in translation); line 2 (Hebrew) = line 4 (in translation); line 3 (Hebrew) = line 3 (in translation); line 4 (Hebrew) = line 2 (in translation).</p>
<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=882><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;all your found ones.&#8221; To achieve tighter parallelism (see &#8220;your leaders&#8221;) some prefer to emend the form to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1510;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ammitsayikh</font>, &#8220;your strong ones&#8221;) or to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1488;&#1457;&#1502;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ne</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ematsayikh</font>, &#8220;your strengthened ones&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=883><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;apart from [i.e., without] a bow they were captured&#8221;; cf. NAB, NRSV &#8220;without the use of a bow.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=884><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;look away from me&#8221; (so KJV, ASV, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=885><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;don&#8217;t hurry&#8221; (so NCV).</p>
<A NAME="2210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=886><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the daughter of my people.&#8221; &#8220;Daughter&#8221; is here used metaphorically to express the speaker&#8217;s emotional attachment to his people, as well as their vulnerability and weakness.</p>
<A NAME="2211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=887><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term translated &#8220;sovereign master&#8221; here and in vv. 12, 14, 15 is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adonay</font>).</p>
<A NAME="2212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=888><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;For [there is] a day of panic, and trampling, and confusion for the master, the Lord who commands armies [traditionally, the Lord of hosts].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=889><b>tn</b> The traditional accentuation of the Hebrew text suggests that this phrase goes with what precedes.</p>
<A NAME="2214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=890><b>tn</b> The precise meaning of this statement is unclear. Some take <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1460;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qir</font>) as &#8220;wall&#8221; and interpret the verb to mean &#8220;tear down.&#8221; However, tighter parallelism (note the reference to crying for help in the next line) is achieved if one takes both the verb and noun from a root, attested in Ugaritic and Arabic, meaning &#8220;make a sound.&#8221; See J. N. Oswalt, <i>Isaiah</i> (NICOT), 1:404, n. 5. </p>
<A NAME="2215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=891><b>sn</b> Perhaps &#8220;the hill&#8221; refers to the temple mount.</p>
<A NAME="2216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=892><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;[with] the chariots of men, horsemen.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=893><b>sn</b> A distant region in the direction of Mesopotamia; see Amos 1:5; 9:7.</p>
<A NAME="2218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=894><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Kir uncovers&#8221; (so NAB, NIV).</p>
<A NAME="2219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=895><b>sn</b> The Elamites and men of Kir may here symbolize a fierce army from a distant land. If this oracle anticipates a Babylonian conquest of the city (see 39:5-7), then the Elamites and men of Kir are perhaps viewed here as mercenaries in the Babylonian army. See J. N. Oswalt, <i>Isaiah</i> (NICOT), 1:410. </p>
<A NAME="2220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=896><b>tn</b> The verb that introduces this verse serves as a discourse particle and is untranslated; see note on &#8220;in the future&#8221; in 2:2.</p>
<A NAME="2221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=897><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;taking a stand, take their stand.&#8221; The infinitive absolute emphasizes the following finite verb. The translation attempts to bring out this emphasis with the adverb &#8220;confidently.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=898><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;he,&#8221; i.e., the enemy invader. NASB, by its capitalization of the pronoun, takes this to refer to the Lord.</p>
<A NAME="2223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=899><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;covering.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=900><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;in that day&#8221; (so KJV), likewise at the beginning of v. 12.</p>
<A NAME="2225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=901><b>sn</b> Perhaps this refers to a royal armory, or to Solomon&#8217;s &#8220;House of the Forest of Lebanon,&#8221; where weapons may have been kept (see 1 Kgs 10:16-17).</p>
<A NAME="2226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=902><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the breaks of the city of David, you saw that they were many.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=903><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="2228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=904><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;you demolished the houses to fortify the wall.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=905><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;look at&#8221;; NAB, NRSV &#8220;did not look to.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=906><b>tn</b> The antecedent of the third feminine singular suffix here and in the next line is unclear. The closest feminine noun is &#8220;pool&#8221; in the first half of the verse. Perhaps this &#8220;old pool&#8221; symbolizes the entire city, which had prospered because of God&#8217;s provision and protection through the years.</p>
<A NAME="2231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=907><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;did not see.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=908><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;for baldness and the wearing of sackcloth.&#8221; See the note at 15:2.</p>
<A NAME="2233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=909><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;happiness and joy.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=910><b>tn</b> The prophet here quotes what the fatalistic people are saying. The introductory &#8220;you say&#8221; is supplied in the translation for clarification; the concluding verb &#8220;we die&#8221; makes it clear the people are speaking. The six verbs translated as imperatives are actually infinitives absolute, functioning here as finite verbs.</p>
<A NAME="2235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=911><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;it was revealed in my ears [by?] the Lord who commands armies [traditionally, the Lord of hosts].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=912><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Certainly this sin will not be atoned for until you die.&#8221; This does not imply that their death will bring atonement; rather it emphasizes that their sin is unpardonable. The statement has the form of an oath. </p>
<A NAME="2237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=913><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;who is over the house&#8221; (so ASV); NASB &#8220;who is in charge of the royal household.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=914><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;and tell him&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarification.</p>
<A NAME="2239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=915><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;What to you here? And who to you here?&#8221; The point of the second question is not entirely clear. The interpretation reflected in the translation is based on the following context, which suggests that Shebna has no right to think of himself so highly and arrange such an extravagant burial place for himself.</p>
<A NAME="2240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=916><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;that you chisel out.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=917><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;will throw you with a throwing.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=918><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;O man&#8221; (so NASB); NAB &#8220;mortal man&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;my fellow.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=919><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and the one who wraps you [will] wrap.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2244"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=920><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and he will tightly [or &#8220;surely&#8221;] wind you [with] winding like a ball, to a land broad of hands [i.e., &#8220;sides&#8221;].&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=921><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and there the chariots of your splendor.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2246"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=922><b>sn</b> Apparently the reference to chariots alludes to Shebna&#8217;s excessive pride, which in turn brings disgrace to the royal family. </p>
<A NAME="2247"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=923><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;I will push you away from.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=924><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;he will throw you down.&#8221; The shift from the first to third person is peculiar and abrupt, but certainly not unprecedented in Hebrew poetry. See GKC 462 §144.<i>p</i>. The third person may be indefinite (&#8220;one will throw you down&#8221;), in which case the passive translation is justified.</p>
<A NAME="2249"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=925><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;in that day.&#8221; The verb that introduces this verse serves as a discourse particle and is untranslated; see note on &#8220;in the future&#8221; in 2:2.</p>
<A NAME="2250"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=926><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and your dominion I will place in his hand.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2251"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=927><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;a father to.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">av</font>, &#8220;father&#8221;) is here used metaphorically of one who protects and supports those under his care and authority, like a father does his family. For another example of this metaphorical use of the word, see Job 29:16.</p>
<A NAME="2252"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=928><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;house.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2253"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=929><b>sn</b> This may refer to a literal insignia worn by the chief administrator. Even so, it would still symbolize the administrator&#8217;s authority to grant or exclude access to the king. See J. N. Oswalt, <i>Isaiah</i> (NICOT), 1:422.</p>
<A NAME="2254"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=930><b>sn</b> The metaphor depicts how secure his position will be.</p>
<A NAME="2255"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=931><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and he will become a glorious throne for the house of his father.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2256"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=932><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and all the glory of the house of his father they will hang on him.&#8221; The Lord returns to the peg metaphor of v. 23a. Eliakim&#8217;s secure position of honor will bring benefits and jobs to many others in the family. </p>
<A NAME="2257"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=933><b>tn</b> The precise meaning and derivation of this word are uncertain. Cf. KJV, ASV, NRSV &#8220;the issue&#8221;; CEV &#8220;relatives.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2258"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=934><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;all the small vessels, from the vessels that are bowls to all the vessels that are jars.&#8221; The picture is that of a single peg holding the weight of all kinds of containers hung from it.</p>
<A NAME="2259"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=935><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;In that day&#8221; (KJV).</p>
<A NAME="2260"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=936><b>sn</b> Eliakim&#8217;s authority, though seemingly secure, will eventually be removed, and with it his family&#8217;s prominence.</p>
<A NAME="2261"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=937><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;for&#8221; (KJV, NAB, NASB, NRSV).</p>
