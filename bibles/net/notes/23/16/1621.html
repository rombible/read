<A NAME="1621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=741><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;for over your fruit and over your harvest shouting has fallen.&#8221; The translation assumes that the shouting is that of the conqueror (Jer 51:14). Another possibility is that the shouting is that of the harvesters (see v. 10b, as well as Jer 25:30), in which case one might translate, &#8220;for the joyful shouting over the fruit and crops has fallen silent.&#8221;</p>
