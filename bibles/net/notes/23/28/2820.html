<A NAME="2820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1163><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Who is he teaching knowledge? For whom is he explaining a message?&#8221; The translation assumes that the Lord is the subject of the verbs &#8220;teaching&#8221; and &#8220;explaining,&#8221; and that the prophet is asking the questions. See v. 12. According to some vv. 9-10 record the people&#8217;s sarcastic response to the Lord&#8217;s message through Isaiah. </p>
