<A NAME="2823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1166><b>sn</b> This verse alludes to the coming Assyrian invasion, when the people will hear a foreign language that sounds like gibberish to them. The Lord is the subject of the verb &#8220;will speak,&#8221; as v. 12 makes clear. He once spoke in meaningful terms, but in the coming judgment he will speak to them, as it were, through the mouth of foreign oppressors. The apparent gibberish they hear will be an outward reminder that God has decreed their defeat. </p>
