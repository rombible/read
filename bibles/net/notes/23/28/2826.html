<A NAME="2826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1169><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;And the word of the Lord will be to them, &#8216;tsahv latsahv,&#8217; etc.&#8221; See the note at v. 10. In this case the &#8220;Lord&#8217;s word&#8221; is not the foreigner&#8217;s strange sounding words (as in v. 10), but the Lord&#8217;s repeated appeals to them (like the one quoted in v. 12). As time goes on, the Lord&#8217;s appeals through the prophets will have no impact on the people; they will regard prophetic preaching as gibberish. </p>
