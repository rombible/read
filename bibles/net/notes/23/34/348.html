<A NAME="348"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1475><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;indeed [or &#8220;for&#8221;] my sword is drenched in the heavens.&#8221; The Qumran scroll 1QIsa<sup>a</sup> has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew" size="-2">&#1514;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;</font> (&#8220;[my sword] appeared [in the heavens]&#8221;), but this is apparently an attempt to make sense out of a difficult metaphor. Cf. NIV &#8220;My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In v. 4 the &#8220;host of the heaven&#8221; refers to the heavenly luminaries (stars and planets, see, among others, Deut 4:19; 17:3; 2 Kgs 17:16; 21:3, 5; 23:4-5; 2 Chr 33:3, 5) that populate the divine/heavenly assembly in mythological and prescientific Israelite thought (see Job 38:7; Isa 14:13). As in 24:21, they are viewed here as opposing God and being defeated in battle. </p>
