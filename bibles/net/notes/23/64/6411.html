<A NAME="6411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2664><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text reads literally, &#8220;look, you were angry and we sinned against them continually [or perhaps, &#8220;in ancient times&#8221;] and we were delivered.&#8221; The statement makes little sense as it stands. The first <i>vav</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>] consecutive (&#8220;and we sinned&#8221;) must introduce an explanatory clause here (see Num 1:48 and Isa 39:1 for other examples of this relatively rare use of the <i>vav</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>] consecutive). The final verb (if rendered positively) makes no sense in this context &#8211; God&#8217;s anger at their sin resulted in judgment, not deliverance. One of the alternatives involves an emendation to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vannirsha</font>&#8217;, &#8220;and we were evil&#8221;; LXX, NRSV, TEV). The Vulgate and the Qumran scroll 1QIsa<sup>a</sup> support the MT reading. One can either accept an emendation or cast the statement as a question (as above).</p>
