<A NAME="274"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1107><b>tn</b> The description of Leviathan should be compared with the following excerpts from Ugaritic mythological texts: (1) &#8220;Was not the dragon (Ugaritic <i>tnn</i>, cognate with Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> [<font face="Scholar">tannin</font>, translated &#8220;sea monster&#8221; here]) vanquished and captured? I did destroy the wriggling (Ugaritic &#8217;<font face="Scholar">qltn</font>, cognate to Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1511;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aqallaton</font>, translated &#8220;squirming&#8221; here]) serpent, the tyrant with seven heads (cf. Ps 74:14).&#8221; (See <i>CTA</i> 3 iii 38-39.) (2) &#8220;for all that you smote Leviathan the slippery (Ugaritic <i>brh</i>, cognate to Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1495;&#1463;</font> [<font face="Scholar">bariakh</font>, translated &#8220;fast-moving&#8221; here]) serpent, [and] made an end of the wriggling serpent, the tyrant with seven heads&#8221; (See <i>CTA</i> 5 i 1-3.) </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In the Ugaritic mythological texts Leviathan is a sea creature that symbolizes the destructive water of the sea and in turn the forces of chaos that threaten the established order. Isaiah here applies imagery from Canaanite mythology to Yahweh&#8217;s eschatological victory over his enemies. Elsewhere in the OT, the battle with the sea motif is applied to Yahweh&#8217;s victories over the forces of chaos at creation and in history (cf. Pss 74:13-14; 77:16-20; 89:9-10; Isa 51:9-10). Yahweh&#8217;s subjugation of the chaos waters is related to His kingship (cf. Pss 29:3, 10; 93:3-4). Apocalyptic literature employs the imagery as well. The beasts of Dan 7 emerge from the sea, while Rev 13 speaks of a seven-headed beast coming from the sea.</p>
<A NAME="275"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1108><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;in that day&#8221; (so KJV).</p>

<A NAME="277"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1110><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;her.&#8221; Apparently &#8220;vineyard&#8221; is the antecedent, though normally this noun is understood as masculine (see Lev 25:3, however). </p>
<A NAME="278"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1111><b>tn</b> Or perhaps, &#8220;constantly.&#8221; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;by moments.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="2710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1113><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;it.&#8221; The feminine singular suffix apparently refers back to the expression &#8220;thorns and briers,&#8221; understood in a collective sense. For other examples of a cohortative expressing resolve after a hypothetical statement introduced by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1503;</font> with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mi </font>with<font face="Scholar"> natan</font>), see Judg 9:29; Jer 9:1-2; Ps 55:6.</p>
<A NAME="2711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1114><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;it.&#8221; The feminine singular suffix apparently refers back to the expression &#8220;thorns and briers,&#8221; understood in a collective sense.</p>
<A NAME="2712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1115><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;or let him take hold of my refuge.&#8221; The subject of the third masculine singular verb form is uncertain. Apparently the symbolic &#8220;thorns and briers&#8221; are in view, though in v. 4b a feminine singular pronoun was used to refer to them.</p>
<A NAME="2713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1116><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text has, &#8220;he makes peace with me, peace he makes with me.&#8221; Some contend that two alternative readings are preserved here and one should be deleted. The first has the object <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shalom</font>, &#8220;peace&#8221;) preceding the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asah</font>, &#8220;make&#8221;); the second reverses the order. Another option is to retain both statements, although repetitive, to emphasize the need to make peace with Yahweh.</p>
<A NAME="2714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1117><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text reads literally, &#8220;the coming ones, let Jacob take root.&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">habba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>, &#8220;the coming ones&#8221;) should probably be emended to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yamim va</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>, &#8220;days [are] coming&#8221;) or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">biyamim habba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>, &#8220;in the coming days&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="2715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1118><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fruit&#8221; (so KJV, NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="2716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1119><b>sn</b> This apparently refers to a future population explosion. See 26:18.</p>
<A NAME="2717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1120><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text reads literally, &#8220;Like the striking down of the one striking him down does he strike him down?&#8221; The meaning of the text is unclear, but this may be a rhetorical question, suggesting that Israel has not experienced divine judgment to the same degree as her oppressors. In this case &#8220;the one striking down&#8221; refers to Israel&#8217;s oppressors, while the pronoun &#8220;him&#8221; refers to Israel. The subject of the final verb (&#8220;does he strike down&#8221;) would then be God, while the pronoun &#8220;him&#8221; would again refer to Israel.</p>
<A NAME="2718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1121><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text reads literally, &#8220;Or like the killing of his killed ones is he killed?&#8221; If one accepts the interpretation of the parallel line outlined in the previous note, then this line too would contain a rhetorical question suggesting that Israel has not experienced destruction to the same degree as its enemies. In this case &#8220;his killed ones&#8221; refers to the one who struck Israel down, and Israel would be the subject of the final verb (&#8220;is he killed&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="2719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1122><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text reads literally, &#8220;in [?], in sending her away, you oppose her.&#8221; The meaning of this line is uncertain. The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1505;&#1463;&#1488;&#1505;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿsa</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ssÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>) is taken as an infinitive from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1463;&#1488;&#1505;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sa</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ssÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>) with a prepositional prefix and a third feminine singular suffix. (The MT does not have a <i>mappiq</i> in the final <i>he</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;</font>], however). According to <i>HALOT</i> 738 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1463;&#1488;&#1505;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font> the verb is a Palpel form from an otherwise unattested root cognate with an Arabic verb meaning &#8220;to gather beasts with a call.&#8221; Perhaps it means &#8220;to call, summon&#8221; here, but this is a very tentative proposal. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿshalkhah</font>, &#8220;in sending her away&#8221;) appears to be a Piel infinitive with a prepositional prefix and a third feminine singular suffix. Since the Piel of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shalakh</font>) can sometimes mean &#8220;divorce&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 1514-15 s.v.) and the following verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">riv</font>, &#8220;oppose&#8221;) can be used in legal contexts, it is possible that divorce proceedings are alluded to here. This may explain why Israel is referred to as feminine in this verse, in contrast to the masculine forms used in vv. 6-7 and 9.</p>
<A NAME="2720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1123><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has no object expressed, but one can understand a third feminine singular pronominal object and place a <i>mappiq</i> in the final <i>he</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;</font>) of the form to indicate the suffix.</p>
<A NAME="2721"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1124><b>sn</b> The &#8220;east wind&#8221; here symbolizes violent divine judgment.</p>
<A NAME="2722"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1125><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;be atoned for&#8221; (NIV); cf. NRSV &#8220;be expiated.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1126><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and this [is] all the fruit of removing his sin.&#8221; The meaning of the statement is not entirely clear, though &#8220;removing his sin&#8221; certainly parallels &#8220;Jacob&#8217;s sin will be removed&#8221; in the preceding line. If original, &#8220;all the fruit&#8221; may refer to the result of the decision to remove sin, but the phrase may be a corruption of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lekhaper</font>, &#8220;to atone for&#8221;), which in turn might be a gloss on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1505;&#1460;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hasir</font>, &#8220;removing&#8221;). </p>
<A NAME="2724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1127><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;when he makes the stones of an altar.&#8221; The singular &#8220;altar&#8221; is collective here; pagan altars are in view, as the last line of the verse indicates. See also 17:8.</p>
<A NAME="2725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1128><b>sn</b> As interpreted and translated above, this verse says that Israel must totally repudiate its pagan religious practices in order to experience God&#8217;s forgiveness and restoration. Another option is to understand &#8220;in this way&#8221; and &#8220;this&#8221; in v. 9a as referring back to the judgment described in v. 8. In this case <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kafar</font>, &#8220;atone for&#8221;) is used in a sarcastic sense; Jacob&#8217;s sin is &#8220;atoned for&#8221; and removed through severe judgment. Following this line of interpretation, one might paraphrase the verse as follows: &#8220;So in this way (through judgment) Jacob&#8217;s sin will be &#8220;atoned for,&#8221; and this is the way his sin will be removed, when he (i.e., God) makes all the altar stones like crushed limestone&#8230;.&#8221; This interpretation is more consistent with the tone of judgment in vv. 8 and 10-11. </p>
<A NAME="2726"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1129><b>sn</b> The identity of this city is uncertain. The context suggests that an Israelite city, perhaps Samaria or Jerusalem, is in view. For discussions of interpretive options see J. N. Oswalt, <i>Isaiah</i> (NICOT), 1:496-97, and Paul L. Redditt, &#8220;Once Again, the City in Isaiah 24-27,&#8221; <i>HAR</i> 10 (1986), 332.</p>
<A NAME="2727"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1130><b>tn</b> The singular form in the text is probably collective.</p>
<A NAME="2728"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1131><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and destroy her branches.&#8221; The city is the antecedent of the third feminine singular pronominal suffix. Apparently the city is here compared to a tree. See also v. 11. </p>
<A NAME="2729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1132><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;are dry&#8221; (so NASB, NIV, NRSV).</p>

<A NAME="2733"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1136><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the Lord will beat out.&#8221; The verb is used of beating seeds or grain to separate the husk from the kernel (see Judg 6:11; Ruth 2:17; Isa 28:27), and of beating the olives off the olive tree (Deut 24:20). The latter metaphor may be in view here, where a tree metaphor has been employed in the preceding verses. See also 17:6. </p>
<A NAME="2734"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1137><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the river,&#8221; a frequent designation in the OT for the Euphrates. For clarity most modern English versions substitute the name &#8220;Euphrates&#8221; for &#8220;the river&#8221; here.</p>
<A NAME="2735"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1138><b>sn</b> The Israelites will be freed from exile (likened to beating the olives off the tree) and then gathered (likened to collecting the olives).</p>
