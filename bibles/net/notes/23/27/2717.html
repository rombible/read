<A NAME="2717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1120><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text reads literally, &#8220;Like the striking down of the one striking him down does he strike him down?&#8221; The meaning of the text is unclear, but this may be a rhetorical question, suggesting that Israel has not experienced divine judgment to the same degree as her oppressors. In this case &#8220;the one striking down&#8221; refers to Israel&#8217;s oppressors, while the pronoun &#8220;him&#8221; refers to Israel. The subject of the final verb (&#8220;does he strike down&#8221;) would then be God, while the pronoun &#8220;him&#8221; would again refer to Israel.</p>
