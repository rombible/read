<A NAME="2718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1121><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text reads literally, &#8220;Or like the killing of his killed ones is he killed?&#8221; If one accepts the interpretation of the parallel line outlined in the previous note, then this line too would contain a rhetorical question suggesting that Israel has not experienced destruction to the same degree as its enemies. In this case &#8220;his killed ones&#8221; refers to the one who struck Israel down, and Israel would be the subject of the final verb (&#8220;is he killed&#8221;).</p>
