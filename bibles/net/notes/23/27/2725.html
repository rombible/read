<A NAME="2725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1128><b>sn</b> As interpreted and translated above, this verse says that Israel must totally repudiate its pagan religious practices in order to experience God&#8217;s forgiveness and restoration. Another option is to understand &#8220;in this way&#8221; and &#8220;this&#8221; in v. 9a as referring back to the judgment described in v. 8. In this case <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kafar</font>, &#8220;atone for&#8221;) is used in a sarcastic sense; Jacob&#8217;s sin is &#8220;atoned for&#8221; and removed through severe judgment. Following this line of interpretation, one might paraphrase the verse as follows: &#8220;So in this way (through judgment) Jacob&#8217;s sin will be &#8220;atoned for,&#8221; and this is the way his sin will be removed, when he (i.e., God) makes all the altar stones like crushed limestone&#8230;.&#8221; This interpretation is more consistent with the tone of judgment in vv. 8 and 10-11. </p>
