<A NAME="2733"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1136><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the Lord will beat out.&#8221; The verb is used of beating seeds or grain to separate the husk from the kernel (see Judg 6:11; Ruth 2:17; Isa 28:27), and of beating the olives off the olive tree (Deut 24:20). The latter metaphor may be in view here, where a tree metaphor has been employed in the preceding verses. See also 17:6. </p>
