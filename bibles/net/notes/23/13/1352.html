<A NAME="1352"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=637><b>sn</b> When was the prophecy of Babylon&#8217;s fall fulfilled? Some argue that the prophecy was fulfilled in 689 <sc>b.c. when the Assyrians under Sennacherib sacked and desecrated the city (this event is alluded to in 23:13). This may have been an initial phase in the fulfillment of the prophecy, but the reference to the involvement of the Medes (v. 17) and the suggestion that Babylon&#8217;s demise will bring about the restoration of Israel (14:1-2) indicate that the fall of Babylon to the Medes and Persians in 538 <sc>b.c. is the primary focus of the prophecy. (After all, the Lord did reveal to Isaiah that the Chaldeans [not the Assyrians] would someday conquer Jerusalem and take the people into exile [see 39:5-7].) However, the vivid picture of destruction in vv. 15-22 raises a problem. The Medes and Persians did not destroy the city; in fact Cyrus&#8217; takeover of Babylon, though preceded by a military campaign, was relatively peaceful and even welcomed by some Babylonian religious officials. How then does one explain the prophecy&#8217;s description of the city&#8217;s violent fall? As noted above, the events of 689 <sc>b.c. and 538 <sc>b.c. may have been merged in the prophecy. However, it is more likely that the language is stylized and exaggerated for rhetorical effect. See Isa 34:11-15; Jer 50:39-40 (describing Babylon&#8217;s fall in 538 <sc>b.c.); 51:36-37 (describing Babylon&#8217;s fall in 538 <sc>b.c.); Zeph 2:13-15; the extra-biblical Sefire treaty curses; and Ashurbanipal&#8217;s description of the destruction of Elam in his royal annals. In other words, the events of 538 <sc>b.c. essentially, though not necessarily literally, fulfill the prophecy.</p>
