<A NAME="137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=592><b>sn</b> In vv. 4-10 the prophet appears to be speaking, since the Lord is referred to in the third person. However, since the Lord refers to himself in the third person later in this chapter (see v. 13), it is possible that he speaks throughout the chapter. </p>
