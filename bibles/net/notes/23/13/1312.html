<A NAME="1312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=597><b>tn</b> Or perhaps, &#8220;land&#8221; (so KJV, NAB, NASB, NLT). Even though the heading and subsequent context (see v. 17) indicate Babylon&#8217;s judgment is in view, the chapter has a cosmic flavor that suggests that the coming judgment is universal in scope. Perhaps Babylon&#8217;s downfall occurs in conjunction with a wider judgment, or the cosmic style is poetic hyperbole used to emphasize the magnitude and importance of the coming event.</p>
