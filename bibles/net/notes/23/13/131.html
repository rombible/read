<A NAME="131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=586><b>sn</b> Isa 13-23 contains a series of judgment oracles against various nations. It is likely that Israel, not the nations mentioned, actually heard these oracles. The oracles probably had a twofold purpose. For those leaders who insisted on getting embroiled in international politics, these oracles were a reminder that Judah need not fear foreign nations or seek international alliances for security reasons. For the righteous remnant within the nation, these oracles were a reminder that Israel&#8217;s God was indeed the sovereign ruler of the earth, worthy of his people&#8217;s trust.</p>
