<A NAME="3112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1346><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;As a lion growls, a young lion over its prey.&#8221; In the Hebrew text the opening comparison is completed later in the verse (&#8220;so the Lord will come down&#8230;&#8221;), after a parenthesis describing how fearless the lion is. The present translation divides the verse into three sentences for English stylistic reasons.</p>
