<A NAME="3118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1352><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Return to the one [against] whom the sons of Israel made deep rebellion.&#8221; The syntax is awkward here. A preposition is omitted by ellipsis after the verb (see GKC 446 §138.<i>f</i>, n. 2), and there is a shift from direct address (note the second plural imperative &#8220;return&#8221;) to the third person (note &#8220;they made deep&#8221;). For other examples of abrupt shifts in person in poetic style, see GKC 462 §144.<i>p</i>. </p>
