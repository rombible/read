<A NAME="3117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1351><b>tn</b> The only other occurrence of this verb is in Exod 12:13, 23, 27, where the Lord &#8220;passes over&#8221; (i.e., &#8220;spares&#8221;) the Israelite households as he comes to judge their Egyptian oppressors. The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1505;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pesakh</font>, &#8220;Passover&#8221;) is derived from the verb. The use of the verb in Isa 31:5 is probably an intentional echo of the Exodus event. As in the days of Moses the Lord will spare his people as he comes to judge their enemies.</p>
