<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=93><b>sn</b> This implement was used to prune the vines, i.e., to cut off extra leaves and young shoots (H. Wildberger, <i>Isaiah</i>, 1:93; M. Klingbeil, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 1:1117-18). It was a short knife with a curved hook at the end sharpened on the inside like a sickle. Breaking weapons and fashioning agricultural implements indicates a transition from fear and stress to peace and security.</p>
