<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=103><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;men bow down, men are low.&#8221; Since the verbs <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shakhakh</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shafal</font>) are used later in this discourse to describe how God will humiliate proud men (see vv. 11, 17), some understand v. 9a as a prediction of judgment, &#8220;men will be brought down, men will be humiliated.&#8221; However, these prefixed verbal forms with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive appear to carry on the description that precedes and are better taken with the accusation. They draw attention to the fact that human beings actually bow down and worship before the lifeless products of their own hands. </p>
