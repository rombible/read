<A NAME="245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=125><b>sn</b> The precise point of vv. 20-21 is not entirely clear. Are they taking the idols into their hiding places with them, because they are so attached to their man-made images? Or are they discarding the idols along the way as they retreat into the darkest places they can find? In either case it is obvious that the gods are incapable of helping them. </p>
