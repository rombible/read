<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=99><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and with the children of foreigners they [?].&#8221; The precise meaning of the final word is uncertain. Some take this verb (I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1511;</font>, <font face="Scholar">safaq</font>) to mean &#8220;slap,&#8221; supply the object &#8220;hands,&#8221; and translate, &#8220;they slap [hands] with foreigners&#8221;; <i>HALOT</i> 1349 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1511;</font>. This could be a reference to foreign alliances. This translation has two disadvantages: It requires the conjectural insertion of &#8220;hands&#8221; and the use of this verb with its object prefixed with a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet</font>) preposition with this meaning does not occur elsewhere. The other uses of this verb refer to clapping at someone, an indication of hostility. The translation above assumes the verb is derived from II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1511;</font> (&#8220;to suffice,&#8221; attested in the Qal in 1 Kgs 20:10; <i>HALOT</i> 1349 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1511;</font>). In this case the point is that a sufficient number of foreigners (in this case, too many!) live in the land. The disadvantage of this option is that the preposition prefixed to &#8220;the children of foreigners&#8221; does not occur with this verb elsewhere. The chosen translation is preferred since it continues the idea of abundant foreign influence and does not require a conjectural insertion or emendation.</p>
