<A NAME="238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=118><b>tn</b> The identity of the grammatical subject is unclear. The &#8220;idols&#8221; could be the subject; they will &#8220;go&#8221; into the caves and holes when the idolaters throw them there in their haste to escape God&#8217;s judgment (see vv. 20-21). The picture of the idols, which represent the foreign deities worshiped by the people, fleeing from the Lord would be highly polemical and fit the overall mood of the chapter. However it seems more likely that the idolaters themselves are the subject, for v. 10 uses similar language in sarcastically urging them to run from judgment.</p>
