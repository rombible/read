<A NAME="6325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2634><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and he remembered the days of antiquity, Moses, his people.&#8221; The syntax of the statement is unclear. The translation assumes that &#8220;his people&#8221; is the subject of the verb &#8220;remembered.&#8221; If original, &#8220;Moses&#8221; is in apposition to &#8220;the days of antiquity,&#8221; more precisely identifying the time period referred to. However, the syntactical awkwardness suggests that &#8220;Moses&#8221; may have been an early marginal note (perhaps identifying &#8220;the shepherd of his flock&#8221; two lines later) that has worked its way into the text. </p>
