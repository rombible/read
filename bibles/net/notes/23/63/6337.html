<A NAME="6337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2646><b>tn</b> Some suggest a tolerative use of the Hiphil here, &#8220;[why do] you allow us to stray?&#8221; (cf. NLT). Though the Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ta</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>) appears to be tolerative in Jer 50:6, elsewhere it is preferable or necessary to take it as causative. See Isa 3:12; 9:15; and 30:28, as well as Gen 20:13; 2 Kgs 21:9; Job 12:24-25; Prov 12:26; Jer 23:13, 32; Hos 4:12; Amos 2:4; Mic 3:5.</p>
