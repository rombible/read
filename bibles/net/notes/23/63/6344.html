<A NAME="6344"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=2653><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;you did not rule them, your name was not called over them.&#8221; The expression &#8220;the name is called over&#8221; indicates ownership; see the note at 4:1. As these two lines stand they are very difficult to interpret. They appear to be stating that the adversaries just mentioned in v. 18 have not been subject to the Lord&#8217;s rule in the past, perhaps explaining why they could commit the atrocity described in v. 18b.</p>
