<A NAME="6320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2629><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the messenger [or &#8220;angel&#8221;] of his face&#8221;; NIV &#8220;the angel of his presence.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This may refer to the &#8220;angel of God&#8221; mentioned in Exod 14:19, who in turn may be identical to the divine &#8220;presence&#8221; (literally, &#8220;face&#8221;) referred to in Exod 33:14-15 and Deut 4:37. Here in Isa 63 this messenger may be equated with God&#8217;s &#8220;holy Spirit&#8221; (see vv. 10-11) and &#8220;the Spirit of the Lord&#8221; (v. 14). See also Ps 139:7, where God&#8217;s &#8220;Spirit&#8221; seems to be equated with his &#8220;presence&#8221; (literally, &#8220;face&#8221;) in the synonymous parallelistic structure.</p>
