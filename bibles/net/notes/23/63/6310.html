<A NAME="6310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2619><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;for the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my revenge came.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1463;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ulai</font>) is sometimes translated here &#8220;my redemption,&#8221; for the verbal root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1488;&#1500;</font> often means &#8220;deliver, buy back.&#8221; A <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">go</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>, &#8220;kinsman-redeemer&#8221;) was responsible for protecting the extended family&#8217;s interests, often by redeeming property that had been sold outside the family. However, the responsibilities of a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;</font> extended beyond financial concerns. He was also responsible for avenging the shed blood of a family member (see Num 35:19-27; Deut 19:6-12). In Isa 63:4, where vengeance is a prominent theme (note the previous line), it is probably this function of the family protector that is in view. The Lord pictures himself as a blood avenger who waits for the day of vengeance to arrive and then springs into action.</p>
