<A NAME="6326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2635><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has a plural form, which if retained and taken as a numerical plural, would probably refer to Moses, Aaron, and the Israelite tribal leaders at the time of the Exodus. Most prefer to emend the form to the singular (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>) and understand this as a reference just to Moses.</p>
