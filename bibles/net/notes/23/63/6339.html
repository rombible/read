<A NAME="6339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2648><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;[Why do] you harden our heart[s] so as not to fear you.&#8221; The interrogative particle is understood by ellipsis (note the preceding line).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> How direct this hardening is, one cannot be sure. The speaker may envision direct involvement on the Lord&#8217;s part. The Lord has brought the exile as judgment for the nation&#8217;s sin and now he continues to keep them at arm&#8217;s length by blinding them spiritually. The second half of 64:7 might support this, though the precise reading of the final verb is uncertain. On the other hand, the idiom of lament is sometimes ironic and hyperbolically deterministic. For example, Naomi lamented that Shaddai was directly opposing her and bringing her calamity (Ruth 1:20-21), while the author of Ps 88 directly attributes his horrible suffering and loneliness to God (see especially vv. 6-8, 16-18). Both individuals make little, if any, room for intermediate causes or the principle of sin and death which ravages the human race. In the same way, the speaker in Isa 63:17 (who evidences great spiritual sensitivity and is anything but &#8220;hardened&#8221;) may be referring to the hardships of exile, which discouraged and even embittered the people, causing many of them to retreat from their Yahwistic faith. In this case, the &#8220;hardening&#8221; in view is more indirect and can be lifted by the Lord&#8217;s intervention. Whether the hardening here is indirect or direct, it is important to recognize that the speaker sees it as one of the effects of rebellion against the Lord (note especially 64:5-6).</p>
