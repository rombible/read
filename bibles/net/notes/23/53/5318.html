<A NAME="5318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2270><b>tn</b> Elsewhere the Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">paga</font>&#8217;) means &#8220;to intercede verbally&#8221; (Jer 15:11; 36:25) or &#8220;to intervene militarily&#8221; (Isa 59:16), but neither nuance fits here. Apparently here the Hiphil is the causative of the normal Qal meaning, &#8220;encounter, meet, touch.&#8221; The Qal sometimes refers to a hostile encounter or attack; when used in this way the object is normally introduced by the preposition -<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet</font>, see Josh 2:16; Judg 8:21; 15:12, etc.). Here the causative Hiphil has a double object &#8211; the Lord makes &#8220;sin&#8221; attack &#8220;him&#8221; (note that the object attacked is introduced by the preposition -<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font>. In their sin the group was like sheep who had wandered from God&#8217;s path. They were vulnerable to attack; the guilt of their sin was ready to attack and destroy them. But then the servant stepped in and took the full force of the attack. </p>
