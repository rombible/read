<A NAME="535"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2257><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the arm of the Lord.&#8221; The &#8220;arm of the Lord&#8221; is a metaphor of military power; it pictures the Lord as a warrior who bares his arm, takes up his weapon, and crushes his enemies (cf. 51:9-10; 63:5-6). But Israel had not seen the Lord&#8217;s military power at work in the servant.</p>
