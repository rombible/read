<A NAME="5328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2280><b>tn</b> The meaning of this line is uncertain. It reads literally, &#8220;if you/she makes, a reparation offering, his life.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tasim</font>) could be second masculine singular,in which case it would have to be addressed to the servant or to God. However, the servant is only addressed once in this servant song (see 52:14a), and God either speaks or is spoken about in this servant song; he is never addressed. Furthermore, the idea of God himself making a reparation offering is odd. If the verb is taken as third feminine singular, then the feminine noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>) at the end of the line is the likely subject. In this case one can take the suffixed form of the noun as equivalent to a pronoun and translate, &#8220;if he [literally, &#8220;his life&#8221;] makes a reparation offering.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> What constitutes the servant&#8217;s reparation offering? Some might think his suffering, but the preceding context views this as past, while the verb here is imperfect in form. The offering appears to be something the servant does after his suffering has been completed. Perhaps the background of the language can be found in the Levitical code, where a healed leper would offer a reparation offering as part of the ritual to achieve ceremonial cleanliness (see Lev 14). The servant was pictured earlier in the song as being severely ill. This illness (a metaphor for the effects of the people&#8217;s sin) separated him from God. However, here we discover the separation is not final; once reparation is made, so to speak, he will again experience the Lord&#8217;s favor.</p>
