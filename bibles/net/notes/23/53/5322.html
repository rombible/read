<A NAME="5322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2274><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and his generation, who considers?&#8221; (NASB similar). Some understand &#8220;his generation&#8221; as a reference to descendants. In this case the question would suggest that he will have none. However, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et</font>) may be taken here as specifying a new subject (see BDB 85 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1514;</font> 3). If &#8220;his generation&#8221; refers to the servant&#8217;s contemporary generation, one may then translate, &#8220;As for his contemporary generation, who took note?&#8221; The point would be that few were concerned about the harsh treatment he received.</p>
