<A NAME="5320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2272><b>sn</b> This verse emphasizes the servant&#8217;s silent submission. The comparison to a sheep does not necessarily suggest a sacrificial metaphor. Sheep were slaughtered for food as well as for sacrificial rituals, and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1462;&#1489;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tevakh</font>) need not refer to sacrificial slaughter (see Gen 43:16; Prov 7:22; 9:2; Jer 50:27; note also the use of the related verb in Exod 21:37; Deut 28:31; 1 Sam 25:11). </p>
