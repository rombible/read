<A NAME="5332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2284><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;he will acquit, a righteous one, my servant, many.&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsadiq</font>) may refer to the servant, but more likely it is dittographic (note the preceding verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1510;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1511;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yatsdiq</font>). The precise meaning of the verb (the Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1511;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tsadaq</font>) is debated. Elsewhere the Hiphil is used at least six times in the sense of &#8220;make righteous&#8221; in a legal sense, i.e., &#8220;pronounce innocent, acquit&#8221; (see Exod 23:7; Deut 25:1; 1 Kgs 8:32 = 2 Chr 6:23; Prov 17:15; Isa 5:23). It can also mean &#8220;render justice&#8221; (as a royal function, see 2 Sam 15:4; Ps 82:3), &#8220;concede&#8221; (Job 27:5), &#8220;vindicate&#8221; (Isa 50:8), and &#8220;lead to righteousness&#8221; (by teaching and example, Dan 12:3). The preceding context and the next line suggest a legal sense here. Because of his willingness to carry the people&#8217;s sins, the servant is able to &#8220;acquit&#8221; them. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Some (e.g., H. M. Orlinsky, &#8220;The So-called &#8216;Suffering Servant&#8217; in Isaiah 53,22,&#8221; VTSup 14 [1967]: 3-133) object to this legal interpretation of the language, arguing that it would be unjust for the righteous to suffer for the wicked and for the wicked to be declared innocent. However, such a surprising development is consistent with the ironic nature of this song. It does seem unfair for the innocent to die for the guilty. But what is God to do when all have sinned and wandered off like stray sheep (cf. v. 6)? Covenant law demands punishment, but punishment in this case would mean annihilation of what God has created. God&#8217;s justice, as demanded by the law, must be satisfied. To satisfy his justice, he does something seemingly unjust. He punishes his sinless servant, the only one who has not strayed off! In the progress of biblical revelation, we discover that the sinless servant is really God in the flesh, who offers himself because he is committed to the world he has created. If his justice can only be satisfied if he himself endures the punishment, then so be it. What appears to be an act of injustice is really love satisfying the demands of justice!</p>
