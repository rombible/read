<A NAME="5334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2286><b>tn</b> Scholars have debated the precise meaning of the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rabbim</font>) that occurs five times in this passage (Isa 52:14, 15; 53:11, 12 [2x]). Its two broad categories of translation are &#8220;much&#8221;/&#8220;many&#8221; and &#8220;great&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 1171-72 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;</font>). Unlike other Hebrew terms for might or strength, this term is linked with numbers or abundance. In all sixteen uses outside of Isaiah 52:13-53:12 (articular and plural) it signifies an inclusive meaning: &#8220;the majority&#8221; or &#8220;the multitude&#8221; (J. Jeremias, <i>TDNT</i> 6:536-37). This term occurs in parallelism with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">atsumim</font>), which normally signifies &#8220;numerous&#8221; or &#8220;large&#8221; or &#8220;powerful&#8221; (through large numbers). Like <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rabbim</font>), it refers to greatness in numbers (cf. Deut 4:38; 7:1; 9:1; 11:34). It emphasizes the multitudes with whom the Servant will share the spoil of his victory. As J. Olley wrote: &#8220;Yahweh has won the victory and vindicates his Servant, giving to him many subservient people, together with their spoils. These numerous peoples in turn receive blessing, sharing in the &#8220;peace&#8221; resulting from Yahweh&#8217;s victory and the Servant&#8217;s suffering&#8221; (John W. Olley, &#8220;&#8216;The Many&#8217;: How Is Isa 53,12a to Be Understood,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 68 [1987]: 330-56).</p>
