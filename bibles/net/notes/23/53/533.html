<A NAME="533"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2255><b>tn</b> The first half of v. 1 is traditionally translated, &#8220;Who has believed our report?&#8221; or &#8220;Who has believed our message?&#8221; as if the group speaking is lamenting that no one will believe what they have to say. But that doesn&#8217;t seem to be the point in this context. Here the group speaking does not cast itself in the role of a preacher or evangelist. No, they are repentant sinners, who finally see the light. The phrase &#8220;our report&#8221; can mean (1) the report which we deliver, or (2) the report which was delivered to us. The latter fits better here, where the report is most naturally taken as the announcement that has just been made in 52:13-15.</p>
