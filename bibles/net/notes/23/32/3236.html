<A NAME="3236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1398><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and [?] when the forest descends.&#8221; The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">uvarad</font>) is often understood as an otherwise unattested denominative verb meaning &#8220;to hail&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 154 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1512;&#1491;</font>). In this case one might translate, &#8220;and it hails when the forest is destroyed&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV, NASB, NIV). Perhaps the text alludes to a powerful wind and hail storm that knocks down limbs and trees. Some prefer to emend the form to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿyarad</font>), &#8220;and it descends,&#8221; which provides better, though not perfect, symmetry with the parallel line (cf. NAB). Perhaps <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1491;</font> should be dismissed as dittographic. In this case the statement (&#8220;when the forest descends&#8221;) lacks a finite verb and seems incomplete, but perhaps it is subordinate to v. 20.</p>
