<A NAME="5716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2392><b>tn</b> The text reads literally, &#8220;Because of these am I relenting?&#8221; If the prefixed interrogative particle is retained at the beginning of the sentence, then the question would be rhetorical, with the Niphal of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakham</font>) probably being used in the sense of &#8220;relent, change one&#8217;s mind.&#8221; One could translate: &#8220;Because of these things, how can I relent?&#8221; However, the initial letter he may be dittographic (note the final <i>he</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;</font>] on the preceding word). In this case one may understand the verb in the sense of &#8220;console oneself, seek vengeance,&#8221; as in 1:24.</p>
