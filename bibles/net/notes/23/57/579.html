<A NAME="579"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2385><b>tn</b> The translation assumes that this verse, in proverbial fashion, laments society&#8217;s apathy over the persecution of the godly. The second half of the verse observes that such apathy results in more widespread oppression. Since the next verse pictures the godly being taken to a place of rest, some interpret the second half of v. 1 in a more positive vein. According to proponents of this view, God removes the godly so that they might be spared suffering and calamity, a fact which the general populace fails to realize. </p>
