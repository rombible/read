<A NAME="5742"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=2418><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the one who dwells forever.&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1499;&#1461;&#1503; &#1506;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shokhen </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ad</font>) is sometimes translated &#8220;the one who lives forever,&#8221; and understood as a reference to God&#8217;s eternal existence. However, the immediately preceding and following descriptions (&#8220;high and exalted&#8221; and &#8220;holy&#8221;) emphasize his sovereign rule. In the next line, he declares, &#8220;I dwell in an exalted and holy [place],&#8221; which refers to the place from which he rules. Therefore it is more likely that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1499;&#1461;&#1503; &#1506;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shokhen </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ad</font>) means &#8220;I dwell [in my lofty palace] forever&#8221; and refers to God&#8217;s eternal kingship.</p>
