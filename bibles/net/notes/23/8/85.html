<A NAME="85"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=354><b>tn</b> The form in the text is a cohortative with prefixed <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>), suggesting that the Lord is announcing what he will do. Some prefer to change the verb to an imperative, &#8220;and summon as witnesses,&#8221; a reading that finds support from the Qumran scroll 1QIsa<sup>a</sup>. Another option is to point the prefixed conjunction as a <i>vav</i> consecutive and translate, &#8220;So I summoned as witnesses.&#8221; In this case Isaiah is recalling his response to the Lord&#8217;s commission. In any case, the reference to witnesses suggests that the name and the child who bears it will function as signs.</p>
