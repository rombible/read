<A NAME="818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=367><b>tn</b> The initial imperative (&#8220;get ready for battle&#8221;) acknowledges the reality of the nations&#8217; hostility; the concluding imperative (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;be shattered&#8221;) is rhetorical and expresses the speakers&#8217; firm conviction of the outcome of the nations&#8217; attack. (See the note on &#8220;be broken.&#8221;) One could paraphrase, &#8220;Okay, go ahead and prepare for battle since that&#8217;s what you want to do, but your actions will backfire and you&#8217;ll be shattered.&#8221; This rhetorical use of the imperatives is comparable to saying to a child who is bent on climbing a high tree, &#8220;Okay, go ahead, climb the tree and break your arm!&#8221; What this really means is: &#8220;Okay, go ahead and climb the tree since that&#8217;s what you really want to do, but your actions will backfire and you&#8217;ll break your arm.&#8221; The repetition of the statement in the final two lines of the verse gives the challenge the flavor of a taunt (ancient Israelite &#8220;trash talking,&#8221; as it were). </p>
