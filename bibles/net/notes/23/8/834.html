<A NAME="834"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=383><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;signs and portents&#8221; (NAB, NRSV). The names of all three individuals has symbolic value. Isaiah&#8217;s name (which meant &#8220;the Lord delivers&#8221;) was a reminder that the Lord was the nation&#8217;s only source of protection; Shear-jashub&#8217;s name was meant, at least originally, to encourage Ahaz (see the note at 7:3), and Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz&#8217;s name was a guarantee that God would defeat Israel and Syria (see the note at 8:4). The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1508;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mofet</font>, &#8220;portent&#8221;) can often refer to some miraculous event, but in 20:3 it is used, along with its synonym <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ot</font>, &#8220;sign&#8221;) of Isaiah&#8217;s walking around half-naked as an object lesson of what would soon happen to the Egyptians. </p>
