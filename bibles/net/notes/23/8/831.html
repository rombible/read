<A NAME="831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=380><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;seal [the] instruction among my followers.&#8221; The &#8220;instruction&#8221; probably refers to the prophet&#8217;s exhortations and warnings. When the people are judged for the sins, the prophet can produce these earlier messages and essentially say, &#8220;I told you so.&#8221; In this way he can authenticate his ministry and impress upon the people the reality of God&#8217;s authority over them. </p>
