<A NAME="5227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2251><b>tn</b> Traditionally the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1494;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yazzeh</font>, a Hiphil stem) has been understood as a causative of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1494;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nazah</font>, &#8220;spurt, spatter&#8221;) and translated &#8220;sprinkle.&#8221; In this case the passage pictures the servant as a priest who &#8220;sprinkles&#8221; (or spiritually cleanses) the nations. Though the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1494;&#1464;&#1492;</font> does occur in the Hiphil with the meaning &#8220;sprinkle,&#8221; the usual interpretation is problematic. In all other instances where the object or person sprinkled is indicated, the verb is combined with a preposition. This is not the case in Isaiah 52:15, unless one takes the following <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alayv</font>, &#8220;on him&#8221;) with the preceding line. But then one would have to emend the verb to a plural, make the nations the subject of the verb &#8220;sprinkle,&#8221; and take the servant as the object. Consequently some interpreters doubt the cultic idea of &#8220;sprinkling&#8221; is present here. Some emend the text; others propose a homonymic root meaning &#8220;spring, leap,&#8221; which in the Hiphil could mean &#8220;cause to leap, startle&#8221; and would fit the parallelism of the verse nicely. </p>
