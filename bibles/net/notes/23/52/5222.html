<A NAME="5222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2246><b>tn</b> Some witnesses read &#8220;him,&#8221; which is more consistent with the context, where the servant is spoken about, not addressed. However, it is possible that the Lord briefly addresses the servant here. The present translation assumes the latter view and places the phrase in parentheses.</p>
