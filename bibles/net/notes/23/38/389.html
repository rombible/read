<A NAME="389"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1632><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;Isaiah replied&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarification. In the present form of the Hebrew text v. 7 is joined directly to v. 6, but vv. 21-22, if original to Isaiah 38, must be inserted here. See 2 Kgs 20:7-8. </p>
