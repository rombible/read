<A NAME="3816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1639><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1491;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khadel</font>), which appears to be derived from a verbal root meaning &#8220;to cease, refrain.&#8221; But the form has probably suffered an error of transmission; the original form (attested in a few medieval Hebrew <sc>mss) was likely <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kheled</font>, &#8220;world&#8221;).</p>
