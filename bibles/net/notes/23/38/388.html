<A NAME="388"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1631><b>tc</b> If original to Isaiah 38, vv. 21-22 have obviously been misplaced in the course of the text&#8217;s transmission, and would most naturally be placed here, between Isa 38:6 and 38:7. See 2 Kgs 20:7-8, where these verses are placed at this point in the narrative, not at the end. Another possibility is that these verses were not in the original account, and a scribe, familiar with the 2 Kgs version of the story, appended vv. 21-22 to the end of the account in Isaiah 38.</p>
