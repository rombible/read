<A NAME="82"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=351><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;write&#8221; (so KJV, ASV, NIV, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="83"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=352><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;with the stylus of a man.&#8221; The significance of the qualifying genitive &#8220;a man&#8221; is uncertain. For various interpretations see J. N. Oswalt, <i>Isaiah</i> (NICOT), 1:219, n. 1.</p>
<A NAME="84"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=353><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;quickly, [the] plunder; it hurries, [the] loot.&#8221; The first word (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1492;&#1461;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">maher</font>) is either a Piel imperative (&#8220;hurry [to]&#8221;) or infinitive (&#8220;hurrying,&#8221; or &#8220;quickly&#8221;). The third word (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khash</font>) is either a third masculine singular perfect or a masculine singular participle, in either case from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khush</font>, &#8220;hurry&#8221;). Perhaps it is best to translate, &#8220;One hastens to the plunder, one hurries to the loot.&#8221; In this case <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1492;&#1461;&#1512;</font> is understood as an infinitive functioning as a verb, the subject of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;</font> is taken as indefinite, and the two nouns are understood as adverbial accusatives. As we discover in v. 3, this is the name of the son to be born to Isaiah through the prophetess.</p>
<A NAME="85"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=354><b>tn</b> The form in the text is a cohortative with prefixed <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>), suggesting that the Lord is announcing what he will do. Some prefer to change the verb to an imperative, &#8220;and summon as witnesses,&#8221; a reading that finds support from the Qumran scroll 1QIsa<sup>a</sup>. Another option is to point the prefixed conjunction as a <i>vav</i> consecutive and translate, &#8220;So I summoned as witnesses.&#8221; In this case Isaiah is recalling his response to the Lord&#8217;s commission. In any case, the reference to witnesses suggests that the name and the child who bears it will function as signs.</p>
<A NAME="86"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=355><b>map</b> For location see Map2-B1; Map4-D3; Map5-E2; Map6-A4; Map7-C1.</p>
<A NAME="87"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=356><b>sn</b> The child&#8217;s name foreshadows what will happen to Judah&#8217;s enemies; when their defeat takes place, the child will be a reminder that God predicted the event and brought it to pass. As such the child will be a reminder of God&#8217;s protective presence with his people.</p>
<A NAME="88"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=357><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text begins with &#8220;because.&#8221; In the Hebrew text vv. 6-7 are one long sentence, with v. 6 giving the reason for judgment and v. 7 formally announcing it.</p>
<A NAME="89"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=358><b>sn</b> The phrase &#8220;waters of Shiloah&#8221; probably refers to a stream that originated at the Gihon Spring and supplied the city of Jerusalem with water. See J. N. Oswalt, <i>Isaiah</i> (NICOT), 1:225. In this context these waters stand in contrast to the flood waters of Assyria and symbolize God&#8217;s presence and blessings. </p>
<A NAME="810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=359><b>tn</b> The precise meaning of v. 6 has been debated. The translation above assumes that &#8220;these people&#8221; are the residents of Judah and that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1474;</font> (<font face="Scholar">masos</font>) is alternate form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1505;&#1493;&#1465;&#1505;</font> (<font face="Scholar">masos</font>, &#8220;despair, melt&#8221;; see <i>HALOT</i> 606 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1505;&#1505;</font>). In this case vv. 7-8 in their entirety announce God&#8217;s disciplinary judgment on Judah. However, &#8220;these people&#8221; could refer to the Israelites and perhaps also the Syrians (cf v. 4). In this case <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1474;</font> probably means &#8220;joy.&#8221; One could translate, &#8220;and rejoice over Rezin and the son of Remaliah.&#8221; In this case v. 7a announces the judgment of Israel, with vv. 7b-8 then shifting the focus to the judgment of Judah. </p>
<A NAME="811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=360><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term translated &#8220;sovereign master&#8221; here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adonay</font>).</p>
<A NAME="812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=361><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the mighty and abundant waters of the river.&#8221; The referent of &#8220;the river&#8221; here, the Euphrates River, has been specified in the translation for clarity. As the immediately following words indicate, these waters symbolize the Assyrian king and his armies which will, as it were, inundate the land.</p>
<A NAME="813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=362><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;it will go up over all its stream beds and go over all its banks.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=363><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and the spreading out of his wings [will be over] the fullness of the breadth of your land.&#8221; The metaphor changes here from raging flood to predatory bird.</p>
<A NAME="815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=364><b>sn</b> The appearance of the name <i>Immanuel</i> (&#8220;God is with us&#8221;) is ironic at this point, for God is present with his people in judgment. Immanuel is addressed here as if he has already been born and will see the judgment occur. This makes excellent sense if his birth has just been recorded. There are several reasons for considering Immanuel and Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz one and the same. 8:3 is a birth account which could easily be understood as recording the fulfillment of the birth prophecy of 7:14. The presence of a formal record/witnesses (8:1-2) suggests a sign function for the child (cf. 7:14). As in 7:14-16, the removal of Judah&#8217;s enemies would take place before the child reached a specified age (cf. 8:4). Both 7:17-25 and 8:7-8 speak of an Assyrian invasion of Judah which would follow the defeat of Israel/Syria. The major objection to this view is the fact that different names appear, but such a phenomenon is not without parallel in the OT (cf. Gen 35:18). The name Immanuel may emphasize the basic fact of God&#8217;s presence, while the name Maher focuses on the specific nature of God&#8217;s involvement. In 7:14 the mother is viewed as naming the child, while in 8:3 Isaiah is instructed to give the child&#8217;s name, but one might again point to Gen 35:18 for a precedent. The sign child&#8217;s age appears to be different in 8:4 than in 7:15-16, but 7:15-16 pertains to the judgment on Judah, as well as the defeat of Israel/Syria (cf. vv. 17-25), while 8:4 deals only with the downfall of Israel/Syria. Some argue that the suffixed form &#8220;your land&#8221; in 8:8 points to a royal referent (a child of Ahaz or the Messiah), but usage elsewhere shows that the phrase does not need to be so restricted. While the suffix can refer to the king of a land (cf. Num 20:17; 21:22; Deut 2:27; Judg 11:17, 19; 2 Sam 24:13; 1 Kgs 11:22; Isa 14:20), it can also refer to one who is a native of a particular land (cf. Gen 12:1; 32:9; Jonah 1:8). (See also the use of &#8220;his land&#8221; in Isa 13:14 [where the suffix refers to a native of a land] and 37:7 [where it refers to a king].)</p>
<A NAME="816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=365><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1465;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ro</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">u</font>) is a Qal imperative, masculine plural from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">a</font>&#8217;, &#8220;break&#8221;). Elsewhere both transitive (Job 34:24; Ps 2:9; Jer 15:12) and intransitive (Prov 25:19; Jer 11:16) senses are attested for the Qal of this verb. Because no object appears here, the form is likely intransitive: &#8220;be broken.&#8221; In this case the imperative is rhetorical (like &#8220;be shattered&#8221; later in the verse) and equivalent to a prediction, &#8220;you will be broken.&#8221; On the rhetorical use of the imperative in general, see <i>IBHS</i> 572 §34.4c; GKC 324 §110.<i>c</i>.</p>
<A NAME="817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=366><b>tn</b> The imperatival form (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;be shattered&#8221;) is rhetorical and expresses the speaker&#8217;s firm conviction of the outcome of the nations&#8217; attack. See the note on &#8220;be broken.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=367><b>tn</b> The initial imperative (&#8220;get ready for battle&#8221;) acknowledges the reality of the nations&#8217; hostility; the concluding imperative (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;be shattered&#8221;) is rhetorical and expresses the speakers&#8217; firm conviction of the outcome of the nations&#8217; attack. (See the note on &#8220;be broken.&#8221;) One could paraphrase, &#8220;Okay, go ahead and prepare for battle since that&#8217;s what you want to do, but your actions will backfire and you&#8217;ll be shattered.&#8221; This rhetorical use of the imperatives is comparable to saying to a child who is bent on climbing a high tree, &#8220;Okay, go ahead, climb the tree and break your arm!&#8221; What this really means is: &#8220;Okay, go ahead and climb the tree since that&#8217;s what you really want to do, but your actions will backfire and you&#8217;ll break your arm.&#8221; The repetition of the statement in the final two lines of the verse gives the challenge the flavor of a taunt (ancient Israelite &#8220;trash talking,&#8221; as it were). </p>
<A NAME="819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=368><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;speak a word, but it will not stand.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=369><b>sn</b> In these vv. 9-10 the tone shifts abruptly from judgment to hope. Hostile nations like Assyria may attack God&#8217;s people, but eventually they will be destroyed, for God is with his people, sometimes to punish, but ultimately to vindicate. In addition to being a reminder of God&#8217;s presence in the immediate crisis faced by Ahaz and Judah, Immanuel (whose name is echoed in this concluding statement) was a guarantee of the nation&#8217;s future greatness in fulfillment of God&#8217;s covenantal promises. Eventually God would deliver his people from the hostile nations (vv. 9-10) through another child, an ideal Davidic ruler who would embody God&#8217;s presence in a special way (see 9:6-7). Jesus the Messiah is the fulfillment of the Davidic ideal prophesied by Isaiah, the one whom Immanuel foreshadowed. Through the miracle of the incarnation he is literally &#8220;God with us.&#8221; Matthew realized this and applied Isaiah&#8217;s ancient prophecy of Immanuel&#8217;s birth to Jesus (Matt 1:22-23). The first Immanuel was a reminder to the people of God&#8217;s presence and a guarantee of a greater child to come who would manifest God&#8217;s presence in an even greater way. The second Immanuel is &#8220;God with us&#8221; in a heightened and infinitely superior sense. He &#8220;fulfills&#8221; Isaiah&#8217;s Immanuel prophecy by bringing the typology intended by God to realization and by filling out or completing the pattern designed by God. Of course, in the ultimate fulfillment of the type, the incarnate Immanuel&#8217;s mother must be a virgin, so Matthew uses a Greek term (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">parqenos</font>), which carries that technical meaning (in contrast to the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">almah</font>], which has the more general meaning &#8220;young woman&#8221;). Matthew draws similar analogies between NT and OT events in 2:15, 18. The linking of these passages by analogy is termed &#8220;fulfillment.&#8221; In 2:15 God calls Jesus, his perfect Son, out of Egypt, just as he did his son Israel in the days of Moses, an historical event referred to in Hos 11:1. In so doing he makes it clear that Jesus is the ideal Israel prophesied by Isaiah (see Isa 49:3), sent to restore wayward Israel (see Isa 49:5, cf. Matt 1:21). In 2:18 Herod&#8217;s slaughter of the infants is another illustration of the oppressive treatment of God&#8217;s people by foreign tyrants. Herod&#8217;s actions are analogous to those of the Assyrians, who deported the Israelites, causing the personified land to lament as inconsolably as a mother robbed of her little ones (Jer 31:15).</p>
<A NAME="821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=370><b>tc</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;with strength of hand and he warned me from walking in the way of these people, saying.&#8221; Some want to change the pointing of the suffix and thereby emend the Qal imperfect <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1505;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yissÿreni</font>, &#8220;he was warning me&#8221;) to the more common Piel perfect <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1505;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yissÿrani</font>, &#8220;he warned me&#8221;). Others follow the lead of the Qumran scroll 1QIsa<sup>a</sup> and read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew" size="-2">&#1497;&#1456;&#1505;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1461;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar" size="-2">yÿsireni</font>, &#8220;he was turning me aside,&#8221; a Hiphil imperfect from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew" size="-2">&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar" size="-2">sur</font>). </p>
<A NAME="822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=371><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Do not say, &#8216;Conspiracy,&#8217; with respect to all which these people say, &#8216;Conspiracy.&#8217;&#8221; The verb translated &#8220;do not say&#8221; is second masculine plural, indicating that this exhortation is directed to Isaiah and other followers of the Lord (see v. 16).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The background of this command is uncertain. Perhaps the &#8220;conspiracy&#8221; in view is the alliance between Israel and Syria. Some of the people may even have thought that individuals in Judah were plotting with Israel and Syria to overthrow the king. </p>
<A NAME="823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=372><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the Lord who commands armies [traditionally, the Lord of hosts], him you must set apart.&#8221; The word order is emphatic, with the object being placed first.</p>
<A NAME="824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=373><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;he is your [object of] fear, he is your [object of] terror.&#8221; The roots <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1512;&#1461;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yare</font>&#8217;) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arats</font>) are repeated from v. 12b.</p>
<A NAME="825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=374><b>tn</b> Because the metaphor of protection (&#8220;sanctuary&#8221;) does not fit the negative mood that follows in vv. 14b-15, some contend that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">miqdash</font>, &#8220;sanctuary&#8221;) is probably a corruption of an original <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1511;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">moqesh</font>, &#8220;snare&#8221;), a word that appears in the next line (cf. NAB and H. Wildberger, <i>Isaiah</i>, 1:355-56). If the MT reading is retained (as in the above translation), the fact that Yahweh is a sanctuary wraps up the point of v. 13 and stands in contrast to God&#8217;s treatment of those who rebel against him (the rest of v. 14).</p>
<A NAME="826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=375><b>sn</b> The two &#8220;houses&#8221; of Israel (= the patriarch Jacob) are the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah.</p>

<A NAME="831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=380><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;seal [the] instruction among my followers.&#8221; The &#8220;instruction&#8221; probably refers to the prophet&#8217;s exhortations and warnings. When the people are judged for the sins, the prophet can produce these earlier messages and essentially say, &#8220;I told you so.&#8221; In this way he can authenticate his ministry and impress upon the people the reality of God&#8217;s authority over them. </p>

Isaiah&#8217;s name (which meant &#8220;the Lord delivers&#8221;) was a reminder that the Lord was the nation&#8217;s only source of protection; Shear-jashub&#8217;s name was meant, at least originally, to encourage Ahaz (see the note at 7:3), and Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz&#8217;s name was a guarantee that God would defeat Israel and Syria (see the note at 8:4). The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1508;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mofet</font>, &#8220;portent&#8221;) can often refer to some miraculous event, but in 20:3 it is used, along with its synonym <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ot</font>, &#8220;sign&#8221;) of Isaiah&#8217;s walking around half-naked as an object lesson of what would soon happen to the Egyptians. </p>
