<A NAME="181"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=780><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Woe [to] the land of buzzing wings.&#8221; On <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hoy</font>, &#8220;woe, ah&#8221;) see the note on the first phrase of 1:4.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The significance of the qualifying phrase &#8220;buzzing wings&#8221; is uncertain. Some suggest that the designation points to Cush as a land with many insects. Another possibility is that it refers to the swiftness with which this land&#8217;s messengers travel (v. 2a); they move over the sea as swiftly as an insect flies through the air. For a discussion of the options, see J. N. Oswalt, <i>Isaiah</i> (NICOT), 1:359-60. </p>
