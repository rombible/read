<a name="172"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=72><b>sn</b> The third person reference to the Lord in v. 28 indicates that the prophet is again (see vv. 21-24a) speaking. Since v. 27 is connected to v. 28 by a conjunction, it is likely that the prophet&#8217;s words begin with v. 27.</p>
