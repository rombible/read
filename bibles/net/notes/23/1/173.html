<a name="173"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=73><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Zion will be ransomed with justice.&#8221; Both cola in this verse end with similar terms: justice and righteousness (and both are preceded by a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font> [<font face="Scholar">bet</font>] preposition). At issue is whether these virtues describe the means or result of the deliverance and whether they delineate God&#8217;s justice/righteousness or that of the covenant people. If the righteousness of Israelite returnees is in view, the point seems to be that the reestablishment of Zion as a center of justice (God&#8217;s people living in conformity with God&#8217;s demand for equity and justice) will deliver the city from its past humiliation and restore it to a place of prominence (see 2:2-4; cf. E. Kissane, <i>Isaiah,</i> 1:19). Most scholars conclude that &#8220;righteousness and &#8220;justice&#8221; refers to God alone (J. Ridderbos, <i>Isaiah </i>[BSC], 50; J. Watts, <i>Isaiah </i>[WBC], 1:25; E. J. Young, <i>Isaiah</i> [NICOT], 1:89; cf. NLT, TEV) or serves as a double reference to both divine and human justice and righteousness (J. A. Motyer, <i>The Prophecy of Isaiah,</i> 51; J. N. Oswalt, <i>Isaiah</i> [NICOT], 1:10; H. Wildberger, <i>Isaiah</i>, 1:72). If it refers to both sides of the coin, these terms highlight the objective divine work of redemption and the subjective human response of penitence (Motyer, 51).</p>
