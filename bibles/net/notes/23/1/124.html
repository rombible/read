<a name="124"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=24><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and [there is] devastation like an overthrow by foreigners.&#8221; The comparative preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kÿ</font>, &#8220;like, as&#8221;) has here the rhetorical nuance, &#8220;in every way like.&#8221; The point is that the land has all the earmarks of a destructive foreign invasion because that is what has indeed happened. One could paraphrase, &#8220;it is desolate as it can only be when foreigners destroy.&#8221; On this use of the preposition in general, see GKC 376 §118.<i>x</i>. Many also prefer to emend &#8220;foreigners&#8221; here to &#8220;Sodom,&#8221; though there is no external attestation for such a reading in the <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> or ancient versions. Such an emendation finds support from the following context (vv. 9-10) and usage of the preceding noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1492;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1461;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mahpekhah</font>, &#8220;overthrow&#8221;). In its five other uses, this noun is associated with the destruction of Sodom. If one accepts the emendation, then one might translate, &#8220;the devastation resembles the destruction of Sodom.&#8221; </p>
