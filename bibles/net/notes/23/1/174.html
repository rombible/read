<a name="174"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=74><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text has, &#8220;her repentant ones/returnees with righteousness.&#8221; The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;&#1462;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shaveha</font>, &#8220;her repentant ones&#8221;), as pointed in MT, is a masculine plural Qal participle from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shuv</font>, &#8220;return&#8221;). Used substantivally, it refers to the &#8220;returning (i.e., repentant) ones.&#8221; It is possible that the parallel line (with its allusion to being freed by a ransom payment) suggests that the form be repointed to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shivyah</font>, &#8220;her captivity&#8221;), a reading that has support from the LXX. Some slightly emend the form to read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿshavah</font>, &#8220;and will return&#8221;). According to this view, the verb from the first line applies to the second line as well with the following translation as a result: &#8220;she will be released when fairness is restored.&#8221; Regardless, it makes best sense in the context to regard this as a reference to repentant Israelites returning to the land of promise. This understanding provides a better contrast with the rebels and sinners in 1:28.</p>
