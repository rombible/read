<a name="129"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=29><b>sn</b> Building on the simile of v. 9, the prophet sarcastically addresses the leaders and people of Jerusalem as if they were leaders and residents of ancient Sodom and Gomorrah. The sarcasm is appropriate, for if the judgment is comparable to Sodom&#8217;s, that must mean that the sin which prompted the judgment is comparable as well. </p>
