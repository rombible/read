The metaphorical language must be allowed some flexibility and should not be pressed into a rigid literalistic mold. The people&#8217;s sins will be removed and replaced by ethical purity. The sins that are now as obvious as the color red will be washed away and the ones who are sinful will be transformed. </p>
