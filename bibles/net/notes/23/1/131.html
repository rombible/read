<a name="131"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=31><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Why to me the multitude of your sacrifices?&#8221; The sarcastic rhetorical question suggests that their many sacrifices are of no importance to the Lord. This phrase answers the possible objection that an Israelite could raise in response to God&#8217;s indictment: &#8220;But we are offering the sacrifices you commanded!&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In this section the Lord refutes a potential objection that his sinful people might offer in their defense. He has charged them with rebellion (vv. 2-3), but they might respond that they have brought him many sacrifices. So he points out that he requires social justice first and foremost, not empty ritual.</p>
