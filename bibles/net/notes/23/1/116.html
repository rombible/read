[Why] do you continue rebellion?&#8221; The rhetorical questions express the prophet&#8217;s disbelief over Israel&#8217;s apparent masochism and obsession with sin. The interrogative construction in the first line does double duty in the parallelism. H. Wildberger (<i>Isaiah</i>, 1:18) offers another alternative by translating the two statements with one question: &#8220;Why do you still wish to be struck that you persist in revolt?&#8221; </p>
