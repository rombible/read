<a name="126"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=26><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;like a city besieged.&#8221; Unlike the preceding two comparisons, which are purely metaphorical, this third one identifies the reality of Israel&#8217;s condition. In this case the comparative preposition, as in v. 7b, has the force, &#8220;in every way like,&#8221; indicating that all the earmarks of a siege are visible because that is indeed what is taking place. The verb form in MT is Qal passive participle of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">natsar</font>, &#8220;guard&#8221;), but since this verb is not often used of a siege (see BDB 666 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1512;</font>), some prefer to repoint the form as a Niphal participle from II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsur</font>, &#8220;besiege&#8221;). However, the latter is not attested elsewhere in the Niphal (see BDB 848 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font>).</p>
