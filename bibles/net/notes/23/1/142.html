<a name="142"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=42><b>tn</b> The precise meaning of this line is uncertain. The translation assumes an emendation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khamots</font>, &#8220;oppressor [?]&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khamuts</font>, &#8220;oppressed&#8221;), a passive participle from II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khamats</font>, &#8220;oppress&#8221;; <i>HALOT</i> 329 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1502;&#1509;</font>) and takes the verb II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ashar</font>) in the sense of &#8220;make happy&#8221; (the delocutive Piel, meaning &#8220;call/pronounce happy,&#8221; is metonymic here, referring to actually effecting happiness). The parallelism favors this interpretation, for the next two lines speak of positive actions on behalf of the destitute. The other option is to retain the MT pointing and translate, &#8220;set right the oppressor,&#8221; but the nuance &#8220;set right&#8221; is not clearly attested elsewhere for the verb I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;</font>. This verb does appear as a participle in Isa 3:12 and 9:16 with the meaning &#8220;to lead or guide.&#8221; If it can mean to &#8220;lead&#8221; or &#8220;rebuke/redirect&#8221; in this verse, the prophet could be contrasting this appeal for societal reformation (v. 17c) with a command to reorder their personal lives (v. 17a-b). J. A. Motyer (<i>The Prophecy of Isaiah</i>, 47) suggests that these three statements (v. 17a-c) provide &#8220;the contrast between the two ends of imperfect society, the oppressor and the needy, the one inflicting and the other suffering the hurt. Isaiah looks for a transformed society wherever it needs transforming.&#8221;</p>
