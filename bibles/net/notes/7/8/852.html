<A NAME="852"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=509><b>sn</b> In Exod 28:4-6 and several other texts an <i>ephod</i> is described as a priestly or cultic garment. In some cases an ephod is used to obtain a divine oracle (1 Sam 23:9; 30:7). Here the ephod is made of gold and is described as being quite heavy (70-75 lbs?). Some identify it as an idol, but it was more likely a cultic object fashioned in the form of a garment which was used for oracular purposes. For discussion of the ephod in the OT, see C. F. Burney, <i>Judges</i>, 236-43, and R. de Vaux, <i>Ancient Israel</i>, 349-52.</p>
