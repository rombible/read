<A NAME="86"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=463><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;And Gideon arrived at the Jordan, crossing over, he and the three hundred men who were with him, exhausted and chasing.&#8221; The English past perfect (&#8220;had crossed&#8221;) is used because this verse flashes back chronologically to an event that preceded the hostile encounter described in vv. 1-3. (Note that 7:25 assumes Gideon had already crossed the Jordan.)</p>
