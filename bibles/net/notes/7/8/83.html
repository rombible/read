<A NAME="83"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=460><b>sn</b> <i>Ephraim&#8217;s leftover grapes are better quality than Abiezer&#8217;s harvest</i>.

He argues that Ephraim&#8217;s mopping up operations, though seemingly like the inferior grapes which are missed initially by the harvesters or left for the poor, are actually more noteworthy than the military efforts of Gideon&#8217;s family.</p>
