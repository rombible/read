<A NAME="998"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">98</span><note=619><b>tn</b> Apparently this rare word refers here to the most inaccessible area of the temple, perhaps the inner sanctuary or an underground chamber. It appears only here and in 1 Sam 13:6, where it is paired with &#8220;cisterns&#8221; and refers to subterranean or cave-like hiding places.</p>
