The practice is referred to outside the Bible as well. For example, one of the curses in the Aramaic Sefire treaty states concerning Arpad: &#8220;May Hadad sow in them salt and weeds, and may it not be mentioned again!&#8221; See J. A. Fitzmyer, <i>The Aramaic Inscriptions of Sefire</i> (BibOr), 15, 53. Deut 29:23, Jer 17:6, and Zeph 2:9 associate salt flats or salty regions with infertility and divine judgment.</p>
