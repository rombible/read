<A NAME="965"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=586><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿtarmah</font>) in the Hebrew text, which occurs only here, has traditionally been understood to mean &#8220;secretly&#8221; or &#8220;with deception.&#8221; If this is correct, it is derived from II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ramah</font>, &#8220;to deceive&#8221;). Some interpreters object, pointing out that this would imply Zebul was trying to deceive Abimelech, which is clearly not the case in this context. But this objection is unwarranted. If retained, the phrase would refer instead to deceptive measures used by Zebul to avoid the suspicion of Gaal when he dispatched the messengers from Shechem. The present translation assumes an emendation to &#8220;in Arumah&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">rumah</font>), a site mentioned in v. 41 as the headquarters of Abimelech. Confusion of <i>alef</i> and <i>tav</i> in archaic Hebrew script, while uncommon, is certainly not unimaginable.</p>
