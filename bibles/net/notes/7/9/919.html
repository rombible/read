<A NAME="919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=540><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;Going they went, the trees.&#8221; The precise emphatic force of the infinitive absolute (&#8220;Going&#8221;) is not entirely clear. Perhaps here it indicates determination, as in Gen 31:30, where one might translate, &#8220;You have insisted on going away.&#8221;</p>
