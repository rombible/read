<A NAME="9114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">114</span><note=635><b>sn</b> A hand mill consisted of an upper stone and larger lower stone. One would turn the upper stone with a handle to grind the grain, which was placed between the stones. An <i>upper millstone</i>, which was typically about two inches thick and a foot or so in diameter, probably weighed 25-30 pounds (11.4-13.6 kg). See G. F. Moore, <i>Judges</i> (ICC), 268; C. F. Burney, <i>Judges</i>, 288.</p>
