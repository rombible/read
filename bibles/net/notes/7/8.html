<A NAME="83"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=460><b>sn</b> <i>Ephraim&#8217;s leftover grapes are better quality than Abiezer&#8217;s harvest</i>. Gideon employs an agricultural metaphor. He argues that Ephraim&#8217;s mopping up operations, though seemingly like the inferior grapes which are missed initially by the harvesters or left for the poor, are actually more noteworthy than the military efforts of Gideon&#8217;s family.</p>
<A NAME="84"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=461><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;What was I able to do compared to you?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="85"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=462><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;Then their spirits relaxed from against him, when he spoke this word.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="86"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=463><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;And Gideon arrived at the Jordan, crossing over, he and the three hundred men who were with him, exhausted and chasing.&#8221; The English past perfect (&#8220;had crossed&#8221;) is used because this verse flashes back chronologically to an event that preceded the hostile encounter described in vv. 1-3. (Note that 7:25 assumes Gideon had already crossed the Jordan.)</p>
<A NAME="87"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=464><b>tn</b> Or perhaps, &#8220;sell.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="88"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=465><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;people.&#8221; The translation uses &#8220;men&#8221; because these were warriors and in ancient Israelite culture would have been exclusively males.</p>
<A NAME="89"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=466><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;who are at my feet.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=468><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;Are the palms of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give to your army bread?&#8221; Perhaps the reference to the kings&#8217; &#8220;palms&#8221; should be taken literally. The officials of Succoth may be alluding to the practice of mutilating prisoners or enemy corpses (see R. G. Boling, <i>Judges</i> [AB], 155).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The officials of Succoth are hesitant to <i>give</i> (or sell) food to Gideon&#8217;s forces because they are not sure of the outcome of the battle. Perhaps they had made an alliance with the Midianites which demanded their loyalty.</p>
<A NAME="812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=469><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;Therefore.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=470><b>sn</b> <i>I will thresh</i>.<i> </i>The metaphor is agricultural. Threshing was usually done on a hard threshing floor. As farm animals walked over the stalks, pulling behind them a board embedded with sharp stones, the stalks and grain would be separated. See O. Borowski, <i>Agriculture in Iron Age Israel</i>, 63-65. Gideon threatens to use thorns and briers on his sledge.</p>
<A NAME="814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=471><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;flesh.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=472><b>tn</b> This is apparently a rare instrumental use of the Hebrew preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et</font>, note the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;</font> [<font face="Scholar">bet</font>] in v. 16). Some, however, argue that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1514;</font> more naturally indicates accompaniment (&#8220;together with&#8221;). In this case Gideon envisions threshing their skin along with thorns and briers, just as the stalks and grain are intermingled on the threshing floor. See C. F. Burney, <i>Judges</i>, 229-30.</p>
<A NAME="816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=473><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;and spoke to them in the same way.&#8221;</p>

G. Boling, <i>Judges</i> [AB], 156), not suspecting an attack at that time and place.</p>
<A NAME="824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=481><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Gideon) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>

<A NAME="831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=488><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;elders.&#8221;</p>

In some cases an ephod is used to obtain a divine oracle (1 Sam 23:9; 30:7). Here the ephod is made of gold and is described as being quite heavy (70-75 lbs?). Some identify it as an idol, but it was more likely a cultic object fashioned in the form of a garment which was used for oracular purposes. For discussion of the ephod in the OT, see C. F. Burney, <i>Judges</i>, 236-43, and R. de Vaux, <i>Ancient Israel</i>, 349-52.</p>

<A NAME="859"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=516><b>sn</b> A <i>concubine</i> was a slave woman in ancient Near Eastern societies who was the legal property of her master, but who could have legitimate sexual relations with her master. A concubine&#8217;s status was more elevated than a mere servant, but she was not free and did not have the legal rights of a free wife. The children of a concubine could, in some instances, become equal heirs with the children of the free wife. After the period of the Judges concubines may have become more of a royal prerogative (2 Sam 21:10-14; 1 Kgs 11:3).</p>
