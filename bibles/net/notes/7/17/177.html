<A NAME="177"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=992><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;to the LORD from my hand for my son to make a carved image and cast metal image.&#8221; She cannot mean that she is now taking the money from her hand and giving it back to her son so he can make an image. Verses 4-6 indicate she took back the money and used a portion of it to hire a silversmith to make an idol for her son to use. The phrase &#8220;a carved image and cast metal image&#8221; is best taken as referring to two idols (see 18:17-18), even though the verb at the end of v. 4, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayÿhi</font>, &#8220;and it was [in the house of Micah]&#8221;), is singular.</p>
