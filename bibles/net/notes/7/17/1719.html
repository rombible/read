<A NAME="1719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1004><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;father.&#8221; &#8220;Father&#8221; is here a title of honor that suggests the priest will give advice and protect the interests of the family, primarily by divining God&#8217;s will in matters, perhaps through the use of the ephod. (See R. G. Boling, <i>Judges</i> [AB], 257; also Gen 45:8, where Joseph, who was a diviner and interpreter of dreams, is called Pharaoh&#8217;s &#8220;father,&#8221; and 2 Kgs 6:21; 13:14, where a prophet is referred to as a &#8220;father.&#8221; Note also 2 Kgs 8:9, where a king identifies himself as a prophet&#8217;s &#8220;son.&#8221; One of a prophet&#8217;s main functions was to communicate divine oracles. Cf. 2 Kgs 8:9ff.; 13:14-19).</p>
