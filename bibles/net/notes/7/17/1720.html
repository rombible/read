<A NAME="1720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1005><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text expands with the phrase: &#8220;and the Levite went.&#8221; This only makes sense if taken with &#8220;to live&#8221; in the next verse. Apparently &#8220;the Levite went&#8221; and &#8220;the Levite agreed&#8221; are alternative readings which have been juxtaposed in the text.</p>
