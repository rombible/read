<A NAME="174"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=989><b>tn</b> In the Hebrew text the statement, &#8220;but now I am giving it back to you,&#8221; appears at the end of v. 3 and is spoken by the mother. But v. 4 indicates that she did not give the money back to her son. Unless the statement is spoken by the woman to the LORD, it appears to be misplaced and fits much better in v. 2. It may have been accidentally omitted from a manuscript, written in the margin, and then later inserted in the wrong place in another manuscript. </p>
