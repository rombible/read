<A NAME="1339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=817><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;Who your name? For [when] your word comes [to pass], we will honor you.&#8221; Manoah apparently gets tongue-tied and uses the wrong pronoun (&#8220;who&#8221; instead of &#8220;what&#8221;). He starts to say, &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; But then he switches to &#8220;your name&#8221; as if he began the sentence with &#8220;what.&#8221; See R. G. Boling, <i>Judges</i> (AB), 222.</p>
