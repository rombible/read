<A NAME="1345"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=823><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;seen God.&#8221; Some take the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohim</font>) as the divine name (&#8220;God&#8221;) here, but this seems unlikely since v. 21 informs us that Manoah realized this was the <sc>Lord&#8217;s messenger, not God himself. Of course, he may be exaggerating for the sake of emphasis. Another option, the one followed in the translation, understands Manoah to be referring to a lesser deity. The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohim</font>) is sometimes used of an individual deity other than the <sc>Lord (see BDB 43 s.v. 2.a). One cannot assume that Manoah was a theologically sophisticated monotheist.</p>
