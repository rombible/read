<A NAME="137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=785><b>tn</b> Another option is to translate, &#8220;you are already pregnant and will have a son.&#8221; The earlier reference to her being infertile (v. 3) suggests that her conception is still future, but it is possible that the earlier statement only reflects her perspective (as far as she is concerned, she is infertile). According to this interpretation, in v. 5 the angel reveals the truth to her &#8211; actually she has recently conceived and is now pregnant (see the translation in R. G. Boling, <i>Judges</i> [AB], 217). Usage favors this interpretation. The predicate adjective <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">harah</font>, &#8220;[be/become] pregnant&#8221;) elsewhere has a past (1 Sam 4:19) or present (Gen 16:11; 38:25; 2 Sam 11:5) translation value. (The usage in Isa 7:14 is debated, but a present translation is definitely possible there.) A final, but less likely possibility, is that she miraculously conceived during the angel&#8217;s speech, sometime between his statements recorded in vv. 3 and 5.</p>
