<A NAME="719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=412><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text adds, &#8220;with their hands to their mouths,&#8221; This makes no sense in light of v. 5, which distinguishes between dog-like lappers (who would not use their hands to drink) and those who kneel (who would use their hands). It seems likely that the words &#8220;with their hands to their mouths&#8221; have been misplaced from v. 6. They fit better at the end of v. 5 or v. 6. Perhaps these words were originally a marginal scribal note which was later accidentally inserted into the text in the wrong place.</p>
