<A NAME="1016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=657><b>tn</b> The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1465;&#1504;&#1462;&#1492; &#1506;&#1462;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shemoneh </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">esreh shanah</font>) could be translated &#8220;eighteen years,&#8221; but this would be difficult after the reference to &#8220;that year.&#8221; It is possible that v. 8b is parenthetical, referring to an eighteen year long period of oppression east of the Jordan which culminated in hostilities against all Israel (including Judah, see v. 9) in the eighteenth year. It is simpler to translate the phrase as an ordinal number, though the context does not provide the point of reference. (See Gen 14:4-5 and R. G. Boling, <i>Judges</i> [AB], 191-92.) In this case, the following statement specifies which &#8220;Israelites&#8221; are in view.</p>
