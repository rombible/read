<A NAME="1945"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1122><b>tc</b> Some Hebrew <sc>mss and ancient witnesses read the singular, &#8220;your servant,&#8221; which would refer to the Levite. If one retains the plural, then both the Levite and his wife are in view. In either case the pronominal suffix emphasizes their dependence on the old man for shelter.</p>
