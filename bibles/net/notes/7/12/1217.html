<A NAME="1217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=764><b>sn</b> The inability of the Ephraimites to pronounce the word <i>shibboleth</i> the way the Gileadites did served as an identifying test. It illustrates that during this period there were differences in pronunciation between the tribes. The Hebrew word <i>shibboleth</i> itself means &#8220;stream&#8221; or &#8220;flood,&#8221; and was apparently chosen simply as a test case without regard to its meaning.</p>
