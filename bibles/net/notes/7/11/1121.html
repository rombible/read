<A NAME="1121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=694><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;spoke all his words.&#8221; This probably refers to the &#8220;words&#8221; recorded in v. 9. Jephthah repeats the terms of the agreement at the <sc>Lord&#8217;s sanctuary, perhaps to ratify the contract or to emphasize the Gileadites&#8217; obligation to keep their part of the bargain. Another option is to translate, &#8220;Jephthah conducted business before the <sc>Lord in Mizpah.&#8221; In this case, the statement is a general reference to the way Jephthah ruled. He recognized the <sc>Lord&#8217;s authority and made his decisions before the <sc>Lord.</p>
