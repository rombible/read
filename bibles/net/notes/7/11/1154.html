<A NAME="1154"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=727><b>tn</b> Some translate &#8220;or,&#8221; suggesting that Jephthah makes a distinction between humans and animals. According to this view, if a human comes through the door, then Jephthah will commit him/her to the <sc>Lord&#8217;s service, but if an animal comes through the doors, he will offer it up as a sacrifice. However, it is far more likely that the Hebrew construction (<i>vav</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>] + perfect) specifies how the subject will become the <sc>Lord&#8217;s, that is, by being offered up as a sacrifice. For similar constructions, where the apodosis of a conditional sentence has at least two perfects (each with <i>vav</i>) in sequence, see Gen 34:15-16; Exod 18:16.</p>
