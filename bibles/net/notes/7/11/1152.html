<A NAME="1152"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=725><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;the one coming out, who comes out from.&#8221; The text uses a masculine singular participle with prefixed article, followed by a relative pronoun and third masculine singular verb. The substantival masculine singular participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1510;&#1461;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hayyotse</font>&#8217;, &#8220;the one coming out&#8221;) is used elsewhere of inanimate objects (such as a desert [Num 21:13] or a word [Num 32:24]) or persons (Jer 5:6; 21:9; 38:2). In each case context must determine the referent. Jephthah may have envisioned an animal meeting him, since the construction of Iron Age houses would allow for an animal coming through the doors of a house (see R. G. Boling, <i>Judges</i> [AB], 208). But the fact that he actually does offer up his daughter indicates the language of the vow is fluid enough to encompass human beings, including women. He probably intended such an offering from the very beginning, but he obviously did not expect his daughter to meet him first.</p>
