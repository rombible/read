<A NAME="1651"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=972><b>tn</b> Most interpret this as a reference to Samson, but this seems premature, since v. 25 suggests he was not yet standing before them. Consequently some prefer to see this statement as displaced and move it to v. 25 (see C. F. Burney, <i>Judges</i>, 387). It seems more likely that the pronoun refers to an image of Dagon.</p>
