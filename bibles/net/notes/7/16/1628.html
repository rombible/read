<A NAME="1628"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=949><b>tc</b> The MT of vv. 13b-14a reads simply, &#8220;He said to her, &#8216;If you weave the seven braids of my head with the web.&#8217; And she fastened with the pin and said to him.&#8221; The additional words in the translation, &#8220;and secure it with the pin, I will become weak and be like any other man.&#8217; <b>16:14</b> So she made him go to sleep, wove the seven braids of his hair into the fabric on the loom,&#8221; which without doubt represent the original text, are supplied from the ancient Greek version. (In both vv. 13b and 14a the Greek version has &#8220;to the wall&#8221; after &#8220;with the pin,&#8221; but this is an interpretive addition that reflects a misunderstanding of ancient weaving equipment. See G. F. Moore, <i>Judges</i> [ICC], 353-54.) The Hebrew textual tradition was accidentally shortened during the copying process. A scribe&#8217;s eye jumped from the first instance of &#8220;with the web&#8221; to the second, causing him to leave out inadvertently the intervening words.</p>
