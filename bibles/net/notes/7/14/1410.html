<A NAME="1410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=838><b>tc</b> The MT reads, &#8220;Samson went down with his father and mother to Timnah. When they approached&#8230;&#8221; Verse 6b states that Samson did not tell his parents about his encounter with the lion (vv. 5b-6a), but v. 5a gives the impression they would have seen the entire episode. One could assume that Samson separated from his parents prior to the lion&#8217;s attack, but the Hebrew text does not indicate this. It seems more likely that the words &#8220;with his father and his mother&#8221; were accidentally copied into the text, perhaps under the influence of v. 4a, where the same phrase appears. An original singular verb (&#8220;he approached&#8221;) may have been changed to the plural form (&#8220;they approached&#8221;) after the words &#8220;his father and his mother&#8221; were accidentally added to the text.</p>
