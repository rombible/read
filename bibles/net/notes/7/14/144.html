<A NAME="144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=832><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;my.&#8221; The singular may seem strange, since the introduction to the quotation attributes the words to his father and mother. But Samson&#8217;s father apparently speaks for both himself and his wife. However, the Lucianic recension of the LXX and the Syriac Peshitta have a second person pronoun here (&#8220;you&#8221;), and this may represent the original reading.</p>
