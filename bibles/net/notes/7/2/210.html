<A NAME="210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=64><b>tn</b> The meaning of the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsiddim</font>) is uncertain in this context. It may be related to an Akkadian cognate meaning &#8220;snare.&#8221; If so, a more literal translation would be &#8220;they will become snares to you.&#8221; Normally the term in question means &#8220;sides,&#8221; but this makes no sense here. On the basis of Num 33:55 some suggest the word for &#8220;thorns&#8221; has been accidentally omitted. If this word is added, the text would read, &#8220;they will become [thorns] in your sides&#8221; (cf. NASB, NIV, NLT).</p>
