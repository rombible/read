<A NAME="257"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=111><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;Joshua left those nations&#8221; are interpretive. The Hebrew text of v. 22 simply begins with &#8220;to test.&#8221; Some subordinate this phrase to &#8220;I will no longer remove&#8221; (v. 21). In this case the <sc>Lord announces that he has <i>now</i> decided to leave these nations as a test for Israel. Another possibility is to subordinate &#8220;to test&#8221; to &#8220;He said&#8221; (v. 20; see B. Lindars, <i>Judges 1-5</i>, 111). In this case the statement recorded in vv. 20b-21 is the test in that it forces Israel to respond either positively (through repentance) or negatively to the <sc>Lord&#8217;s declaration. A third possibility (the one reflected in the present translation) is to subordinate &#8220;to test&#8221; to &#8220;left unconquered&#8221; (v. 21). In this case the <sc>Lord recalls that <i>Joshua</i> left these nations as a test. Israel has failed the test (v. 20), so the <sc>Lord announces that the punishment threatened earlier (Josh 23:12-13; see also Judg 2:3) will now be implemented. As B. G. Webb (<i>Judges</i> [JSOTSup], 115) observes, &#8220;The nations which were originally left as a test are now left as a punishment.&#8221; This view best harmonizes v. 23, which explains that the <sc>Lord did not give all the nations to Joshua, with v. 22. (For a grammatical parallel, where the infinitive construct of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1505;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">nasah</font>] is subordinated to the perfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1489;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">azav</font>], see 2 Chr 32:31.)</p>
