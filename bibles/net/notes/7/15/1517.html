<A NAME="1517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=893><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text expands the statement with the additional phrase &#8220;burned with fire.&#8221; The words &#8220;with fire&#8221; are redundant in English and have been omitted from the translation for stylistic reasons. Some textual witnesses read &#8220;burned&#8230;her father&#8217;s house,&#8221; perhaps under the influence of 14:15. On the other hand, the shorter text may have lost this phrase due to haplography.</p>
