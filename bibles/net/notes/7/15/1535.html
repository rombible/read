<A NAME="1535"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=911><b>tn</b> The precise meaning of the second half of the line (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1458;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512; &#1495;&#1458;&#1502;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khamor khamoratayim</font>) is uncertain. The present translation assumes that the phrase means, &#8220;a heap, two heaps&#8221; and refers to the heaps of corpses littering the battlefield. Other options include: (a) &#8220;I have made donkeys of them&#8221; (cf. NIV; see C. F. Burney, <i>Judges</i>, 373, for a discussion of this view, which understands a denominative verb from the noun &#8220;donkey&#8221;); (b) &#8220;I have thoroughly skinned them&#8221; (see <i>HALOT</i> 330 s.v. IV cj. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1502;&#1512;</font>, which appeals to an Arabic cognate for support); (c) &#8220;I have stormed mightily against them,&#8221; which assumes the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khamar</font>, &#8220;to ferment; to foam; to boil up&#8221;).</p>
