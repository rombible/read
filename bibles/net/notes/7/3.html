<A NAME="31"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=120><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;did not know the wars of Canaan.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="32"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=121><b>tn</b> The Hebrew syntax of v. 2 is difficult. The Hebrew text reads literally, &#8220;only in order that the generations of the Israelites might know, to teach them war &#8211; only those who formerly did not know them.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The stated purpose for leaving the nations (<i>to teach the subsequent generations&#8230;how to conduct holy war</i>) seems to contradict 2:22 and 3:4, which indicate the nations were left to test Israel&#8217;s loyalty to the <sc>Lord. However, the two stated purposes can be harmonized. The willingness of later generations to learn and engage in holy war would measure their allegiance to the <sc>Lord (see B. G. Webb, <i>Judges</i> [JSOTSup], 114-15).</p>
<A NAME="33"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=122><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;These were the nations,&#8221; though not present in the Hebrew text, are supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>

<A NAME="38"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=127><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;in the eyes of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="39"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=128><b>sn</b> The <i>Asherahs</i> were local manifestations of the Canaanite goddess Asherah.</p>
<A NAME="310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=129><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;The <sc>Lord&#8217;s anger burned (or raged) against Israel.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=134><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;delivered.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=135><b>tn</b> &#8220;Caleb&#8217;s younger brother&#8221; may refer to Othniel or to Kenaz (in which case Othniel is Caleb&#8217;s nephew).</p>
<A NAME="317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=136><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;was on him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=137><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;his hand was strong against Cushan-Rishathaim.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=138><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;in the eyes of the <sc>Lord&#8221; (also later in this verse).</p>
<A NAME="320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=139><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;strengthened Eglon&#8230;against Israel.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=140><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he gathered to him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=141><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the Israelites served Eglon.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=142><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the <sc>Lord.&#8221; This has been replaced by the pronoun (&#8220;he&#8221;) in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=143><b>tn</b> The phrase, which refers to Ehud, literally reads &#8220;bound/restricted in the right hand,&#8221; apparently a Hebrew idiom for a left-handed person. See Judg 20:16, where 700 Benjaminites are described in this way. Perhaps the Benjaminites purposely trained several of their young men to be left-handed warriors by restricting the use of the right hand from an early age so the left hand would become dominant. Left-handed men would have a distinct military advantage, especially when attacking city gates. See B. Halpern, &#8220;The Assassination of Eglon: The First Locked-Room Murder Mystery,&#8221; <i>BRev</i> 4 (1988): 35.</p>
<A NAME="325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=144><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The Israelites sent by his hand an offering to Eglon, king of Moab.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=145><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1465;&#1502;&#1462;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gomed</font>) denotes a unit of linear measure, perhaps a cubit (the distance between the elbow and the tip of the middle finger &#8211; approximately 18 inches [45 cm]). Some suggest it is equivalent to the short cubit (the distance between the elbow and the knuckles of the clenched fist &#8211; approximately 13 inches [33 cm]) or to the span (the distance between the end of the thumb and the end of the little finger in a spread hand &#8211; approximately 9 inches [23 cm]). See BDB 167 s.v.; <i>HALOT</i> 196 s.v.; B. Lindars, <i>Judges 1-5</i>, 142.</p>
<A NAME="327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=146><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the tribute payment.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=147><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;returned&#8221; (i.e., to Eglon&#8217;s palace).</p>
<A NAME="329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=148><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;when he reached&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarification. The Hebrew text simply reads &#8220;from.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=149><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;idols.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=150><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;to Eglon&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarification.</p>
<A NAME="332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=151><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Eglon) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=152><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Hush!&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=153><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;cool.&#8221; This probably refers to a room with latticed windows which allowed the breeze to pass through. See B. Lindars, <i>Judges 1-5</i>, 144.</p>
<A NAME="335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=154><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;word of [i.e., from] God.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=155><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;throne.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=156><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;his&#8221;; the referent (Eglon) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="338"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=157><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Ehud) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=158><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has &#8220;and he went out to the [?].&#8221; The meaning of the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">parshÿdonah</font>) which occurs only here in the OT, is uncertain. The noun has the article prefixed and directive suffix. The word may be a technical architectural term, indicating the area into which Ehud moved as he left the king and began his escape. In this case Ehud is the subject of the verb &#8220;went out.&#8221; The present translation omits the clause, understanding it as an ancient variant of the first clause in v. 23. Some take the noun as &#8220;back,&#8221; understand &#8220;sword&#8221; (from the preceding clause) as the subject, and translate &#8220;the sword came out his [i.e., Eglon&#8217;s] back.&#8221; But this rendering is unlikely since the Hebrew word for &#8220;sword&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kherev</font>) is feminine and the verb form translated &#8220;came out&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1510;&#1461;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">vayyetse</font>&#8217;) is masculine. (One expects agreement in gender when the subject is supplied from the preceding clause. See Ezek 33:4, 6.) See B. Lindars, <i>Judges 1-5</i>, 146-48, for discussion of the options.</p>
<A NAME="340"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=159><b>tn</b> Again the precise meaning of the Hebrew word, used only here in the OT, is uncertain. Since it is preceded by the verb &#8220;went out&#8221; and the next clause refers to Ehud closing doors, the noun is probably an architectural term referring to the room (perhaps a vestibule; see <i>HALOT</i> 604 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1505;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font>) immediately outside the king&#8217;s upper chamber. As v. 24 indicates, this vestibule separated the upper room from an outer room where the king's servants were waiting.</p>
<A NAME="341"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=160><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;his.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="342"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=161><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;covering his feet&#8221; (i.e., with his outer garments while he relieves himself).</p>
<A NAME="343"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=162><b>tn</b> The Hebrew expression translated &#8220;well-ventilated inner room&#8221; may refer to the upper room itself or to a bathroom attached to or within it.</p>
<A NAME="344"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=163><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;the doors&#8221; are supplied.</p>
<A NAME="345"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=164><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;See, their master, fallen to the ground, dead.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="346"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=165><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;When he arrived.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="347"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=166><b>tn</b> That is, &#8220;mustered an army.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="348"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=167><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;now he was before them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="349"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=168><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for the Lord has given your enemies, Moab, into your hand.&#8221; The verb form (a Hebrew perfect, indicating completed action from the standpoint of the speaker) emphasizes the certainty of the event. Though it had not yet taken place, the <sc>Lord speaks of it as a &#8220;done deal.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="350"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=169><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;River&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but is supplied for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="351"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=170><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;against Moab,&#8221; that is, so as to prevent the Moabites from crossing.</p>
<A NAME="352"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=171><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;They struck Moab that day &#8211; about ten thousand men.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="353"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=172><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;him&#8221;; the referent (Ehud) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
