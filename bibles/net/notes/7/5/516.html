<A NAME="516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=234><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;warriors.&#8221; The Hebrew text reads literally, &#8220;He chose God/gods new.&#8221; Some take &#8220;Israel&#8221; as the subject of the verb, &#8220;gods&#8221; as object, and &#8220;new&#8221; as an adjective modifying &#8220;gods.&#8221; This yields the translation, &#8220;(Israel) chose new gods.&#8221; In this case idolatry is the cause of the trouble alluded to in the context. The present translation takes &#8220;God&#8221; as subject of the verb and &#8220;new&#8221; as substantival, referring to the new leaders raised up by God (see v. 9a). For a survey of opinions and a defense of the present translation, see B. Lindars, <i>Judges 1-5</i>, 239-40.</p>
