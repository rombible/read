When he resists they must offer him a more attractive reward &#8211; rulership over the region. See R. G. Boling, <i>Judges</i> (AB), 198.</p>

Jephthah is repeating the terms of the agreement in an official manner. In v. 10 the leaders legally agree to these terms.</p>

<A NAME="1121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=694><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;spoke all his words.&#8221; This probably refers to the &#8220;words&#8221; recorded in v. 9. Jephthah repeats the terms of the agreement at the <sc>Lord&#8217;s sanctuary, perhaps to ratify the contract or to emphasize the Gileadites&#8217; obligation to keep their part of the bargain. Another option is to translate, &#8220;Jephthah conducted business before the <sc>Lord in Mizpah.&#8221; In this case, the statement is a general reference to the way Jephthah ruled.

<A NAME="1143"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=716><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;Is it not so that what Chemosh your god causes you to possess, you possess, and all whom the <sc>Lord our God dispossesses before us we will possess?&#8221; Jephthah speaks of Chemosh as if he is on a par with the <sc>Lord God of Israel. This does not necessarily mean that Jephthah is polytheistic or that he recognizes the <sc>Lord as only a local deity. He may simply be assuming the Ammonite king&#8217;s perspective for the sake of argument. Other texts, as well as the extrabiblical Mesha inscription, associate Chemosh with Moab, while Milcom is identified as the god of the Ammonites. Why then does Jephthah refer to Chemosh as the Ammonite god? Ammon had likely conquered Moab and the Ammonite king probably regarded himself as heir of all territory formerly held by Moab. Originally Moab had owned the disputed territory (cf. Num 21:26-29), meaning that Chemosh was regarded as the god of the region (see R. G. Boling, <i>Judges</i> [AB], 203-4). Jephthah argues that Chemosh had long ago relinquished claim to the area (by allowing Sihon to conquer it), while the <sc>Lord had long ago established jurisdiction over it (by taking it from Sihon and giving it to Israel). Both sides should abide by the decisions of the gods which had stood firm for three hundred years.</p>
<A NAME="1144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=717><b>tn</b> The Hebrew grammatical constructions of all three rhetorical questions indicate emphasis, which &#8220;really&#8221; and &#8220;dare to&#8221; are intended to express in the translation. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Jephthah argues that the Ammonite king should follow the example of <i>Balak</i>, who, once thwarted in his attempt to bring a curse on Israel, refused to attack Israel and returned home (Num 22-24).</p>

<A NAME="1152"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=725><b>tn<i> </i></b><i>Heb</i> &#8220;the one coming out, who comes out from.&#8221; The text uses a masculine singular participle with prefixed article, followed by a relative pronoun and third masculine singular verb. The substantival masculine singular participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1510;&#1461;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hayyotse</font>&#8217;, &#8220;the one coming out&#8221;) is used elsewhere of inanimate objects (such as a desert [Num 21:13] or a word [Num 32:24]) or persons (Jer 5:6; 21:9; 38:2). In each case context must determine the referent. Jephthah may have envisioned an animal meeting him, since the construction of Iron Age houses would allow for an animal coming through the doors of a house (see R. G. Boling, <i>Judges</i> [AB], 208). But the fact that he actually does offer up his daughter indicates the language of the vow is fluid enough to encompass human beings, including women. He probably intended such an offering from the very beginning, but he obviously did not expect his daughter to meet him first.</p>
<A NAME="1153"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=726><b>tn</b> The language is fluid enough to include women and perhaps even animals, but the translation uses the masculine pronoun because the Hebrew form is grammatically masculine. </p>
<A NAME="1154"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=727><b>tn</b> Some translate &#8220;or,&#8221; suggesting that Jephthah makes a distinction between humans and animals. According to this view, if a human comes through the door, then Jephthah will commit him/her to the <sc>Lord&#8217;s service, but if an animal comes through the doors, he will offer it up as a sacrifice. However, it is far more likely that the Hebrew construction (<i>vav</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>] + perfect) specifies how the subject will become the <sc>Lord&#8217;s, that is, by being offered up as a sacrifice. For similar constructions, where the apodosis of a conditional sentence has at least two perfects (each with <i>vav</i>) in sequence, see Gen 34:15-16; Exod 18:16.</p>
