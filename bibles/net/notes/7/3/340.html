<A NAME="340"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=159><b>tn</b> Again the precise meaning of the Hebrew word, used only here in the OT, is uncertain. Since it is preceded by the verb &#8220;went out&#8221; and the next clause refers to Ehud closing doors, the noun is probably an architectural term referring to the room (perhaps a vestibule; see <i>HALOT</i> 604 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1505;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font>) immediately outside the king&#8217;s upper chamber. As v. 24 indicates, this vestibule separated the upper room from an outer room where the king's servants were waiting.</p>
