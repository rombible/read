<A NAME="324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=143><b>tn</b> The phrase, which refers to Ehud, literally reads &#8220;bound/restricted in the right hand,&#8221; apparently a Hebrew idiom for a left-handed person. See Judg 20:16, where 700 Benjaminites are described in this way. Perhaps the Benjaminites purposely trained several of their young men to be left-handed warriors by restricting the use of the right hand from an early age so the left hand would become dominant. Left-handed men would have a distinct military advantage, especially when attacking city gates. See B. Halpern, &#8220;The Assassination of Eglon: The First Locked-Room Murder Mystery,&#8221; <i>BRev</i> 4 (1988): 35.</p>
