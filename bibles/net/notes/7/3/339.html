<A NAME="339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=158><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has &#8220;and he went out to the [?].&#8221; The meaning of the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">parshÿdonah</font>) which occurs only here in the OT, is uncertain. The noun has the article prefixed and directive suffix. The word may be a technical architectural term, indicating the area into which Ehud moved as he left the king and began his escape. In this case Ehud is the subject of the verb &#8220;went out.&#8221; The present translation omits the clause, understanding it as an ancient variant of the first clause in v. 23. Some take the noun as &#8220;back,&#8221; understand &#8220;sword&#8221; (from the preceding clause) as the subject, and translate &#8220;the sword came out his [i.e., Eglon&#8217;s] back.&#8221; But this rendering is unlikely since the Hebrew word for &#8220;sword&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kherev</font>) is feminine and the verb form translated &#8220;came out&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1510;&#1461;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">vayyetse</font>&#8217;) is masculine. (One expects agreement in gender when the subject is supplied from the preceding clause. See Ezek 33:4, 6.) See B. Lindars, <i>Judges 1-5</i>, 146-48, for discussion of the options.</p>
