<A NAME="32"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=121><b>tn</b> The Hebrew syntax of v. 2 is difficult. The Hebrew text reads literally, &#8220;only in order that the generations of the Israelites might know, to teach them war &#8211; only those who formerly did not know them.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The stated purpose for leaving the nations (<i>to teach the subsequent generations&#8230;how to conduct holy war</i>) seems to contradict 2:22 and 3:4, which indicate the nations were left to test Israel&#8217;s loyalty to the <sc>Lord. However, the two stated purposes can be harmonized. The willingness of later generations to learn and engage in holy war would measure their allegiance to the <sc>Lord (see B. G. Webb, <i>Judges</i> [JSOTSup], 114-15).</p>
