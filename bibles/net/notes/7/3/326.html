<A NAME="326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=145><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1465;&#1502;&#1462;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gomed</font>) denotes a unit of linear measure, perhaps a cubit (the distance between the elbow and the tip of the middle finger &#8211; approximately 18 inches [45 cm]). Some suggest it is equivalent to the short cubit (the distance between the elbow and the knuckles of the clenched fist &#8211; approximately 13 inches [33 cm]) or to the span (the distance between the end of the thumb and the end of the little finger in a spread hand &#8211; approximately 9 inches [23 cm]). See BDB 167 s.v.; <i>HALOT</i> 196 s.v.; B. Lindars, <i>Judges 1-5</i>, 142.</p>
