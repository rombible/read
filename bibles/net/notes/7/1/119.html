<a name="119"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=19><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;him.&#8221; The pronoun could refer to Othniel, in which case one would translate, &#8220;she incited him [Othniel] to ask her father for a field.&#8221; This is problematic, however, for Acsah, not Othniel, makes the request in v. 15. The LXX has &#8220;he [Othniel] urged her to ask her father for a field.&#8221; This appears to be an attempt to reconcile the apparent inconsistency and probably does not reflect the original text. If Caleb is understood as the referent of the pronoun, the problem disappears. For a fuller discussion of the issue, see P. G. Mosca, &#8220;Who Seduced Whom? A Note on Joshua 15:18 // Judges 1:14,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 46 (1984): 18-22. The translation takes Caleb to be the referent, specified as &#8220;her father.&#8221;</p>
