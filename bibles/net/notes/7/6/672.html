<A NAME="672"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=374><b>sn</b> <i>Whoever takes up his cause will die by morning</i>. This may be a warning to the crowd that Joash intends to defend his son and to kill anyone who tries to execute Gideon. Then again, it may be a sarcastic statement about Baal&#8217;s apparent inability to defend his own honor. Anyone who takes up Baal&#8217;s cause may end up dead, perhaps by the same hand that pulled down the pagan god&#8217;s altar.</p>
