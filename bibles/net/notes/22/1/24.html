<a name="24"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=24><b>sn</b> Normally in the Song, the person/gender of the pronouns and suffixes makes the identify of the speaker or addressee clear. However, there are several places in which there is grammatical ambiguity that makes it difficult to identify either the speaker or the addressee (e.g., 6:11-13; 7:9b). This is particularly true when 1st person common plural or 3rd person common plural verbs or suffixes are present (1:3[4]; 2:15; 5:1b; 8:8-9), as is the case in the three lines of 1:3b[4b]. There are four views to the identity of the speaker(s): (1) NASB attributes all three lines to the maidens, (2) NIV attributes the first two lines to the friends and the third line to the Beloved (= woman), (3) NJPS attributes all three lines to the Beloved, speaking throughout 1:2-4, and (4) The first line could be attributed to the young man speaking to his beloved, and the last two lines attributed to the Beloved who returns praise to him. The referents of the 1st person common plural cohortatives and the 2sg suffixes have been taken as: (1) the maidens of Jerusalem, mentioned in 1:4[5] and possibly referred to as the 3rd person common plural subject of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1492;&#1461;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ahevukha</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;they love you&#8221;) in 1:3b[4b], using the 1st person common plural cohortatives in reference to themselves as they address her lover: &#8220;We (= maidens) will rejoice in you (= the young man).&#8221; (2) The Beloved using 1st person common plural cohortatives in a hortatory sense as she addresses her lover: &#8220;Let us (= the couple) rejoice in you (= the young man), let us praise your lovemaking&#8230;&#8221; (3) The Beloved using the 1st person common plural cohortatives in reference to herself &#8211; there are examples in ancient Near Eastern love literature of the bride using 1st person common plural forms in reference to herself (S. N. Kramer, <i>The Sacred Marriage Rite</i>, 92, 99) &#8211; as she addresses the young man: &#8220;We (= I) will rejoice in you (= the young man).&#8221; Note: This problem is compounded by the ambiguity of the gender on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bakh</font>, &#8220;in you&#8221;) which appears to be 2nd person feminine singular but may be 2nd person masculine singular in pause (see note below).</p>
