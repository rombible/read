<a name="57"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=57><b>tn</b> Alternately, &#8220;resting between my breasts.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lin</font>)<font face="Scholar"> </font>has a three-fold range of meaning in the Qal stem: (1) &#8220;to leave overnight,&#8221; e.g., meat or corpse on a tree, (2) &#8220;to spend the night, stay overnight,&#8221; and (3) &#8220;to stay, dwell&#8221; (<i>HALOT </i>529 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1497;&#1503;</font>). The myrrh motif (see study note above) suggests the nuance &#8220;to spend the night&#8221; (<i>HALOT </i>529 s.v. 2). This is also the most appropriate nuance of its usage in Song 7:12 (e.g., Gen 19:2; 24:23, 25, 54; 28:11; 31:54; 32:14, 22; Num 22:8; Josh 3:1; 4:3; 6:11; 8:9; Judg 18:2; 19:4-15 (9x), 20; 20:4; 2 Sam 12:16; 17:8, 16; 19:8; 1 Kgs 19:9; Isa 21:13; 65:4; Jer 14:8; Joel 1:13; Zeph 2:14; Pss 25:13; 55:8; Job 24:7; 31:32; 39:9; Prov 19:23; Song 7:12; Ruth 1:16; 3:13; Neh 4:16; 13:20; 1 Chr 9:27). Several translations follow course: &#8220;he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts&#8221; (KJV) and &#8220;which lies all night between my breasts&#8221; (NASB). Others downplay the obvious sexual connotations: &#8220;resting between my breasts&#8221; (NIV) and &#8220;lodged between my breasts&#8221; (NJPS). The imperfect has been taken in two basic senses: (1) future time action: &#8220;he shall spend the night between my breasts&#8221; and (2) present characteristic or present progressive: &#8220;he spends the night between my breasts.&#8221; The latter is favored by the characteristic/progressive nature of the metaphors used through 1:12-13[13-14].</p>
