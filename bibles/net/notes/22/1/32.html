<a name="32"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=32><b>sn</b> The comparison of her dark, outdoors appearance to the &#8220;tents of Qedar&#8221; is quite fitting for two reasons. First, the name &#8220;Qedar&#8221; refers to an ancient Arabian tribe of bedouin who lived in tents and inhabited a region in northern Arabia. Their tents were traditionally woven from the wool of black goats. They were not beautiful to look at; they were rough, rustic, rugged, and weather-beaten. Second, the terms <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿkhorah</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;black&#8221;) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1461;&#1491;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qedar</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;Qedar&#8221;) create a wordplay because the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qadar</font>)<font face="Scholar"> </font>means &#8220;dark, dirty&#8221; (<i>HALOT </i>1072 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1491;&#1512;</font>). The point of the comparison is that the Beloved had dark skin and a rugged outdoors appearance because she had been forced to work outdoors, and so her skin had become dark as 1:6 states.</p>
