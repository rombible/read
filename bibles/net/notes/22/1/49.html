Scholars have struggled with the meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1489;&#1461;&#1497; &#1508;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿrikhbe par</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">oh</font>, &#8220;[harnessed to (?)] Pharaoh&#8217;s chariot&#8221;; <i>HALOT </i>1234 s.v. 6.b). M. H. Pope (<i>Song of Songs </i>[AB], 338) suggests that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1489;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rikhbe</font>)<font face="Scholar"> </font>be nuanced &#8220;chariot-horses&#8221; and the phrase rendered &#8220;among the chariot-horses of Pharaoh.&#8221; Pope offers the best explanation of this enigmatic picture: &#8220;A crucial consideration overlooked by commentators is the well-attested fact that Pharaoh&#8217;s chariots, like other chariotry in antiquity, were not drawn by a mare or mares but by stallions hitched in pairs. This bit of intelligence radically alters the usual understanding of the verse and dispels the notion that there is a grammatical incongruity, which needs harmonizing. The juxtaposition is between a single mare and a plurality of stallions and it requires only a modicum of what is called &#8216;horse sense&#8217; to appreciate the thrust of the comparison. The situation envisaged is illustrated by the famous incident in one of the campaigns of Thutmose III against Qadesh. On his tomb at Thebes, the Egyptian soldier Amenemheb relates how the Prince of Qadesh sent forth a swift mare, which entered among the army. But Amenemheb ran after her on foot and with his dagger ripped open her belly, cut off her tail, and presented it to the king, thus preventing a debacle before the excited stallions could take out after the mare.&#8221;</p>
