<a name="34"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=34><b>sn</b> There is debate whether the terms &#8220;tents&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;&#1459;&#1500;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ahale</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;tents&#8221;) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿri</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ot</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;tent-curtains&#8221;) used here as synonyms or antonyms. The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1465;&#1492;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ohel</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;tent&#8221;) is often used in reference to an overall tent assembly, with particular emphasis on the external structure (e.g., Gen 4:20; 18:1; 31:33; Exod 26:13; 40:19; Judg 4:17; Isa 54:2; Jer 37:10) (<i>HALOT </i>19 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1465;&#1492;&#1462;&#1500;</font>). The term &#8220;tent-curtains&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1492;</font>) is used to refer to (1) inner hanging curtains, such as decorative hangings or tapestries inside a tent (e.g., Exod 26:1-2, 7; Num 4:25) and (2) a tent as a whole (e.g., 2 Sam 7:2; Jer 4:20; 10:20; Hab 3:7) (<i>HALOT </i>439 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font>). The two terms are often used in parallelism as an A-B word pair (Isa 54:2; Jer 4:20; 10:20; 49:29; Hab 3:7). Like the &#8220;tents&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1465;&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>) of Qedar which were made from the wool of black goats, &#8220;tent-curtains&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1492;</font>) also were sometimes made from goat hair (Exod 26:7). If the two are synonymous, the point is that the tents of Qedar and the tent-curtains of Salmah were both black but beautiful. If the two terms are antonyms, the point is that the tents of Qedar are black but the tent-curtains of Salmah are beautiful. In either case, her point is that she is black, but nonetheless beautiful. Rabbinic midrash misses the point; it views the metaphor as contrasting her swarthy outward appearance with her inner beauty: &#8220;Just as the tents of Kedar, although from outside they look ugly, black, and ragged, yet inside contain precious stones and pearls, so the disciples of the wise, although they look repulsive and swarthy in this world, yet have within them knowledge of the Torah, Scriptures, Mishnah, Midrash, Halachoth, Talmud, Toseftas and Haggadah&#8221; (<i>Midrash Rabbah</i> 4:54-55).</p>
