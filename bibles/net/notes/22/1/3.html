Several factors suggest that the Song of Songs was poetry to be read and enjoyed rather than sung: (a) its sheer length, (b) absence of musical notations or instrumental instructions, (c) testimony of Jewish tradition and interpretation, (d) lack of evidence of its musical performance in the history of Israel, and (e) comparison with ancient Egyptian love poetry. The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font> here probably refers to love poetry (e.g., Isa 5:1) (BDB 1010 s.v. 1; W. L. Holladay, <i>Concise Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon</i>, 368). The Song appears to be a collection of individual love songs rather than a single multistanza poem. For comparison of the Song of Songs with ancient Egyptian loves songs, see M. V. Fox, <i>The Song of Songs and the Ancient Egyptian Love Songs</i>, and J. B. White,<i> Language of Love in the Song of Songs and Ancient Egyptian Poetry</i> (SBLDS).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The superscription &#8220;Solomon&#8217;s Most Excellent Love Song&#8221; appears to be a late addition, just as many superscriptions in the Psalter appear to have been added to the psalms sometime after their original composition. R. E. Murphy (<i>Song of Songs </i>[Hermeneia], 119) notes that the use of the independent relative pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asher</font>)<font face="Scholar"> </font>in 1:1 sharply distinguishes the superscription from the body of the Song as a whole where the short form -<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;</font> (<font face="Scholar">she-</font>)<font face="Scholar"> </font>occurs thirty-two times (e.g., 1:6, 12; 6:5). The short form -<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;</font> also occurs frequently in Ecclesiastes which is traditionally attributed to Solomon. Therefore, it would appear that the superscription is a later addition to the Song. This, of course, raises the question whether or not the attribution of Solomonic authorship of the Song is historically reliable or simply a matter of later Jewish tradition.</p>
