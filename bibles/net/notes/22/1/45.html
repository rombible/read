<a name="45"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=45><b>tn</b> The meaning of MT <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1465;&#1496;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">otÿyah</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>Qal active participle fs from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">atah</font>, &#8220;to veil oneself&#8221;) is debated; several options have been proposed: (1) Some scholars attempt to explain this in light of ancient Israelite culture or customs. The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;</font> describes a person wrapping oneself in a garment or with a veil (<i>HALOT </i>813 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1496;&#1492;</font>) as (a) a sign of grief or mourning (Ezek 24:17, 22), uncleanness (Lev 13:45), or shame (Mic 3:7), and as (b) the clothing of the deceased (1 Sam 28:14) and veiled cult-prostitutes (Gen 28:14). The term is rendered &#8220;one who veils herself&#8221; (NASB), &#8220;one who is veiled&#8221; (NRSV, KJV margin) and &#8220;like a veiled woman&#8221; (ASV, NIV). BDB suggests that she veiled herself in mourning (BDB 741 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;</font>). Rashi suggested that she veiled herself in mourning because she did not know where to find her beloved (<i>Canticles Rabbah</i> 1:6). Many commentators connect this with the veiled cult-prostitute soliciting business among shepherds. She wished to avoid what Tamar tried to do: to be mistaken as a harlot looking for business among the shepherds (Gen 38:14-23). If her beloved would not declare his whereabouts, she would be reduced to looking for him among the shepherds &#8211; an action that could be easily misunderstood. This is reflected in the CEV paraphrase: &#8220;Don&#8217;t let the other shepherds think badly of me.&#8221; R. E. Murphy (<i>Song of Songs </i>[Hermeneia], 131) writes: &#8220;Commentators have interpreted the covering as a sign of mourning (2 Sam 15:30) or as the sign of a harlot (Gen 38:14-15). These references are not helpful in explaining the context of v 7, and in neither of the instances is the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;</font> used. She seems rather to refer to some kind of covering or disguise she will be forced to use unless she knows where to find him. One can infer that the disguise will enable her to avoid being identified by his &#8216;companions,&#8217; but no reason is given (perhaps she does not want them to know about the rendezvous?)&#8221; (2) Other scholars resort to comparative lexicography. For example, S. R. Driver suggested that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1465;&#1496;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;</font> is not derived from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;</font> I (&#8220;to veil&#8221;), but from the Arabic root <i>gth</i> that came into Hebrew as the homonymic root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;</font> &#8220;to pick lice&#8221; (Isa 22:17; Jer 43:12) (<i>HALOT</i> 814 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1496;&#1492;</font>). Driver renders the line, &#8220;lest I be left picking lice,&#8221; that is, while away the siesta-time grooming herself. Most scholars reject this proposal; it seems strange in the context and unnecessarily creates a homonym for a well-known term that makes adequate sense contextually. Nevertheless, Driver&#8217;s proposal was adopted by the NEB: &#8220;that I may not be left picking lice.&#8221; See D. R. Driver, &#8220;Lice in the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>PEQ</i> 106 (1974): 159-160. (3) Still other scholars emend the text. MT reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1496;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">otÿyah</font>, &#8220;like one who is veiled&#8221;) (preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;</font> + Qal active participle fs <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;</font> I &#8220;to veil&#8221;) which is also reflected in the LXX&#8217;s <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8032; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#946;&#945;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#951;</font> (<font face="Greektl">w periballomenh,</font> &#8220;like one who is covered&#8221;; fs passive participle from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#946;&#940;&#955;&#955;&#969;</font>,<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> </font><font face="Greektl">periballw,</font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> </font>&#8220;to cover&#8221;). However, several ancient versions (Greek: Symmachus, Syriac Peshitta, Vulgate) reflect a Hebrew <i>Vorlage</i> with metathesis of the first two consonants: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1496;&#1465;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kÿto</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">iyyah</font>)<font face="Scholar"> </font>from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ta</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;to wander about, to stray&#8221;; e.g., Ezek 13:10). The root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> would be an Aramaizing form of Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8220;to wander&#8221;). This emendation is suggested by the <i>BHS</i> editors and the lexicons (<i>HALOT </i>377 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1506;&#1492;</font>; 814; BDB 742 s.v.); It is adopted by many translations: &#8220;like one who wanders&#8221; (RSV, AV, JB, NAB, NJV), &#8220;like one who strays&#8221; (JPS, NJPS) and &#8220;as one that turneth aside&#8221; (KJV). This would make nice sense contextually: she begs her beloved to tell her where to find him because she does not want to wander around like someone who is lost. </p>
