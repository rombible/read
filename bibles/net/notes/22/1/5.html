<a name="5"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;May he kiss me&#8230;.&#8221; The shift from 3rd person masculine singular forms (&#8220;he&#8221; and &#8220;his&#8221;) in 1:2a to 2nd person masculine singular forms (&#8220;your&#8221;) in 1:2b-4 has led some to suggest that the Beloved addresses the Friends in 1:2a and then her Lover in 1:2b-4. A better solution is that the shift from the 3rd person masculine singular to 2nd person masculine singular forms is an example of heterosis of person: a poetic device in which the grammatical person shifts from line to line (M. H. Pope, <i>Song of Songs </i>[AB], 297). The third person is put for the second person (e.g, Gen 49:4; Deut 32:15; Ps 23:2-5; Isa 1:29; 42:20; 54:1; Jer 22:24; Amos 4:1; Micah 7:19; Lam 3:1; Song 4:2; 6:6) (E. W. Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, 524-25). Similar shifts occur in ancient Near Eastern love literature (cf. S. N. Kramer, <i>The Sacred Marriage Rite</i>, 92, 99). Most translations render 1:2 literally and preserve the shifts from 3rd person masculine singular to 2nd person masculine singular forms (KJV, AV, NASB, NIV); others render 1:2 with 2nd person masculine singular forms throughout (RSV, NJPS).</p>
