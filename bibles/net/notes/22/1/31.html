<a name="31"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=31><b>sn</b> The term &#8220;dark&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew in this line but is supplied in the translation from the preceding line for the sake of clarity. The poetic structure of this tricolon is an example of redistribution. The terms &#8220;black but beautiful&#8221; in the A-line are broken up &#8211; the B-line picks up on &#8220;black&#8221; and the C-line picks up on &#8220;beautiful.&#8221; The Beloved was &#8220;black&#8221; like the rugged tents of Qedar woven from the wool of black goats, but &#8220;beautiful&#8221; as the decorative inner tent-curtains of King Solomon (J. L. Kugel, <i>The Idea of Biblical Poetry</i>, 40; W. G. E. Watson, <i>Classical Hebrew Poetry</i> [JSOTSup], 181).</p>
