<a name="62"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=62><b>sn</b> In the ancient Near East there was an unusual emphasis on beauty of a woman&#8217;s eyes. This was probably due to the practice of women veiling themselves and wearing long robes so that no portion of their body or face was exposed to sight except for their eyes (e.g., Gen 26:17). The only indication of a woman&#8217;s beauty was her eyes. There was no better (and no other, in light of the attire) way to praise a woman&#8217;s beauty in the ancient Near East (G. L. Carr, <i>Song of Solomon </i>[TOTC], 86).</p>
