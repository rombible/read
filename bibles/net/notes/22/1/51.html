<a name="51"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=51><b>tn</b> The subject of the 1st person common plural verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">na</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aseh</font>) might be the maidens of Jerusalem mentioned in 1:4[5]. However, this might be an example of heterosis of number, that is, the 1st person common plural for 1st person common singular person. In this case, her lover &#8211; the speaker throughout the rest of 1:8-9[9-10] &#8211; would still be the speaker here. Other possible examples of heterosis of number of the plural for the singular in the Song include 1:3[4]; 2:15; 5:1b; 6:13[7:1].</p>
