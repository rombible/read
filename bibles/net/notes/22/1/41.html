<a name="41"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=41><b>sn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kerem</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;vineyard&#8221;) is used figuratively in this line (see following note on the wordplays in this verse). Some suggest that her &#8220;vineyard&#8221; refers to her virginity, that is, she lost her virginity. However, this runs contrary to the moral purity accorded to the Beloved throughout the Song (e.g., 4:12; 8:8-10). It is better to take the &#8220;vineyard&#8221; imagery as a reference to her ability to take care of her physical appearance which had been thwarted by being forced to work outside where her skin had been darkened by the scorching rays of the sun, as alluded to throughout 1:4-5[5-6].</p>
