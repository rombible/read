<a name="63"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=63><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Your eyes are doves.&#8221; This metaphor compares her eyes to doves. There is no lack of suggestions as to the point of the comparison: (1) Arabic love literature describes doves having sentimental eyes, the point here (Marcia Falk, <i>Love Lyrics from the Bible</i>, 113). (2) The comparison has to do with the color of her eyes (G. L. Carr, <i>Song of Solomon </i>[TOTC], 86). (3) The comparison has to do with the glistening color of the dove and its quick movements, that is, her eyes had a beautiful color and had lively motion (M. H. Pope, <i>Song of Songs </i>[AB], 356). (4) The comparison has to do with the fluttering of her eyes which reminded him of the fluttering of a dove&#8217;s wings (M. D. Goulder, <i>The Song of Fourteen Songs </i>[JSOTSup], 5). (5) The comparison has to do with gentleness and purity, as well as longing and simplicity (K&amp;D 18:38). </p>
