(2) The conditional clause <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im-ta</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">iru vÿim-te</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">orÿru </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et-ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ehavah</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;If you arouse or awaken love&#8230;&#8221;) reflects the typical construction of a negative oath formula which consists of two parts: (1) protasis: the warning introduced by the conditional particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (&#8220;if&#8221;) and (2) apodosis: the description of the disaster or penalty which would befall the person who broke the vow and violated the condition of the oath. (3) If the consequences of violating the oath were extremely severe, they would not even be spoken; the statement of the consequences would be omitted for emphasis &#8211; as is the case here, that is, the apodosis is omitted for rhetorical emphasis. As is typical in negative oath formulas, the sanction or curse on the violation of the condition is suppressed for rhetorical emphasis. The curse was so awful that one could not or dare not speak of them (M. H. Pope, <i>IDB</i> 3:575-77).</p>
