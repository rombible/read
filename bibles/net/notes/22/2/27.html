<a name="27"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=95><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;of the field.&#8221; The Hebrew term refers to open fields or open country as the home of wild animals; if taken adjectivally this could modify the previous term: &#8220;wild young does&#8221; (cf. NRSV).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The &#8220;gazelles&#8221; and &#8220;does of the fields&#8221; are probably zoomorphisms for love personified. In other words, the witness of this oath is &#8220;love&#8221; itself. Should the daughters violate this vow which they are asked to make, &#8220;love&#8221; itself would hold them accountable. Gazelles were often figures in Hebrew, Akkadian, and Ugaritic literature for mighty warriors or virile young men (e.g., 2 Sam 1:19; 2:18; Isa 14:9; Zech 10:3).</p>
