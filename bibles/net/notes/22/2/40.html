<a name="40"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=108><b>sn</b> In ancient Near Eastern love literature it was common to use wild animals to symbolize potential problems which could separate lovers and destroy their love. For instance, in Egyptian love songs it is the crocodile, rather than the foxes, which were used as figures for obstacles which might threaten a couple&#8217;s love. Here the &#8220;foxes&#8221; are probably used figuratively to represent potentially destructive problems which could destroy their romantic relationship and which could hinder it from ripening into marriage.</p>
