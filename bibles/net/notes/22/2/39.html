<a name="39"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=107><b>sn</b> The term &#8220;foxes&#8221; is used metaphorically. Foxes are always spoken of in a negative light in the OT and in the ancient world were particularly associated with their destructive tendencies with regard to vineyards (Judg 15:4; Neh 4:3; Ps 63:10; Lam 5:18; Ezek 13:4). The description of these foxes as being destructive here seems to confirm that this is the point of comparison in mind.</p>
