Cosmic forces such as the &#8220;heavens and earth&#8221; were often personified to act as witnesses to an oath (e.g., Deut 32:1; Isa 1:2; Mic 1:2; 6:1-2; Ps 50:2). In this case, the &#8220;witnesses&#8221; are the &#8220;gazelles and stags of the field&#8221; (2:7; 3:5). These animals were frequently used as symbols of romantic love in the OT (Prov 5:19). And in Egyptian and Mesopotamian love literature and Ugaritic poetry the gazelle was often associated with sexual fertility. For instance, in the following excerpt from a Mesopotamian incantation text the stag is referred to in the context of sexual potency in which a woman urges an ailing male: &#8220;With the love-[making of the mountain goat] six times, with the lovemaking of a stag seven times, with the lovemaking of a partridge twelve times, make love to me! Make love to me because I am young! And the lovemaking of a stag&#8230;Make love to me!&#8221; (R. D. Biggs, <i>Ancient Mesopotamian Potency Incantations</i> [TCS], 26, lines 4-8).</p>
