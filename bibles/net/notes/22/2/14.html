<a name="14"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=82><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my palate.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khikki</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;my palate&#8221;) is used metonymically in reference to the sensation of taste which is associated with a person&#8217;s palate. The idea of &#8220;tasting&#8221; is used as a metaphor in the OT for the experiential knowledge which is acquired through a person&#8217;s relationship with someone (e.g., Ps 34:9). Just as a person would learn whether a fruit was ripe and delicious by tasting it, so a person could learn of the quality of a person&#8217;s character by experiencing it through personal interaction. This extended metaphor compares the delights of his love to (1) the refreshment of sitting in the shade of a tree for refuge from the desert sun, and (2) the delight of tasting a sweet apple &#8211; a fruit that was not indigenous to Palestine.</p>
