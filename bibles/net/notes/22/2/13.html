<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=81><b>sn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">matoq</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;sweet&#8221;) is used literally and figuratively. When used literally, it describes pleasant tasting foods, such as honey (Judg 14:14, 18; Prov 24:13; Ps 19:11) or sweet water (Num 33:28; Prov 9:17). Used figuratively, it describes what is pleasant to experience: friendship (Job 20:12; Ps 55:15; Prov 27:9), life (Eccl 11:7; Sir 40:18), sleep for the weary (Eccl 5:11), eloquence in speech (Prov 16:21, 24), and scripture (Ps 19:11). Those who adopt the &#8220;hyper-erotic&#8221; approach opt for the literal meaning: his &#8220;fruit&#8221; tastes sweet to her palate. The nonerotic approach takes the term in its figurative sense: The experience of his love was pleasant.</p>
