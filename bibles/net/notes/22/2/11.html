<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=79><b>sn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsel</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;shade&#8221;) is used figuratively to depict protection and relief. This term is used in OT literally (physical shade from the sun) and figuratively (protection from something) (<i>HALOT </i>1024-25 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1461;&#1500;</font>): (1) Literal: The physical shade of a tree offers protection from the heat of the midday sun (Judg 9:15; Ezek 17:23; 31:6, 12, 17; Hos 4:13; Jonah 4:6; Job 7:22; 40:22). Similar protection from the sun is offered by the shade of a vine (Ps 80:11), root (Gen 19:8), mountain (Judg 9:36), rock (Isa 32:2), cloud (Isa 25:5), and hut (Jonah 4:5). (2) Figurative (hypocatastasis): Just as physical shade offers protection from the sun, the Israelite could find &#8220;shade&#8221; (protection) from God or the king (e.g., Num 14:9; Isa 30:2; 49:2; 51:16; Hos 14:8; Pss 17:8; 36:8; 57:2; 63:8; 91:1; 121:5; Lam 4:20; Eccl 7:12). The association between &#8220;shade&#8221; and &#8220;protection&#8221; is seen in the related Akkadian <i>sillu</i> &#8220;shade, covering, protection&#8221; (<i>AHw</i> 3:1101; <i>CAD</i> S:189). The epithets of several Akkadian deities are <i>sillu</i> and <i>sululu</i> (&#8220;Shade, Protector&#8221;). The motif of protection, rest, and relief from the sun seems to be implied by the expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿyashavti</font>, &#8220;I sat down&#8221;) in 2:3b. During the summer months, the temperature often reaches 110-130ºF in the Negev. Those who have never personally experienced the heat of the summer sun in the Negev as they performed strenuous physical labor cannot fully appreciate the relief offered by any kind of shade! Previously, the young woman had complained that she had been burned by the sun because she had been forced to labor in the vineyards with no shade to protect her (Song 1:5-6). She had urged him to tell her where she could find relief from the sun during the hot midday hours (Song 1:7). Now she exults that she finally had found relief from the scorching sun under the &#8220;shade&#8221; which he offered to her (Song 2:3). S. C. Glickman writes: &#8220;Whereas before she came to him she worked long hours on the sun (1:6), now she rests under the protective shade he brings. And although formerly she was so exhausted by her work she could not properly care for herself, now she finds time for refreshment with him&#8221; (<i>A Song for Lovers</i>, 40).</p>
