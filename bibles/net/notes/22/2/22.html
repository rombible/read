The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khol</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;sick&#8221;) refers to the physical weakness which consumes a person who is suffering from a medical illness (Gen 48:1; 1 Sam 19:14). It is used figuratively as a hyperbolic hypocatastasis for being so consumed with sexual desire that it saps one of his/her physical and emotional strength (BDB 317 s.v. 2). This is commonly referred to as &#8220;love-sickness.&#8221; It was associated with such deep longing for physical and sexual fulfillment that it weighed so heavily upon a person that he/she was physically and emotionally drained (2 Sam 13:2).</p>
