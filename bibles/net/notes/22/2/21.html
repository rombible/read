<a name="21"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=89><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;apricots.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tappukhim</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;apples,&#8221; from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tappukha</font>) occurs four times in the book (Song 2:3, 5; 7:9; 8:5) and twice outside (Prov 25:4; Joel 1:12). It is usually defined as &#8220;apples&#8221; (BDB 656 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font>); however, some argue for &#8220;apricots&#8221; (FFB 92-93). The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (&#8220;apple&#8221;) is derived from the Hebrew root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nafakh</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;scent, breath&#8221;) which is related to the Arabic root <i>nafahu</i> &#8220;fragrant scent&#8221; (<i>HALOT </i>708 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1508;&#1495;</font>). Hence, the term refers to a fruit with a fragrant scent. This may explain why the mere scent of this fruit was thought to have medicinal powers in the ancient Near East (G. E. Post, <i>Flora of Syria, Palestine and Sinai</i>, 128). This imagery draws upon two motifs associated with apples. First, apples were viewed as medicinal in ancient Syro-Palestinian customs; the sick were given apples to eat or smell in order to revive them. Similarly, the Mishnah and Talmud refer to apples as a medication like wine and grapes. Second, apples were considered an aphrodisiac in the ancient Near East. Both motifs are combined here because the Beloved is &#8220;love-sick&#8221; and only the embrace of her beloved can cure her, as 2:6 indicates (T. H. Ratzaby, &#8220;A Motif in Hebrew Love Poetry: In Praise of the Apple,&#8221; <i>Ariel</i> 40 [1976]: 14).</p>
