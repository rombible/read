<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=80><b>sn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">piryo</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;his fruit&#8221;) is a figure for the young man himself or perhaps his kisses which the young woman delights to &#8220;taste&#8221; (e.g., Song 4:11; 5:13). It is possible to take the imagery of the young woman tasting his &#8220;fruit&#8221; as kissing. Likewise, the imagery of the gazelles grazing among the lilies is probably a picture of the young man caressing and kissing his beloved (Song 2:16; 6:3).</p>
