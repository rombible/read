<a name="6"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=178><b>sn</b> The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500; &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qol</font> <font face="Scholar">dodi</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;Listen! My lover &#8230;!&#8221;) that introduces this scene in 5:2-8 is the exact same phrase used in 2:8 to introduce the courtship section 2:8-11. In 2:8-11, the Beloved was excited about his unexpected arrival; however, in 5:2-8 she is apathetic about his unexpected approach. One should not miss the dramatic contrast between the Beloved&#8217;s eagerness to see her lover in 2:8-11 and her apathy about his approach on this evening in 5:2-8. The repetition of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500; &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8220;Listen! My lover &#8230;!&#8221;) in 2:8 and 5:2 is designed to draw out the parallels and contrasts between 2:8-11 and 5:2-8.</p>
