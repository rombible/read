<a name="10"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=182><b>tn</b> Possibly a euphemism (<i>double entendre</i>). The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yad</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;hand&#8221;) normally refers simply to the physical hand (<i>HALOT </i>386 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;</font> 1; BDB 388 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;</font> 1). There are, however, at least three occasions when <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;</font> refers to tall stone pillars (translated &#8220;monument&#8221; or &#8220;pillar&#8221;), such as those used in Canaanite fertility-cults in the form of phallic representations (1 Sam 15:12; 2 Sam 18:18; Isa 56:5). It is clearly used as a euphemism for the male copulative organ in Isa 57:8, 10. It is now an established fact that <i>yad</i> is sometimes used as a euphemism for the male sexual organ in Ugaritic literature (e.g., text no. 52:33-35) (<i>UT</i> 1072). The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;</font> is also used in the Qumran literature in this sense in a list of penalties for indecent exposure (Manual of Discipline 7:12-15). Thus, several scholars suggest that a subtle <i>double entendre</i> in 5:4-6. The imagery of the man thrusting his &#8220;hand&#8221; through the &#8220;hole&#8221; in the door, and the Beloved &#8220;opening&#8221; to her lover, with her fingers dripped with &#8220;myrrh&#8221; on the &#8220;handles of the lock,&#8221; might have a double reference to the literal attempt to gain entry to her bedroom and his desire to make love to her. See M. Delcour, &#8220;Two Special Meanings of the Word <i>yd</i> in Biblical Hebrew,&#8221; <i>JSS</i> 12 (1967): 230-40.</p>
