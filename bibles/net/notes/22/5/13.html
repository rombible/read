It is frequently used as a metonymy of adjunct for the emotions which Hebrew psychology associated with these internal organs (see H. W. Wolff, <i>Anthropology of the Old Testament</i>, 63-66). These include pity (Isa 16:11), lamentation (Jer 48:36), distress (Jer 4:19; Lam 1:20; 2:11), and compassion (Isa 63:15; Jer 31:20) (<i>HALOT </i>610-11 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1506;&#1462;&#1492;</font> 3; BDB 589 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1506;&#1462;&#1492;</font> 5). Most scholars suggest that the Beloved&#8217;s feelings of love were revived &#8211; a reversal of her feelings of indifference and apathy in 5:3. This is reflected in many translations which use equivalent English idioms: &#8220;the core of my being&#8221; (JB) and &#8220;my heart&#8221; (NIV, NJPS) over the woodenly literal &#8220;my bowels&#8221; (KJV, NEB, AV). On the other hand, the term is also used to refer to the procreative organs, both male (e.g., Gen 15:4; 2 Sam 7:12; 16:11; Isa 48:19; 2 Chr 32:21) and female (e.g., Gen 25:23; Ruth 1:11; Ps 71:6; Isa 49:1). NASB well renders the line, &#8220;my feelings were aroused for him&#8221; (NASB).</p>
