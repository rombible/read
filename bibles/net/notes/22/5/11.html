<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=183><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sent his hand through.&#8221; Most scholars suggest that it denotes &#8220;to send through,&#8221; that is, &#8220;to thrust through&#8221; or &#8220;to extend through.&#8221; For example, BDB 1018 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;</font> 3.a proposes that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> + <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shalakh </font>+<font face="Scholar"> min</font>) means &#8220;to stretch out (his hand) from the outside, inward.&#8221; He was attempting to open the door from the outside by extending his hand inside the door through some kind of latch-opening: &#8220;he put in his hand by the opening of the door&#8221; (KJV), &#8220;he extended his hand through the opening&#8221; (NASB), &#8220;he thrust his hand through the latch-opening&#8221; (NIV). Others, however, suggest that the construction. </p><p class="footnote"><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> + <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;</font> denotes &#8220;to withdraw from&#8221; (e.g., 1 Kgs 13:4). The preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> is taken to mean, not &#8220;through,&#8221; but &#8220;away from.&#8221; Thus, he was withdrawing his hand from the latch-opening, that is, he had given up and was leaving. This approach is adopted by NJPS: &#8220;My beloved took his hand off the latch.&#8221; His departure is clearly stated in 5:6, &#8220;I opened [the door] for my beloved, but my beloved had already turned and gone away; my heart sank at his departure!&#8221; (see study notes below on 5:6).</p>
