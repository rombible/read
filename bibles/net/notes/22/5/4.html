<a name="4"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=176><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;but my heart was awake.&#8221; Scholars have interpreted 5:2a in two basic ways: (1) The Beloved had been asleep or was just about to fall asleep when she was awakened by the sound of him knocking on the door of her bedroom chambers. The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">livvi</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;my heart&#8221;) is a synecdoche of part for the whole: &#8220;my heart&#8221; = &#8220;I.&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">er</font>) functions verbally, describing a past ingressive state: &#8220;was awakened.&#8221; The line would be rendered: &#8220;I was sleeping when I (= my heart) was awakened.&#8221; (2) The Beloved was sleeping, but her mind was dreaming (in her dream she heard him knocking on her door). In this case, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8220;my heart&#8221;) is a metonymy of association for the thoughts (e.g., Ps 90:12; Prov 18:15) and emotions (e.g., Prov 15:13; Song 3:11) she experienced during her dream: &#8220;my heart&#8221; = &#8220;my mind.&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1512;</font> functions verbally, describing a past progressive state: &#8220;was awake.&#8221; The line could be nuanced, &#8220;I was asleep, but my mind was dreaming.&#8221; Many translations adopt this approach: &#8220;I was asleep but my heart waketh&#8221; (KJV), &#8220;I was asleep but my heart was awake&#8221; (NASB, NIV), and &#8220;I was asleep, but my heart was wakeful&#8221; (NJPS).</p>
