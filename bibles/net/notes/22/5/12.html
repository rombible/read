The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khor</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;hole&#8221;) is used in OT in a literal and metaphorical sense: (1) literal sense: hole bored in the lid of a chest (2 Kgs 12:10); hole in a wall (Ezek 8:7); hole in the ground or cave used as hiding places for men (1 Sam 13:6; 14:11; Isa 42:23); hole in the ground, as the dwelling place of an asp (Isa 11:8); and a hole in a mountain, as the den of lions (Nah 2:13); and (2) figurative sense: hole of an eye (metonymy of association), that is, eye-socket (Zech 14:12) (<i>HALOT </i>348 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1512;</font>; BDB 359 s.v. III <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1512;</font>). While the meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1512;</font> in Song 5:4 is clear &#8211; &#8220;hole&#8221; &#8211; there is a debate whether it is used in a literal or figurative sense. (1) Literal sense: The lexicons suggest that it denotes &#8220;hole of a door, that is, key-hole or latch-opening&#8221; (<i>HALOT </i>348; BDB 359). Most commentators suggest that it refers to a hole bored through the bedroom door to provide access to the latch or lock. The mention in 5:5 of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514; &#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1504;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kaffot hamman</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ul</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;latches of the door-bolt&#8221;) suggests that the term refers to some kind of opening associated with the latch of the bedroom door. This approach is followed by most translations: &#8220;the hole in the door&#8221; (JB), &#8220;the latch-hole&#8221; (NEB), &#8220;the latch-opening&#8221; (NIV), &#8220;the latch-hole&#8221; (NEB), &#8220;the latch&#8221; (RSV, NJPS), and &#8220;the opening of the door&#8221; (KJV). The assumption that the hole in question was a latch-hole in the door is reflected in Midrash Rabbah: Rabbi Abba ben Kahana said, &#8220;Why is the hole of the door mentioned here, seeing that it is a place where vermin swarm?&#8221; The situation envisaged by his actions are often depicted thus: In ancient Near Eastern villages, the bolting systems of doors utilized door-bolts and keys made of wood. The keys were often stored either on the outside (!) or inside of the door. If the key was placed on the inside of the door, a small hole was bored through the door so that a person could reach through the hole with the key to unlock the door. The key was often over a foot in length, and the keyhole large enough for a man&#8217;s hand. Apparently, he extended his hand through the hole from the outside to try to unbolt the door latch on the inside. He could put his hand through the hole, but could not open the door without the key. (2) Figurative sense: Because of the presence of several erotic motifs in 5:2-8 and the possibility that a <i>double entendre</i> is present (see notes below), several scholars suggest that the term is a euphemism for the female vagina (<i>HALOT </i>348). They suggest that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (&#8220;hole&#8221;) is the female counterpart for the euphemistic usage of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;</font> (&#8220;hand&#8221;) in 5:4.
