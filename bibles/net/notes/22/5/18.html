<a name="18"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=190><b>tn</b> Alternately, &#8220;spoke.&#8221; Traditionally, the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿdabbÿro</font>) has been related to the common root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">davar</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;to speak&#8221;) which occurs nearly 1150 times in verbal forms and nearly 1500 times as a noun. This approach is seen as early as the LXX (although the LXX treated <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1512;</font> as a noun rather than an infinitive construct because it was working with an unpointed text): <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#955;&#959;&#947;&#8183; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166; </font>(<font face="Greektl">en logw autou,</font> &#8220;in his word&#8221;). Although they differ on whether the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿ</font>)<font face="Scholar"> </font>is temporal (&#8220;when&#8221;) or respect (&#8220;at&#8221;), many translations adopt the same basic approach as the LXX: &#8220;when he spake&#8221; (KJV), &#8220;as he spoke&#8221; (NASB), &#8220;when he spoke&#8221; (NIV margin), &#8220;at what he said&#8221; (JPS, NJPS). However, many recent scholars relate <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;</font> to the homonymic root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8220;to turn away, depart&#8221;) which is related to Akkadian <i>dabaru</i> D &#8220;to go away,&#8221; Dt &#8220;to drive away, push back&#8221; (<i>CAD</i> 3:186ff), and Arabic <i>dabara</i> &#8220;to turn one&#8217;s back, be behind, depart, retreat&#8221; (<i>HALOT </i>209 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;</font>). Several examples of this root have been found (Pss 18:48; 47:4; 56:6; 75:6; 116:10; 127:5; 2 Chr 22:10; Job 19:18; Song 5:6; Isa 32:7) (<i>HALOT </i>209-10 s.v. I). Several recent translations take this approach: &#8220;when he turned his back&#8221; (NEB), &#8220;at his flight&#8221; (JB), and &#8220;at his departure&#8221; (NIV). This makes better sense contextually (Solomon did not say anything after 5:2a), and it provides a tighter parallelism with the preceding line that also describes his departure: &#8220;My beloved had turned away (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1511;</font>,<font face="Scholar"> khamaq</font>); he was gone (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avar</font>)&#8221; (NIV).</p>
