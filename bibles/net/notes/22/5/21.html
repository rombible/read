<a name="21"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=193><b>sn</b> The Beloved&#8217;s praise of his appearance follows the typical literary structure of the ancient Near Eastern <i>wasfs</i> song: (1) introductory summary praise (5:10), (2) detailed descriptive praise from head to foot (5:11-16a), and (3) concluding summary praise (5:16b). There are several striking features about this song that are unique from the typical <i>wasfs</i>. (1) The ordinary setting of the ancient Near Eastern <i>wasfs</i> songs was the wedding night. (2) They were ordinarily sung only by a man in praise of his bride. (3) Normally, the <i>wasfs</i> song will conclude with the feet after the legs; however, the Beloved concludes by praising his mouth after his legs.</p>
