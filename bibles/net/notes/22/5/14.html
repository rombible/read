<a name="14"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=186><b>tn</b> The exact meaning of this Hebrew verb is uncertain. The exact connotation of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hamu</font>) in 5:4 is debated. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hamah</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;to murmur, growl, roar, be boisterous&#8221;) is related to the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hamon</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;sound, murmur, roar, noisy crowd&#8221;), <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1462;&#1502;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hemyah</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;sound, music&#8221;), and perhaps even <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1502;&#1467;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hamulah</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;noise, noisy crowd, crowd&#8221;). The Hebrew root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1502;&#1492;</font> is related to Aramaic <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1502;&#1488;</font> (&#8220;to roar; to be agitated&#8221;). The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> has a basic two-fold range of meanings: (1) literal: &#8220;to make a noise&#8221; of some kind and (2) figurative: &#8220;to be in commotion, uproar&#8221; (e.g., often associated with noise or a noisy crowd). The lexicons suggest six distinct categories: (1) &#8220;to make a noise&#8221; or &#8220;to be in commotion,&#8221; particularly by a tumultuous crowd (1 Kgs 1:41; Pss 39:7; 46:7; Prov 1:21; Is 22:2; Mic 2:12); (2) &#8220;to roar,&#8221; of the sea and sea-waves (Isa 17:12; 51:15; Jer 5:22; 6:23; 31:35; 50:42; 51:55; Ps 46:4); (3) &#8220;to make a sound,&#8221; e.g., bear growling (Isa 59:11), dog barking (Ps 59:7, 15), bird chirping (Ps 102:8), dove cooing (Ezek 7:16); (4) &#8220;to moan,&#8221; (Ps 39:7; 55:18; Prov 1:21; Lam 2:18; Ezek 7:16; Zech 9:15); (5) &#8220;to be turbulent, boisterous&#8221; (Prov 7:11; 9:13; 20:1; Zech 9:5); and (6) figuratively of the internal organs: &#8220;to murmur, be restless, be turbulent,&#8221; used in reference to pity (Isa 16:11; Jer 4:19; 31:20; 48:36), discouragement (Ps 42:6, 12; 43:5), and murmuring in prayer (Pss 55:18; 77:4) (<i>HALOT </i>250 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1502;&#1492;</font>; BDB 242 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font>). <i>HALOT</i> suggests &#8220;to be turbulent&#8221; for Song 5:4 (<i>HALOT </i>250 s.v. 4), while BDB suggests &#8220;the thrill of deep-felt compassion or sympathy&#8221; (BDB 242 s.v. 2). Commentators offer a spectrum of opinions from the Beloved feeling agitation, pity, compassion, sexual arousal, or a revival of her love for him. A survey of the translations reveals the same lack of consensus: &#8220;my bowels were moved for him&#8221; (KJV), &#8220;my bowels stirred within me&#8221; (NEB), &#8220;my heart was thrilled within me&#8221; (RSV), &#8220;I trembled to the core of my being&#8221; (JB), &#8220;my heart trembled within me&#8221; (NAB), &#8220;my heart was stirred for him&#8221; (JPS, NJPS), &#8220;my feelings were aroused for him&#8221; (NASB), and &#8220;my heart began to pound for him&#8221; (NIV). While the precise meaning may never be agreed upon, whatever she was feeling she roused herself from her indifferent apathetic inactivity to arise and open for her beloved in 5:5. The phrase is used similarly elsewhere in OT, rousing the subject to irresistible action (Jer 4:19). The simplest course of action is to nuance this term metonymically (cause for effect), e.g., &#8220;my feelings were stirred up for him.&#8221;</p>
