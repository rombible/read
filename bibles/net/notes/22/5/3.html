If this verse is introducing a dream sequence in 5:2-8, this is a metonymy for the Beloved&#8217;s thoughts in her dream: &#8220;I was sleeping but my mind was dreaming.&#8221; If this verse depicts the Beloved beginning to doze off to sleep &#8211; only to be awakened by his knocking at her door &#8211; then it is a synecdoche of part for the whole: &#8220;I was about to fall asleep when I was suddenly awakened.&#8221; </p>
