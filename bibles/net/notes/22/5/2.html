This is an appropriate figure of comparison because it would have been issued during the feast which followed the wedding and the consummation. The term &#8220;drink&#8221; refers to intoxication, that is, it compares becoming drunk on wine with enjoying the physical love of one&#8217;s spouse (e.g., Prov 5:19-20). </p>
