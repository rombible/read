<a name="26"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=198><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;among ten thousand.&#8221; The numeral &#8220;ten thousand&#8221; is the highest number used in comparisons in Hebrew poetry (1 Sam 18:7-8; 21:12; 29:5; Ps 91:7). It is not used to mark out a specific number, but to denote an indefinite number of persons of the largest possible proportions (Gen 24:60; Num 10:36; Deut 33:2; Ps 3:7). Her point is simply this: no other man could possibly compare to him in appearance, even if he were in a group of an infinite number of men.</p>
