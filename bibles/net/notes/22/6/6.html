Of these five are unequivocally used figuratively as descriptions of a woman or women (2:1, 2), the color and softness of her breasts (4:5), the attractiveness of his lips (5:13), and her waist (7:2). The closest parallel to 6:2 is the description &#8220;the one who grazes among the lilies&#8221; (2:16; 6:3) which is a figurative expression comparing his romancing of his Beloved with a sheep feeding on lilies. However, this still leaves a question as to what the lilies represent in 2:16; 6:2, 3. The phrase &#8220;to gather lilies&#8221; itself appears only here in the Song. However, the synonymous phrase &#8220;to gather myrrh and balsam spice&#8221; is used in 5:1 as a figure (euphemistic hypocatastasis) for sexual consummation by the man of the woman. There are three basic options as to how &#8220;lilies&#8221; may be taken: (1) The lilies are real flowers; he has gone to a real garden in which to repose and she is picking real lilies. (2) The term &#8220;lilies&#8221; is a figure for the young woman; he is romancing her just as he had in 2:16 and 5:1. He is kissing her mouth just as a sheep would graze among lilies. (3) The term &#8220;lilies&#8221; is a figure expression referring to other women, such as his harem (e.g., 6:8-9). Two factors support the &#8220;harem&#8221; interpretation: (1) Solomon had recently departed from her, and she was desperate to find him after she refused him. (2) His harem is mentioned explicitly in 6:8-9. However, several other factors support the Beloved interpretation: (1) She expresses her confidence in 6:3 that he is devoted to her. (2) The immediately following use of &#8220;lilies&#8221; in 6:3 appears to refer to her, as in 2:16 and 5:1. (3) He praises her in 6:4-7, suggesting that he was romancing her in 6:2-3. (4) Although his harem is mentioned in 6:8-10, all these women acknowledge that he is disinterested in them and only loves her. (5) Her exultation &#8220;I am my beloved&#8217;s and my beloved is mine; the one who grazes among the lilies&#8221; (6:3) is a statement of assurance in their relationship and this would seem quite strange if he was cavorting with his harem while she said this.</p>
