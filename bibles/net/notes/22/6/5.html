<a name="5"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=210><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lir</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ot</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;to browse&#8221;; so NAB, NIV) is from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;to feed, graze&#8221;) which is used seven times in the Song (1:7, 8a, 8b; 2:16; 4:5; 6:2, 3). All its uses appear to be either literal or figurative descriptions of sheep grazing. The verb is used twice in reference to sheep &#8220;grazing&#8221; in a pasture (1:7, 8). The participle is used once to designate &#8220;shepherds&#8221; (1:8), once in reference to two fawns which &#8220;which graze among the lilies&#8221; as a figurative description of her breasts (4:5), and twice as a figurative description of Solomon as &#8220;the one who grazes among the lilies&#8221; which is probably also a comparison of Solomon to a grazing sheep (2:16; 6:3). Therefore, it is likely that the usage of the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (&#8220;to graze&#8221;) in 6:2 is also a figurative comparison of Solomon to a sheep grazing among garden flowers. Thus, there are two options: (1) nuance the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> as &#8220;to browse&#8221; (NAB, NIV) and take this as a literal action of Solomon walking through a real garden or (2) nuance the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> as &#8220;to graze&#8221; (NLT) and take this as a figure in which Solomon is pictured as a gazelle grazing on the flowers in a garden.</p>
