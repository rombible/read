<a name="7"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=212><b>sn</b> This is the second occurrence of the poetic refrain that occurs elsewhere in 2:16 and 7:11. The order of the first two cola are reversed from 2:16: &#8220;My beloved is mine and I am his&#8221; (2:16) but &#8220;I am my beloved&#8217;s and he is mine&#8221; (6:3). The significance of this shift depends on whether the parallelism is synonymous or climactic. This might merely be a literary variation with no rhetorical significance. On the other hand, it might signal a shift in her view of their relationship: Originally, she focused on her possession of him, now she focused on his possession of her.</p>
