<a name="24"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=229><b>tn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿvanah</font>)<font face="Scholar"> </font>literally means &#8220;the white one&#8221; (BDB 526 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font>) and is always used in reference to the moon. It is only used elsewhere in the OT in parallelism with the term used to designate the sun (Isa 24:23; 30:26), which likewise is not the ordinary term, but literally means &#8220;the hot one,&#8221; emphasizing the heat of the sun (Job 30:28; Ps 19:6). Both of these terms, &#8220;the white one&#8221; and &#8220;the hot one,&#8221; are metonymies of adjunct in which an attribute (i.e., color and heat) are substituted for the subject itself. The white moon in contrast to the dark night sky captures one&#8217;s attention, just as the red-hot sun in the afternoon sky is the center of attention during the day. The use of the figurative comparisons of her beauty to that of the dawn, sun, moon, and stars is strikingly similar to the Hebrews&#8217; figurative comparison of Simon the high priest coming out of the sanctuary to the morning star, moon, sun, and rainbow: &#8220;How glorious he was when the people gathered round him as he came out of the inner sanctuary! Like the morning star among the clouds, like the moon when it is full; like the sun shining upon the temple of the Most High, and like the rainbow gleaming in glorious clouds&#8221; (See G. Gerleman, <i>Ruth, Das Hohelied</i> [BKAT], 171).</p>
