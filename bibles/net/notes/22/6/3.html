In five cases, it is used figuratively (hypocatastasis) to describe her body or the sexual love of the couple (4:12, 15, 16a, 16b; 5:1). There is only one usage in which it might refer to a real garden (8:13). Thus, this usage of &#8220;garden&#8221; might be figurative or literal: (1) He went to a real garden for repose. Solomon did, in fact, own a great many gardens (Eccl 2:4-7; 1 Chr 27:27). (2) The &#8220;garden&#8221; is a figurative description referring either to: (a) the young woman, (b) their sexual love, or (c) Solomon&#8217;s harem.</p>
