The beauty of Jerusalem was legendary; it is twice called &#8220;the perfection of beauty&#8221; (Ps 50:2; Lam 2:15). Tirzah was beautiful as well &#8211; in fact, the name means &#8220;pleasure, beauty.&#8221; So beautiful was Tirzah that it would be chosen by Jeroboam as the original capital of the northern kingdom (1 Kgs 15:33; 16:8, 15, 23). The ancient city Tirzah has been identified as Tel el-Far`ah near Nablus: see B. S. J. Isserlin, &#8220;Song of Songs IV, 4: An Archaeological Note,&#8221; <i>PEQ</i> 90 (1958): 60; R. de Vaux, &#8220;Le premiere campagne de fouilles a Tell el-Far`ah,&#8221; <i>RB</i> 54 (1947): 394-433.</p>
