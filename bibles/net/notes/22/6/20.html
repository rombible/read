Likewise, the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">halal</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;to praise&#8221;) is used elsewhere of people who are held in high esteem by others either due to a commendable moral quality (Prov 31:28, 31) or due to one&#8217;s physical beauty (Gen 12:15; 2 Sam 14:25). The actual content of their praise of her appears in Song 6:10 in which they compare her beauty to that of the dawn, moon, sun, and stars.</p>
