The syntax is enigmatic and the textual reading is uncertain. The difficulty of this verse has generated a plethora of different translations: &#8220;Or ever I was aware, my soul made me [like] the chariots of Ammi-nadib&#8221; (KJV), &#8220;Before I knew it, my soul made me like the chariots of Ammi-nadib&#8221; (AV), &#8220;Before I knew it, my fancy set me in a chariot beside my prince&#8221; (AT), &#8220;Before I knew&#8230;my desire hurled me on the chariots of my people, as their prince&#8221; (JB), &#8220;Before I knew it, my desire set me mid the chariots of Ammi-nadib&#8221; (JPSV), &#8220;I did not know myself, she made me feel more than a prince reigning over the myriads of his people&#8221; (NEB), &#8220;Before I knew it, my heart had made me the blessed one of my kins-women&#8221; (NAB), &#8220;Before I was aware, my soul set me [over] the chariots of my noble people&#8221; (NASB), &#8220;Before I realized it, my desire set me among the royal chariots of my people&#8221; (NIV), &#8220;&#8230;among the chariots of Amminadab&#8221; (NIV margin), &#8220;&#8230;among the chariots of the people of the prince&#8221; (NIV margin), and &#8220;Before I realized it, I was stricken with a terrible homesickness and wanted to be back among my own people&#8221; (NLT).
