<a name="22"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=227><b>tn</b> Alternately, &#8220;rises&#8221; or &#8220;looks forth.&#8221; Delitzsch renders <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1511;&#1464;&#1508;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hannishqafah</font>)<font face="Scholar"> </font>as &#8220;who rises,&#8221; while NIV opts for &#8220;who appears.&#8221; The verb means &#8220;to look down upon [something] from a height&#8221; and is derived from the related noun &#8220;ceiling, roof, sky&#8221; (BDB 1054 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1507;</font>; <i>HALOT</i> 1645 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1507;</font>). The verb is used of looking down over a plain or valley from the vantage point of a mountain-top (Num 21:20; 23:28; 1 Sam 13:18); of God looking down from heaven (Ps 14:2); or of a person looking down below out of an upper window (Judg 5:28; 2 Sam 6:16; Prov 7:6). M. H. Pope (<i>The Song of Songs</i> [AB], 571-72) suggests that this verb implies the idea of her superiority over the other women, that is, she occupies a &#8220;higher&#8221; position over them due to his choice of her. But another interpretation is possible: The verb creates personification (i.e., the dawn is attributed with the human action of looking). Just as the dawn is the focus of attention during the morning hours and looks down upon the earth, so too she is the focus of his attention and is in the privileged position over all the other women.</p>
