<a name="1"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=173><b>sn</b> There is no little debate about the identity of the speaker(s) and the audience addressed in 5:1b. There are five options: (1) He is addressing his bride. (2) The bride is addressing him. (3) The wedding guests are addressing him and his bride. (4) He and his bride are addressing the wedding guests. (5) The poet is addressing him and his bride. When dealing with this issue, the following factors should be considered: (1) the form of both the exhortations and the addressees are plural. This makes it unlikely that he is addressing his bride or that his bride is addressing him. (2) The exhortation has an implicitly sexual connotation because the motif of &#8220;eating&#8221; and &#8220;drinking&#8221; refers to sexual consummation in 5:1a. This makes it unlikely that he or his bride are addressing the wedding guests &#8211; an orgy is quite out of the question! (3) The poet could be in view because as the writer who created the Song, only he could have been with them &#8211; in a poetic sense &#8211; in the bridal chamber as a &#8220;guest&#8221; on their wedding night. (4) The wedding guests could be in view through the figurative use of apostrophe (addressing an audience that is not in the physical presence of the speaker). While the couple was alone in their wedding chambers, the wedding guests wished them all the joys and marital bliss of the honeymoon. This is supported by several factors: (a) Wedding feasts in the ancient Near East frequently lasted several days and after the couple had consummated their marriage, they would appear again to celebrate a feast with their wedding guests. (b) The structure of the Song is composed of paired-dialogues which either begin or conclude with the words of the friends or daughters of Jerusalem (1:2-4, 5-11; 3:6-11; 5:9-16; 6:1-3, 4-13; 7:1-10) or which conclude with an exhortation addressed to them (2:1-7; 3:1-5; 8:1-4). In this case, the poetic unit of 4:1-5:1 would conclude with an exhortation by the friends in 5:1b.</p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=174><b>sn</b> The physical love between the couple is compared to eating and drinking at a wedding feast. This is an appropriate figure of comparison because it would have been issued during the feast which followed the wedding and the consummation. The term &#8220;drink&#8221; refers to intoxication, that is, it compares becoming drunk on wine with enjoying the physical love of one&#8217;s spouse (e.g., Prov 5:19-20). </p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=175><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my heart.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">livvi</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;my heart&#8221;) is a metonymy of association for emotions (e.g., Prov 15:13; Song 3:11) or thoughts (e.g., Ps 90:12; Prov 18:15) or a synecdoche of part for the whole. If this verse is introducing a dream sequence in 5:2-8, this is a metonymy for the Beloved&#8217;s thoughts in her dream: &#8220;I was sleeping but my mind was dreaming.&#8221; If this verse depicts the Beloved beginning to doze off to sleep &#8211; only to be awakened by his knocking at her door &#8211; then it is a synecdoche of part for the whole: &#8220;I was about to fall asleep when I was suddenly awakened.&#8221; </p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=176><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;but my heart was awake.&#8221; Scholars have interpreted 5:2a in two basic ways: (1) The Beloved had been asleep or was just about to fall asleep when she was awakened by the sound of him knocking on the door of her bedroom chambers. The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">livvi</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;my heart&#8221;) is a synecdoche of part for the whole: &#8220;my heart&#8221; = &#8220;I.&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">er</font>) functions verbally, describing a past ingressive state: &#8220;was awakened.&#8221; The line would be rendered: &#8220;I was sleeping when I (= my heart) was awakened.&#8221; (2) The Beloved was sleeping, but her mind was dreaming (in her dream she heard him knocking on her door). In this case, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8220;my heart&#8221;) is a metonymy of association for the thoughts (e.g., Ps 90:12; Prov 18:15) and emotions (e.g., Prov 15:13; Song 3:11) she experienced during her dream: &#8220;my heart&#8221; = &#8220;my mind.&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1512;</font> functions verbally, describing a past progressive state: &#8220;was awake.&#8221; The line could be nuanced, &#8220;I was asleep, but my mind was dreaming.&#8221; Many translations adopt this approach: &#8220;I was asleep but my heart waketh&#8221; (KJV), &#8220;I was asleep but my heart was awake&#8221; (NASB, NIV), and &#8220;I was asleep, but my heart was wakeful&#8221; (NJPS).</p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=177><b>sn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qol</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>literally, &#8220;sound, noise, voice&#8221;) is used as an exclamation: &#8220;Listen!&#8221; or &#8220;Hark!&#8221; (e.g., Gen 4:10; Isa 13:4; 40:3; 52:8; Jer 3:21; 4:15; 10:22; 31:51; 50:28; 51:54; Mic 6:9; Zeph 1:14; 2:14; Song 2:8; 5:2) (<i>HALOT </i>1085 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;</font> 8b; BDB 877 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;</font> 1.f; Joüon 2:614 §162.e; GKC 467 §146.<i>b</i>). The term often refers to a loud or unexpected sound that arrests the attention of a character in a narrative. The speaker/writer uses it as a rhetorical device to dramatically portray his/her own startled reaction to an unexpected sound that called his/her attention. The Beloved is startled from her sleep by the unexpected sound of him loudly knocking at her bedroom door late at night.</p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=178><b>sn</b> The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500; &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qol</font> <font face="Scholar">dodi</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;Listen! My lover &#8230;!&#8221;) that introduces this scene in 5:2-8 is the exact same phrase used in 2:8 to introduce the courtship section 2:8-11. In 2:8-11, the Beloved was excited about his unexpected arrival; however, in 5:2-8 she is apathetic about his unexpected approach. One should not miss the dramatic contrast between the Beloved&#8217;s eagerness to see her lover in 2:8-11 and her apathy about his approach on this evening in 5:2-8. The repetition of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500; &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8220;Listen! My lover &#8230;!&#8221;) in 2:8 and 5:2 is designed to draw out the parallels and contrasts between 2:8-11 and 5:2-8.</p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=179><b>sn</b> The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1508;&#1461;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dofeq</font>) connotes present progressive or iterative action. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dafaq</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;to knock, pound, beat&#8221;) occurs only three times in biblical Hebrew, twice in reference to knocking at a door (Judg 19:22; Song 5:2) and once of beating cattle in order to drive them along (Gen 33:13). The Qal stem depicts the normal action of knocking at a door, while the Hitpael denotes a more intensive pounding, e.g., Qal: &#8220;to knock at the door&#8221; (Song 5:2) and Hitpael: &#8220;to beat violently against the door&#8221; (Judg 19:22) (<i>HALOT </i>229 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1508;&#1511;</font>; BDB 200 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1511;</font>). The same connotations are seen in Mishnaic Hebrew, e.g., the verbs <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1511;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1508;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dÿfaq</font>), &#8220;to knock at the door&#8221; (Jastrow 317 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1511;</font>), and the nouns <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1508;&#1461;&#1511;</font> &#8220;door frame (= what someone knocks on), movable tomb stone,&#8221; and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1508;&#1456;&#1511;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dofÿqanin</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;knockers&#8221;; Jastrow 287 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1508;&#1456;&#1511;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font>). The collocation of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1514;&#1495;</font> &#8220;to open&#8221; a door (<i>HALOT </i>986-87 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1514;&#1495;</font>; BDB 835 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1495;</font>) clearly suggests that he is at the Beloved&#8217;s bedroom door.</p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=180><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;at the door&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew but is supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>

When used with the accusative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">delet</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;door&#8221;), it refers to opening a door (e.g., Judg 3:25; 19:27; 1 Sam 3:15; 2 Kgs 9:3, 10; 2 Chr 29:3; Job 31:32) (<i>HALOT </i>986-87 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1514;&#1495;</font>; BDB 835 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1495;</font>). Although the object <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (&#8220;door&#8221;) is here omitted, a bedroom door is clearly in mind in 5:2, as indicated by the collocated verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dafaq</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;to knock on a door&#8221;) in the preceding line.

While it is clear that the verb describes her action of opening the door of her bedroom chamber in 5:2, some suggest that in 5:5-6 it is used figuratively (hypocatastasis: implied comparison) of the Beloved &#8220;opening&#8221; her female genitalia for sexual intercourse (but see study notes below).</p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=182><b>tn</b> Possibly a euphemism (<i>double entendre</i>). The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yad</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;hand&#8221;) normally refers simply to the physical hand (<i>HALOT </i>386 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;</font> 1; BDB 388 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;</font> 1). There are, however, at least three occasions when <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;</font> refers to tall stone pillars (translated &#8220;monument&#8221; or &#8220;pillar&#8221;), such as those used in Canaanite fertility-cults in the form of phallic representations (1 Sam 15:12; 2 Sam 18:18; Isa 56:5). It is clearly used as a euphemism for the male copulative organ in Isa 57:8, 10. It is now an established fact that <i>yad</i> is sometimes used as a euphemism for the male sexual organ in Ugaritic literature (e.g., text no. 52:33-35) (<i>UT</i> 1072). The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;</font> is also used in the Qumran literature in this sense in a list of penalties for indecent exposure (Manual of Discipline 7:12-15). Thus, several scholars suggest that a subtle <i>double entendre</i> in 5:4-6. The imagery of the man thrusting his &#8220;hand&#8221; through the &#8220;hole&#8221; in the door, and the Beloved &#8220;opening&#8221; to her lover, with her fingers dripped with &#8220;myrrh&#8221; on the &#8220;handles of the lock,&#8221; might have a double reference to the literal attempt to gain entry to her bedroom and his desire to make love to her. See M. Delcour, &#8220;Two Special Meanings of the Word <i>yd</i> in Biblical Hebrew,&#8221; <i>JSS</i> 12 (1967): 230-40.</p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=183><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sent his hand through.&#8221; Most scholars suggest that it denotes &#8220;to send through,&#8221; that is, &#8220;to thrust through&#8221; or &#8220;to extend through.&#8221; For example, BDB 1018 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;</font> 3.a proposes that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> + <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shalakh </font>+<font face="Scholar"> min</font>) means &#8220;to stretch out (his hand) from the outside, inward.&#8221; He was attempting to open the door from the outside by extending his hand inside the door through some kind of latch-opening: &#8220;he put in his hand by the opening of the door&#8221; (KJV), &#8220;he extended his hand through the opening&#8221; (NASB), &#8220;he thrust his hand through the latch-opening&#8221; (NIV). Others, however, suggest that the construction. </p><p class="footnote"><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> + <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;</font> denotes &#8220;to withdraw from&#8221; (e.g., 1 Kgs 13:4). The preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> is taken to mean, not &#8220;through,&#8221; but &#8220;away from.&#8221; Thus, he was withdrawing his hand from the latch-opening, that is, he had given up and was leaving. This approach is adopted by NJPS: &#8220;My beloved took his hand off the latch.&#8221; His departure is clearly stated in 5:6, &#8220;I opened [the door] for my beloved, but my beloved had already turned and gone away; my heart sank at his departure!&#8221; (see study notes below on 5:6).</p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=184><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;hole.&#8221; Probably &#8220;latch-hole&#8221; or &#8220;key-hole,&#8221; but possibly a euphemism (<i>double entendre</i>). The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khor</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;hole&#8221;) is used in OT in a literal and metaphorical sense: (1) literal sense: hole bored in the lid of a chest (2 Kgs 12:10); hole in a wall (Ezek 8:7); hole in the ground or cave used as hiding places for men (1 Sam 13:6; 14:11; Isa 42:23); hole in the ground, as the dwelling place of an asp (Isa 11:8); and a hole in a mountain, as the den of lions (Nah 2:13); and (2) figurative sense: hole of an eye (metonymy of association), that is, eye-socket (Zech 14:12) (<i>HALOT </i>348 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1512;</font>; BDB 359 s.v. III <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1512;</font>). While the meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1512;</font> in Song 5:4 is clear &#8211; &#8220;hole&#8221; &#8211; there is a debate whether it is used in a literal or figurative sense. (1) Literal sense: The lexicons suggest that it denotes &#8220;hole of a door, that is, key-hole or latch-opening&#8221; (<i>HALOT </i>348; BDB 359). Most commentators suggest that it refers to a hole bored through the bedroom door to provide access to the latch or lock. The mention in 5:5 of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514; &#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1504;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kaffot hamman</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ul</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;latches of the door-bolt&#8221;) suggests that the term refers to some kind of opening associated with the latch of the bedroom door. This approach is followed by most translations: &#8220;the hole in the door&#8221; (JB), &#8220;the latch-hole&#8221; (NEB), &#8220;the latch-opening&#8221; (NIV), &#8220;the latch-hole&#8221; (NEB), &#8220;the latch&#8221; (RSV, NJPS), and &#8220;the opening of the door&#8221; (KJV). The assumption that the hole in question was a latch-hole in the door is reflected in Midrash Rabbah: Rabbi Abba ben Kahana said, &#8220;Why is the hole of the door mentioned here, seeing that it is a place where vermin swarm?&#8221; The situation envisaged by his actions are often depicted thus: In ancient Near Eastern villages, the bolting systems of doors utilized door-bolts and keys made of wood. The keys were often stored either on the outside (!) or inside of the door. If the key was placed on the inside of the door, a small hole was bored through the door so that a person could reach through the hole with the key to unlock the door. The key was often over a foot in length, and the keyhole large enough for a man&#8217;s hand. Apparently, he extended his hand through the hole from the outside to try to unbolt the door latch on the inside. He could put his hand through the hole, but could not open the door without the key. (2) Figurative sense: Because of the presence of several erotic motifs in 5:2-8 and the possibility that a <i>double entendre</i> is present (see notes below), several scholars suggest that the term is a euphemism for the female vagina (<i>HALOT </i>348). They suggest that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (&#8220;hole&#8221;) is the female counterpart for the euphemistic usage of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;</font> (&#8220;hand&#8221;) in 5:4.

These include pity (Isa 16:11), lamentation (Jer 48:36), distress (Jer 4:19; Lam 1:20; 2:11), and compassion (Isa 63:15; Jer 31:20) (<i>HALOT </i>610-11 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1506;&#1462;&#1492;</font> 3; BDB 589 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1506;&#1462;&#1492;</font> 5). Most scholars suggest that the Beloved&#8217;s feelings of love were revived &#8211; a reversal of her feelings of indifference and apathy in 5:3. This is reflected in many translations which use equivalent English idioms: &#8220;the core of my being&#8221; (JB) and &#8220;my heart&#8221; (NIV, NJPS) over the woodenly literal &#8220;my bowels&#8221; (KJV, NEB, AV). On the other hand, the term is also used to refer to the procreative organs, both male (e.g., Gen 15:4; 2 Sam 7:12; 16:11; Isa 48:19; 2 Chr 32:21) and female (e.g., Gen 25:23; Ruth 1:11; Ps 71:6; Isa 49:1).

The Hebrew root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1502;&#1492;</font> is related to Aramaic <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1502;&#1488;</font> (&#8220;to roar; to be agitated&#8221;). The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> has a basic two-fold range of meanings: (1) literal: &#8220;to make a noise&#8221; of some kind and (2) figurative: &#8220;to be in commotion, uproar&#8221; (e.g., often associated with noise or a noisy crowd). The lexicons suggest six distinct categories: (1) &#8220;to make a noise&#8221; or &#8220;to be in commotion,&#8221; particularly by a tumultuous crowd (1 Kgs 1:41; Pss 39:7; 46:7; Prov 1:21; Is 22:2; Mic 2:12); (2) &#8220;to roar,&#8221; of the sea and sea-waves (Isa 17:12; 51:15; Jer 5:22; 6:23; 31:35; 50:42; 51:55; Ps 46:4); (3) &#8220;to make a sound,&#8221; e.g., bear growling (Isa 59:11), dog barking (Ps 59:7, 15), bird chirping (Ps 102:8), dove cooing (Ezek 7:16); (4) &#8220;to moan,&#8221; (Ps 39:7; 55:18; Prov 1:21; Lam 2:18; Ezek 7:16; Zech 9:15); (5) &#8220;to be turbulent, boisterous&#8221; (Prov 7:11; 9:13; 20:1; Zech 9:5); and (6) figuratively of the internal organs: &#8220;to murmur, be restless, be turbulent,&#8221; used in reference to pity (Isa 16:11; Jer 4:19; 31:20; 48:36), discouragement (Ps 42:6, 12; 43:5), and murmuring in prayer (Pss 55:18; 77:4) (<i>HALOT </i>250 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1502;&#1492;</font>; BDB 242 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font>). <i>HALOT</i> suggests &#8220;to be turbulent&#8221; for Song 5:4 (<i>HALOT </i>250 s.v. 4), while BDB suggests &#8220;the thrill of deep-felt compassion or sympathy&#8221; (BDB 242 s.v. 2). Commentators offer a spectrum of opinions from the Beloved feeling agitation, pity, compassion, sexual arousal, or a revival of her love for him. A survey of the translations reveals the same lack of consensus: &#8220;my bowels were moved for him&#8221; (KJV), &#8220;my bowels stirred within me&#8221; (NEB), &#8220;my heart was thrilled within me&#8221; (RSV), &#8220;I trembled to the core of my being&#8221; (JB), &#8220;my heart trembled within me&#8221; (NAB), &#8220;my heart was stirred for him&#8221; (JPS, NJPS), &#8220;my feelings were aroused for him&#8221; (NASB), and &#8220;my heart began to pound for him&#8221; (NIV). While the precise meaning may never be agreed upon, whatever she was feeling she roused herself from her indifferent apathetic inactivity to arise and open for her beloved in 5:5. The phrase is used similarly elsewhere in OT, rousing the subject to irresistible action (Jer 4:19). The simplest course of action is to nuance this term metonymically (cause for effect), e.g., &#8220;my feelings were stirred up for him.&#8221;</p>

Lane, <i>Arabic-English Dictionary, </i>311) and Akkadian <i>tilu</i> &#8220;hill, mound&#8221; (<i>AHw</i> 3:1358). On the other hand, <i>HALOT</i> suggests that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;</font> means &#8220;date-panicle&#8221; and that it is related to the Akkadian noun <i>taltallu</i> &#8220;pollen of date-palm&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 1741 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>). The term occurs in Mishnaic Hebrew as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;</font> &#8220;curls, locks&#8221; (Jastrow 1674 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;</font>). It is used in the same way in the Song. The form <i>tltl</i> is a reduplicated pattern used for adjectives denoting an intense characteristic (S. Moscati, <i>Comparative Grammar</i>, 78-79, §12.9-13). It functions as a predicate adjective to the subjective nominative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qutsotav</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;his locks of hair&#8221;).</p>
