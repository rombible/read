The optative particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mi</font>) with an imperfect expresses an unreal wish, e.g., Judg 9:29; 2 Sam 15:4; Mal 1:10. The construction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1504;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mi yittenka</font>) is an idiom expressing an unreal wish in the optative mood (<i>HALOT </i>575 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;</font>), e.g., &#8220;Would that it were evening&#8230;Would that it were morning!&#8221; (KJV) or &#8220;If only it were evening&#8230;If only it were morning!&#8221; (NIV) (Deut 28:67); &#8220;Oh that I knew where I might find him&#8221; (KJV, NASB, NJPS), &#8220;I wish I had known,&#8221; &#8220;If only I knew where to find him; if only I could go to his dwelling!&#8221; (NIV) (Job 23:3); &#8220;I wish that all the LORD&#8217;s people were prophets!&#8221; (NIV), &#8220;Would that all the LORD&#8217;s people were prophets&#8221; (NASB) (Num 11:29). Evidently, the LXX did not understand the idiom; it rendered the line in wooden literalness: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#932;&#943;&#962; &#948;&#8061;&#8131; &#963;&#949; &#7936;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#953;&#948;&#972;&#957; &#956;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Tis dwh se adelfidon mou,</font> &#8220;Who might give/make you as my brother?&#8221;).</p>

The simple juxtaposition of two verbal clauses without any grammatical indicator, such as <i>vav</i> or a conditional particle, is rather rare: &#8220;If you rebel (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;</font>,<font face="Scholar"> tim</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alu</font>), I will disperse you (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1508;&#1460;&#1497;&#1509;</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">afits</font>) among the nations&#8221; (Neh 1:8); &#8220;If I counted them (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1505;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1501;</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">esppÿrem</font>), they would be more numerous (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font>,<font face="Scholar"> yirbun</font>) than the sand!&#8221; (Ps 139:18); &#8220;If a man has found a wife (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font>,<font face="Scholar"> matsa</font>&#8217;), he has found (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font>) a good thing&#8221; (Prov 18:22) (Joüon 2:627 §167.a.1). On the other hand, LXX treated the imperfects as denoting future temporal sequence: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8017;&#961;&#959;&#8166;&#963;&#940; &#963;&#949; &#7954;&#958;&#969;</font>,<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> &#966;&#953;&#955;&#8053;&#963;&#969; &#963;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">eurousa se exw, filhsw se,</font> &#8220;I will find you outside, I will kiss you&#8221;). Ordinarily, however, <i>vav</i> or a temporal particle introduces a temporal clause (Joüon 2:627 §167.a; GKC 502 §164.<i>d</i>). The English translation tradition generally adopts the conditional nuance: &#8220;If I found you outdoors, I would kiss you&#8221; (NASB), &#8220;Then, if I found you outside, I would kiss you&#8221; (NIV). However, a few translations adopt the temporal nuance: &#8220;When I should find thee without, I would kiss thee&#8221; (KJV), &#8220;Then I could kiss you when I met you in the street&#8221; (NJPS).</p>

<a name="5"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=282><b>sn</b> Song 8:1-2 may be classified as a &#8220;a lover&#8217;s wish song&#8221; that is similar in content and structure to an ancient Egyptian love song in which the lover longs for greater intimacy with his beloved: &#8220;I wish I were her Negro maid who follows at her feet; then the skin of all her limbs would be revealed to me. I wish I were her washerman, if only for a month; then I would be [entranced], washing out the Moringa oils in her diaphanous garments. I wish I were the seal ring, the guardian of her [fingers]; then [&#8230;]&#8221; (The Cairo Love Songs, 25-27, in W. K. Simpson, ed., <i>The Literature of Ancient Egypt</i>, 311). The Egyptian and Hebrew parallels display a similar structure: (1) introductory expression of the lover&#8217;s wish to be something/someone in a position of physical closeness with the Beloved; (2) description of the person/thing that is physically close to the Beloved; and (3) concluding description of the resultant greater degree of intimacy with the Beloved. In the Egyptian parallel it is the man who longs for greater closeness; in the Hebrew song it is the woman. The Egyptian love song borders on the sensual; the Hebrew love song is simply romantic. The Beloved expresses her desire for greater freedom to display her affection for Solomon. In ancient Near Eastern cultures the public display of affection between a man and woman was frowned upon &#8211; sometimes even punished. For example, in Assyrian laws the punishment for a man kissing a woman in public was to cut off his upper lip. On the other hand, public displays of affection between children and between family members were allowed. Accordingly, the Beloved hyperbolically wished that she and Solomon were children from the same family so she could kiss him anytime she wished without fear of punishment or censure.</p>

The LXX variant probably arose due to: (1) the syntactical awkwardness of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1461;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8220;she taught me&#8221; or &#8220;she will teach me&#8221;), (2) the perceived need for a parallel to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514; &#1488;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8220;to the house of my mother&#8221;), and (3) the influence of Song 3:4 which reads: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1492;&#1458;&#1489;&#1461;&#1497;&#1488;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;&#1493; &#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514; &#1488;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497; &#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1500; &#1495;&#1462;&#1491;&#1462;&#1512; &#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ad-sheheve</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">tiv </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el-bet </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">immi vÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el kheder horati</font>, &#8220;until I brought him to the house of my mother, to the chamber of the one who bore me&#8221;). The MT reading should be adopted because (1) it is the more difficult reading, (2) it best explains the origin of the LXX variant, and (3) the origin of the LXX variant is easily understood in the light of Song 3:4.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1461;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tÿlammÿdeni</font>) may be rendered in two basic ways: (1) future action: &#8220;she will teach me&#8221; or more likely as (2) past customary action: &#8220;who would instruct me&#8221; (KJV), &#8220;who used to instruct me&#8221; (NASB), &#8220;she who has taught me&#8221; (NIV), &#8220;she who taught me&#8221; (NJPS). This is an example of <i>casus</i> <i>pendus</i> in which the subject of the verb serves as a relative pronoun to the antecedent noun (&#8220;my mother&#8221;). The JPS parses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1461;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> as 2nd person masculine singular (&#8220;that you might instruct me&#8221;) rather than 3rd person feminine singular (&#8220;she would teach me&#8221;). However, this would obscure the imagery: The Beloved wished that Solomon was her little brother still nursing on her mother&#8217;s breast. The Beloved, who had learned from her mother&#8217;s example, would bring him inside their home and she would give him her breast: &#8220;I would give you spiced wine to drink, the nectar of my pomegranates.&#8221; </p>

This wordplay draws attention to the unity of her &#8220;wish song&#8221; in 8:1-2. In 8:1 the Beloved expresses her desire to kiss Solomon on the lips when they are outdoors; while in 8:2 she expresses her desire for Solomon to kiss her breasts when they are in the privacy of her home indoors.</p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=287><b>sn</b> This statement is a euphemism: the Beloved wished to give her breasts to Solomon, like a mother would give her breast to her nursing baby.

The Beloved, who had learned from her mother&#8217;s example, would bring him inside their home and she would give him her breast: &#8220;I would give you spiced wine to drink, the nectar of my pomegranates.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;my pomegranates&#8221; is a euphemism for her breasts.

Throughout the Song, the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (&#8220;vineyard&#8221;) is used figuratively (Song 1:6; 2:15; 8:12). In 8:12 it is used in reference to either (1) herself, (2) her choice of whom to give herself to in love, or (3) her physical body. In contrast to Solomon&#8217;s physical vineyard, whose fruit can be bought and sold (8:11), she is not for sale: She will only give herself freely to the one whom she chooses to love.</p>
<a name="41"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=318><b>tn</b> Each of the three terms in this line has the 1st person common singular suffix which is repeated three times for emphasis: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">karmi</font>, &#8220;my vineyard&#8221;), <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1500;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shelli</font>, &#8220;which belongs to me&#8221;), and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1508;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿfana</font>, &#8220;at my disposal&#8221;). In contrast to King Solomon, who owns the vineyard at Baal-Hamon and who can buy and sell anything in the vineyard that he wishes, she proclaims that her &#8220;vineyard&#8221; (= herself or her body) belongs to her alone. In contrast to the vineyard, which can be leased out, and its fruit, which can be bought or sold, her &#8220;vineyard&#8221; is not for sale. Her love must and is to be freely given.</p>

Similar to Akkadian <i>ana</i> <i>pan</i> &#8220;at the disposal of&#8221; (<i>AHw</i> 2:821.a, paragraph 20), the term is used in reference to a sovereign (usually a land-owner or king) who has full power over his property to dispose of as he wishes, e.g., &#8220;The whole country is at your disposal [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1508;&#1464;&#1504;&#1462;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</font>,<font face="Scholar"> lÿfaneka</font>]&#8221; (Gen 13:9).
