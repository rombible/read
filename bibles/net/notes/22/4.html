<a name="1"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=151><b>sn</b> Song 4:1-7 is often compared to ancient Near Eastern <i>wasfs</i> songs sung by the groom to his new bride, praising her beauty from head to foot. Examples have been found in Egyptian, Syrian, Sumerian, and Arabic love literature. The wasfs song is a poetic celebration by the groom of his bride&#8217;s physical beauty. The typical form has three parts: (1) introductory words by the wedding guests, (2) invitation by the bride to the groom to celebrate her physical beauty, and (3) the groom&#8217;s poetic comparative praise of his bride&#8217;s beauty from head to foot &#8211; comprising the bulk of the song. The groom&#8217;s praise typically is characterized by three movements: (1) introductory summary praise of his bride&#8217;s beauty, (2) lengthy and detailed figurative description of her physical beauty, and (3) concluding summary praise which reiterates the introductory words of the song. Although the introductory words of the wedding guests and the invitation by the bride are absent, the form of the Lover&#8217;s praise of his bride is identical, as are the types of comparative praise. His song falls into the same three movements: (1) introductory summary praise of his bride&#8217;s beauty in 4:1a, (2) lengthy and detailed figurative description of her beauty in 4:1b-6, and (3) concluding summary praise in 4:7. See K&amp;D 18:174-76; S. Krauss, &#8220;The Archaeological Background of Some Passages in the Song of Songs,&#8221; <i>JQR</i> 32 (1941-42): 125.</p>

<a name="4"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=154><b>sn</b> The expression &#8220;your eyes [are] doves&#8221; is a metaphor (implied comparison). Like most of the other metaphors in 4:1-7, this is probably a comparison of sight rather than sense: (1) the shape of a woman&#8217;s eyes, especially in Egyptian art, resemble the shape of a dove, and (2) the white color of the eyeballs resemble the white color of a dove&#8217;s body. On the other hand, many Jewish and Christian interpreters have suggested that this is a comparison of sense, usually suggesting that the dove is a symbol for purity and that the eyes of a person are the windows of their soul or character, that is, the bride has a pure character as can be seen through her eyes.</p>

Klein, <i>Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the Hebrew Language</i>, 102). Earlier lexicons suggested the meanings &#8220;to sit, sit up, recline&#8221; (BDB 167 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font>). The Hebrew root is probably related to Arabic <i>jalasa</i> &#8220;to go up, to go down, sit up&#8221; (<i>HALOT </i>195).</p>

The metaphor describing the beautiful teeth of the bride probably pictures freshly washed sheep rather than freshly watered sheep. He praises his bride&#8217;s teeth by comparing them to freshly washed sheep. In the ancient Near East it was customary to wash sheep before shearing them. The picture of freshly washed sheep depicts the whiteness of the bride&#8217;s teeth. </p>

The Talmud suggests that the term refers to Jerusalem as the hill (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1500;</font>) to which all mouths (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;</font>) turn (<i>b.Berakhot</i> 30a).

This is reflected in several translations: &#8220;armoury&#8221; (KJV, AV, ASV), &#8220;arsenal&#8221; (RSV), and &#8220;fortress&#8221; (JB). The noun may be related to the Arabic root <i>tlp</i> (&#8220;to perish&#8221;) in a metonymical sense: &#8220;a cause of perishing,&#8221; i.e., a weapon. The Hebrew Piel verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tillef</font>)<font face="Scholar"> </font>means &#8220;to hang up for display,&#8221; thus NEB suggests that it is derived from <i>lpy</i> which means &#8220;to arrange in courses,&#8221; i.e., &#8220;layered,&#8221; as a reference to the Bride&#8217;s layered necklace she wears. The NIV nuances it as &#8220;with elegance&#8221; and NEB &#8220;winding courses.&#8221; Perles connects <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> to Akkadian <i>tilpanu</i> (&#8220;bow&#8221;), while Haupt connects the word with the Shaphel stem of the Akkadian<br> <i>labu</i> (&#8220;to fortify&#8221;). Honeyman suggests that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> is a feminine plural noun of the <i>taqtilat</i> nominal pattern from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1508;&#1497;</font> which means &#8220;to arrange in courses.&#8221; <i>HALOT</i> notes that the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497; &#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">banu lÿtalpiyyot</font>) has been rendered in several ways: (1) &#8220;built with turrets,&#8221; (2) &#8220;built with siege-towers,&#8221; (3) &#8220;built in rows (of stones)&#8221; or &#8220;built in terraces.&#8221; Haupt and Krauss suggest that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;</font> denotes &#8220;constructed for siege-towers&#8221; or &#8220;built for an armory.&#8221; Honeyman suggests that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> is a feminine plural noun with a standard nominative prefix <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;</font> and is derived from the verbal root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1508;&#1488;</font> (&#8220;to arrange in stones&#8221;). Probably, the best solution is to relate this Hebrew root to Akkadian <i>lapu</i> (&#8220;to surround, enclose&#8221;), Arabic <i>laffa</i> or <i>lifafah</i> (&#8220;to envelope&#8221;), and Aramaic <i>lpp</i> and <i>lp</i>&#8217; (&#8220;to interlace, entwine, plait&#8221;). This is the simplest solution and does not demand emending the text. The preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿ</font>) could denote &#8220;in respect to&#8221; and the colon <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497; &#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> could be translated &#8220;built in rows (of stones)&#8221; or &#8220;built in terraces.&#8221; Thus, the phrase &#8220;built in rows of stones&#8221; refers to the outer walls of a tower built in spiraling rows of stones or built in terraces. This is a comparison of sight: (1) her neck was long and symmetrical or (2) she was wearing a strand of beads or necklaces wrapped around her neck like a tower built in spiraling rows of stones.

<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=161><b>tn</b> Scholars debate whether this refers to (1) the interior walls of a tower upon which warriors would hang their shields when not in use or (2) the external upper wall of a military fortress upon which warriors would hang their shields to add to their protection during battle. A few scholars suggest that what is pictured here are the internal walls of the tower and, on the basis of Ezek 27:10-11, posit that in the ancient world there was a practice in which mercenaries, who had joined themselves to a king, would hang their shields upon his fortress wall as a sign of their allegiance. Following Crim, Deere suggests, &#8220;the custom of hanging shields on the tower was symbolic of the warriors&#8217; allegiance to and valor for a particular king.&#8221; Crim suggests that the point of comparison of his praise would be something similar to what follows: &#8220;Just as the fame of Tyre in Ezek. 27:11 attracted mercenaries, the fame of the tower of David has attracted soldiers to come and enter its service. The shields hanging there show that they have given their allegiance to the tower. Your neck is like that tower. It is so beautiful that it could win the allegiance of a thousand heroic soldiers.&#8221; We would then translate something like this: &#8220;Your neck attracts men as the tower of David attracts warriors. A thousand heroic soldiers would swear allegiance to your beauty.&#8221; J. S. Deere suggests that the point of the comparison is that the bride&#8217;s neck was so beautiful and majestic that mighty warriors from near and far would have given their allegiance to her&#8230;It is as if he were saying that these soldiers would be willing to surrender their shields to her beauty. On the other hand, most scholars suggest that it refers to the common practice in the ancient Near East of lining the top wall of a military fortress tower with shields, behind which the soldiers could stand for protection leaving both hands free for bow and arrows (Note: It is possible to view Ezek 27:10-11 and 2 Chr 32:5 in this manner). This is supported by ancient Near Eastern art which pictures such a practice, especially by the relief of Sennacherib&#8217;s siege of Lachish which shows the top wall of Lachish lined with shields. <i>The Illustrated Family Encyclopedia of the Living Bible</i>, 10:56, notes: &#8220;The art of the ancient East often shows us the shields that were, in time of war, set in position on the towers of the city walls, so that defenders could safely fire arrows and hurl stones while standing upright behind them.&#8221; Those who see this as the imagery all agree that the point of comparison is to jeweled necklaces with pendants which could be compared to shields, as in 1:10-11 (A. Robert, T. J. Meek, G. Gerlemann, A. M. Honeyman, B. S. J. Isserlin, J. McKenzie). McKenzie expresses this view when he posits that she was wearing jewelry around her neck and that this was being compared to the shields hung around this military tower: &#8220;One of the many physical charms that the Beloved finds in his mistress (Song of Sol. 4:1-4) is her long neck which, with its stately poise, reminds him of the lofty tower of David. Just as this tower is hung all round with shields placed there by mighty men of valor, so is his mistress&#8217; neck adorned with chains and strings of jewels. This is supported by the fact that 4:9 explicitly mentions a necklace with a multitude of jewels in it which she was wearing at this time. And Isserlin suggests that the complete image in view fits the evidence of both ancient Near Eastern military towers and jewelry which has been recovered archaeologically: &#8220;It seems to the present writer that a reading of the verse&#8230;can be taken to refer to the presence not of one, but two elements on the tower: there is the coursed masonry, and on top of it there are the shields. If we keep the idea that a multiple necklace is alluded to, then this should be made up of two kinds of elements: on top there should be a series of beads resembling round shields; below we should find something resembling either the short or the long side of building stones (according to whether the masonry is laid in headers or stretchers). Can necklaces of this type be found in the ancient Near East? It seems to the writer that the well-known sculpture from Arsos in Cyprus (Pl. VI) represents just this type of necklace. The upper beads do look like a row of round shields, as shown on the tower in the relief slab representing Sennacherib&#8217;s siege of Lachish, while the lower elements do evoke roughly bossed headers, as found in ancient Palestinian defence works&#8221; (B. S. J. Isserlin, <i>The Israelites</i>, 59, and plate VI). Composite necklaces such as this one might be referred to in Prov 1:9. In any case, it is quite unlikely that the point of comparison was that she had a large, muscular neck, as some have suggested (M. Jastrow, L. Waterman, and R. Gordis). See A. M. Honeyman, &#8220;Two Contributions to Canaanite Toponymy,&#8221; <i>JTS</i> 50 (1949): 51; B. S. J. Isserlin, &#8220;Song of Songs IV, 4: An Archaeological Note,&#8221; <i>PEQ</i> 90 (1958): 59-61; <i>The Illustrated Family Encyclopedia of the Living Bible</i>, 10:56; K. R.

<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=163><b>tn</b> The Piel denominative verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1489;&#1489;</font> is derived from the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1461;&#1489;&#1464;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">levav</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;heart&#8221;), and occurs only here. Its meaning is debated: (1) metonymical sense: &#8220;you have encouraged me,&#8221; that is, given me heart (BDB 525 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1461;&#1489;</font>; AV, RSV); (2) intensive sense: &#8220;you have made my heart beat faster&#8221; (KBL 471 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1489;&#1489;</font>); and (3) privative sense: &#8220;you have ravished my heart&#8221; or &#8220;you have stolen my heart&#8221; (<i>HALOT </i>515 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1489;&#1489;</font>; GKC 141-42 §52.<i>h</i>) (NIV). While the Niphal stem has a metonymical nuance (cause for effect): to get heart, that is, to get understanding (Job 11:12), the Piel stem may have a privative nuance: to take away heart, that is, to take away the senses. Her beauty was so overwhelming that it robbed him of his senses (e.g., Hos 4:11). This is paralleled by a modern Palestinian love song: &#8220;She stood opposite me and deprived me of reason (literally, &#8220;took my heart&#8221;), your dark eyes slew me while I was singing, your eyebrows drove shame from me&#8230;the darkness of your eyes have slain me; O one clad in purple clothes, it is worthwhile falling in love with you, for your eyes are black and sparkle, and have slain me indeed.&#8221; Less likely is the proposal of Waldeman who relates this to Akkadian <i>lababu</i> (&#8220;to rage, be aroused to fury&#8221;), suggesting that Song 4:9 means &#8220;to become passionately aroused&#8221; or &#8220;to be aroused sexually.&#8221; See S. H. Stephan, &#8220;Modern Palestinian Parallels to the Song of Songs,&#8221; <i>JPOS</i> 2 (1922): 13; R. Gordis, <i>Song of Songs and Lamentations</i>, 85-86; N. M.

<a name="14"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=164><b>sn</b> It is clear from Song 8:1 that the young man and his bride were not physical brother and sister, yet he addresses his bride as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1495;&#1465;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akhoti</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;my sister&#8221;) several times (4:9, 10, 12; 5:1). This probably reflects any one of several ancient Near Eastern customs: (1) The appellatives &#8220;my sister&#8221; and &#8220;my brother&#8221; were both commonly used in ancient Near Eastern love literature as figurative descriptions of two lovers. For instance, in a Ugaritic poem when Anat tried to seduce Aqhat, she says, &#8220;Hear, O hero Aqhat, you are my brother and I your sister&#8221; (Aqhat 18 i. 24). In the OT Apocrypha husband and wife are referred to several times as &#8220;brother&#8221; and &#8220;sister&#8221; (Add Esth 15:9; Tob 5:20; 7:16). This &#8220;sister-wife&#8221; motif might be behind Paul&#8217;s perplexing statement about a &#8220;sister-wife&#8221; (1 Cor 9:5). (2) In several Mesopotamian societies husbands actually could legally adopt their wives for a variety of reasons. For instance, in Hurrian society husbands in the upper classes sometimes adopted their wives as &#8220;sisters&#8221; in order to form the strongest of all possible marriage bonds; a man could divorce his wife but he could not divorce his &#8220;sister&#8221; because she was &#8220;family.&#8221; At Nuzi a husband could adopt his wife to give her a higher status in society.

However, in Sumero-Akkadian literature the term &#8220;eye&#8221; sometimes refers to the eye-stone of a necklace. Agate-stones were cut so that white stripes appeared around the black or brown core to look like the pupil on the eye. M. H. Pope (<i>Song of Songs</i> [AB], 482-83) suggests that the parallelism between the A and B lines suggests the following: &#8220;with one of your eye-stones&#8221; and &#8220;with one jewel of your necklace.&#8221; See W.

The Babylonian term <i>pardesu</i> means &#8220;marvelous garden,&#8221; in reference to the enclosed parks of the kings (<i>AHw</i> 2:833.a and 3:1582.a).
