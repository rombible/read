<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=165><b>tn</b> Alternately, &#8220;eye-stone [of your necklace].&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1504;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">inayikh</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;your eyes&#8221;) probably refers to her physical eyes (e.g., 4:1). However, in Sumero-Akkadian literature the term &#8220;eye&#8221; sometimes refers to the eye-stone of a necklace. Agate-stones were cut so that white stripes appeared around the black or brown core to look like the pupil on the eye. M. H. Pope (<i>Song of Songs</i> [AB], 482-83) suggests that the parallelism between the A and B lines suggests the following: &#8220;with one of your eye-stones&#8221; and &#8220;with one jewel of your necklace.&#8221; See W. G. Lambert, &#8220;An Eye Stone of Esarhaddon&#8217;s Queen and Other Similar Gems,&#8221; <i>RA</i> 63 (1969): 65-71.</p>
