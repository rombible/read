<a name="14"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=164><b>sn</b> It is clear from Song 8:1 that the young man and his bride were not physical brother and sister, yet he addresses his bride as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1495;&#1465;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akhoti</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;my sister&#8221;) several times (4:9, 10, 12; 5:1). This probably reflects any one of several ancient Near Eastern customs: (1) The appellatives &#8220;my sister&#8221; and &#8220;my brother&#8221; were both commonly used in ancient Near Eastern love literature as figurative descriptions of two lovers. For instance, in a Ugaritic poem when Anat tried to seduce Aqhat, she says, &#8220;Hear, O hero Aqhat, you are my brother and I your sister&#8221; (Aqhat 18 i. 24). In the OT Apocrypha husband and wife are referred to several times as &#8220;brother&#8221; and &#8220;sister&#8221; (Add Esth 15:9; Tob 5:20; 7:16). This &#8220;sister-wife&#8221; motif might be behind Paul&#8217;s perplexing statement about a &#8220;sister-wife&#8221; (1 Cor 9:5). (2) In several Mesopotamian societies husbands actually could legally adopt their wives for a variety of reasons. For instance, in Hurrian society husbands in the upper classes sometimes adopted their wives as &#8220;sisters&#8221; in order to form the strongest of all possible marriage bonds; a man could divorce his wife but he could not divorce his &#8220;sister&#8221; because she was &#8220;family.&#8221; At Nuzi a husband could adopt his wife to give her a higher status in society.
