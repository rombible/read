<a name="1"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=151><b>sn</b> Song 4:1-7 is often compared to ancient Near Eastern <i>wasfs</i> songs sung by the groom to his new bride, praising her beauty from head to foot. Examples have been found in Egyptian, Syrian, Sumerian, and Arabic love literature. The wasfs song is a poetic celebration by the groom of his bride&#8217;s physical beauty. The typical form has three parts: (1) introductory words by the wedding guests, (2) invitation by the bride to the groom to celebrate her physical beauty, and (3) the groom&#8217;s poetic comparative praise of his bride&#8217;s beauty from head to foot &#8211; comprising the bulk of the song. The groom&#8217;s praise typically is characterized by three movements: (1) introductory summary praise of his bride&#8217;s beauty, (2) lengthy and detailed figurative description of her physical beauty, and (3) concluding summary praise which reiterates the introductory words of the song. Although the introductory words of the wedding guests and the invitation by the bride are absent, the form of the Lover&#8217;s praise of his bride is identical, as are the types of comparative praise. His song falls into the same three movements: (1) introductory summary praise of his bride&#8217;s beauty in 4:1a, (2) lengthy and detailed figurative description of her beauty in 4:1b-6, and (3) concluding summary praise in 4:7. See K&amp;D 18:174-76; S. Krauss, &#8220;The Archaeological Background of Some Passages in the Song of Songs,&#8221; <i>JQR</i> 32 (1941-42): 125.</p>
