<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=163><b>tn</b> The Piel denominative verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1489;&#1489;</font> is derived from the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1461;&#1489;&#1464;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">levav</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;heart&#8221;), and occurs only here. Its meaning is debated: (1) metonymical sense: &#8220;you have encouraged me,&#8221; that is, given me heart (BDB 525 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1461;&#1489;</font>; AV, RSV); (2) intensive sense: &#8220;you have made my heart beat faster&#8221; (KBL 471 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1489;&#1489;</font>); and (3) privative sense: &#8220;you have ravished my heart&#8221; or &#8220;you have stolen my heart&#8221; (<i>HALOT </i>515 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1489;&#1489;</font>; GKC 141-42 §52.<i>h</i>) (NIV). While the Niphal stem has a metonymical nuance (cause for effect): to get heart, that is, to get understanding (Job 11:12), the Piel stem may have a privative nuance: to take away heart, that is, to take away the senses. Her beauty was so overwhelming that it robbed him of his senses (e.g., Hos 4:11). This is paralleled by a modern Palestinian love song: &#8220;She stood opposite me and deprived me of reason (literally, &#8220;took my heart&#8221;), your dark eyes slew me while I was singing, your eyebrows drove shame from me&#8230;the darkness of your eyes have slain me; O one clad in purple clothes, it is worthwhile falling in love with you, for your eyes are black and sparkle, and have slain me indeed.&#8221; Less likely is the proposal of Waldeman who relates this to Akkadian <i>lababu</i> (&#8220;to rage, be aroused to fury&#8221;), suggesting that Song 4:9 means &#8220;to become passionately aroused&#8221; or &#8220;to be aroused sexually.&#8221; See S. H. Stephan, &#8220;Modern Palestinian Parallels to the Song of Songs,&#8221; <i>JPOS</i> 2 (1922): 13; R. Gordis, <i>Song of Songs and Lamentations</i>, 85-86; N. M. Waldman, &#8220;A Note on Canticles 4:9,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 89 (1970): 215-17; H. W. Wolff, <i>Anthropology of the Old Testament</i>, 40-58.</p>
