<a name="16"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=129><b>sn</b> There is debate about the reason why the woman brought her beloved to her mother&#8217;s house. Campbell notes that the mother&#8217;s house is sometimes referred to as the place where marital plans were made (Gen 24:28; Ruth 1:8). Some suggest, then, that the woman here was unusually bold and took the lead in proposing marriage plans with her beloved. This approach emphasizes that the marriage plans in 3:4 are followed by the royal wedding procession (3:6-11) and the wedding night (4:1-5:1). On the other hand, others suggest that the parallelism of &#8220;house of my mother&#8221; and &#8220;chamber of she who conceived me&#8221; focuses on the bedroom of her mother&#8217;s house. Fields suggests that her desire was to make love to her beloved in the very bedroom chambers where she herself was conceived, to complete the cycle of life/love. If this is the idea, it would provide a striking parallel to a similar picture in 8:5 in which the woman exults that they had made love in the very location where her beloved had been conceived: &#8220;Under the apple tree I aroused you; it was there your mother conceived you, there she who bore you conceived you.&#8221;</p>
