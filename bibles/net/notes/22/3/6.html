<a name="6"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=119><b>tc</b> The LXX adds &#8220;I called him but he did not answer me&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#940;&#955;&#949;&#963;&#945; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#972;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#959;&#8016;&#967; &#8017;&#960;&#8053;&#954;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#941;&#957; &#956;&#959;&#965;</font>,<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> </font><font face="Greektl">ekalesa auton kai ouc Juphkousen</font>) to 3:2d on the basis of its appearance in the parallel expressions in Song 5:6. There is no textual support for its inclusion here.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;but I did not find him.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">matsa</font>&#8217;,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;to find&#8221;) normally describes discovering the whereabouts of something/someone who is lost or whose presence is not known. It is clear in 3:1 that the Beloved was not taking a physically active role in looking all around for him, because she stayed in her bed all night long during this time. Therefore, the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (&#8220;to find&#8221;) must be nuanced metonymically in terms of him appearing to her. It does not denote &#8220;finding&#8221; him physically, but visually; that is, if and when he would arrive at her bedside, she would &#8220;find&#8221; him. This might allude to her request in 2:17 for him to rendezvous with her to make love to her all night long (&#8220;until the day breathes and the shadows flee&#8221;). Despite the fact that she was waiting for him all night long, he never appeared (3:1). The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (&#8220;to find&#8221;) is repeated four times in 3:1-4, paralleling the four-fold repetition of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">baqash</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;to seek&#8221;). This antithetical word-pair creates a strong and dramatic contrast.</p>
