<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=124><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;those who go around the city&#8221; or &#8220;those who go around in the city.&#8221; The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1505;&#1468;&#1465;&#1489;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hassovÿvim ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ir</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;those who go around the city&#8221;) probably refers to the watchmen of the city walls rather than night city street patrol (e.g., Ps 127:1; Song 5:7; Isa 21:11; 62:6). The Israelite night watchmen of the walls is paralleled by the Akkadian <i>sahir duri</i> (&#8220;one who goes around the wall&#8221;) which appears in a lexical text as the equivalent of <i>ma</i>-<i>sar</i> <i>musi</i> (&#8220;night watchman&#8221;) (<i>CAD</i> 4:192). See M. H. Pope, <i>Song of Songs</i> (AB), 419. There is a wordplay in 3:2-3 between the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1505;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">va</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asovÿvah</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;I will go about&#8221;) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1505;&#1468;&#1465;&#1489;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hassovÿvim</font>, &#8220;those who go around&#8221;). This wordplay draws attention to the ironic similarity between the woman&#8217;s action and the action of the city&#8217;s watchmen. Ironically, she failed to find her beloved as she went around in the city, but the city watchmen found her. Rather than finding the one she was looking for, she was found.</p>
