<a name="3"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=116><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I sought&#8230;.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">baqash</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;to seek&#8221;) denotes the attempt to physically find someone (e.g., 1 Sam 13:14; 16:16; 28:7; 1 Kgs 1:2-3; Isa 40:20; Ezek 22:30; Esth 2:2; Job 10:6; Prov 18:1) (<i>HALOT </i>152 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;</font>). However, it is clear in 3:1 that this &#8220;search&#8221; took place upon her bed. It does not make sense in the context that the Beloved was looking around in her bed to find her lover &#8211; how big could her bed be that she had lost him? Rather, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (&#8220;to seek&#8221;) is used metonymically to reference to her longing for her absent lover, that is, seeking in the sense of anticipation. The perfect tense should be classified as a past constantive action, describing a past action which covered an extended period of time, as indicated by the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ballelot</font>, plural of extension, &#8220;all night long&#8221;) in 3:1. This continual action is emphasized by the four-fold repetition of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (&#8220;seek&#8221;) in 3:1-2.</p>
