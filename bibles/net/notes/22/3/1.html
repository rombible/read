<a name="1"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=114><b>tn</b> Alternately, &#8220;at night&#8221; or &#8220;night after night.&#8221; The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ballelot</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>plural of &#8220;night&#8221;) functions as an adverbial accusative of time. The plural form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">laylah</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;night&#8221;) can be classified in several ways: (1) plural of number: &#8220;night after night&#8221; (NASB, NEB); (2) plural of extension: &#8220;all night long&#8221; (NIV); (3) plural of composition: &#8220;by night&#8221; (KJV) and &#8220;at night&#8221; (NJPS); or (4) plural of intensity: &#8220;during the blackest night.&#8221; The plural of extension (&#8220;all night long&#8221;) is supported by (1) the four-fold repetition of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">baqash</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;to seek&#8221;) in 3:1-2 which emphasizes that the Beloved was continually looking for her lover all night long, (2) her decision to finally arise in the middle of the night to look for him in 3:2-4, and (3) her request in the immediately preceding verse (2:17) that he make love to her all night long: &#8220;until the day breathes and the shadows flee&#8230;.&#8221; One should note, however, that the plural <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> occurs in 3:8 where it is a plural of composition: &#8220;by night&#8221; (NJPS) or &#8220;of the night&#8221; (NASB, NIV) or &#8220;in the night&#8221; (KJV).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The use of the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ballelot</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;night&#8221;) in 3:1 stands in striking contrast to the use of the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hayyom</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;the day&#8221;) in 2:17 which is the preceding verse. In 2:17 the woman invited her beloved to make love to her all night long; however, in 3:1 she recounts a nightmarish experience in which she was unable to find her beloved next to her in bed. Scholars debate whether 3:1-4 recounts a nightmare-like dream sequence or a real-life experience. There are striking parallels between 3:1-4 and 5:2-8 which also raises the possibility of a nightmare-like dream sequence.</p>
