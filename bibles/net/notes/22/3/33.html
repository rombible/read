<a name="33"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=146><b>tn</b> The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">argaman</font>, &#8220;purple fabric&#8221;) is a loanword from Hittite <i>argaman</i> &#8220;tribute,&#8221; which is reflected in Akkadian <i>argamannu</i> &#8220;purple&#8221; (also &#8220;tribute&#8221; under Hittite influence), Ugaritic <i>argmn</i> &#8220;tax, purple,&#8221; and Aramaic <i>argwn</i> &#8220;purple&#8221; (<i>HALOT </i>84 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1503;</font>). The Hebrew term refers to wool dyed with red purple (<i>BRL2</i> 153; <i>HALOT </i>84). It is used in reference to purple threads (Exod 35:25; 39:3; Esth 1:9) or purple cloth (Num 4:13; Judg 8:26; Esth 8:15; Prov 31:22; Jer 10:9; Song 3:10). Purple cloth and fabrics were costly (Ezek 27:7, 16) and were commonly worn by kings as a mark of their royal position (Judg 8:26). Thus, this was a sedan-chair fit for a king. KJV and NIV render it simply as &#8220;purple,&#8221; NASB as &#8220;purple fabric,&#8221; and NJPS &#8220;purple wool.&#8221;</p>
