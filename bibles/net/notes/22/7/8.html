<a name="8"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=254><b>sn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1494;&#1462;&#1490;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mazeg</font>, &#8220;mixed wine&#8221;) does not refer to wine mixed with water to dilute its potency, but to strong wine mixed with weaker wine. The practice of mixing wine with water is not attested in the Hebrew Bible. Both <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1494;&#1462;&#1490;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mesekh</font>) refer to strong wine mixed with weaker wine. The rabbis later distinguished between the two, stating that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1494;&#1462;&#1490;</font> was strong wine mixed with weak wine, while <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> was wine mixed with water (Aboda Zara 58b). However, both types of wine were intoxicating. Mixed wine was the most intoxicating type of wine. In a midrash on the Book of Numbers a comment is made about the practice of mixing strong wine with weaker wine (e.g., Isa 5:22; Prov 23:30), stating its purpose: &#8220;They used to mix strong wine with weak wine so as to get drunk with it&#8221; (<i>Num. Rab.</i> 10:8). See J. P. Brown, &#8220;The Mediterranean Vocabulary of Wine,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 19 (1969): 154. The comparison of a wife&#8217;s sexual love to intoxicating wine is common in ancient Near Eastern love literature. Parallel in thought are the words of the Hebrew sage, &#8220;May your fountain be blessed and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth. A loving doe, a graceful deer &#8211; may her love (or breasts) always intoxicate you, may you ever stagger like a drunkard in her love&#8221; (Prov 5:18-19).</p>
