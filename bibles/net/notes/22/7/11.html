<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=257><b>tn</b> Alternately, &#8220;the ivory tower.&#8221; The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hashshen</font>, &#8220;ivory&#8221;) is a genitive of composition, that is, a tower made out of ivory. Solomon had previously compared her neck to a tower (Song 4:4). In both cases the most obvious point of comparison has to do with size and shape, that is, her neck was long and symmetrical. Archaeology has never found a tower overlaid with ivory in the ancient Near East and it is doubtful that there ever was such a tower. The point of comparison might simply be that the shape of her neck looks like a tower, while the color and smoothness of her neck was like ivory. Solomon is mixing metaphors: her neck was long and symmetrical like a tower; but also elegant, smooth, and beautiful as ivory. The beauty, elegance, and smoothness of a woman&#8217;s neck is commonly compared to ivory in ancient love literature. For example, in a piece of Greek love literature, Anacron compared the beauty of the neck of his beloved Bathyllus to ivory (Ode xxxix 28-29).</p>
