<a name="5"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=251><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shorer</font>) is a <i>hapax legomenon</i>, appearing in the OT only here. There is debate whether it means &#8220;navel&#8221; or &#8220;vulva&#8221;: (1) Lys and Pope suggest that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1512;</font> is related to Arabic <i>srr</i> (&#8220;secret place, pudenda, coition, fornication&#8221;). They suggest that this is contextually supported by three factors: (a) His descriptive praise of her is in ascending order, beginning with her feet and concluding with her hair. The movement from her thighs (7:1b), to her vulva (7:2a), and then to her waist (7:2b) would fit this. (b) The descriptive comparison to a glass of wine would be grotesque if her navel were in view &#8211; her navel was moist or filled with liquid? &#8211; but appropriate if her vulva were in view. (c) The navel would be a somewhat synonymous reference to the belly which is already denoted by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1496;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bitnekh</font>, &#8220;belly&#8221;) in the following line. Because 7:1-7 does not use synonymous parallelism, the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1512;</font> would have to refer to something other than the belly. (2) The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1512;</font> denotes &#8220;navel&#8221;: (a) It may be related to the bi-consonantal noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shor</font>, &#8220;navel, umbilical cord&#8221;) (Prov 3:8; Ezek 16:4). (b) Mishnaic Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sharar</font>) denotes &#8220;navel, umbilical cord&#8221; (Jastrow 1634 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1512;</font>). For example, in a midrash on the Book of Numbers, the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1512;</font> appears in an allusion to Song 7:3 to justify the seating of the Sanhedrin in the middle of the synagogue: &#8220;As the navel (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1512;</font>) is placed in the centre of the body, so are the Sanhedrin&#8230;&#8221; (<i>Num. Rab.</i> 1:4). On the other hand, the meaning &#8220;vulva&#8221; never appears in Mishnaic Hebrew. Therefore, apart from this disputed usage there is no evidence that this term was ever used in this manner in Hebrew. (c) Rather than <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1512;</font> being related to Arabic <i>sirr</i> (&#8220;pudenda&#8221;), it could just as easily be related to the Arabic noun <i>surr</i> &#8220;navel.&#8221; It is methodologically more sound to define <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1512;</font> as &#8220;navel&#8221; than as &#8220;vulva.&#8221; (d) The nuance &#8220;navel&#8221; is not as out of line contextually as Lys and Pope suggest. The navel would not be out of place in the ascending order of praise because the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1496;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (&#8220;abdomen&#8221;) which follows may be viewed as both above and below the navel. The figurative association of the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1512;</font> as a mixing bowl filled with wine does not imply that this bodily part must actually be moist or filled with liquid as Pope suggests. The point of comparison is not physical or visual but one of function, i.e., it is intoxicating. The comparison of the navel to a mixing bowl of wine is no more out of line than the comparison of the belly to a heap of wheat in the next line. In fact, the two go together &#8211; she is both the &#8220;drink&#8221; and &#8220;food&#8221; for Solomon. The shape of the navel is as congruent with the metaphor of the &#8220;round bowl&#8221; as the vulva; both are round and receding. (3) Since both terms are derived from the same geminate root &#8211; Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1512;</font> and Arabic <i>srr</i> &#8211; it is more prudent to take the term as a synecdoche of whole (lower region) for the parts (including navel and vulva). The attempt to decide between these two options may be illegitimately splitting hairs. See K&amp;D 18:123; J. S. Deere, &#8220;<i>Song of Solomon</i>,&#8221;<i> BKCOT</i>,<i> </i>199-200; D. Lys, &#8220;Notes sur de Cantique,&#8221; VTSup 17 (1969): 171-78; M. H. Pope, <i>Song of Songs </i>(AB), 617; G. L. Carr, <i>Song of Solomon </i>(TOTC), 157.</p>
