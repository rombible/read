<a name="16"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=262><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;like purple&#8221; or &#8220;like purple fabric.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">argaman</font>, &#8220;purple fabric&#8221;) refers to wool dyed with red purple (<i>HALOT </i>84 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1503;</font>). It is used in reference to purple threads (Exod 35:25; 39:3; Esth 1:9) or purple cloth (Num 4:13; Judg 8:26; Esth 8:15; Prov 31:22; Jer 10:9; Song 3:10). NASB translates it as &#8220;purple threads,&#8221; while NIV nuances this term as &#8220;royal tapestry.&#8221; M. H. Pope (<i>The Song of Songs </i>[AB], 629-30) adduces several ancient Near Eastern texts and suggests that it refers to purple hair-dye. The comparison is to hair which entangles Solomon like binding cords and therefore, it seems most likely that the idea here must be purple threads. The Hebrew noun is a loanword from Hittite <i>argaman</i> &#8220;tribute,&#8221; which is reflected in Akkadian <i>argamannu</i> &#8220;purple&#8221; (also &#8220;tribute&#8221; under Hittite influence), Ugaritic <i>argmn</i> &#8220;tax, purple,&#8221; Aramaic <i>argwn</i> &#8220;purple&#8221; (<i>HALOT </i>84). Purple cloth and threads were considered very valuable (Ezek 27:7, 16) and were commonly worn by kings as a mark of their royal position (Judg 8:26).</p>
