<a name="9"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=255><b>tn</b> Alternately, &#8220;your waist.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1496;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bitnekh</font>) probably refers to the woman&#8217;s &#8220;belly&#8221; rather than &#8220;waist.&#8221; It is associated with a woman&#8217;s abdominal/stomach region rather than her hips (Prov 13:25; 18:20; Ezek 3:3). The comparison of her belly to a heap of wheat is visually appropriate because of the similarity of their symmetrical shape and tannish color. The primary point of comparison, however, is based upon the commonplace association of wheat in Israel, namely, wheat was the main staple of the typical Israelite meal (Deut 32:14; 2 Sam 4:6; 17:28; 1 Kgs 5:25; Pss 81:14; 147:14). Just as wheat satisfied an Israelite&#8217;s physical hunger, she satisfied his sexual hunger. J. S. Deere makes this point in the following manner: &#8220;The most obvious commonplace of wheat was its function, that is, it served as one of the main food sources in ancient Palestine. The Beloved was both the &#8216;food&#8217; (wheat) and &#8216;drink&#8217; (wine) of the Lover. Her physical expression of love nourished and satisfied him. His satisfaction was great for the &#8216;mixed wine&#8217; is intoxicating and the &#8216;heap of wheat&#8217; was capable of feeding many. The &#8216;heap of wheat&#8217; also suggests the harvest, an association which contributes to the emotional quality of the metaphor. The harvest was accompanied with a joyous celebration over the bounty yielded up by the land. So also, the Beloved is bountiful and submissive in giving of herself, and the source of great joy&#8221; (&#8220;<i>Song of Solomon</i>,&#8221; <i>BKCOT</i>, 203-204).</p>
