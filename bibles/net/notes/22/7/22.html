<a name="22"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=268><b>tn</b> Alternately &#8220;clusters of figs.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ashkolot</font>, &#8220;clusters&#8221;) usually refers to (1) clusters of grapes, that is, the stalk on which the bunch of grapes grow and the bunch of grapes themselves (Gen 40:10; Num 13:23-24; Deut 32:32; Isa 65:8; Mic 7:1) or (2) the berry on a cluster of henna bush (Song 1:14) (<i>HALOT </i>95 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;</font>). It is possible that this is an anomalous usage in reference to a cluster of dates rather than to a cluster of grapes for three reasons: (1) the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tamar</font>, &#8220;palm tree&#8221;) referred to in 7:7 is a date palm, (2) the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1463;&#1504;&#1456;&#1505;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sansinnim</font>, &#8220;fruit stalks&#8221;) in 7:8a refers to the fruit stalk of dates (<i>Rademus dactylorum</i>), being related to Akkadian <i>sissinnu</i> (&#8220;part of the date palm&#8221;), and (3) the reference to climbing the palm tree in 7:8a is best understood if it is a date palm and its fruit are dates. The comparison between her breasts and clusters of dates probably has to do with shape and multiplicity, as well as taste, as the rest of this extended metaphor intimates. M. H. Pope (<i>The Song of Songs </i>[AB], 634) notes: &#8220;The comparison of the breasts to date clusters presumably intended a pair of clusters to match the dual form of the word for &#8216;breasts.&#8217; A single cluster of dates may carry over a thousand single fruits and weigh twenty pounds or more. It may be noted that the multiple breasts of the representations of Artemis of Ephesus look very much like a cluster of large dates, and it might be that the date clusters here were intended to suggest a similar condition of polymasty.&#8221;</p>
