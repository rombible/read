<a name="17"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=263><b>tn</b> Alternately, &#8220;captivated.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asar</font>, &#8220;to bind, capture, hold captive, put in prison&#8221;) is commonly used of binding a prisoner with cords and fetters (Gen 42:34; Judg 15:10-13; 16:5-12; 2 Kgs 17:4; 23:33; 25:7; 2 Chr 33:11) (<i>HALOT </i>75 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1505;&#1512;</font>). It is frequently used as a figure to depict absolute authority over a person (Ps 105:22). The passive participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> means &#8220;to be bound, held captive, imprisoned&#8221; (2 Sam 3:34; Jer 40:1; Job 36:8). Like a prisoner bound in cords and fetters and held under the complete control and authority of his captor, Solomon was captivated by the spellbinding power of her hair. In a word, he was the prisoner of love and she was his captor. Similar imagery appears in an ancient Egyptian love song: &#8220;With her hair she throws lassoes at me, with her eyes she catches me, with her necklace she entangles me, and with her seal ring she brands me&#8221; (Song 43 in the Chester Beatty Cycle, translated by W. K. Simpson, ed., <i>The Literature of Ancient Egypt</i>, 324). J. S. Deere suggests, &#8220;The concluding part of the metaphor, &#8216;The king is held captive by your tresses,&#8217; is a beautiful expression of the powerful effect of love. A strong monarch was held prisoner by the beauty of his Beloved&#8221; (&#8220;<i>Song of Solomon</i>,&#8221; <i>BKCOT</i>, 206-207). This is a startling statement because Solomon emphasizes that the one who was being held captive like a prisoner in bonds was the &#8220;king&#8221;! At this point in world history, Solomon was the ruler of the most powerful and wealthy nation in the world (1 Kgs 3:13; 10:23-29). And yet he was held totally captive and subject to the beauty of this country maiden!</p>
