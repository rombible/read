<a name="21"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=267><b>sn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tamar</font>, &#8220;palm tree&#8221;) refers to the date palm tree (<i>Phoenix dactyliferia</i>) that can reach a height of 80 feet (24 m). It flourished in warm moist areas and oases from Egypt to India. Ancient Iraq was the leading grower of date palms and dates in the ancient world, as today (M. H. Pope, <i>The Song of Songs </i>[AB], 633). There is also a hint of eroticism in this palm tree metaphor because the palm tree was often associated with fertility in the ancient world. The point of comparison is that she is a tall, slender, fertile young woman. The comparison of a tall and slender lady to a palm tree is not uncommon in love literature: &#8220;O you, whose height is that of a palm tree in a serail&#8221; (Homer, <i>Odyssey</i> vi 162-63) (S. H. Stephan, &#8220;Modern Palestinian Parallels to the Song of Songs,&#8221; <i>JPOS</i> 2 [1922]: 76). </p>
