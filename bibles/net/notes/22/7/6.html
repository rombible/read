<a name="6"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=252><b>sn</b> The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1503; &#1492;&#1463;&#1505;&#1468;&#1463;&#1492;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aggan hassahar</font>, &#8220;round mixing bowl&#8221;) refers to a vessel used for mixing wine. Archaeologists have recovered examples of such large, deep, two handled, ring-based round bowls. The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (&#8220;mixing bowl&#8221;) came into Greek usage as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7938;&#947;&#947;&#959;&#962; </font>(<font face="Greektl">angos</font>) which designates vessels used for mixing wine (e.g., Homer, <i>Odyssey</i> xvi 16) (LSJ 7). This is consistent with the figurative references to wine which follows: &#8220;may it never lack mixed wine.&#8221; Selected Bibliography: J. P. Brown, &#8220;The Mediterranean Vocabulary for Wine,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 19 (1969): 158; A. M. Honeyman, &#8220;The Pottery Vessels of the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>PEQ</i> 80 (1939): 79. The comparison of her navel to a &#8220;round mixing bowl&#8221; is visually appropriate in that both are round and receding. The primary point of comparison to the round bowl is one of sense, as the following clause makes clear: &#8220;may it never lack mixed wine.&#8221; J. S. Deere suggests that the point of comparison is that of taste, desirability, and function (&#8220;<i>Song of Solomon</i>,&#8221; <i>BKCOT</i>, 202). More specifically, it probably refers to the source of intoxication, that is, just as a bowl used to mix wine was the source of physical intoxication, so she was the source of his sexual intoxication. She intoxicated Solomon with her love in the same way that wine intoxicates a person.</p>
