<a name="35"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=312><b>sn</b> An interesting semantic parallel involving the &#8220;door/bar&#8221; motif in ancient Near Eastern texts comes from an Assyrian charm against an enemy: &#8220;If he is a door, I will open your mouth; but if he is a bar, I will open your tongue.&#8221; Obviously, the line in the Song is not an incantation; the formula is used in a love motif. Cited by J. Ebeling, &#8220;Aus dem Tagewerk eines assyrischen Zauberpriesters,&#8221; <i>MAOG</i> 5 (1931): 19.</p>
