<a name="41"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=318><b>tn</b> Each of the three terms in this line has the 1st person common singular suffix which is repeated three times for emphasis: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">karmi</font>, &#8220;my vineyard&#8221;), <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1500;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shelli</font>, &#8220;which belongs to me&#8221;), and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1508;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿfana</font>, &#8220;at my disposal&#8221;). In contrast to King Solomon, who owns the vineyard at Baal-Hamon and who can buy and sell anything in the vineyard that he wishes, she proclaims that her &#8220;vineyard&#8221; (= herself or her body) belongs to her alone. In contrast to the vineyard, which can be leased out, and its fruit, which can be bought or sold, her &#8220;vineyard&#8221; is not for sale. Her love must and is to be freely given.</p>
