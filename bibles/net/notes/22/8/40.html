<a name="40"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=317><b>sn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kerem</font>, &#8220;vineyard&#8221;) is used literally in 8:11 in reference to Solomon&#8217;s physical vineyard, but in 8:12 it is used figuratively (hypocatastasis) in reference to the Beloved: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">karmi</font>, &#8220;my vineyard&#8221;). Throughout the Song, the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (&#8220;vineyard&#8221;) is used figuratively (Song 1:6; 2:15; 8:12). In 8:12 it is used in reference to either (1) herself, (2) her choice of whom to give herself to in love, or (3) her physical body. In contrast to Solomon&#8217;s physical vineyard, whose fruit can be bought and sold (8:11), she is not for sale: She will only give herself freely to the one whom she chooses to love.</p>
