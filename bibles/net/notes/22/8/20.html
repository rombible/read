<a name="20"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=297><b>sn</b> It was a common practice in the ancient world to compare intense feelings to death. The point of the expression &#8220;love is as strong as death&#8221; means that love is extremely strong. The expression &#8220;love is as cruel as Sheol&#8221; may simply mean that love can be profoundly cruel. For example: &#8220;His soul was vexed to death,&#8221; means that he could not stand it any longer (Judg 16:16). &#8220;I do well to be angry to death,&#8221; means that he was extremely angry (Jonah 4:9). &#8220;My soul is sorrowful to death,&#8221; means that he was exceedingly sorrowful (Matt 26:38 = Mark 14:34) (D. W. Thomas, &#8220;A Consideration of Some Unusual Ways of Expressing the Superlative in Hebrew,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 3 [1953]: 220-21).</p>
