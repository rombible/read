<a name="18"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=295><b>tn</b> Literally &#8220;cylinder-seal&#8221; or &#8220;seal.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khotam</font>, &#8220;cylinder-seal&#8221;) is repeated in 8:6 for emphasis. The translation above uses the terms &#8220;cylinder seal&#8221; and &#8220;signet&#8221; simply for the sake of poetic variation. The Beloved wanted to be as safe and secure as a cylinder seal worn on the arm or around the neck, hanging down over the heart. She also wanted to be placed on his heart (emotions), like the impression of a cylinder seal is written on a document. She wanted to be &#8220;written&#8221; on his heart like the impression of a cylinder seal, and kept secure in his love as a signet ring is worn around his arm/hand to keep it safe.</p>
