<a name="10"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=287><b>sn</b> This statement is a euphemism: the Beloved wished to give her breasts to Solomon, like a mother would give her breast to her nursing baby. This is the climactic point of the &#8220;lover&#8217;s wish song&#8221; of Song 8:1-2. The Beloved wished that Solomon was her little brother still nursing on her mother&#8217;s breast. The Beloved, who had learned from her mother&#8217;s example, would bring him inside their home and she would give him her breast: &#8220;I would give you spiced wine to drink, the nectar of my pomegranates.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;my pomegranates&#8221; is a euphemism for her breasts. Rather than providing milk from her breasts for a nursing baby, the Beloved&#8217;s breasts would provide the sensual delight of &#8220;spiced wine&#8221; and &#8220;nectar&#8221; for her lover.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tc</b> The MT reads the singular noun with 1st person common singular suffix <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rimmoni</font>, &#8220;my pomegranate&#8221;).

Therefore, R.
