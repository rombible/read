<a name="16"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=293><b>sn</b> In the ancient Near East <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khotam</font>, &#8220;seal&#8221;) was used to denote ownership and was thus very valuable (Jer 22:24; Hag 2:23; Eccl 17:22). Seals were used to make a stamp impression to identify the object as the property of the seal&#8217;s owner (<i>HALOT </i>300 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1501;</font>). Seals were made of semi-precious stone upon which was engraved a unique design and an inscription, e.g., LMLK [PN] &#8220;belonging to king [&#8230;].&#8221; The impression could be placed upon wet clay of a jar or on a writing tablet by rolling the seal across the clay. Because it was a valuable possession its owner would take careful precautions to not lose it and would keep it close to him at all times. </p>
