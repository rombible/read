<a name="5"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=282><b>sn</b> Song 8:1-2 may be classified as a &#8220;a lover&#8217;s wish song&#8221; that is similar in content and structure to an ancient Egyptian love song in which the lover longs for greater intimacy with his beloved: &#8220;I wish I were her Negro maid who follows at her feet; then the skin of all her limbs would be revealed to me. I wish I were her washerman, if only for a month; then I would be [entranced], washing out the Moringa oils in her diaphanous garments. I wish I were the seal ring, the guardian of her [fingers]; then [&#8230;]&#8221; (The Cairo Love Songs, 25-27, in W. K. Simpson, ed., <i>The Literature of Ancient Egypt</i>, 311). The Egyptian and Hebrew parallels display a similar structure: (1) introductory expression of the lover&#8217;s wish to be something/someone in a position of physical closeness with the Beloved; (2) description of the person/thing that is physically close to the Beloved; and (3) concluding description of the resultant greater degree of intimacy with the Beloved. In the Egyptian parallel it is the man who longs for greater closeness; in the Hebrew song it is the woman. The Egyptian love song borders on the sensual; the Hebrew love song is simply romantic. The Beloved expresses her desire for greater freedom to display her affection for Solomon. In ancient Near Eastern cultures the public display of affection between a man and woman was frowned upon &#8211; sometimes even punished. For example, in Assyrian laws the punishment for a man kissing a woman in public was to cut off his upper lip. On the other hand, public displays of affection between children and between family members were allowed. Accordingly, the Beloved hyperbolically wished that she and Solomon were children from the same family so she could kiss him anytime she wished without fear of punishment or censure.</p>
