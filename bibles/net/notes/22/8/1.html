<a name="1"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=278><b>tn</b> The imperfect <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1504;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yittenka</font>) may denote a desire or wish of the subject, e.g., Gen 24:58; Exod 21:36; 1 Sam 21:10 (<i>IBHS</i> 509 §31.4h). The optative particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mi</font>) with an imperfect expresses an unreal wish, e.g., Judg 9:29; 2 Sam 15:4; Mal 1:10. The construction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1504;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mi yittenka</font>) is an idiom expressing an unreal wish in the optative mood (<i>HALOT </i>575 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;</font>), e.g., &#8220;Would that it were evening&#8230;Would that it were morning!&#8221; (KJV) or &#8220;If only it were evening&#8230;If only it were morning!&#8221; (NIV) (Deut 28:67); &#8220;Oh that I knew where I might find him&#8221; (KJV, NASB, NJPS), &#8220;I wish I had known,&#8221; &#8220;If only I knew where to find him; if only I could go to his dwelling!&#8221; (NIV) (Job 23:3); &#8220;I wish that all the LORD&#8217;s people were prophets!&#8221; (NIV), &#8220;Would that all the LORD&#8217;s people were prophets&#8221; (NASB) (Num 11:29). Evidently, the LXX did not understand the idiom; it rendered the line in wooden literalness: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#932;&#943;&#962; &#948;&#8061;&#8131; &#963;&#949; &#7936;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#953;&#948;&#972;&#957; &#956;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Tis dwh se adelfidon mou,</font> &#8220;Who might give/make you as my brother?&#8221;).</p>
