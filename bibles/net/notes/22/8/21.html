<a name="21"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=298><b>tn</b> Alternately, &#8220;jealousy.&#8221; The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qin</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>) has a wide range of meanings: &#8220;jealousy&#8221; (Prov 6:34; 14:30; 27:4), &#8220;competitiveness&#8221; (Eccl 4:4; 9:6), &#8220;anger&#8221; (Num 5:14, 30), &#8220;zeal&#8221; (2 Kgs 10:16; Pss 69:10; 119:139; Job 5:2; Sir 30:24), and &#8220;passion&#8221; (Song 8:6). The Hebrew noun is related to the Akkadian and Arabic roots that mean &#8220;to become intensely red&#8221; or &#8220;become red with passion,&#8221; suggesting that the root denotes strong emotion. Although <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font> is traditionally rendered &#8220;jealousy&#8221; (KJV, RSV, NASB, NIV), the parallelism with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ahavah</font>, &#8220;love&#8221;) suggests the nuance &#8220;passion&#8221; (NJPS). Coppes notes, &#8220;This word is translated in the KJV in a bad sense in Song 8:6, &#8216;jealousy is as cruel as the grave,&#8217; but it could be taken in a good sense in parallel with the preceding, &#8216;ardent zeal is as strong as the grave&#8217;&#8221; (<i>TWOT</i> 2:803).</p>
