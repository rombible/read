W. Wolff<i>, Anthropology of the Old Testament</i>, 40-58).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> There were two kinds of cylinder seals in the ancient Near East, namely, those worn around one&#8217;s neck and those worn around one&#8217;s wrist. The typical Mesopotamian seal was mounted on a pin and hung on a string or necklace around one&#8217;s neck. The cylinder seal hung around one&#8217;s neck would, figuratively speaking, rest over the heart (metonymy of association). The Beloved wished to be to Solomon like a cylinder seal worn over his heart. She wanted to be as intimate with her lover as the seal worn by him (W. W. Hallo, &#8220;&#8216;As the Seal Upon Thy Heart&#8217;: Glyptic Roles in the Biblical World,&#8221; <i>BRev</i> 2 [1985]: 26).</p>
