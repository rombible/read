<a name="2"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=70><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;meadow-saffron&#8221; or &#8220;crocus.&#8221; The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1458;&#1489;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khavatselet</font>)<font face="Scholar"> </font>traditionally has been translated &#8220;rose&#8221; (KJV, NKJV, ASV, NASB, RSV, NRSV, NIV, NJPS, NLT, CEV); however, recent translations suggest &#8220;crocus&#8221; (NIV margin, NJPS margin), &#8220;narcissus&#8221; (DBY) or simply &#8220;flower&#8221; (DRA, NAB). The LXX translated it with the generic term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#952;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anqos,</font> &#8220;flower, blossom&#8221;). Early English translators knew that it referred to some kind of flower but were unsure exactly which type, so they arbitrarily chose &#8220;rose&#8221; because it was a well-known and beautiful flower. In the light of comparative Semitics, modern Hebrew lexicographers have settled on &#8220;asphodel,&#8221; &#8220;meadow-saffron,&#8221; &#8220;narcissus,&#8221; or &#8220;crocus&#8221; (BDB 287 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1458;&#1489;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1514;</font>; <i>HALOT </i>287 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1458;&#1489;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1514;</font>; <i>DCH</i> 3:153 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1458;&#1489;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1514;</font>). The Hebrew term is related to Syriac <i>hamsalaita</i> (&#8220;meadow saffron&#8221;) and Akkadian <i>habasillatu</i> (&#8220;flower-stalk, marsh plant, reed&#8221;). Lexicographers and botanists suggest that the Hebrew term refers to <i>Ashodelos</i> (lily family), <i>Narcissus tazetta</i> (narcissus or daffodil), or <i>Colchicum autumnale</i> (meadow-saffron or crocus). The location of this flower in Sharon suggests that a common wild flower would be more consonant than a rose. The term appears elsewhere only in Isa 35:1 where it refers to some kind of desert flower &#8211; erroneously translated &#8220;rose&#8221; (KJV, NJPS) but probably &#8220;crocus&#8221; (NASB, NIV, NJPS margin). Appropriately, the rustic maiden who grew up in the simplicity of rural life compares herself to a simple, common flower of the field (M. H. Pope, <i>Song of Songs </i>[AB], 367).</p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=71><b>sn</b> Sharon is a low coastal plain stretching south from Mount Carmel. It is well watered due to the Kurkar ridges running parallel to the shore which trapped the water run-off from the Samaritan hills. The combination of low sandy hills and swampy lowlands produced heavy vegetation and an abundance of wild flowers in the area (M. H. Pope, <i>Song of Songs</i> [AB], 367).</p>

Botanists note that among the many different species of the lily family only one grows in Palestine. This species may be identified as the <i>Anthemis palaestina</i>, the chamomile, a white-daisy-like plant, which was indigenous to Palestine (<i>Fauna and Flora of the Bible</i>, 134-36).</p>

The Hebrew term is related to Akkadian <i>hahu</i> and <i>haiahu</i> &#8220;thorn&#8221; and <i>hahinnu</i> &#8220;thorny plants&#8221; (<i>AHw</i> 1:308) and Aramaic <i>hahhu</i> (<i>HALOT </i>296). The &#8220;thorn bush&#8221; is a thistle plant (<i>Poterium spinosum</i>) which has prickly spines covered with thistles, but also sprouts beautiful small red flowers (<i>Fauna and Flora of the Bible</i>, 184-85).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Lover accommodates her self-denigrating comparison, but heightens it to praise her: If she insisted that she was nothing more than a common flower of the field, then he insisted that all other women were like thorns by comparison.

<a name="8"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=76><b>sn</b> Apple trees were not native to Palestine and had to be imported and cultivated. To find a cultivated apple tree growing in the forest among other wild trees would be quite unusual; the apple tree would stand out and be a delightful surprise. Like a cultivated apple tree, the Lover was unique and stood out among all other men. In ancient Near Eastern love literature, the apple tree was a common symbol for romantic love and sexual fertility (S. N. Kramer, <i>The</i> <i>Sacred Marriage Rite</i>, 100-101). The &#8220;apple tree&#8221; motif is used in the Song in a similar manner (e.g., Song 2:3; 8:5). Likewise, the motif of &#8220;apples&#8221; is used as a symbol of fertility (Joel 1:12) and sexual desire (Song 2:5, 7, 9).</p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=77><b>tn</b> Alternately, &#8220;I desired&#8221; or &#8220;I took delight in.&#8221; The meaning of this use of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khamad</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;delight, desire&#8221;) is debated. The root has a basic two-fold range of meanings: (1) &#8220;to take pleasure in, delight in&#8221; (Job 20:20; Pss 39:12; 68:17; Prov 1:22; Isa 1:29; 44:9; 53:2) and (2) &#8220;to desire passionately, to desire illicitly&#8221; (Exod 20:17; 34:24; Deut 5:21; 7:25; Josh 7:21; Prov 1:22; 6:25; 12:12; Mic 2:2) (<i>HALOT </i>325 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1502;&#1491;</font>; BDB 326 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1491;</font>). The related noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1502;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khemÿkhah</font>)<font face="Scholar"> </font>describes objects which are &#8220;delightful, precious, desirable&#8221; (<i>HALOT </i>325 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1502;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font>). Commentators who adopt an erotic view of the extended metaphor in 2:3 opt for the sexual desire nuance: &#8220;I desired (sexually).&#8221; Those who adopt the less erotic approach favor the more general connotation: &#8220;I took delight in&#8221; or &#8220;I delight in.&#8221; </p>

The main idea is indicated by the second verb; the first verb indicates the manner of action. The first verb functions adverbially while the second verb carries its full verbal sense (see <i>IBHS</i> 653-54 §39.2.5). </p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=79><b>sn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsel</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;shade&#8221;) is used figuratively to depict protection and relief. This term is used in OT literally (physical shade from the sun) and figuratively (protection from something) (<i>HALOT </i>1024-25 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1461;&#1500;</font>): (1) Literal: The physical shade of a tree offers protection from the heat of the midday sun (Judg 9:15; Ezek 17:23; 31:6, 12, 17; Hos 4:13; Jonah 4:6; Job 7:22; 40:22). Similar protection from the sun is offered by the shade of a vine (Ps 80:11), root (Gen 19:8), mountain (Judg 9:36), rock (Isa 32:2), cloud (Isa 25:5), and hut (Jonah 4:5). (2) Figurative (hypocatastasis): Just as physical shade offers protection from the sun, the Israelite could find &#8220;shade&#8221; (protection) from God or the king (e.g., Num 14:9; Isa 30:2; 49:2; 51:16; Hos 14:8; Pss 17:8; 36:8; 57:2; 63:8; 91:1; 121:5; Lam 4:20; Eccl 7:12). The association between &#8220;shade&#8221; and &#8220;protection&#8221; is seen in the related Akkadian <i>sillu</i> &#8220;shade, covering, protection&#8221; (<i>AHw</i> 3:1101; <i>CAD</i> S:189). The epithets of several Akkadian deities are <i>sillu</i> and <i>sululu</i> (&#8220;Shade, Protector&#8221;). The motif of protection, rest, and relief from the sun seems to be implied by the expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿyashavti</font>, &#8220;I sat down&#8221;) in 2:3b. During the summer months, the temperature often reaches 110-130ºF in the Negev. Those who have never personally experienced the heat of the summer sun in the Negev as they performed strenuous physical labor cannot fully appreciate the relief offered by any kind of shade! Previously, the young woman had complained that she had been burned by the sun because she had been forced to labor in the vineyards with no shade to protect her (Song 1:5-6). She had urged him to tell her where she could find relief from the sun during the hot midday hours (Song 1:7). Now she exults that she finally had found relief from the scorching sun under the &#8220;shade&#8221; which he offered to her (Song 2:3). S. C. Glickman writes: &#8220;Whereas before she came to him she worked long hours on the sun (1:6), now she rests under the protective shade he brings. And although formerly she was so exhausted by her work she could not properly care for herself, now she finds time for refreshment with him&#8221; (<i>A Song for Lovers</i>, 40).</p>

It is possible to take the imagery of the young woman tasting his &#8220;fruit&#8221; as kissing. Likewise, the imagery of the gazelles grazing among the lilies is probably a picture of the young man caressing and kissing his beloved (Song 2:16; 6:3).</p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=81><b>sn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">matoq</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;sweet&#8221;) is used literally and figuratively. When used literally, it describes pleasant tasting foods, such as honey (Judg 14:14, 18; Prov 24:13; Ps 19:11) or sweet water (Num 33:28; Prov 9:17). Used figuratively, it describes what is pleasant to experience: friendship (Job 20:12; Ps 55:15; Prov 27:9), life (Eccl 11:7; Sir 40:18), sleep for the weary (Eccl 5:11), eloquence in speech (Prov 16:21, 24), and scripture (Ps 19:11). Those who adopt the &#8220;hyper-erotic&#8221; approach opt for the literal meaning: his &#8220;fruit&#8221; tastes sweet to her palate. The nonerotic approach takes the term in its figurative sense: The experience of his love was pleasant.</p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=82><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my palate.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khikki</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;my palate&#8221;) is used metonymically in reference to the sensation of taste which is associated with a person&#8217;s palate. The idea of &#8220;tasting&#8221; is used as a metaphor in the OT for the experiential knowledge which is acquired through a person&#8217;s relationship with someone (e.g., Ps 34:9). Just as a person would learn whether a fruit was ripe and delicious by tasting it, so a person could learn of the quality of a person&#8217;s character by experiencing it through personal interaction. This extended metaphor compares the delights of his love to (1) the refreshment of sitting in the shade of a tree for refuge from the desert sun, and (2) the delight of tasting a sweet apple &#8211; a fruit that was not indigenous to Palestine.</p>

This alternate vocalization tradition has several factors that make it a viable option: (1) It respects the consonantal text; (2) It is supported by the LXX and Syriac; (3) It provides a tighter parallelism with the two identical imperatival forms in 2:5a (both 2nd person masculine plural imperatives with 1st person common singular suffixes); (4) It provides thematic unity to the entire poetic unit of 2:4-5; and (5) It helps make better sense of an enigmatic unit. This approach is strengthened if the MT reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿdiglo</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;and his banner&#8221;) is revocalized to the imperative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿdiglu</font>, &#8220;and feed [me]&#8221;) (see translator&#8217;s note below). In this case, the parallelism throughout 2:4-5 would be very tight. It would feature four parallel imperatives of request, all revolving around the theme of love-sickness: &#8220;Bring me into the banquet hall, feed me with love; sustain me with raisin cakes, refresh me with apples, because I am faint with love.&#8221; The weakness with the revocalization to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1458;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;&#1467;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8220;Bring me!&#8221;) is that it demands, due to the dictates of synonymous parallelism, the questionable revocalization of the MT&#8217;s <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (&#8220;and his banner&#8221;) to the imperative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (&#8220;and feed [me]&#8221;).</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> Alternately, &#8220;Bring me!&#8221;</p>

G. L. Carr favors the vineyard view due to the agricultural metaphors in 2:1-5. However, most commentators favor the banquet house view because of the reference to &#8220;raisin-cakes&#8221; and &#8220;apples&#8221; (2:4) which were served at banquets in the ancient Near East. Moreover, the expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</font> in in Song 2:4 may be equivalent to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492; &#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet mishte hayyayin</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;house of the drinking of wine&#8221;) in Esther 7:8 (<i>HALOT </i>409 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</font>). Second, raisin cakes are mentioned in this context in 2:5, and they were often eaten to celebrate festive occasions (2 Sam 6:19; Isa 16:7; Hos 3:1); therefore, the banquet motif finds support.

Thus, most translations render <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> as &#8220;his banner&#8221; (KJV, NASB, NIV, NJPS). However, the expression &#8220;His banner over me was love&#8221; is enigmatic. (2) &#8220;serve love to me!&#8221; Delitzsch revocalized the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (&#8220;his banner&#8221;) as an imperative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿdiglu</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;serve [me]&#8221;) from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dagal</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;to serve food&#8221;) which is related to Akkadian <i>dagalu</i> II (&#8220;to serve food&#8221;). Delitzsch renders the passage: &#8220;Bring me into the banquet hall and serve me love&#8230;for I am faint with love.&#8221; This is supported by LXX which reads: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#963;&#945;&#947;&#940;&#947;&#949;&#964;&#941; &#956;&#949; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#959;&#7990;&#954;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#959;&#7986;&#957;&#959;&#965;</font>,<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> &#964;&#940;&#958;&#945;&#964;&#949; &#7952;&#960;</font>&#8217;<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> &#7952;&#956;&#8050; &#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">eisagagete me eis oikon tou oinou, taxate ep</font>&#8217;<font face="Greektl"> eme agaphn,</font> &#8220;Bring me into the wine house, and set love before me&#8221;). However, R. Gordis points out the difficulties with Delitzsch&#8217;s proposal: (a) The meaning &#8220;serve&#8221; for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1500;</font> is unparalleled in Hebrew thus, it would create a homonymic <i>hapax legomenon</i>; (b) We would expect the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">li</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;to me&#8221;) rather than <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ala</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;over me&#8221;) after the imperative; and (c) The Akkadian parallel is uncertain. (3) &#8220;its banner above me is love.&#8221; <i>HALOT</i> relates <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> to the Akkadian noun <i>diglu</i> (&#8220;eyesight, view, look, gaze&#8221;) and proposes the nuance &#8220;sign of an inn,&#8221; such as a flag placed over taverns (<i>HALOT </i>213 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1490;&#1462;&#1500;</font>). This approach renders the line: &#8220;He has brought me to the banquet hall, and its banner above me is love.&#8221; (4) &#8220;his look toward me was loving&#8221; = &#8220;he looked at me lovingly.&#8221; Several lexicons relate <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> to the homonymic root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1500;</font>, &#8220;look, glance&#8221; (e.g., <i>DCH</i> 2:415 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1500;</font>). The Hebrew noun <i>degel</i> II is related to the Akkadian noun <i>diglu</i> &#8220;eyesight, view, look, gaze&#8221; (<i>CAD</i> 3:21; <i>AHw</i> 1:14). Likewise, the Hebrew verb II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8220;to look, behold&#8221;; Song 5:10; 6:4, 10; Eccl 9:13; Ps 20:6) (BDB 186 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1500;</font>; <i>HALOT </i>213 s.v.

Those who adopt this approach render the line: &#8220;His glance upon me is love&#8221; (<i>DCH </i>2:414) or &#8220;His look upon me was loving&#8221; (R. Gordis, &#8220;The Root <i>dgl</i> in the Song of Songs,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 88 [1969]: 203-204; idem, <i>Song of Songs and Lamentations</i>, 81-82); or &#8220;He looked upon me with love.&#8221; (5) &#8220;his wish regarding me was lovemaking.&#8221; M. H. Pope (<i>Song of Songs</i> [AB], 376-77) notes that the Assyrian noun <i>diglu</i> may denote &#8220;wish,&#8221; i.e., desire or intent (<i>CAD</i> 3:136). He renders the line: &#8220;His wish regarding me was lovemaking&#8221; or &#8220;His intentions were to make love.&#8221; Pope&#8217;s suggestion has been adopted by several recent commentators (e.g., G.

Thus, some commentators suggest that the woman is speaking to a large audience, perhaps the banquet guests implied in 2:4 or the maidens mentioned in 2:7 (R. Gordis, <i>Song of Songs and Lamentations</i>, 82). However, the Hebrew plural can be used in reference to a single individual when functioning in an intensive sense (<i>IBHS</i> 122 §7.4.3a). Thus, the woman may be speaking to her beloved, as in the rest of 2:3-6, but with intense passion. Similarly, in Sumerian love literature the bride sometimes uses plural verbs in reference to herself or her bridegroom (S. N. Kramer, <i>The Sacred Marriage Rite</i>, 92, 99).</p>

Raisin cakes were used as cultic offerings by many ancient Near Easterners, and were especially prominent in ancient Near Eastern fertility rites (e.g., Isa 16:7; Hos 3:1). In ancient Israel they were eaten during festive celebrations, being viewed as enhancing sexual fertility (2 Sam 6:19; 1 Chr 16:3). Scholars regard the &#8220;raisin cakes&#8221; as (1) literal food viewed as an aphrodisiac to &#8220;cure&#8221; her love-sickness; (2) a figurative expression (hypocatastasis) for sexual passion or lovemaking; or (3) double entendre referring to the literal food as an aphrodisiac and her desire for lovemaking.</p>

Hence, the term refers to a fruit with a fragrant scent. This may explain why the mere scent of this fruit was thought to have medicinal powers in the ancient Near East (G. E. Post, <i>Flora of Syria, Palestine and Sinai</i>, 128). This imagery draws upon two motifs associated with apples. First, apples were viewed as medicinal in ancient Syro-Palestinian customs; the sick were given apples to eat or smell in order to revive them. Similarly, the Mishnah and Talmud refer to apples as a medication like wine and grapes. Second, apples were considered an aphrodisiac in the ancient Near East. Both motifs are combined here because the Beloved is &#8220;love-sick&#8221; and only the embrace of her beloved can cure her, as 2:6 indicates (T. H. Ratzaby, &#8220;A Motif in Hebrew Love Poetry: In Praise of the Apple,&#8221; <i>Ariel</i> 40 [1976]: 14).</p>

It is used figuratively as a hyperbolic hypocatastasis for being so consumed with sexual desire that it saps one of his/her physical and emotional strength (BDB 317 s.v. 2).

For example, one Egyptian love song reads: &#8220;She will make the doctors unnecessary, because she knows my sickness&#8221; (Papyrus Harris 4:11). Similarly, &#8220;My salvation is her coming in from outside; when I see her, I will be healthy. When she opens her eye, my body is young; when she speaks, I will be strong.

In this case, the &#8220;witnesses&#8221; are the &#8220;gazelles and stags of the field&#8221; (2:7; 3:5). These animals were frequently used as symbols of romantic love in the OT (Prov 5:19). And in Egyptian and Mesopotamian love literature and Ugaritic poetry the gazelle was often associated with sexual fertility. For instance, in the following excerpt from a Mesopotamian incantation text the stag is referred to in the context of sexual potency in which a woman urges an ailing male: &#8220;With the love-[making of the mountain goat] six times, with the lovemaking of a stag seven times, with the lovemaking of a partridge twelve times, make love to me!

The Hiphil depicts a causative action (causing love to initially awaken) and the Polel depicts an intensive action (repeated efforts to awaken love or to set love into motion). On the other hand, G. L. Carr (<i>Song of Solomon</i> [TOTC], 94) writes: &#8220;The meaning is not <i>stir up</i>, i.e., a repetition of the same act, but is rather first the act of awakening or <i>summoning</i> something, and then doing what is necessary to <i>sustain</i> the activity already begun, i.e., being so fully awakened that sleep becomes impossible (e.g., 5:2).&#8221; The terms <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1464;&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ta</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">iru</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;arouse&#8221;; Hiphil imperative from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">orÿru</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;awaken&#8221;; Polel imperative from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font>) are probably figurative expressions (hypocatastasis) rather than literal, because the object does not refer to a person (her lover) but to an emotional state (&#8220;love&#8221;). The Hebrew root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> has two basic meanings: (1) to wake up and (2) to excite (<i>HALOT </i>802 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font>). These two nuances are paralleled in the related Semitic roots: Ugaritic <i>`r</i> and <i>`rr</i> &#8220;to be excited&#8221; (<i>UT</i> 19.1849; 19.1926; <i>WUS</i> 2092) and Akkadian <i>eru</i> &#8220;to awake&#8221; (<i>AHw</i> 1:247) (<i>HALOT </i>802 s.v. II). The Hiphil stem has a four-fold range of meanings: (1) to wake up someone/something, (2) to excite, put into motion, start to work, (3) to summons, (4) to disturb (<i>HALOT </i>802-803 s.v. II). When used literally, the Hiphil describes waking up a sleeper (Zech 4:1) or stirring up a fire (Hos 7:4). When used figuratively, it describes stirring up (Isa 50:4; Pss 57:9; 108:3) strength (Dan 11:25), anger/wrath (Ps 78:38), jealous/zeal (Isa 42:13), and love/sexual passion (Song 2:7; 3:5; 8:4). The Polel stem has a three-fold range of meanings: (1) to awake, start to move, (2) to agitate, disturb, (3) to set in motion (<i>HALOT </i>802-803 s.v. II). The expression &#8220;arouse or awaken love&#8221; is figurative (hypocatastasis). It draws an implied comparison between the literal action of arousing a person from sleep and stirring him/her up to excited action, with the figurative picture of a lover sexually stirring up, arousing and exciting the sexual passions of his beloved.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> What does the expression to &#8220;arouse or awaken love&#8221; mean?

<a name="37"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=105><b>sn</b> The dove was a common figure for romantic love in ancient Near Eastern love literature. This emphasis seems to be suggested by his use of the term &#8220;my dove.&#8221; Just as the young man heard the voice of the turtledove in 2:12, so now he wants to hear her voice. Doves were often associated with timidity in the ancient world. Being virtually defenseless, they would often take refuge in crevices and cliffs for safety (Jer 48:28). The emphasis on timidity and the need for security is undoubtedly the emphasis here because of the explicit description of this &#8220;dove&#8221; hiding in the &#8220;clefts of the rock&#8221; and in &#8220;the hiding places of the mountain crevice.&#8221; Fortresses were sometimes built in the clefts of the rocks on mountainsides because they were inaccessible and therefore, in a secure place of safety (Jer 49:16; Obad 3). Perhaps he realized it might be intimidating for her to join him and communicate with him freely. She would need to feel secure in his love to do this. It would be easy for her to hide from such emotionally exposing experiences.</p>

Some commentators suggest that the woman is speaking to a large audience, perhaps the maidens of Jerusalem mentioned in 2:7. However, the Hebrew plural can function in an intensive sense when used in reference to a single individual (<i>IBHS</i> 122 §7.4.3a). As noted previously, the bride often uses the plural in reference to herself or to her bridegroom in Sumerian love literature.

The meaning of the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">beter</font>)<font face="Scholar"> </font>is uncertain. <i>DCH</i> distinguishes between three homonymic nouns: (1) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</font> I noun &#8220;part, piece&#8221; (Gen 15:10; Jer 34:19) related to the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</font> &#8220;to cut in two&#8221; (Gen 15:10); (2) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</font> II noun &#8220;gorge&#8221; (Song 2:17); and (3) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</font> III place name &#8220;Bether&#8221; in Judah and 6.5 miles (11 km) SW of Jerusalem (Josh 15:59; 1 Chr 6:44; perhaps Song 2:17) (<i>DCH</i> 2:291 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</font>). Thus, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497; &#1489;&#1464;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</font> might mean &#8220;mountains of gorge[s]&#8221; or &#8220;mountains of Bether&#8221; (<i>DCH</i> 2:291 s.v. III). The Hebrew root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">batar</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;cut in pieces, cut in half&#8221;) is related to Arabic <i>batara</i> &#8220;to cut off&#8221; (<i>HALOT </i>167 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1514;&#1512;</font>; BDB 144 <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1512;</font>). The word does not appear in Ugaritic, Akkadian, or Syriac. Aramaic <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1514;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">tar</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;after, behind&#8221;) was used frequently in Northwest Semitic (<i>DISO</i> 45-46) and Late Hebrew (Jastrow 201 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1514;&#1463;&#1512;</font>); however, it offers little to this problem. Many scholars take <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</font> as a genitive of description functioning as an attributive adjective. For example, BDB suggests that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</font> means &#8220;mountains of cutting,&#8221; that is, &#8220;cleft mountains&#8221; (BDB 144 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</font>), while Koehler posits &#8220;ravine,&#8221; that is, mountains with a ravine (<i>HALOT </i>167 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</font>). This is reflected in the LXX&#8217;s <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#959;&#953;&#955;&#969;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957; </font>(<font face="Greektl">koilwmatwn,</font> &#8220;hollow places, basin, cavity&#8221;): <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8004;&#961;&#951; &#954;&#959;&#953;&#955;&#969;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">orh koilwmatwn</font>) &#8220;mountains with many ravines.&#8221; This approach is adopted by several translations, e.g., &#8220;rugged mountains&#8221; (NLT). On the other hand, Vulgate, Aquila, and Symmachus took it as a place name referring to the town of Bether (LXX <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#914;&#945;&#953;&#952;&#951;&#961;</font> = Mishnaic Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;</font>) located 6.5 miles (11 km) southwest of Jerusalem (Josh 15:59; 1 Chr 6:44). This approach is adopted by several translations: &#8220;mountains of Bether&#8221; (KJV, ASV, RSV, NASB, NIV margin, TEV). Theodotion takes it as a figurative expression, reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#965;&#956;&#953;&#945;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#969;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">qumiamatwn,</font> &#8220;incense&#8221;) which reflects a variant Hebrew reading of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿshamim</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;balsam, perfume&#8221;) which also appears in Song 8:14. This approach is taken in a Jewish-English translation: &#8220;hills of spice&#8221; (NJPS). The botanist Löw connects Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</font> to Greek <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#946;&#940;&#952;&#961;&#959;&#957; </font>(<font face="Greektl">malabaqron</font>) which was an Indian spice plant imported to Judah. See I. Low, <i>Die Flora der Juden</i>, 2:117-118. The expression &#8220;cleft mountains&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497; &#1489;&#1464;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</font>) might refer simply to a rugged and jagged mountain-range (NLT &#8220;rugged mountains&#8221;; NIV &#8220;rugged hills&#8221;). However, this may be a figurative description of the woman&#8217;s cleavage because similar imagery is used in Song 4:6 to describe her breasts. The name &#8220;Tihamah&#8221; (literally &#8220;the Great Deep&#8221;) was applied to the low-lying coastland between the mountains of Yemen and the Red Sea as well as to the depression of Djauf (Dumah) because of fresh-water springs which oozed up from below (Hebrew &#8220;Tehom&#8221; and &#8220;Tehomot,&#8221; Ugaritic &#8220;Tihamaten&#8221; or &#8220;Tahamatum,&#8221; Akkadian &#8220;Tiamat&#8221;). And it appears that in an Ammonite inscription that an area near the mountainous region of Rabbath-Amman is referred to by the name &#8220;Tymtn&#8221; (literally &#8220;The Two Depressions&#8221;), rather than by its real name (W. F. Albright, &#8220;Some Comments on the Amman Citadel Inscription,&#8221; <i>BASOR</i> 198 [April 1978]: 38-39).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Scholars offer three interpretations of her figurative request: (1) The Beloved desires her Lover to embrace her breasts, like a gazelle romping over mountains (mountains are figurative); (2) The Beloved entreats her Lover to leave and go back over the hills from whence he had journeyed (mountains are literal); and (3) As her Lover prepares to leave her country village, the Beloved asks him to return to her again in the same way he arrived, like a gazelle bounding over the mountains in 2:8-10 (mountains are literal).</p>
