<A NAME="161"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=939><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the word of the <sc>Lord came to Jehu son of Hanani concerning [or &#8220;against&#8221;] Baasha, saying.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="162"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=940><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has &#8220;because&#8221; at the beginning of the sentence. In the Hebrew text vv. 2-3 are one sentence comprised of a causal clause giving the reason for divine punishment (v. 2) and the main clause announcing the punishment (v. 3). The translation divides this sentence for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="163"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=941><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;walked in the way of Jeroboam.&#8221;</p>

II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1506;&#1512;</font>). In this case one might translate, &#8220;I am ready to sweep away Baasha and his family.&#8221; Either metaphor emphasizes the thorough and destructive nature of the coming judgment.</p>
