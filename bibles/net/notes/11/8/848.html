<A NAME="848"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=480><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and you, hear inside your dwelling place, inside heaven.&#8221; The precise nuance of the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>), used here with the verb &#8220;hear,&#8221; is unclear. One expects the preposition &#8220;from,&#8221; which appears in the parallel text in 2 Chr 6:21. The nuance &#8220;inside; among&#8221; is attested for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (see Gen 23:19; 1 Sam 10:22; Jer 4:3), but in each case a verb of motion is employed with the preposition, unlike 1 Kgs 8:30. The translation above (&#8220;from inside&#8221;) is based on the demands of the immediate context rather than attested usage elsewhere.</p>
