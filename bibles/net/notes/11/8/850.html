<A NAME="850"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=482><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and forgive the man who sins against his neighbor when one takes up against him a curse to curse him and the curse comes before your altar in this house.&#8221; In the Hebrew text the words &#8220;and forgive&#8221; conclude v. 30, but the accusative sign at the beginning of v. 31 suggests the verb actually goes with what follows in v. 31. The parallel text in 2 Chr 6:22 begins with &#8220;and if,&#8221; rather than the accusative sign. In this case &#8220;forgive&#8221; must be taken with what precedes, and v. 31 must be taken as the protasis (&#8220;if&#8221; clause) of a conditional sentence, with v. 32 being the apodosis (&#8220;then&#8221; clause) that completes the sentence.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Be willing to forgive the accused if the accusation is false</i>. At first it appears that Solomon is asking God to forgive the guilty party. But in v. 32 Solomon asks the <sc>Lord to discern who is guilty and innocent, so v. 31 must refer to a situation where an accusation has been made, but not yet proven. The very periphrastic translation reflects this interpretation.</p>
