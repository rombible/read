<A NAME="1860"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=1060><b>sn</b> <i>So he went on up, looked, and reported, &#8220;There is nothing.&#8221; </i>Several times in this chapter those addressed by Elijah obey his orders. In vv. 20 and 42 Ahab does as instructed, in vv. 26 and 28 the prophets follow Elijah&#8217;s advice, and in vv. 30, 34, 40 and 43 the people and servants do as they are told. By juxtaposing Elijah&#8217;s commands with accounts of those commands being obeyed, the narrator emphasizes the authority of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s prophet.</p>
