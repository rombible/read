<A NAME="1840"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1040><b>sn</b> Elijah&#8217;s sarcastic proposals would have been especially offensive and irritating to Baal&#8217;s prophets, for they believed Baal was imprisoned in the underworld as death&#8217;s captive during this time of drought. Elijah&#8217;s apparent ignorance of their theology is probably designed for dramatic effect; indeed the suggestion that Baal is away on a trip or deep in sleep comes precariously close to the truth as viewed by the prophets.</p>
