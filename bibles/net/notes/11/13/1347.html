<A NAME="1347"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=821><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has &#8220;because&#8221; at the beginning of the sentence. In the Hebrew text vv. 21-22 are one long sentence comprised of a causal clause giving the reason for divine punishment (vv. 21-22a) and the main clause announcing the punishment (v. 22b). The translation divides this lengthy sentence for stylistic reasons.</p>
