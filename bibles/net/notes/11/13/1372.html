<A NAME="1372"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=846><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Samaria.&#8221; The name of Israel&#8217;s capital city here stands for the northern kingdom as a whole. Actually Samaria was not built and named until several years after this (see 1 Kgs 16:24), so it is likely that the author of Kings, writing at a later time, is here adapting the old prophet&#8217;s original statement. </p>
