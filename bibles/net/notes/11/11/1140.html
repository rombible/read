<A NAME="1140"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=691><b>sn</b> <i>So Hadad asked Pharaoh</i>&#8230;<i> </i>This lengthy description of Hadad&#8217;s exile in Egypt explains why Hadad wanted to oppose Solomon and supports the author&#8217;s thesis that his hostility to Solomon found its ultimate source in divine providence. Though Hadad enjoyed a comfortable life in Egypt, when the <sc>Lord raised him up (apparently stirring up his desire for vengeance) he decided to leave the comforts of Egypt and return to Edom.</p>
