<A NAME="1031"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=633><b>sn</b> <i>The Palace of the Lebanon Forest. </i>This name was appropriate because of the large amount of cedar, undoubtedly brought from Lebanon, used in its construction. The cedar pillars in the palace must have given it the appearance of a forest.</p>
