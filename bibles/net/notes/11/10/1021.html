<A NAME="1021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=623><b>tn</b> This Hebrew architectural term occurs only here. The meaning is uncertain; some have suggested &#8220;banisters&#8221; or &#8220;parapets&#8221;; cf. TEV, NLT &#8220;railings.&#8221; The parallel passage in 2 Chr 9:11 has a different word, meaning &#8220;tracks,&#8221; or perhaps &#8220;steps.&#8221;</p>
