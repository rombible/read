<A NAME="147"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=857><b>sn</b> <i>Tell her so-and-so</i>. Certainly the <sc>Lord gave Ahijah a specific message to give to Jeroboam&#8217;s wife (see vv. 6-16), but the author of Kings here condenses the <sc>Lord&#8217;s message with the words &#8220;so-and-so.&#8221; For dramatic effect he prefers to have us hear the message from Ahijah&#8217;s lips as he speaks to the king&#8217;s wife.</p>
