<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1212><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the word of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; Jehoshaphat is requesting a prophetic oracle revealing the Lord&#8217;s will in the matter and their prospects for success. For examples of such oracles, see 2 Sam 5:19, 23-24.</p>
<A NAME="227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1213><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Should I go against Ramoth Gilead for war or should I refrain?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1214><b>tn</b> Though Jehoshaphat requested an oracle from &#8220;the <sc>Lord&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">Yahweh</font>), they stop short of actually using this name and substitute the title <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adonai</font>, &#8220;lord; master&#8221;). This ambiguity may explain in part Jehoshaphat&#8217;s hesitancy and caution (vv. 7-8). He seems to doubt that the four hundred are genuine prophets of the <sc>Lord.</p>
<A NAME="229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1215><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to seek the <sc>Lord from him.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="2214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1220><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the words of the prophets are [with] one mouth good for the king.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1221><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;let your words be like the word of each of them and speak good.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1222><b>sn</b> <i>&#8220;Attack! You will succeed; the <sc>Lord will hand it over to the king.&#8221; </i>One does not expect Micaiah, having just vowed to speak only what the Lord tells him, to agree with the other prophets and give the king an inaccurate prophecy. Micaiah&#8217;s actions became understandable later, when it is revealed that the <sc>Lord desires to deceive the king and lead him to his demise. The <sc>Lord even dispatches a lying spirit to deceive Ahab&#8217;s prophets. Micaiah can lie to the king because he realizes this lie is from the <sc>Lord. It is important to note that in v. 14 Micaiah only vows to speak the word of the <sc>Lord; he does not necessarily say he will tell the truth. In this case the <sc>Lord&#8217;s word itself is deceptive. Only when the king adjures him to tell the truth (v. 16), does Micaiah do so.</p>
<A NAME="2217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1223><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;swear an oath by.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1224><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Micaiah) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1225><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Micaiah) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1226><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and fall.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1227><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the spirit.&#8221; The significance of the article prefixed to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ruakh</font>) is uncertain, but it could contain a clue as to this spirit&#8217;s identity, especially when interpreted in light of v. 24. It is certainly possible, and probably even likely, that the article is used in a generic or dramatic sense and should be translated, &#8220;a spirit.&#8221; In the latter case it would show that this spirit was vivid and definite in the mind of Micaiah the storyteller. However, if one insists that the article indicates a well-known or universally known spirit, the following context provides a likely referent. Verse 24 tells how Zedekiah slapped Micaiah in the face and then asked sarcastically, &#8220;Which way did the spirit from the <sc>Lord (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;&#1470;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, [<font face="Scholar">ruakh-Yahweh</font>], <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the spirit of the <sc>Lord&#8221;) go when he went from me to speak to you?&#8221; When the phrase &#8220;the spirit of the <sc>Lord&#8221; refers to the divine spirit (rather than the divine breath or mind, Isa 40:7, 13) elsewhere, the spirit energizes an individual or group for special tasks or moves one to prophesy. This raises the possibility that the deceiving spirit of vv. 20-23 is the same as the divine spirit mentioned by Zedekiah in v. 24. This would explain why the article is used on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font>; he can be called &#8220;the spirit&#8221; because he is the well-known spirit who energizes the prophets.</p>
<A NAME="2222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1228><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (the <sc>Lord) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1229><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has two imperfects connected by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1490;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿgam</font>). These verbs could be translated as specific futures, &#8220;you will deceive and also you will prevail,&#8221; in which case the <sc>Lord is assuring the spirit of success on his mission. However, in a commissioning context (note the following imperatives) such as this, it is more likely that the imperfects are injunctive, in which case one could translate, &#8220;Deceive, and also overpower.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1230><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the bread of affliction and the water of affliction.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="2227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1233><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verbal forms could be imperatives (&#8220;Disguise yourself and enter&#8221;), but this would make no sense in light of the immediately following context. The forms are better interpreted as infinitives absolute functioning as cohortatives. See <i>IBHS</i> 594 §35.5.2a. Some prefer to emend the forms to imperfects.</p>
