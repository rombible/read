If retained, perhaps it should be translated, &#8220;because of the reputation of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The phrase, which is omitted in the parallel passage in 2 Chr 9:1, may be an addition based on the queen&#8217;s declaration of praise to the <sc>Lord in v. 9.</p>

When used of metals it can refer to a disk-shaped weight made of the metal or to a standard unit of weight, generally regarded as a talent. Since the accepted weight for a talent of metal is about 75 pounds, this would have amounted to about 50,000 pounds of gold (cf. NCV); CEV, NLT &#8220;twenty-five tons&#8221;; TEV &#8220;almost 23,000 kilogrammes.&#8221;</p>
