<A NAME="419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=257><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has &#8220;40,000,&#8221; but this is probably an inflated number (nevertheless it is followed by KJV, ASV, NASB, NRSV, TEV, CEV). Some Greek <sc>mss of the OT and the parallel in 2 Chr 9:25 read &#8220;4,000&#8221; (cf. NAB, NIV, NCV, NLT).</p>
