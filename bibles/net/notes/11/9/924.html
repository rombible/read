<A NAME="924"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=578><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he called them the land of Cabul to this day.&#8221; The significance of the name is unclear, though it appears to be disparaging. The name may be derived from a root, attested in Akkadian and Arabic, meaning &#8220;bound&#8221; or &#8220;restricted.&#8221; Some propose a wordplay, pointing out that the name &#8220;Cabul&#8221; sounds like a Hebrew phrase meaning, &#8220;like not,&#8221; or &#8220;as good as nothing.&#8221;</p>
