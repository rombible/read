<A NAME="91"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=555><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and all the desire of Solomon which he wanted to do.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="92"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=556><b>sn</b> <i>In the same way he had appeared to him at Gibeon. </i>See 1 Kgs 3:5.</p>
<A NAME="93"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=557><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I have heard.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="94"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=558><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;by placing my name there perpetually&#8221; (or perhaps, &#8220;forever&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="95"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=559><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and my eyes and my heart will be there all the days.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="96"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=560><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;As for you, if you walk before me, as David your father walked, in integrity of heart and in uprightness, by doing all which I commanded you, [and] you keep my rules and my regulations.&#8221; Verse 4 is actually a lengthy protasis (&#8220;if&#8221; section) of a conditional sentence, the apodosis (&#8220;then&#8221; section) of which appears in v. 5.</p>
<A NAME="97"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=561><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="98"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=562><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;there will not be cut off from you a man from upon the throne of Israel.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="99"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=563><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;which I placed before you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="910"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=564><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and walk and serve other gods and bow down to them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=565><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will cut off Israel from upon the surface of the land.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=566><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the temple which I consecrated for my name I will send away from before my face.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Instead of &#8220;I will send away,&#8221; the parallel text in 2 Chr 7:20 has &#8220;I will throw away.&#8221; The two verbs sound very similar in Hebrew, so the discrepancy is likely due to an oral transmissional error.</p>
<A NAME="913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=567><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;will become a proverb and a taunt,&#8221; that is, a proverbial example of destruction and an object of reproach.</p>
<A NAME="914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=568><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and this house will be high [or elevated].&#8221; The statement makes little sense in this context, which predicts the desolation that judgment will bring. Some treat the clause as concessive, &#8220;Even though this temple is lofty [now].&#8221; Others, following the lead of several ancient versions, emend the text to, &#8220;this temple will become a heap of ruins.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=569><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;hiss,&#8221; or perhaps &#8220;whistle.&#8221; This refers to a derisive sound one would make when taunting an object of ridicule. </p>
<A NAME="916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=570><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they will say.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="917"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=571><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fathers.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=572><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they took hold of other gods and bowed down to them and served them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=573><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the two houses, the house of the <sc>Lord and the house of the king.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="920"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=574><b>map</b> For location see Map1-A2; Map2-G2; Map4-A1; JP3-F3; JP4-F3.</p>

<A NAME="923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=577><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my brother.&#8221; Kings allied through a parity treaty would sometimes address each other as &#8220;my brother.&#8221; See 1 Kgs 20:32-33.</p>
<A NAME="924"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=578><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he called them the land of Cabul to this day.&#8221; The significance of the name is unclear, though it appears to be disparaging. The name may be derived from a root, attested in Akkadian and Arabic, meaning &#8220;bound&#8221; or &#8220;restricted.&#8221; Some propose a wordplay, pointing out that the name &#8220;Cabul&#8221; sounds like a Hebrew phrase meaning, &#8220;like not,&#8221; or &#8220;as good as nothing.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=579><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kikkar</font>, &#8220;circle&#8221;) refers generally to something that is round. When used of metals it can refer to a disk-shaped weight made of the metal or to a standard unit of weight, generally regarded as a talent. Since the accepted weight for a talent of metal is about 75 pounds, this would have amounted to about 9,000 pounds of gold (cf. NCV, NLT); CEV &#8220;five tons&#8221;; TEV &#8220;4,000 kilogrammes.&#8221;</p>
