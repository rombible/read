<A NAME="2036"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1130><b>tn</b> The noun translated &#8220;small flocks&#8221; occurs only here. The common interpretation derives the word from the verbal root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1513;&#1474;&#1507;</font>, &#8220;to strip off; to make bare.&#8221; In this case the noun refers to something &#8220;stripped off&#8221; or &#8220;made bare.&#8221; <i>HALOT</i> 359 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1513;&#1474;&#1507;</font> derives the noun from a proposed homonymic verbal root (which occurs only in Ps 29:9) meaning &#8220;cause a premature birth.&#8221; In this case the derived noun could refer to goats that are undersized because they are born prematurely. </p>
