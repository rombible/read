<A NAME="2052"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=1146><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will send you away with a treaty.&#8221; The words &#8220;Ahab then said&#8221; are supplied in the translation. There is nothing in the Hebrew text to indicate that the speaker has changed from Ben Hadad to Ahab. Some suggest adding &#8220;and he said&#8221; before &#8220;I will send you away.&#8221; Others prefer to maintain Ben Hadad as the speaker and change the statement to, &#8220;Please send me away with a treaty.&#8221;</p>
