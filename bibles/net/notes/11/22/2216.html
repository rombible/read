<A NAME="2216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1222><b>sn</b> <i>&#8220;Attack! You will succeed; the <sc>Lord will hand it over to the king.&#8221; </i>One does not expect Micaiah, having just vowed to speak only what the Lord tells him, to agree with the other prophets and give the king an inaccurate prophecy. Micaiah&#8217;s actions became understandable later, when it is revealed that the <sc>Lord desires to deceive the king and lead him to his demise. The <sc>Lord even dispatches a lying spirit to deceive Ahab&#8217;s prophets. Micaiah can lie to the king because he realizes this lie is from the <sc>Lord. It is important to note that in v. 14 Micaiah only vows to speak the word of the <sc>Lord; he does not necessarily say he will tell the truth. In this case the <sc>Lord&#8217;s word itself is deceptive. Only when the king adjures him to tell the truth (v. 16), does Micaiah do so.</p>
