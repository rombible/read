<A NAME="2221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1227><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the spirit.&#8221; The significance of the article prefixed to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ruakh</font>) is uncertain, but it could contain a clue as to this spirit&#8217;s identity, especially when interpreted in light of v. 24. It is certainly possible, and probably even likely, that the article is used in a generic or dramatic sense and should be translated, &#8220;a spirit.&#8221; In the latter case it would show that this spirit was vivid and definite in the mind of Micaiah the storyteller. However, if one insists that the article indicates a well-known or universally known spirit, the following context provides a likely referent. Verse 24 tells how Zedekiah slapped Micaiah in the face and then asked sarcastically, &#8220;Which way did the spirit from the <sc>Lord (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;&#1470;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, [<font face="Scholar">ruakh-Yahweh</font>], <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the spirit of the <sc>Lord&#8221;) go when he went from me to speak to you?&#8221; When the phrase &#8220;the spirit of the <sc>Lord&#8221; refers to the divine spirit (rather than the divine breath or mind, Isa 40:7, 13) elsewhere, the spirit energizes an individual or group for special tasks or moves one to prophesy. This raises the possibility that the deceiving spirit of vv. 20-23 is the same as the divine spirit mentioned by Zedekiah in v. 24. This would explain why the article is used on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font>; he can be called &#8220;the spirit&#8221; because he is the well-known spirit who energizes the prophets.</p>
