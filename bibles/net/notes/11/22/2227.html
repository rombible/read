<A NAME="2227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1233><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verbal forms could be imperatives (&#8220;Disguise yourself and enter&#8221;), but this would make no sense in light of the immediately following context. The forms are better interpreted as infinitives absolute functioning as cohortatives. See <i>IBHS</i> 594 §35.5.2a. Some prefer to emend the forms to imperfects.</p>
