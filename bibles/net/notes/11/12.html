<A NAME="121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=725><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;come [to].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=726><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;him&#8221;; the referent (Rehoboam) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=727><b>tc</b> Verse 2 is not included in the Old Greek translation. See the note on 11:43.</p>
<A NAME="124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=728><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Jeroboam lived in Egypt.&#8221; The parallel text in 2 Chr 10:2 reads, &#8220;and Jeroboam returned from Egypt.&#8221; In a purely consonantal text the forms &#8220;and he lived&#8221; and &#8220;and he returned&#8221; are identical (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;</font>).</p>
<A NAME="125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=729><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;They sent and called for him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=730><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;made our yoke burdensome.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=731><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;but you, now, lighten the burdensome work of your father and the heavy yoke which he placed on us, and we will serve you.&#8221; In the Hebrew text the prefixed verbal form with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1491;&#1462;&#1498;&#1464;</font>, [<font face="Scholar">vÿna</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avdekha</font>] &#8220;and we will serve you&#8221;) following the imperative (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1511;&#1461;&#1500;</font> [<font face="Scholar">haqel</font>], &#8220;lighten&#8221;) indicates purpose (or result). The conditional sentence used in the translation above is an attempt to bring out the logical relationship between these forms.</p>
<A NAME="128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=732><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;stood before.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=733><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;saying.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=734><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;If today you are a servant to these people and you serve them and answer them and speak to them good words, they will be your servants all the days.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=735><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;He rejected the advice of the elders which they advised and he consulted the young men with whom he had grown up, who stood before him.&#8221; The referent (Rehoboam) of the initial pronoun (&#8220;he&#8221;) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=736><b>tn</b> In the Hebrew text the verb &#8220;we will respond&#8221; is plural, although it can be understood as an editorial &#8220;we.&#8221; The ancient versions have the singular here.</p>
<A NAME="1213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=737><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Lighten the yoke which your father placed on us.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=738><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Rehoboam) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=739><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Your father made our yoke heavy, but make it lighter upon us.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=740><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;My little one is thicker than my father&#8217;s hips.&#8221; The referent of &#8220;my little one&#8221; is not clear. The traditional view is that it refers to the little finger. As the following statement makes clear, Rehoboam&#8217;s point is that he is more harsh and demanding than his father.</p>
<A NAME="1217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=741><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and now my father placed upon you a heavy yoke, but I will add to your yoke.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=742><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;My father punished you with whips, but I will punish you with scorpions.&#8221; &#8220;Scorpions&#8221; might allude to some type of torture using poisonous insects, but more likely it refers to a type of whip that inflicts an especially biting, painful wound. Cf. CEV &#8220;whips with pieces of sharp metal.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=743><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;came.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=747><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;because this turn of events was from the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=748><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;so that he might bring to pass his word which the <sc>Lord spoke.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=749><b>sn</b> <i>We have no portion in David; no share in the son of Jesse. </i>Their point seems to be that they have no familial relationship with David that brings them any benefits or places upon them any obligations. They are being treated like outsiders. </p>
<A NAME="1226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=750><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to your tents, Israel.&#8221; The word &#8220;return&#8221; is supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>

<A NAME="1229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=753><b>tc</b> The MT has &#8220;Adoram&#8221; here, but the Old Greek translation and Syriac Peshitta have &#8220;Adoniram.&#8221; Cf. 1 Kgs 4:6.</p>
<A NAME="1230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=754><b>sn</b> <i>The work crews. </i>See the note on this expression in 4:6.</p>

<A NAME="1232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=756><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;there was no one [following] after the house of David except the tribe of Judah, it alone.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=763><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Now the kingdom could return to the house of David.&#8221; The imperfect verbal form translated &#8220;could return&#8221; is understood as having a potential force here.

<A NAME="1247"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=771><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has the singular, but the plural is preferable here (see 1 Kgs 13:32). The Old Greek translation and the Vulgate have the plural.</p>
