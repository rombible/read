<A NAME="171"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=880><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the son of ninety-nine years.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="172"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=881><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;appeared to Abram and said to him.&#8221; The proper name has been replaced by the pronoun (&#8220;him&#8221;) and the final phrase &#8220;to him&#8221; has been left untranslated for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="173"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=882><b>tn</b> The name <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500; &#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el shadday</font>, &#8220;El Shaddai&#8221;) has often been translated &#8220;God Almighty,&#8221; primarily because Jerome translated it <i>omnipotens</i> (&#8220;all powerful&#8221;) in the Latin Vulgate. There has been much debate over the meaning of the name. For discussion see W. F. Albright,<i> </i>&#8220;The Names <i>Shaddai</i> and <i>Abram</i>,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 54 (1935): 173-210; R. Gordis, &#8220;The Biblical Root <i>sdy-sd</i>,&#8221; <i>JTS</i> 41 (1940): 34-43; and especially T. N. D. Mettinger, <i>In Search of God</i>, 69-72. Shaddai/El Shaddai is the sovereign king of the world who grants, blesses, and judges. In the Book of Genesis he blesses the patriarchs with fertility and promises numerous descendants. Outside Genesis he both blesses/protects and takes away life/happiness. The patriarchs knew God primarily as El Shaddai (Exod 6:3). While the origin and meaning of this name are uncertain (see discussion below) its significance is clear. The name is used in contexts where God appears as the source of fertility and life. In Gen 17:1-8 he appeared to Abram, introduced himself as El Shaddai, and announced his intention to make the patriarch fruitful. In the role of El Shaddai God repeated these words (now elevated to the status of a decree) to Jacob (35:11). Earlier Isaac had pronounced a blessing on Jacob in which he asked El Shaddai to make Jacob fruitful (28:3). Jacob later prayed that his sons would be treated with mercy when they returned to Egypt with Benjamin (43:14). The fertility theme is not as apparent here, though one must remember that Jacob viewed Benjamin as the sole remaining son of the favored and once-barren Rachel (see 29:31; 30:22-24; 35:16-18). It is quite natural that he would appeal to El Shaddai to preserve Benjamin&#8217;s life, for it was El Shaddai&#8217;s miraculous power which made it possible for Rachel to give him sons in the first place. In 48:3 Jacob, prior to blessing Joseph&#8217;s sons, told him how El Shaddai appeared to him at Bethel (see Gen 28) and promised to make him fruitful. When blessing Joseph on his deathbed Jacob referred to Shaddai (we should probably read &#8220;El Shaddai,&#8221; along with a few Hebrew <sc>mss, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the LXX, and Syriac) as the one who provides abundant blessings, including &#8220;blessings of the breast and womb&#8221; (49:25). (The direct association of the name with &#8220;breasts&#8221; suggests the name might mean &#8220;the one of the breast&#8221; [i.e., the one who gives fertility], but the juxtaposition is probably better explained as wordplay. Note the wordplay involving the name and the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shadad</font>, &#8220;destroy&#8221;] in Isa 13:6 and in Joel 1:15.) Outside Genesis the name Shaddai (minus the element &#8220;El&#8221; [&#8220;God&#8221;]) is normally used when God is viewed as the sovereign king who blesses/protects or curses/brings judgment. The name appears in the introduction to two of Balaam&#8217;s oracles (Num 24:4, 16) of blessing upon Israel. Naomi employs the name when accusing the Lord of treating her bitterly by taking the lives of her husband and sons (Ruth 1:20-21). In Ps 68:14; Isa 13:6; and Joel 1:15 Shaddai judges his enemies through warfare, while Ps 91:1 depicts him as the protector of his people. (In Ezek 1:24 and 10:5 the sound of the cherubs&#8217; wings is compared to Shaddai&#8217;s powerful voice. The reference may be to the mighty divine warrior&#8217;s battle cry which accompanies his angry judgment.) Finally, the name occurs 31 times in the Book of Job. Job and his &#8220;friends&#8221; assume that Shaddai is the sovereign king of the world (11:7; 37:23a) who is the source of life (33:4b) and is responsible for maintaining justice (8:3; 34:10-12; 37:23b). He provides abundant blessings, including children (22:17-18; 29:4-6), but he can also discipline, punish, and destroy (5:17; 6:4; 21:20; 23:16). It is not surprising to see the name so often in this book, where the theme of God&#8217;s justice is primary and even called into question (24:1; 27:2). The most likely proposal is that the name means &#8220;God, the one of the mountain&#8221; (an Akkadian cognate means &#8220;mountain,&#8221; to which the Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shad</font>, &#8220;breast&#8221;] is probably related). For a discussion of proposed derivations see T. N. D. Mettinger, <i>In Search of God</i>, 70-71. The name may originally have depicted God as the sovereign judge who, in Canaanite style, ruled from a sacred mountain. Isa 14:13 and Ezek 28:14, 16 associate such a mountain with God, while Ps 48:2 refers to Zion as &#8220;Zaphon,&#8221; the Canaanite Olympus from which the high god El ruled. (In Isa 14 the Canaanite god El may be in view. Note that Isaiah pictures pagan kings as taunting the king of Babylon, suggesting that pagan mythology may provide the background for the language and imagery.)</p>
<A NAME="174"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=883><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Live out your life.&#8221; The Hebrew verb translated &#8220;walk&#8221; is the Hitpael; it means &#8220;to walk back and forth; to walk about; to live out one&#8217;s life.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="175"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=884><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;in my presence.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="176"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=885><b>tn</b> There are two imperatives here: &#8220;walk&#8230;and be blameless [or &#8220;perfect&#8221;].&#8221; The second imperative may be purely sequential (see the translation) or consequential: &#8220;walk before me and then you will be blameless.&#8221; How one interprets the sequence depends on the meaning of &#8220;walk before&#8221;: (1) If it simply refers in a neutral way to serving the <sc>Lord, then the second imperative is likely sequential. (2) But if it has a positive moral connotation (&#8220;serve me faithfully&#8221;), then the second imperative probably indicates purpose (or result). For other uses of the idiom see 1 Sam 2:30, 35 and 12:2 (where it occurs twice).</p>
<A NAME="177"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=886><b>tn</b> Following the imperative, the cohortative indicates consequence. If Abram is blameless, then the <sc>Lord will ratify the covenant. Earlier the <sc>Lord ratified part of his promise to Abram (see Gen 15:18-21), guaranteeing him that his descendants would live in the land. But the expanded form of the promise, which includes numerous descendants and eternal possession of the land, remains to be ratified. This expanded form of the promise is in view here (see vv. 2b, 4-8). See the note at Gen 15:18 and R. B. Chisholm, &#8220;Evidence from Genesis,&#8221; <i>A Case for Premillennialism</i>, 35-54.</p>
<A NAME="178"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=887><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will multiply you exceedingly, exceedingly.&#8221; The repetition is emphatic.</p>
<A NAME="179"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=888><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And Abram fell on his face.&#8221; This expression probably means that Abram sank to his knees and put his forehead to the ground, although it is possible that he completely prostrated himself. In either case the posture indicates humility and reverence.</p>
<A NAME="1710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=889><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;God spoke to him, saying.&#8221; This is redundant in contemporary English and has been simplified in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="1711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=890><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=891><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;is&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>).</p>
<A NAME="1713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=892><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;will your name be called.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=893><b>sn</b> <i>Your name will be Abraham</i>. The renaming of Abram was a sign of confirmation to the patriarch. Every time the name was used it would be a reminder of God&#8217;s promise. &#8220;Abram&#8221; means &#8220;exalted father,&#8221; probably referring to Abram&#8217;s father Terah. The name looks to the past; Abram came from noble lineage. The name &#8220;Abraham&#8221; is a dialectical variant of the name Abram. But its significance is in the wordplay with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1489;&#1470;&#1492;&#1458;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">av-hamon</font>, &#8220;the father of a multitude,&#8221; which sounds like <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">avraham</font>, &#8220;Abraham&#8221;). The new name would be a reminder of God&#8217;s intention to make Abraham the father of a multitude. For a general discussion of renaming, see O. Eissfeldt, &#8220;Renaming in the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>Words and Meanings</i>, 70-83.</p>
<A NAME="1715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=894><b>tn</b> The perfect verbal form is used here in a rhetorical manner to emphasize God&#8217;s intention.</p>
<A NAME="1716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=895><b>tn</b> This verb starts a series of perfect verbal forms with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive to express God&#8217;s intentions.</p>
<A NAME="1717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=896><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;exceedingly, exceedingly.&#8221; The repetition is emphatic.</p>

<A NAME="1719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=898><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qum</font>, &#8220;to arise, to stand up&#8221;) in the Hiphil verbal stem means &#8220;to confirm, to give effect to, to carry out&#8221; (i.e., a covenant or oath; see BDB 878-79 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</font>).</p>
<A NAME="1720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=899><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;as an eternal.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1721"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=900><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to be to you for God and to your descendants after you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1722"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=901><b>tn</b> The verbal root is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gur</font>, &#8220;to sojourn, to reside temporarily,&#8221; i.e., as a resident alien). It is the land in which Abram resides, but does not yet possess as his very own.</p>

<A NAME="1724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=903><b>tn</b> The imperfect tense could be translated &#8220;you shall keep&#8221; as a binding command; but the obligatory nuance (&#8220;must&#8221;) captures the binding sense better.</p>
<A NAME="1725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=904><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my covenant.&#8221; The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿrit</font>) can refer to (1) the agreement itself between two parties (see v. 7), (2) the promise made by one party to another (see vv. 2-3, 7), (3) an obligation placed by one party on another, or (4) a reminder of the agreement. In vv. 9-10 the word refers to a covenantal obligation which God gives to Abraham and his descendants.</p>
<A NAME="1726"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=905><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;This is my covenant that you must keep between me and you and your descendants after you.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1731"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=910><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my covenant.&#8221; Here in v. 13 the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿrit</font>) refers to the outward, visible sign, or reminder, of the covenant. For the range of meaning of the term, see the note on the word &#8220;requirement&#8221; in v. 9.</p>
<A NAME="1732"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=911><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;an eternal.&#8221;</p>

An entire tractate in the Mishnah is devoted to this subject (tractate <i>Keritot</i>). Being ostracized from the community is involved at the least, but it is not certain whether this refers to the death penalty.</p>
<A NAME="1735"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=914><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he has broken my covenant.&#8221; The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿrit</font>) here refers to the obligation required by God in conjunction with the covenantal agreement.

<A NAME="1737"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=916><b>sn</b> <i>Sarah</i>. The name change seems to be a dialectical variation, both spellings meaning &#8220;princess&#8221; or &#8220;queen.&#8221; Like the name Abram, the name Sarai symbolized the past. The new name Sarah, like the name Abraham, would be a reminder of what God intended to do for Sarah in the future.</p>
