<A NAME="1131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=624><b>sn</b> The name <i>Milcah</i> means &#8220;Queen.&#8221; But more to the point here is the fact that <i>Malkatu</i> was a title for Ishtar, the daughter of the moon god. If the women were named after such titles (and there is no evidence that this was the motivation for naming the girls &#8220;Princess&#8221; or &#8220;Queen&#8221;), that would not necessarily imply anything about the faith of the two women themselves.</p>
