<A NAME="1126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=619><b>tc</b> The reading of the MT is followed in vv. 11-12; the LXX reads, &#8220;And [= when] Arphaxad had lived thirty-five years, [and] he fathered [= became the father of] Cainan. And after he fathered [= became the father of] Cainan, Arphaxad lived four hundred and thirty years and fathered [= had] [other] sons and daughters, and [then] he died. And [= when] Cainan had lived one hundred and thirty years, [and] he fathered [= became the father of] Sala [= Shelah]. And after he fathered [= became the father of] Sala [= Shelah], Cainan lived three hundred and thirty years and fathered [= had] [other] sons and daughters, and [then] he died.&#8221; See also the note on &#8220;Shelah&#8221; in Gen 10:24; the LXX reading also appears to lie behind Luke 3:35-36.</p>
