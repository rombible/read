Here &#8220;earth&#8221; is a metonymy of subject, referring to the people who lived in the earth. Genesis 11 begins with everyone speaking a common language, but chap. 10 has the nations arranged by languages. It is part of the narrative art of Genesis to give the explanation of the event after the narration of the event. On this passage see A. P. Ross, &#8220;The Dispersion of the Nations in Genesis 11:1-9,&#8221; <i>BSac</i> 138 (1981): 119-38.</p>
