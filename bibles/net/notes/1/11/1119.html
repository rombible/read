<A NAME="1119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=612><b>tn</b> The cohortatives mirror the cohortatives of the people. They build to ascend the heavens; God comes down to destroy their language. God speaks here to his angelic assembly. See the notes on the word &#8220;make&#8221; in 1:26 and &#8220;know&#8221; in 3:5, as well as <i>Jub.</i> 10:22-23, where an angel recounts this incident and says &#8220;And the <sc>Lord our God said to us&#8230;. And the <sc>Lord went down and we went down with him. And we saw the city and the tower which the sons of men built.&#8221; On the chiastic structure of the story, see G. J. Wenham, <i>Genesis</i> (WBC), 1:235.</p>
