<A NAME="1113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=606><b>sn</b> The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1464;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pavats</font>, translated &#8220;scatter&#8221;) is a key term in this passage. The focal point of the account is the dispersion (&#8220;scattering&#8221;) of the nations rather than the Tower of Babel. But the passage also forms a polemic against Babylon, the pride of the east and a cosmopolitan center with a huge ziggurat. To the Hebrews it was a monument to the judgment of God on pride.</p>
