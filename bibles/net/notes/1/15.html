<A NAME="151"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=778><b>sn</b> The noun &#8220;shield&#8221; recalls the words of Melchizedek in 14:20. If God is the shield, then God will deliver. Abram need not fear reprisals from those he has fought.</p>
<A NAME="152"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=779><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your reward [in] great abundance.&#8221; When the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; &#1502;&#1456;&#1488;&#1465;&#1491;&#1461;</font> (<font face="Scholar">harbeh mÿod</font>) follows a noun it invariably modifies the noun and carries the nuance &#8220;very great&#8221; or &#8220;in great abundance.&#8221; (See its use in Gen 41:49; Deut 3:5; Josh 22:8; 2 Sam 8:8; 12:2; 1 Kgs 4:29; 10:10-11; 2 Chr 14:13; 32:27; Jer 40:12.) Here the noun &#8220;reward&#8221; is in apposition to &#8220;shield&#8221; and refers by metonymy to God as the source of the reward. Some translate here &#8220;your reward will be very great&#8221; (cf. NASB, NRSV), taking the statement as an independent clause and understanding the Hiphil infinitive absolute as a substitute for a finite verb. However, the construction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; &#1502;&#1456;&#1488;&#1465;&#1491;&#1461;</font> is never used this way elsewhere, where it either modifies a noun (see the texts listed above) or serves as an adverb in relation to a finite verb (see Josh 13:1; 1 Sam 26:21; 2 Sam 12:30; 2 Kgs 21:16; 1 Chr 20:2; Neh 2:2).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Abram has just rejected all the spoils of war, and the <sc>Lord promises to reward him <i>in great abundance</i>. In walking by faith and living with integrity he cannot lose.</p>
<A NAME="153"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=780><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497; &#1497;&#1457;&#1492;&#1493;&#1460;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adonay yehvih</font>, &#8220;Master, <sc>Lord&#8221;). Since the tetragrammaton (<i>YHWH</i>) usually is pointed with the vowels for the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adonay</font>, &#8220;master&#8221;) to avoid pronouncing the divine name, that would lead in this place to a repetition of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;</font>. So the tetragrammaton is here pointed with the vowels for the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohim</font>, &#8220;God&#8221;) instead. That would produce the reading of the Hebrew as &#8220;Master, God&#8221; in the Jewish textual tradition. But the presence of &#8220;Master&#8221; before the holy name is rather compelling evidence that the original would have been &#8220;Master, <sc>Lord,&#8221; which is rendered here &#8220;sovereign <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="154"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=781><b>tn</b> The <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) disjunctive at the beginning of the clause is circumstantial, expressing the cause or reason.</p>
<A NAME="155"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=782><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I am going.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="156"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=783><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the son of the acquisition of my house.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> For the custom of designating a member of the household as <i>heir</i>, see C. H. Gordon, &#8220;Biblical Customs and the Nuzu Tablets,&#8221; <i>Biblical Archaeologist Reader</i>, 2:21-33.</p>
<A NAME="157"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=784><b>tn</b> The pronoun is anaphoric here, equivalent to the verb &#8220;to be&#8221; (R. J. Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 23, §115).</p>
<A NAME="158"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=785><b>sn</b> The sentence in the Hebrew text employs a very effective wordplay on the name <i>Damascus</i>: &#8220;The son of the acquisition (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;&#1502;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1511;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ben-mesheq</font>) of my house is Eliezer of Damascus (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1511;</font>, <font face="Scholar">dammesheq</font>).&#8221; The words are not the same; they have different sibilants. But the sound play gives the impression that &#8220;in the nomen is the omen.&#8221; Eliezer the Damascene will be Abram&#8217;s heir if Abram dies childless because &#8220;Damascus&#8221; seems to mean that. See M. F. Unger, &#8220;Some Comments on the Text of Genesis 15:2-3,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 72 (1953): 49-50; H. L. Ginsberg, &#8220;Abram&#8217;s &#8216;Damascene&#8217; Steward,&#8221; <i>BASOR</i> 200 (1970): 31-32.</p>
<A NAME="159"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=786><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And Abram said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=787><b>tn</b> The construction uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hen</font>) to introduce the foundational clause (&#8220;since&#8230;&#8221;), and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿhinneh</font>) to introduce the main clause (&#8220;then look&#8230;&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=788><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;is inheriting me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=789><b>tn</b> The disjunctive draws attention to God&#8217;s response and the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>, translated &#8220;look&#8221;) mirrors Abram&#8217;s statement in v. 3 and highlights the fact that God responded to Abram.</p>
<A NAME="1513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=790><b>tn</b> The subject of the verb is the demonstrative pronoun, which can be translated &#8220;this one&#8221; or &#8220;this man.&#8221; That the <sc>Lord does not mention him by name is significant; often in ancient times the use of the name would bring legitimacy to inheritance and adoption cases.</p>
<A NAME="1514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=791><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;inherit you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=792><b>tn</b> The Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki-</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>) forms a very strong adversative.</p>
<A NAME="1516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=793><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he who&#8221;; the implied referent (Abram&#8217;s unborn son who will be his heir) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=794><b>tn</b> The pronoun could also be an emphatic subject: &#8220;whoever comes out of your body, <i>he</i> will inherit you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=795><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;will inherit you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=796><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (the <sc>Lord) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=797><b>tn</b> The nonconsecutive <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) is on a perfect verbal form. If the composer of the narrative had wanted to show simple sequence, he would have used the <i>vav</i> consecutive with the preterite. The perfect with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> conjunctive (where one expects the preterite with <i>vav </i>consecutive) in narrative contexts can have a variety of discourse functions, but here it probably serves to highlight Abram&#8217;s response to God&#8217;s promise. For a detailed discussion of the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> + perfect construction in Hebrew narrative, see R. Longacre, &#8220;<i>Weqatal</i> Forms in Biblical Hebrew Prose: A Discourse-modular Approach,&#8221; <i>Biblical Hebrew and Discourse Linguistics</i>, 50-98. The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aman</font>) means &#8220;to confirm, to support&#8221; in the Qal verbal stem. Its derivative nouns refer to something or someone that/who provides support, such as a &#8220;pillar,&#8221; &#8220;nurse,&#8221; or &#8220;guardian, trustee.&#8221; In the Niphal stem it comes to mean &#8220;to be faithful, to be reliable, to be dependable,&#8221; or &#8220;to be firm, to be sure.&#8221; In the Hiphil, the form used here, it takes on a declarative sense: &#8220;to consider something reliable [or &#8220;dependable&#8221;].&#8221; Abram regarded the God who made this promise as reliable and fully capable of making it a reality.</p>
<A NAME="1521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=798><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he&#8221;; the referent (the <sc>Lord) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1522"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=799><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he reckoned it to him.&#8221; The third feminine singular pronominal suffix refers back to Abram&#8217;s act of faith, mentioned in the preceding clause. On third feminine singular pronouns referring back to verbal ideas see GKC 440-41 §135.<i>p</i>. Some propose taking the suffix as proleptic, anticipating the following feminine noun (&#8220;righteousness&#8221;). In this case one might translate: &#8220;and he reckoned it to him &#8211; [namely] righteousness.&#8221; See O. P. Robertson, &#8220;Genesis 15:6: A New Covenant Exposition of an Old Covenant Text,&#8221; <i>WTJ</i> 42 (1980): 259-89.</p>
<A NAME="1523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=800><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;righteousness&#8221;; or &#8220;evidence of steadfast commitment.&#8221; The noun is an adverbial accusative. The verb translated &#8220;considered&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;reckoned&#8221;) also appears with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsÿdaqah</font>, &#8220;righteousness&#8221;) in Ps 106:31. Alluding to the events recorded in Numbers 25, the psalmist notes that Phinehas&#8217; actions were &#8220;credited to him as righteousness for endless generations to come.&#8221; Reference is made to the unconditional, eternal covenant with which God rewarded Phinehas&#8217; loyalty (Num 25:12-13). So <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1492;</font> seems to carry by metonymy the meaning &#8220;loyal, rewardable behavior&#8221; here, a nuance that fits nicely in Genesis 15, where God responds to Abram&#8217;s faith by formally ratifying his promise to give Abram and his descendants the land. (See R. B. Chisholm, &#8220;Evidence from Genesis,&#8221; <i>A Case for Premillennialism</i>, 40.) In Phoenician and Old Aramaic inscriptions cognate nouns glossed as &#8220;correct, justifiable conduct&#8221; sometimes carry this same semantic nuance (<i>DNWSI</i> 2:962).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This episode is basic to the NT teaching of Paul on justification (Romans 4). Paul weaves this passage and Psalm 32 together, for both use this word. Paul explains that for the one who believes in the <sc>Lord, like Abram, God credits him with righteousness but does not credit his sins against him because he is forgiven. Justification does not mean that the believer is righteous; it means that God credits him with righteousness, so that in the records of heaven (as it were) he is declared righteous. See M. G. Kline, &#8220;Abram&#8217;s Amen,&#8221; <i>WTJ</i> 31 (1968): 1-11.</p>
<A NAME="1524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=801><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And he said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=802><b>sn</b> <i>I am the </i><sc>Lord. The <sc>Lord initiates the covenant-making ceremony with a declaration of who he is and what he has done for Abram. The same form appears at the beginning of the covenant made at Sinai (see Exod 20:1).</p>
<A NAME="1526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=803><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>of the Chaldeans</i> is a later editorial clarification for the readers, designating the location of Ur. From all evidence there would have been no Chaldeans in existence at this early date; they are known in the time of the neo-Babylonian empire in the first millennium <sc>b.c.</></p>
<A NAME="1527"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=804><b>tn</b> Here the <i>vav</i> carries adversative force and is translated &#8220;but.&#8221;</p>

F. Hasel, &#8220;The Meaning of the Animal Rite in Genesis 15,&#8221; <i>JSOT</i> 19 (1981): 61-78.</p>
<A NAME="1535"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=812><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a deep sleep fell on Abram.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1537"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=814><b>tn</b> The Hebrew construction is emphatic, with the Qal infinitive absolute followed by the imperfect from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yada</font>&#8217;, &#8220;know&#8221;). The imperfect here has an obligatory or imperatival force.</p>
<A NAME="1538"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=815><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ger</font>, &#8220;sojourner, stranger&#8221;) is related to the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gur</font>, &#8220;to sojourn, to stay for awhile&#8221;). Abram&#8217;s descendants will stay in a land as resident aliens without rights of citizenship.</p>

The translation &#8220;execute judgment on&#8221; implies that the judgment will certainly be carried out.</p>
<A NAME="1542"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=819><b>tn</b> The <i>vav</i> with the pronoun before the verb calls special attention to the subject in contrast to the preceding subject.</p>

When the chronological factors are considered and the genealogies tabulated, there are four hundred years of bondage.

The <sc>Lord here unconditionally promises that Abram&#8217;s descendants will possess the land, but he does not yet ratify his earlier promises to give Abram a multitude of descendants and eternal possession of the land.
