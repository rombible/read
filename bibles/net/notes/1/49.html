<A NAME="491"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2942><b>tn</b> After the imperative, the cohortative with prefixed <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) indicates purpose/result.</p>
<A NAME="492"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2943><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;in the future&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">akharit hayyamim</font>, &#8220;in the end of days&#8221;) is found most frequently in prophetic passages; it may refer to the end of the age, the eschaton, or to the distant future. The contents of some of the sayings in this chapter stretch from the immediate circumstances to the time of the settlement in the land to the coming of Messiah. There is a great deal of literature on this chapter, including among others C. Armerding, &#8220;The Last Words of Jacob: Genesis 49,&#8221; <i>BSac</i> 112 (1955): 320-28; H. Pehlke, &#8220;An Exegetical and Theological Study of Genesis 49:1-28&#8221; (Th.D. dissertation, Dallas Theological Seminary, 1985); and B. Vawter, &#8220;The Canaanite Background of Genesis 49,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 17 (1955): 1-18.</p>
<A NAME="493"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2944><b>tn</b> The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1494;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pakhaz</font>) only occurs here in the OT. A related verb occurs twice in the prophets (Jer 23:32; Zeph 3:4) for false prophets inventing their messages, and once in Judges for unscrupulous men bribed to murder (Judg 9:4). It would describe Reuben as being &#8220;frothy, boiling, turbulent&#8221; as water. The LXX has &#8220;run riot,&#8221; the Vulgate has &#8220;poured out,&#8221; and <i>Tg. Onq.</i> has &#8220;you followed your own direction.&#8221; It is a reference to Reuben&#8217;s misconduct in Gen 35, but the simile and the rare word invite some speculation. H. Pehlke suggests &#8220;destructive like water,&#8221; for Reuben acted with pride and presumption; see his &#8220;An Exegetical and Theological Study of Genesis 49:1-28&#8221; (Th.D. dissertation, Dallas Theological Seminary, 1985).</p>
<A NAME="494"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2945><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Do not excel!&#8221; The Hiphil of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatar</font>) has this meaning only here. The negated jussive is rhetorical here. Rather than being a command, it anticipates what will transpire. The prophecy says that because of the character of the ancestor, the tribe of Reuben would not have the character to lead (see 1 Chr 5:1).</p>
<A NAME="495"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2946><b>sn</b> This is a euphemism for having sexual intercourse with Jacob&#8217;s wives (see Gen 35:22).</p>
<A NAME="496"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2947><b>tn</b> The last verb is third masculine singular, as if for the first time Jacob told the brothers, or let them know that he knew. For a discussion of this passage see S. Gevirtz, &#8220;The Reprimand of Reuben,&#8221; <i>JNES</i> 30 (1971): 87-98.</p>
<A NAME="497"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2948><b>tn</b> The meaning of the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1499;&#1461;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿkherah</font>) is uncertain. It has been rendered (1) &#8220;habitations&#8221;; (2) &#8220;merchandise&#8221;; (3) &#8220;counsels&#8221;; (4) &#8220;swords&#8221;; (5) &#8220;wedding feasts.&#8221; If it is from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">karat</font>) and formed after noun patterns for instruments and tools (<i>maqtil, miqtil</i> form), then it would refer to &#8220;knives.&#8221; Since the verb is used in Exod 4:25 for circumcision, the idea would be &#8220;their circumcision knives,&#8221; an allusion to the events of Gen 34 (see M. J. Dahood, &#8220;&#8216;MKRTYHM&#8217; in Genesis 49,5,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 23 [1961]: 54-56). Another explanation also connects the word to the events of Gen 34 as a reference to the intended &#8220;wedding feast&#8221; for Dinah which could take place only after the men of Shechem were circumcised (see D. W. Young, &#8220;A Ghost Word in the Testament of Jacob (Gen 49:5)?&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 100 [1981]: 335-422).</p>
<A NAME="498"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2949><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text reads &#8220;my glory,&#8221; but it is preferable to repoint the form and read &#8220;my liver.&#8221; The liver was sometimes viewed as the seat of the emotions and will (see <i>HALOT</i> 456 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1461;&#1491;</font>) for which the heart is the modern equivalent.</p>
<A NAME="499"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2950><b>sn</b> <i>Divide&#8230;scatter</i>. What is predicted here is a division of their tribes. Most commentators see here an anticipation of Levi being in every area but not their own. That may be part of it, but not entirely what the curse intended. These tribes for their ruthless cruelty would be eliminated from the power and prestige of leadership.</p>
<A NAME="4910"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2951><b>sn</b> There is a wordplay here; the name <i>Judah</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yÿhudah</font>) sounds in Hebrew like the verb translated <i>praise</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;&#1464;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yodukha</font>). The wordplay serves to draw attention to the statement as having special significance.</p>
<A NAME="4911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2952><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;from his descendants,&#8221; taking the expression &#8220;from between his feet&#8221; as a euphemism referring to the genitals. In this case the phrase refers by metonymy to those who come forth from his genitals, i.e., his descendants.</p>
<A NAME="4912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2953><b>tn</b> The Hebrew form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shiloh</font>) is a major interpretive problem. There are at least four major options (with many variations and less likely alternatives): (1) Some prefer to leave the text as it is, reading &#8220;Shiloh&#8221; and understanding it as the place where the ark rested for a while in the time of the Judges. (2) By repointing the text others arrive at the translation &#8220;until the [or &#8220;his&#8221;] ruler comes,&#8221; a reference to a Davidic ruler or the Messiah. (3) Another possibility that does not require emendation of the consonantal text, but only repointing, is &#8220;until tribute is brought to him&#8221; (so NEB, JPS, NRSV), which has the advantage of providing good parallelism with the following line, &#8220;the nations will obey him.&#8221; (4) The interpretation followed in the present translation, &#8220;to whom it [belongs]&#8221; (so RSV, NIV, REB), is based on the ancient versions. Again, this would refer to the Davidic dynasty or, ultimately, to the Messiah.</p>
<A NAME="4913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2954><b>tn</b> &#8220;and to him [will be] the obedience of the nations.&#8221; For discussion of this verse see J. Blenkinsopp, &#8220;The Oracle of Judah and the Messianic Entry,&#8221; <i>JBL </i>80 (1961): 55-64; and E. M. Good, &#8220;The &#8216;Blessing&#8217; on Judah,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 82 (1963): 427-32.</p>
<A NAME="4914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2955><b>tn</b> The perfect verbal form is used rhetorically, describing coming events as though they have already taken place.</p>
<A NAME="4915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2956><b>tn</b> Some translate these as comparatives, &#8220;darker than wine&#8230;whiter than milk,&#8221; and so a reference to his appearance (so NEB, NIV, NRSV). But if it is in the age of abundance, symbolized by wine and milk, then the dark (i.e., red or perhaps dull) eyes would be from drinking wine, and the white teeth from drinking milk.</p>
<A NAME="4916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2957><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shakhan</font>) means &#8220;to settle,&#8221; but not necessarily as a permanent dwelling place. The tribal settlements by the sea would have been temporary and not the tribe&#8217;s territory.</p>
<A NAME="4917"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2958><b>map</b> For location see Map1-A1; JP3-F3; JP4-F3.</p>
<A NAME="4918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2959><b>tn</b> The verb forms in this verse (&#8220;sees,&#8221; &#8220;will bend,&#8221; and &#8220;[will] become&#8221;) are preterite; they is used in a rhetorical manner, describing the future as if it had already transpired.</p>
<A NAME="4919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2960><b>sn</b> The oracle shows that the tribe of Issachar will be willing to trade liberty for the material things of life. Issachar would work (<i>become a slave laborer</i>) for the Canaanites, a reversal of the oracle on Canaan. See C. M. Carmichael, &#8220;Some Sayings in Genesis 49,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 88 (1969): 435-44; and S. Gevirtz, &#8220;The Issachar Oracle in the Testament of Jacob,&#8221; <i>ErIsr </i>12 (1975): 104-12.</p>
<A NAME="4920"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2961><b>sn</b> The name <i>Dan</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">dan</font>) means &#8220;judge&#8221; and forms a wordplay with the following verb.</p>
<A NAME="4921"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2962><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;govern.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4922"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2963><b>sn</b> The comparison of the tribe of <i>Dan</i> to a venomous <i>serpent</i> is meant to say that Dan, though small, would be potent, gaining victory through its skill and shrewdness. Jewish commentators have linked the image in part with Samson. That link at least illustrates the point: Though a minority tribe, Dan would gain the upper hand over others.</p>
<A NAME="4923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2964><b>sn</b> <i>I wait for your deliverance, O </i><sc>Lord. As Jacob sees the conflicts that lie ahead for Dan and Gad (see v. 19), he offers a brief prayer for their security.</p>
<A NAME="4924"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2965><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;heel.&#8221; The MT has suffered from misdivision at this point. The initial <i>mem</i> on the first word in the next verse should probably be taken as a plural ending on the word &#8220;heel.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In Hebrew the name <i>Gad</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">gad</font> ) sounds like the words translated &#8220;raided&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1462;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yÿgudennu</font>) and &#8220;marauding bands&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">gÿdud</font>).</p>
<A NAME="4925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2966><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from Asher,&#8221; but the initial <i>mem</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;</font>) of the MT should probably be moved to the end of the preceding verse and taken as a plural ending on &#8220;heel.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2967><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word translated &#8220;rich,&#8221; when applied to products of the ground, means abundant in quantity and quality.</p>
<A NAME="4927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2968><b>tn</b> The word translated &#8220;delicacies&#8221; refers to foods that were delightful, the kind fit for a king.</p>
<A NAME="4928"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2969><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a doe set free.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4929"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2970><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the one who gives words of beauty.&#8221; The deer imagery probably does not continue into this line; Naphtali is the likely antecedent of the substantival participle, which is masculine, not feminine, in form. If the animal imagery is retained from the preceding line, the image of a talking deer is preposterous. For this reason some read the second line &#8220;the one who bears beautiful fawns,&#8221; interpreting <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">imre</font>) as a reference to young animals, not words (see <i>HALOT</i> 67 s.v. *<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;</font>).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Almost every word in the verse is difficult. Some take the imagery to mean that Naphtali will be swift and agile (like a <i>doe</i>), and be used to take good messages (reading &#8220;words of beauty&#8221;). Others argue that the tribe was free-spirited (<i>free running</i>), but then settled down with young children.</p>
<A NAME="4930"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2971><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text appears to mean &#8220;[is] a son of fruitfulness.&#8221; The second word is an active participle, feminine singular, from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">parah</font>, &#8220;to be fruitful&#8221;). The translation &#8220;bough&#8221; is employed for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ben</font>, elsewhere typically &#8220;son&#8221;) because Joseph is pictured as a healthy and fruitful vine growing by the wall. But there are difficulties with this interpretation. The word &#8220;son&#8221; nowhere else refers to a plant and the noun translated &#8220;branches&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;daughters&#8221;) in the third line is a plural form whereas its verb is singular. In the other oracles of Gen 49 an animal is used for comparison and not a plant, leading some to translate the opening phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503; &#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ben parah</font>, &#8220;fruitful bough&#8221;) as &#8220;wild donkey&#8221; (JPS, NAB). Various other interpretations involving more radical emendation of the text have also been offered.</p>
<A NAME="4931"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2972><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;daughters.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4932"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2973><b>tn</b> The verb forms in vv. 23-24 are used in a rhetorical manner, describing future events as if they had already taken place.</p>
<A NAME="4933"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2974><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the arms of his hands.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4934"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2975><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from there,&#8221; but the phrase should be revocalized and read &#8220;from [i.e., because of] the name of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4935"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2976><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Stone.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4936"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2977><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he will help you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4937"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2978><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Shaddai.&#8221; See the note on the title &#8220;sovereign God&#8221; in Gen 17:1. The preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et</font>) in the Hebrew text should probably be emended to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>, &#8220;God&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="4938"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2979><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he will bless you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4939"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2980><b>sn</b> Jacob envisions God imparting both agricultural (<i>blessings from the sky above, blessings from the deep that lies below</i>) and human fertility (<i>blessings of the breasts and womb</i>) to Joseph and his family.</p>
<A NAME="4940"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=2981><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;have prevailed over.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4941"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=2982><b>tn</b> One could interpret the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1463;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">horay</font>) to mean &#8220;my progenitors&#8221; (literally, &#8220;the ones who conceived me&#8221;), but the masculine form argues against this. It is better to emend the text to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1512;&#1458;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">harare</font>, &#8220;mountains of&#8221;) because it forms a better parallel with the next clause. In this case the final <i>yod</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font>) on the form is a construct plural marker, not a pronominal suffix.</p>
<A NAME="4942"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=2983><b>tn</b> For further discussion of this passage, see I. Sonne, &#8220;Genesis 49:24-26,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 65 (1946): 303-6.</p>
<A NAME="4943"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2984><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;All these.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4944"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=2985><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he blessed them, each of whom according to his blessing, he blessed them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4945"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=2986><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text adds &#8220;and he said to them,&#8221; which is not included in the translation because it is redundant in English.</p>
<A NAME="4946"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=2987><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I am about to be gathered&#8221; The participle is used here to describe what is imminent.</p>
<A NAME="4947"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=2988><b>tn</b> Some translate the Hebrew term &#8220;Heth&#8221; as &#8220;Hittites&#8221; here (see also Gen 23:3), but this gives the impression that these people were the classical Hittites of Anatolia. However, there is no known connection between these sons of Heth, apparently a Canaanite group (see Gen 10:15), and the Hittites of Asia Minor. See H. A. Hoffner, Jr., &#8220;Hittites,&#8221; <i>Peoples of the Old Testament World</i>, 152-53.</p>
<A NAME="4948"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=2989><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;was gathered.&#8221;</p>
