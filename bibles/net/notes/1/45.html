<A NAME="451"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2783><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all the ones standing beside him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="452"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2784><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;stood.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="453"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2785><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he gave his voice in weeping,&#8221; meaning that Joseph could not restrain himself and wept out loud.</p>
<A NAME="454"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2786><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the Egyptians heard and the household of Pharaoh heard.&#8221; Presumably in the latter case this was by means of a report.</p>
<A NAME="455"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2787><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;let there not be anger in your eyes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="456"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2788><b>sn</b> <i>You sold me here, for God sent me</i>. The tension remains as to how the brothers&#8217; wickedness and God&#8217;s intentions work together. Clearly God is able to transform the actions of wickedness to bring about some gracious end. But this is saying more than that; it is saying that from the beginning it was God who sent Joseph here. Although harmonization of these ideas remains humanly impossible, the divine intention is what should be the focus. Only that will enable reconciliation.</p>
<A NAME="457"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2789><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the famine [has been] in the midst of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="458"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2790><b>sn</b> <i>God sent me</i>. The repetition of this theme that God sent Joseph is reminiscent of commission narratives in which the leader could announce that God sent him (e.g., Exod 3:15).</p>
<A NAME="459"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2791><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to make you a remnant.&#8221; The verb, followed here by the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿ</font>), means &#8220;to make.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2792><b>tn</b> The infinitive gives a second purpose for God&#8217;s action.</p>
<A NAME="4511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2793><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a father.&#8221; The term is used here figuratively of one who gives advice, as a father would to his children.</p>
<A NAME="4512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2794><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;hurry and go up.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2795><b>tn</b> The perfect verbal form with <i>vav</i> consecutive here expresses instruction.</p>
<A NAME="4514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2796><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kul</font>) in the Pilpel stem means &#8220;to nourish, to support, to sustain.&#8221; As in 1 Kgs 20:27, it here means &#8220;to supply with food.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2797><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And, look, your eyes see and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that my mouth is the one speaking to you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2798><b>tn</b> The perfect verbal form with the <i>vav</i> consecutive here expresses instruction.</p>
<A NAME="4517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2799><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and hurry and bring down my father to here.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2800><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the sound was heard.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2801><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;was good in the eyes of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2802><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and go! Enter!&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2803><b>tn</b> After the imperatives in vv. 17-18a, the cohortative with <i>vav</i> indicates result.</p>
<A NAME="4522"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2804><b>tn</b> After the cohortative the imperative with <i>vav </i>states the ultimate goal.</p>
<A NAME="4523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2805><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fat.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2806><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;to say&#8221; have been supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="4525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2807><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;let not your eye regard.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2808><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the sons of Israel did so.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4527"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2809><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;according to the mouth of Pharaoh.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4528"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2810><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to all of them he gave, to each one, changes of outer garments.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="4531"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2813><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;do not be stirred up in the way.&#8221; The verb means &#8220;stir up.&#8221; Some understand the Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1490;&#1464;&#1494;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ragaz</font>, &#8220;to stir up&#8221;) as a reference to quarreling (see Prov 29:9, where it has this connotation), but in Exod 15:14 and other passages it means &#8220;to fear.&#8221; This might refer to a fear of robbers, but more likely it is an assuring word that they need not be fearful about returning to Egypt. They might have thought that once Jacob was in Egypt, Joseph would take his revenge on them.</p>
<A NAME="4532"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2814><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they entered the land of Canaan to their father.&#8221;</p>
