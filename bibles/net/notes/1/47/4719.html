<A NAME="4719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2864><b>sn</b> The <i>land of Rameses</i> is another designation for the region of Goshen. It is named Rameses because of a city in that region (Exod 1:11; 12:37). The use of this name may represent a modernization of the text for the understanding of the intended readers, substituting a later name for an earlier one. Alternatively, there may have been an earlier Rameses for which the region was named.</p>
