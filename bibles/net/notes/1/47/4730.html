The idea of slavery is not attractive to the modern mind, but in the ancient world it was the primary way of dealing with the poor and destitute. If the people became slaves of Pharaoh, it was Pharaoh&#8217;s responsibility to feed them and care for them. It was the best way for them to survive the famine.</p>
