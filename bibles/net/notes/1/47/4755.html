<A NAME="4755"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=2900><b>sn</b> The Hebrew verb normally means &#8220;bow down,&#8221; especially in worship or prayer. Here it might simply mean &#8220;bend low,&#8221; perhaps from weakness or approaching death. The narrative is ambiguous at this point and remains open to all these interpretations.</p>
