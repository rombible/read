<A NAME="1962"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=1080><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And he said, &#8216;Look, I will grant.&#8217;&#8221; The order of the clauses has been rearranged for stylistic reasons. The referent of the speaker (&#8220;he&#8221;) is somewhat ambiguous: It could be taken as the angel to whom Lot has been speaking (so NLT; note the singular references in vv. 18-19), or it could be that Lot is speaking directly to the <sc>Lord here. Most English translations leave the referent of the pronoun unspecified and maintain the ambiguity.</p>
