<A NAME="1910"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1028><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yada</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to know&#8221;) is used here in the sense of &#8220;to lie with&#8221; or &#8220;to have sex with&#8221; (as in Gen 4:1). That this is indeed the meaning is clear from Lot&#8217;s warning that they not do so wickedly, and his willingness to give them his daughters instead. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The sin of the men of Sodom is debated. The fact that the sin involved a sexual act (see note on the phrase &#8220;have sex&#8221; in 19:5) precludes an association of the sin with inhospitality as is sometimes asserted (see W. Roth, &#8220;What of Sodom and Gomorrah? Homosexual Acts in the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>Explor</i> 1 [1974]: 7-14). The text at a minimum condemns forced sexual intercourse, i.e., rape. Other considerations, though, point to a condemnation of homosexual acts more generally. The narrator emphasizes the fact that the men of Sodom wanted to have sex with men: They demand that Lot release the angelic messengers (seen as men) to them for sex, and when Lot offers his daughters as a substitute they refuse them and attempt to take the angelic messengers by force. In addition the wider context of the Pentateuch condemns homosexual acts as sin (see, e.g., Lev 18:22). Thus a reading of this text within its narrative context, both immediate and broad, condemns not only the attempted rape but also the attempted homosexual act.</p>
