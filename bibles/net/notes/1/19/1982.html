<A NAME="1982"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">82</span><note=1100><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;remembered,&#8221; but this means more than mental recollection here. Abraham&#8217;s request (Gen 18:23-32) was that the <sc>Lord not destroy the righteous with the wicked. While the requisite minimum number of righteous people (ten, v. 32) needed for God to spare the cities was not found, God nevertheless rescued the righteous before destroying the wicked.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> God showed Abraham special consideration because of the covenantal relationship he had established with the patriarch. Yet the reader knows that God delivered the &#8220;righteous&#8221; (Lot&#8217;s designation in 2 Pet 2:7) before destroying their world &#8211; which is what he will do again at the end of the age.</p>
