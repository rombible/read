<A NAME="1935"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1053><b>sn</b> The language has to be interpreted in the light of the context and the social customs. The men are called &#8220;sons-in-law&#8221; (literally &#8220;the takers of his daughters&#8221;), but the daughters had not yet had sex with a man. It is better to translate the phrase &#8220;who were going to marry his daughters.&#8221; Since formal marriage contracts were binding, the husbands-to-be could already be called sons-in-law.</p>
