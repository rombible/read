<A NAME="1957"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=1075><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ir</font>) can refer to either a city or a town, depending on the size of the place. Given that this place was described by Lot later in this verse as a &#8220;little place,&#8221; the translation uses &#8220;town.&#8221;</p>
