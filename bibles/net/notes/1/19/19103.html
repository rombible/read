<A NAME="19103"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">103</span><note=1121><b>sn</b> The meaning of the name <i>Moab</i> is not certain. The name sounds like the Hebrew phrase &#8220;from our father&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</font>, <font face="Scholar">me</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avinu</font>) which the daughters used twice (vv. 32, 34). This account is probably included in the narrative in order to portray the Moabites, who later became enemies of God&#8217;s people, in a negative light.</p>
