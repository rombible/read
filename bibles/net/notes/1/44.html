<A NAME="441"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2730><b>tn</b> The imperfect verbal form is used here to express Joseph&#8217;s instructions.</p>
<A NAME="442"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2731><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he did according to the word of Joseph which he spoke.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="443"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2732><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the morning was light.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="444"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2733><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the men were sent off, they and their donkeys.&#8221; This clause, like the preceding one, has the subject before the verb, indicating synchronic action.</p>
<A NAME="445"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2734><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they left the city, they were not far,&#8221; meaning &#8220;they had not gone very far.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="446"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2735><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Joseph said.&#8221; This clause, like the first one in the verse, has the subject before the verb, indicating synchronic action.</p>
<A NAME="447"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2736><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;arise, chase after the men.&#8221; The first imperative gives the command a sense of urgency.</p>
<A NAME="448"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2737><b>tn</b> After the imperative this perfect verbal form with <i>vav</i> consecutive has the same nuance of instruction. In the translation it is subordinated to the verbal form that follows (also a perfect with <i>vav</i> consecutive): &#8220;and overtake them and say,&#8221; becomes &#8220;when you overtake them, say.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="449"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2738><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Is this not what my master drinks from.&#8221; The word &#8220;cup&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but is obviously the referent of &#8220;this,&#8221; and so has been supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="4410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2739><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he, divining, divines with it.&#8221; The infinitive absolute is emphatic, stressing the importance of the cup to Joseph.</p>
<A NAME="4411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2740><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you have caused to be evil what you have done.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2741><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he&#8221;; the referent (the man who was in charge of Joseph&#8217;s household) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="4413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2742><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Why does my lord speak according to these words?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2743><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;according to this thing.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2744><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The one with whom it is found from your servants.&#8221; Here &#8220;your servants&#8221; (a deferential way of referring to the brothers themselves) has been translated by the pronoun &#8220;us&#8221; to avoid confusion with Joseph&#8217;s servants.</p>
<A NAME="4416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2745><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Also now, according to your words, so it is.&#8221; As the next statement indicates, this does mean that he will do exactly as they say. He does agree with them the culprit should be punished, but not as harshly as they suggest. Furthermore, the innocent parties will not be punished.</p>
<A NAME="4417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2746><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The one with whom it is found will become my slave.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2747><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;the rest of&#8221; have been supplied in the translation for clarification and for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="4419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2748><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">naqi</font>) means &#8220;acquitted,&#8221; that is, free of guilt and the responsibility for it.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The rest of you will be free</i>. Joseph&#8217;s purpose was to single out Benjamin to see if the brothers would abandon him as they had abandoned Joseph. He wanted to see if they had changed.</p>
<A NAME="4420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2749><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they hurried and they lowered.&#8221; Their speed in doing this shows their presumption of innocence.</p>
<A NAME="4421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2750><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he&#8221;; the referent (the man who was in charge of Joseph&#8217;s household) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="4422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2751><b>sn</b> <i>Judah and his brothers</i>. The narrative is already beginning to bring Judah to the forefront.</p>
<A NAME="4423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2752><b>tn</b> The disjunctive clause here provides supplemental information.</p>
<A NAME="4424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2753><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;What is this deed you have done?&#8221; The demonstrative pronoun (&#8220;this&#8221;) adds emphasis to the question. A literal translation seems to contradict the following statement, in which Joseph affirms that he is able to divine such matters. Thus here the emotive force of the question has been reflected in the translation, &#8220;What did you think you were doing?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2754><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[is] fully able to divine,&#8221; meaning that he can find things out by divination. The infinitive absolute appears before the finite verb for emphasis, stressing his ability to do this.</p>
<A NAME="4426"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2755><b>tn</b> The imperfect verbal form here indicates the subject&#8217;s potential.</p>
<A NAME="4427"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2756><b>tn</b> The Hitpael form of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1491;&#1461;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsadeq</font>) here means &#8220;to prove ourselves just, to declare ourselves righteous, to prove our innocence.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4428"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2757><b>sn</b> <i>God has exposed the sin of your servants</i>. The first three questions are rhetorical; Judah is stating that there is nothing they can say to clear themselves. He therefore must conclude that they have been found guilty.</p>
<A NAME="4429"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2758><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;the rest of&#8221; have been supplied in the translation for clarification and for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="4430"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2759><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;up&#8221; (reflecting directions from their point of view &#8211; &#8220;up&#8221; to Canaan; &#8220;down&#8221; to Egypt).</p>
<A NAME="4431"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2760><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Please my lord, let your servant speak a word into the ears of my lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4432"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2761><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and let not your anger burn against your servant.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4433"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2762><b>sn</b> <i>You are just like Pharaoh</i>. Judah&#8217;s speech begins with the fear and trembling of one who stands condemned. Joseph has as much power as Pharaoh, either to condemn or to pardon. Judah will make his appeal, wording his speech in such a way as to appeal to Joseph&#8217;s compassion for the father, whom he mentions no less than fourteen times in the speech.</p>
<A NAME="4434"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2763><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and a small boy of old age,&#8221; meaning that he was born when his father was elderly.</p>
<A NAME="4435"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2764><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his&#8221;; the referent (the boy just mentioned) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="4436"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2765><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he, only he, to his mother is left.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4437"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2766><b>tn</b> The cohortative after the imperative indicates purpose here.</p>
<A NAME="4438"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2767><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;that I may set my eyes upon him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4439"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2768><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (the boy&#8217;s father, i.e., Jacob) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="4440"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=2769><b>tn</b> The last two verbs are perfect tenses with <i>vav</i> consecutive. The first is subordinated to the second as a conditional clause.</p>
<A NAME="4441"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=2770><b>tn</b> The direct object is not specified in the Hebrew text, but is implied; &#8220;there&#8221; is supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="4442"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=2771><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;go down.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4443"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2772><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;that two sons my wife bore to me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4444"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=2773><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;went forth from me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4445"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=2774><b>tn</b> The construction uses a perfect verbal form with the <i>vav</i> consecutive to introduce the conditional clause and then another perfect verbal form with a <i>vav</i> consecutive to complete the sentence: &#8220;if you take&#8230;then you will bring down.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4446"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=2775><b>sn</b> The expression <i>bring down my gray hair</i> is figurative, using a part for the whole &#8211; they would put Jacob in the grave. But the gray head signifies a long life of worry and trouble. See Gen 42:38.</p>
<A NAME="4447"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=2776><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;evil/calamity.&#8221; The term is different than the one used in the otherwise identical statement recorded in v. 31 (see also 42:38).</p>
<A NAME="4448"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=2777><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to Sheol,&#8221; the dwelling place of the dead.</p>
<A NAME="4449"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=2778><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his life is bound up in his life.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="4451"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=2780><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;for.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4452"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=2781><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has &#8220;lest I see,&#8221; which expresses a negative purpose &#8211; &#8220;I cannot go up lest I see.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4453"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=2782><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the calamity which would find my father.&#8221;</p>
