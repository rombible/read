<a name="131"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=31><b>tn</b> The Hebrew construction employs a cognate accusative, where the nominal object (&#8220;vegetation&#8221;) derives from the verbal root employed. It stresses the abundant productivity that God created.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Vegetation</i>. The Hebrew word translated &#8220;vegetation&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">deshe</font>&#8217;) normally means &#8220;grass,&#8221; but here it probably refers more generally to vegetation that includes many of the plants and trees. In the verse the plants and the trees are qualified as self-perpetuating with seeds, but not the word &#8220;vegetation,&#8221; indicating it is the general term and the other two terms are sub-categories of it. Moreover, in vv. 29 and 30 the word vegetation/grass does not appear. The Samaritan Pentateuch adds an &#8220;and&#8221; before the fruit trees, indicating it saw the arrangement as bipartite (The Samaritan Pentateuch tends to eliminate asyndetic constructions). </p>
