<a name="148"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=48><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adam</font>), which can sometimes refer to man, as opposed to woman. The term refers here to humankind, comprised of male and female. The singular is clearly collective (see the plural verb, &#8220;[that] they may rule&#8221; in v. 26b) and the referent is defined specifically as &#8220;male and female&#8221; in v. 27. Usage elsewhere in Gen 1-11 supports this as well. In 5:2 we read: &#8220;Male and female he created them, and he blessed them and called their name &#8216;humankind&#8217; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501;</font>).&#8221; The noun also refers to humankind in 6:1, 5-7 and in 9:5-6.</p>
