<a name="17"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=7><b>tn</b> Traditional translations have followed a more literal rendering of &#8220;waste and void.&#8221; The words describe a condition that is without form and empty. What we now know as &#8220;the earth&#8221; was actually an unfilled mass covered by water and darkness. Later <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1465;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tohu</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bohu</font>), when used in proximity, describe a situation resulting from judgment (Isa 34:11; Jer 4:23). Both prophets may be picturing judgment as the reversal of creation in which God&#8217;s judgment causes the world to revert to its primordial condition. This later use of the terms has led some to conclude that Gen 1:2 presupposes the judgment of a prior world, but it is unsound method to read the later application of the imagery (in a context of judgment) back into Gen 1:2.</p>
