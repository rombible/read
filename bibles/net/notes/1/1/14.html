<a name="14"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the entire universe&#8221;; or &#8220;the sky and the dry land.&#8221; This phrase is often interpreted as a merism, referring to the entire ordered universe, including the heavens and the earth and everything in them. The &#8220;heavens and the earth&#8221; were completed in seven days (see Gen 2:1) and are characterized by fixed laws (see Jer 33:25). &#8220;Heavens&#8221; refers specifically to the sky, created on the second day (see v. 8), while &#8220;earth&#8221; refers specifically to the dry land, created on the third day (see v. 10). Both are distinct from the sea/seas (see v. 10 and Exod 20:11). </p>
