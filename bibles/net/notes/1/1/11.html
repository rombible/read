<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1><b>tn</b> The translation assumes that the form translated &#8220;beginning&#8221; is in the absolute state rather than the construct (&#8220;in the beginning of,&#8221; or &#8220;when God created&#8221;). In other words, the clause in v. 1 is a main clause, v. 2 has three clauses that are descriptive and supply background information, and v. 3 begins the narrative sequence proper. The referent of the word &#8220;beginning&#8221; has to be defined from the context since there is no beginning or ending with God.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>In the beginning</i>. The verse refers to the beginning of the world as we know it; it affirms that it is entirely the product of the creation of God. But there are two ways that this verse can be interpreted: (1) It may be taken to refer to the original act of creation with the rest of the events on the days of creation completing it. This would mean that the disjunctive clauses of v. 2 break the sequence of the creative work of the first day. (2) It may be taken as a summary statement of what the chapter will record, that is, vv. 3-31 are about God&#8217;s creating the world as we know it. If the first view is adopted, then we have a reference here to original creation; if the second view is taken, then Genesis itself does not account for the original creation of matter. To follow this view does not deny that the Bible teaches that God created everything out of nothing (cf. John 1:3) &#8211; it simply says that Genesis is not making that affirmation. This second view presupposes the existence of pre-existent matter, when God said, &#8220;Let there be light.&#8221; The first view includes the description of the primordial state as part of the events of day one. The following narrative strongly favors the second view, for the &#8220;heavens/sky&#8221; did not exist prior to the second day of creation (see v. 8) and &#8220;earth/dry land&#8221; did not exist, at least as we know it, prior to the third day of creation (see v. 10).</p>
