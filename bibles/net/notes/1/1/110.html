<a name="110"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=10><b>tn</b> The traditional rendering &#8220;Spirit of God&#8221; is preserved here, as opposed to a translation like &#8220;wind from/breath of God&#8221; (cf. NRSV) or &#8220;mighty wind&#8221; (cf. NEB), taking the word &#8220;God&#8221; to represent the superlative. Elsewhere in the OT the phrase refers consistently to the divine spirit that empowers and energizes individuals (see Gen 41:38; Exod 31:3; 35:31; Num 24:2; 1 Sam 10:10; 11:6; 19:20, 23; Ezek 11:24; 2 Chr 15:1; 24:20).</p>
