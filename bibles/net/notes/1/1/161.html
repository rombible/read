<a name="161"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=61><b>sn</b> G. J. Wenham (<i>Genesis</i> [WBC], 1:34) points out that there is nothing in the passage that prohibits the man and the woman from eating meat. He suggests that eating meat came after the fall. Gen 9:3 may then ratify the postfall practice of eating meat rather than inaugurate the practice, as is often understood.</p>
