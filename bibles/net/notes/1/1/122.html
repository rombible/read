<a name="122"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=22><b>tn</b> Another option is to translate, &#8220;Evening came, and then morning came.&#8221; This formula closes the six days of creation. It seems to follow the Jewish order of reckoning time: from evening to morning. Day one started with the dark, continued through the creation of light, and ended with nightfall. Another alternative would be to translate, &#8220;There was night and then there was day, one day.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The first day</i>. The exegetical evidence suggests the word &#8220;day&#8221; in this chapter refers to a literal twenty-four hour day. It is true that the word can refer to a longer period of time (see Isa 61:2, or the idiom in 2:4, &#8220;in the day,&#8221; that is, &#8220;when&#8221;). But this chapter uses &#8220;day,&#8221; &#8220;night,&#8221; &#8220;morning,&#8221; &#8220;evening,&#8221; &#8220;years,&#8221; and &#8220;seasons.&#8221; Consistency would require sorting out how all these terms could be used to express ages. Also, when the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yom</font>) is used with a numerical adjective, it refers to a literal day. Furthermore, the commandment to keep the sabbath clearly favors this interpretation. One is to work for six days and then rest on the seventh, just as God did when he worked at creation. </p>
