<a name="137"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=37><b>sn</b> <i>Two great lights</i>. The text goes to great length to discuss the creation of these lights, suggesting that the subject was very important to the ancients. Since these &#8220;lights&#8221; were considered deities in the ancient world, the section serves as a strong polemic (see G. Hasel, &#8220;The Polemical Nature of the Genesis Cosmology,&#8221; <i>EvQ </i>46 [1974]: 81-102). The Book of Genesis is affirming they are created entities, not deities. To underscore this the text does not even give them names. If used here, the usual names for the sun and moon [<i>Shemesh </i>and <i>Yarih</i>, respectively] might have carried pagan connotations, so they are simply described as greater and lesser lights. Moreover, they serve in the capacity that God gives them, which would not be the normal function the pagans ascribed to them. They merely divide, govern, and give light in God&#8217;s creation.</p>
