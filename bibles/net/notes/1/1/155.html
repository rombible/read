<a name="155"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=55><b>sn</b> The distinction of &#8220;humankind&#8221; as &#8220;male&#8221; and &#8220;female&#8221; is another point of separation in God&#8217;s creation. There is no possibility that the verse is teaching that humans were first androgynous (having both male and female physical characteristics) and afterward were separated. The mention of male and female prepares for the blessing to follow.</p>
