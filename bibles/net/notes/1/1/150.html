<a name="150"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=50><b>tn</b> Following the cohortative (&#8220;let us make&#8221;), the prefixed verb form with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) conjunctive indicates purpose/result (see Gen 19:20; 34:23; 2 Sam 3:21). God&#8217;s purpose in giving humankind his image is that they might rule the created order on behalf of the heavenly king and his royal court. So the divine image, however it is defined, gives humankind the capacity and/or authority to rule over creation.</p>
