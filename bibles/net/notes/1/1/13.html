<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3><b>tn</b> The English verb &#8220;create&#8221; captures well the meaning of the Hebrew term in this context. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bara</font>&#8217;) always describes the divine activity of fashioning something new, fresh, and perfect. The verb does not necessarily describe creation out of nothing (see, for example, v. 27, where it refers to the creation of man); it often stresses forming anew, reforming, renewing (see Ps 51:10; Isa 43:15, 65:17).</p>
