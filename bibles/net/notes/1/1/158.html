<a name="158"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=58><b>tn</b> Elsewhere the Hebrew verb translated &#8220;subdue&#8221; means &#8220;to enslave&#8221; (2 Chr 28:10; Neh 5:5; Jer 34:11, 16), &#8220;to conquer,&#8221; (Num 32:22, 29; Josh 18:1; 2 Sam 8:11; 1 Chr 22:18; Zech 9:13; and probably Mic 7:19), and &#8220;to assault sexually&#8221; (Esth 7:8). None of these nuances adequately meets the demands of this context, for humankind is not viewed as having an adversarial relationship with the world. The general meaning of the verb appears to be &#8220;to bring under one&#8217;s control for one&#8217;s advantage.&#8221; In Gen 1:28 one might paraphrase it as follows: &#8220;harness its potential and use its resources for your benefit.&#8221; In an ancient Israelite context this would suggest cultivating its fields, mining its mineral riches, using its trees for construction, and domesticating its animals.</p>
