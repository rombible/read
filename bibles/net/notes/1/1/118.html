<a name="118"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=18><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tov</font>) in this context signifies whatever enhances, promotes, produces, or is conducive for life. It is the light that God considers &#8220;good,&#8221; not the darkness. Whatever is conducive to life in God&#8217;s creation is good, for God himself is good, and that goodness is reflected in all of his works.</p>
