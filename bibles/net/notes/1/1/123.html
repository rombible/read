<a name="123"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=23><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word refers to an expanse of air pressure between the surface of the sea and the clouds, separating water below from water above. In v. 8 it is called &#8220;sky.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>An expanse</i>. In the poetic texts the writers envision, among other things, something rather strong and shiny, no doubt influencing the traditional translation &#8220;firmament&#8221; (cf. NRSV &#8220;dome&#8221;). Job 37:18 refers to the skies poured out like a molten mirror. Dan 12:3 and Ezek 1:22 portray it as shiny. The sky or atmosphere may have seemed like a glass dome. For a detailed study of the Hebrew conception of the heavens and sky, see L. I. J. Stadelmann, <i>The Hebrew Conception of the World</i> (AnBib), 37-60.</p>
