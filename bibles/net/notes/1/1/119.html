<a name="119"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=19><b>tn</b> The verb &#8220;separate, divide&#8221; here explains how God used the light to dispel the darkness. It did not do away with the darkness completely, but made a separation. The light came alongside the darkness, but they are mutually exclusive &#8211; a theme that will be developed in the Gospel of John (cf. John 1:5).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The idea of separation is critical to this chapter. <i>God separated</i> light from darkness, upper water from lower water, day from night, etc. The verb is important to the Law in general. In Leviticus God separates between clean and unclean, holy and profane (Lev 10:10, 11:47 and 20:24); in Exodus God separates the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place (Exod 26:33). There is a preference for the light over the darkness, just as there will be a preference for the upper waters, the rain water which is conducive to life, over the sea water.</p>
