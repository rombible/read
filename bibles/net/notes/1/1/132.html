The Hebrew word translated &#8220;kind&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">min</font>) indicates again that God was concerned with defining and dividing time, space, and species. The point is that creation was with order, as opposed to chaos. And what God created and distinguished with boundaries was not to be confused (see Lev 19:19 and Deut 22:9-11). </p>
