<a name="149"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=49><b>tn</b> The two prepositions translated &#8220;in&#8221; and &#8220;according to&#8221; have overlapping fields of meaning and in this context seem to be virtually equivalent. In 5:3 they are reversed with the two words. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tselem</font>, &#8220;image&#8221;) is used frequently of statues, models, and images &#8211; replicas (see D. J. A. Clines, &#8220;The Etymology of Hebrew <i>selem</i>,&#8221; <i>JNSL</i> 3 [1974]: 19-25). The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dÿmut</font>, &#8220;likeness&#8221;) is an abstract noun; its verbal root means &#8220;to be like; to resemble.&#8221; In the Book of Genesis the two terms describe human beings who in some way reflect the form and the function of the creator. The form is more likely stressing the spiritual rather than the physical. The &#8220;image of God&#8221; would be the God-given mental and spiritual capacities that enable people to relate to God and to serve him by ruling over the created order as his earthly vice-regents.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>In our image, after our likeness</i>. Similar language is used in the instructions for building the tabernacle. Moses was told to make it &#8220;according to the pattern&#8221; he was shown on the mount (Exod 25:9, 10). Was he shown a form, a replica, of the spiritual sanctuary in the heavenly places? In any case, what was produced on earth functioned as the heavenly sanctuary does, but with limitations.</p>
