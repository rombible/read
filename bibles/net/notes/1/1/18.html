The Hebrew word simply means &#8220;darkness,&#8221; but in the Bible it has come to symbolize what opposes God, such as judgment (Exod 10:21), death (Ps 88:13), oppression (Isa 9:1), the wicked (1 Sam 2:9) and in general, sin. In Isa 45:7 it parallels &#8220;evil.&#8221; It is a fitting cover for the primeval waste, but it prepares the reader for the fact that God is about to reveal himself through his works.</p>
