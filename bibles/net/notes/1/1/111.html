<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb has been translated &#8220;hovering&#8221; or &#8220;moving&#8221; (as a bird over her young, see Deut 32:11). The Syriac cognate term means &#8220;to brood over; to incubate.&#8221; How much of that sense might be attached here is hard to say, but the verb does depict the presence of the Spirit of God moving about mysteriously over the waters, presumably preparing for the acts of creation to follow. If one reads &#8220;mighty wind&#8221; (cf. NEB) then the verse describes how the powerful wind begins to blow in preparation for the creative act described in vv. 9-10. (God also used a wind to drive back the flood waters in Noah&#8217;s day. See Gen 8:1.) </p>
