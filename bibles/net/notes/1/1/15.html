<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>tn</b> The disjunctive clause (conjunction + subject + verb) at the beginning of v. 2 gives background information for the following narrative, explaining the state of things when &#8220;God said&#8230;&#8221; (v. 3). Verse one is a title to the chapter, v. 2 provides information about the state of things when God spoke, and v. 3 begins the narrative per se with the typical narrative construction (<i>vav</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>] consecutive followed by the prefixed verbal form). (This literary structure is paralleled in the second portion of the book: Gen 2:4 provides the title or summary of what follows, 2:5-6 use disjunctive clause structures to give background information for the following narrative, and 2:7 begins the narrative with the <i>vav </i>consecutive attached to a prefixed verbal form.) Some translate 1:2a &#8220;and the earth became,&#8221; arguing that v. 1 describes the original creation of the earth, while v. 2 refers to a judgment that reduced it to a chaotic condition. Verses 3ff. then describe the re-creation of the earth. However, the disjunctive clause at the beginning of v. 2 cannot be translated as if it were relating the next event in a sequence. If v. 2 were sequential to v. 1, the author would have used the <i>vav</i> consecutive followed by a prefixed verbal form and the subject.</p>
