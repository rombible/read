<a name="144"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=44><b>tn</b> While the translation &#8220;blessed&#8221; has been retained here for the sake of simplicity, it would be most helpful to paraphrase it as &#8220;God endowed them with fruitfulness&#8221; or something similar, for here it refers to God&#8217;s giving the animals the capacity to reproduce. The expression &#8220;blessed&#8221; needs clarification in its different contexts, for it is one of the unifying themes of the Book of Genesis. The divine blessing occurs after works of creation and is intended to continue that work &#8211; the word of blessing guarantees success. The word means &#8220;to enrich; to endow,&#8221; and the most visible evidence of that enrichment is productivity or fruitfulness. See C. Westermann, <i>Blessing in the Bible and the Life of the Church </i>(OBT).</p>
