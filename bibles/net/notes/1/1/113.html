<a name="113"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=13><b>sn</b> <i>The water</i>. The text deliberately changes now from the term for the watery deep to the general word for water. The arena is now the life-giving water and not the chaotic abyss-like deep. The change may be merely stylistic, but it may also carry some significance. The deep carries with it the sense of the abyss, chaos, darkness &#8211; in short, that which is not good for life.</p>
