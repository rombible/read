<a name="159"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=59><b>sn</b> The several imperatives addressed to both males and females together (plural imperative forms) actually form two commands: reproduce and rule. God&#8217;s word is not merely a form of blessing, but is now addressed to them personally; this is a distinct emphasis with the creation of human beings. But with the blessing comes the ability to be fruitful and to rule. In procreation they will share in the divine work of creating human life and passing on the divine image (see 5:1-3); in ruling they will serve as God&#8217;s vice-regents on earth. They together, the human race collectively, have the responsibility of seeing to the welfare of that which is put under them and the privilege of using it for their benefit.</p>
