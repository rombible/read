<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1162><b>sn</b> The Hebrew verb translated &#8220;visit&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">paqad</font> ) often describes divine intervention for blessing or cursing; it indicates God&#8217;s special attention to an individual or a matter, always with respect to his people&#8217;s destiny. He may visit (that is, destroy) the Amalekites; he may visit (that is, deliver) his people in Egypt. Here he visits Sarah, to allow her to have the promised child. One&#8217;s destiny is changed when the <sc>Lord &#8220;visits.&#8221; For a more detailed study of the term, see G. André, <i>Determining the Destiny </i>(ConBOT).</p>
<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1163><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the <sc>Lord did.&#8221; The divine name has not been repeated here in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1164><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;spoken.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1165><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;she conceived.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1166><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the one born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.&#8221; The two modifying clauses, the first introduced with an article and the second with the relative pronoun, are placed in the middle of the sentence, before the name Isaac is stated. They are meant to underscore that this was indeed an actual birth to Abraham and Sarah in fulfillment of the promise.</p>
<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1167><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Isaac his son, the son of eight days.&#8221; The name &#8220;Isaac&#8221; is repeated in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1168><b>sn</b> <i>Just as God had commanded him to do</i>. With the birth of the promised child, Abraham obeyed the <sc>Lord by both naming (Gen 17:19) and circumcising Isaac (17:12).</p>
<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1169><b>tn</b> The parenthetical disjunctive clause underscores how miraculous this birth was. Abraham was 100 years old. The fact that the genealogies give the ages of the fathers when their first son is born shows that this was considered a major milestone in one&#8217;s life (G. J. Wenham, <i>Genesis </i>[WBC], 2:80).</p>
<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1170><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Laughter God has made for me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1171><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;about this&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarification.</p>
<A NAME="2111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1172><b>sn</b> Sarah&#8217;s words play on the name &#8220;Isaac&#8221; in a final triumphant manner. God prepared &#8220;laughter&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1456;&#1495;&#1465;&#1511;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ysÿkhoq</font> ) for her, and everyone who hears about this &#8220;will laugh&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1511;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yitskhaq</font> ) with her. The laughter now signals great joy and fulfillment, not unbelief (cf. Gen 18:12-15).</p>
<A NAME="2112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1173><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1174><b>tn</b> The perfect form of the verb is used here to describe a hypothetical situation.</p>
<A NAME="2114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1175><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;made.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1176><b>sn</b> Children were <i>weaned</i> closer to the age of two or three in the ancient world, because infant mortality was high. If an infant grew to this stage, it was fairly certain he or she would live. Such an event called for a celebration, especially for parents who had waited so long for a child.</p>
<A NAME="2116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1177><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;saw.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1178><b>tn</b> The Piel participle used here is from the same root as the name &#8220;Isaac.&#8221; In the Piel stem the verb means &#8220;to jest; to make sport of; to play with,&#8221; not simply &#8220;to laugh,&#8221; which is the meaning of the verb in the Qal stem. What exactly Ishmael was doing is not clear. Interpreters have generally concluded that the boy was either (1) mocking Isaac (cf. NASB, NIV, NLT) or (2) merely playing with Isaac as if on equal footing (cf. NAB, NRSV). In either case Sarah saw it as a threat. The same participial form was used in Gen 19:14 to describe how some in Lot&#8217;s family viewed his attempt to warn them of impending doom. It also appears later in Gen 39:14, 17, where Potiphar accuses Joseph of mocking them. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Mocking</i>. Here Sarah interprets Ishmael&#8217;s actions as being sinister. Ishmael probably did not take the younger child seriously and Sarah saw this as a threat to Isaac. Paul in Gal 4:29 says that Ishmael persecuted Isaac. He uses a Greek word that can mean &#8220;to put to flight; to chase away; to pursue&#8221; and may be drawing on a rabbinic interpretation of the passage. In Paul&#8217;s analogical application of the passage, he points out that once the promised child Isaac (symbolizing Christ as the fulfillment of God&#8217;s promise) has come, there is no room left for the slave woman and her son (who symbolize the Mosaic law).</p>
<A NAME="2118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1179><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;drive out.&#8221; The language may seem severe, but Sarah&#8217;s maternal instincts sensed a real danger in that Ishmael was not treating Isaac with the proper respect.</p>
<A NAME="2119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1180><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the word was very wrong in the eyes of Abraham on account of his son.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">a</font>&#8217;) often refers to what is morally or ethically &#8220;evil.&#8221; It usage here suggests that Abraham thought Sarah&#8217;s demand was ethically (and perhaps legally) wrong.</p>
<A NAME="2120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1181><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Let it not be evil in your eyes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1182><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;listen to her voice.&#8221; The idiomatic expression means &#8220;obey; comply.&#8221; Here her advice, though harsh, is necessary and conforms to the will of God. Later (see Gen 25), when Abraham has other sons, he sends them all away as well.</p>
<A NAME="2122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1183><b>tn</b> The imperfect verbal form here draws attention to an action that is underway.</p>
<A NAME="2123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1184><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;will be named&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for in Isaac offspring will be called to you.&#8221; The exact meaning of the statement is not clear, but it does indicate that God&#8217;s covenantal promises to Abraham will be realized through Isaac, not Ishmael.</p>
<A NAME="2124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1185><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Abraham rose up early in the morning and he took.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1186><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;bread,&#8221; although the term can be used for food in general.</p>
<A NAME="2126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1187><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;He put upon her shoulder, and the boy [or perhaps, &#8220;and with the boy&#8221;], and he sent her away.&#8221; It is unclear how &#8220;and the boy&#8221; relates syntactically to what precedes. Perhaps the words should be rearranged and the text read, &#8220;and he put [them] on her shoulder and he gave to Hagar the boy.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1188><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;she went and wandered.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1189><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;desert,&#8221; although for English readers this usually connotes a sandy desert like the Sahara rather than the arid wasteland of this region with its sparse vegetation.</p>
<A NAME="2129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1190><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;threw,&#8221; but the child, who was now thirteen years old, would not have been carried, let alone thrown under a bush. The exaggerated language suggests Ishmael is limp from dehydration and is being abandoned to die. See G. J. Wenham, <i>Genesis </i>(WBC), 2:85.</p>
<A NAME="2130"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1191><b>sn</b> <i>A bowshot</i> would be a distance of about a hundred yards (ninety meters).</p>
<A NAME="2131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1192><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1193><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will not look on the death of the child.&#8221; The cohortative verbal form (note the negative particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;</font>,&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) here expresses her resolve to avoid the stated action.</p>
<A NAME="2133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1194><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and she lifted up her voice and wept&#8221; (that is, she wept uncontrollably). The LXX reads &#8220;he&#8221; (referring to Ishmael) rather than &#8220;she&#8221; (referring to Hagar), but this is probably an attempt to harmonize this verse with the following one, which refers to the boy&#8217;s cries.</p>
<A NAME="2134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1195><b>sn</b> <i>God heard the boy&#8217;s voice</i>. The text has not to this point indicated that Ishmael was crying out, either in pain or in prayer. But the text here makes it clear that God heard him. Ishmael is clearly central to the story. Both the mother and the <sc>Lord are focused on the child&#8217;s imminent death.</p>
<A NAME="2135"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1196><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;What to you?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1197><b>sn</b> Here the verb <i>heard</i> picks up the main motif of the name Ishmael (&#8220;God hears&#8221;), introduced back in chap. 16.</p>
<A NAME="2137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1198><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water.&#8221; The referent (Hagar) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1199><b>sn</b> <i>The wilderness of Paran</i> is an area in the east central region of the Sinai peninsula, northeast from the traditional site of Mt. Sinai and with the Arabah and the Gulf of Aqaba as its eastern border.</p>
<A NAME="2139"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1200><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And his mother took for him a wife from the land of Egypt.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2140"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1201><b>sn</b> <i>God is with you</i>. Abimelech and Phicol recognized that Abraham enjoyed special divine provision and protection.</p>
<A NAME="2141"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1202><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And now swear to me by God here.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="2143"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1204><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;land&#8221; refers by metonymy to the people in the land.</p>
<A NAME="2144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1205><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb means &#8220;to stay, to live, to sojourn&#8221; as a temporary resident without ownership rights.</p>
<A NAME="2145"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1206><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;kindness.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2146"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1207><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;According to the loyalty which I have done with you, do with me and with the land in which you are staying.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2147"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1208><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I swear.&#8221; No object is specified in the Hebrew text, but the content of the oath requested by Abimelech is the implied object.</p>
<A NAME="2148"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1209><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb used here means &#8220;to argue; to dispute&#8221;; it can focus on the beginning of the dispute (as here), the dispute itself, or the resolution of a dispute (Isa 1:18). Apparently the complaint was lodged before the actual oath was taken.</p>
<A NAME="2149"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1210><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;concerning the matter of the well of water.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2150"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1211><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb used here means &#8220;to steal; to rob; to take violently.&#8221; The statement reflects Abraham&#8217;s perspective.</p>
<A NAME="2151"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1212><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and also.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="2154"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1215><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;that it be for me for a witness.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2155"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=1216><b>sn</b> <i>This well</i>. Since the king wanted a treaty to share in Abraham&#8217;s good fortune, Abraham used the treaty to secure ownership of and protection for the well he dug. It would be useless to make a treaty to live in this territory if he had no rights to the water. Abraham consented to the treaty, but added his rider to it.</p>
<A NAME="2156"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=1217><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;that is why he called that place.&#8221; Some translations render this as an impersonal passive, &#8220;that is why that place was called.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2157"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=1218><b>sn</b> The name <i>Beer Sheba </i>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1506;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">er shava</font>&#8217;) means &#8220;well of the oath&#8221; or &#8220;well of the seven.&#8221; Both the verb &#8220;to swear&#8221; and the number &#8220;seven&#8221; have been used throughout the account. Now they are drawn in as part of the explanation of the significance of the name.</p>
<A NAME="2158"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=1219><b>sn</b> The verb forms a wordplay with the name <i>Beer Sheba</i>.</p>

<A NAME="2164"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=1225><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he called there in the name of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The expression refers to worshiping the <sc>Lord through prayer and sacrifice (see Gen 4:26; 12:8; 13:4; 26:25).
