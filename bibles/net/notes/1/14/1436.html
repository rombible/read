<A NAME="1436"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=754><b>sn</b> The use of the name Dan reflects a later perspective. The Danites did not migrate to this northern territory until centuries later (see Judg 18:29). Furthermore Dan was not even born until much later. By inserting this name a scribe has clarified the location of the region.</p>
