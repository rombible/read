<A NAME="1414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=732><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;they returned and came to En Mishpat (that is, Kadesh).&#8221; The two verbs together form a verbal hendiadys, the first serving as the adverb: &#8220;they returned and came&#8221; means &#8220;they came again.&#8221; Most English translations do not treat this as a hendiadys, but translate &#8220;they turned back&#8221; or something similar. Since in the context, however, &#8220;came again to&#8221; does not simply refer to travel but an assault against the place, the present translation expresses this as &#8220;attacked&#8230;again.&#8221;</p>
