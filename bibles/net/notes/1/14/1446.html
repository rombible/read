<A NAME="1446"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=764><b>sn</b> <i>Salem</i> is traditionally identified as the Jebusite stronghold of old Jerusalem. Accordingly, there has been much speculation about its king. Though some have identified him with the preincarnate Christ or with Noah&#8217;s son Shem, it is far more likely that Melchizedek was a Canaanite royal priest whom God used to renew the promise of the blessing to Abram, perhaps because Abram considered Melchizedek his spiritual superior. But Melchizedek remains an enigma. In a book filled with genealogical records he appears on the scene without a genealogy and then disappears from the narrative. In Psalm 110 the <sc>Lord declares that the Davidic king is a royal priest after the pattern of Melchizedek.</p>
