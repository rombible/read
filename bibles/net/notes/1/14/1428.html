<A NAME="1428"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=746><b>sn</b> E. A. Speiser (<i>Genesis</i> [AB], 103) suggests that part of this chapter came from an outside source since it refers to <i>Abram the Hebrew</i>. That is not impossible, given that the narrator likely utilized traditions and genealogies that had been collected and transmitted over the years. The meaning of the word &#8220;Hebrew&#8221; has proved elusive. It may be related to the verb &#8220;to cross over,&#8221; perhaps meaning &#8220;immigrant.&#8221; Or it might be derived from the name of Abram&#8217;s ancestor Eber (see Gen 11:14-16).</p>
