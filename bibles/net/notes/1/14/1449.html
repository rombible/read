<A NAME="1449"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=767><b>tn</b> Some translate &#8220;possessor of heaven and earth&#8221; (cf. NASB). But cognate evidence from Ugaritic indicates that there were two homonymic roots <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1464;&#1511;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qanah</font>), one meaning &#8220;to create&#8221; (as in Gen 4:1) and the other &#8220;to obtain, to acquire, to possess.&#8221; While &#8220;possessor&#8221; would fit here, &#8220;creator&#8221; is the more likely due to the collocation with &#8220;heaven and earth.&#8221;</p>
