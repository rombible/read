<A NAME="1456"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=774><b>tn</b> The oath formula is elliptical, reading simply: &#8220;&#8230;if I take.&#8221; It is as if Abram says, &#8220;[May the <sc>Lord deal with me] if I take,&#8221; meaning, &#8220;I will surely not take.&#8221; The positive oath would add the negative adverb and be the reverse: &#8220;[God will deal with me] if I do not take,&#8221; meaning, &#8220;I certainly will.&#8221;</p>
