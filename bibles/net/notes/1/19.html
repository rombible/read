<A NAME="191"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1019><b>tn</b> The disjunctive clause is temporal here, indicating what Lot was doing at the time of their arrival.</p>
<A NAME="192"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1020><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sitting in the gate of Sodom.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;the gate of Sodom&#8221; has been translated &#8220;the city&#8217;s gateway&#8221; for stylistic reasons.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The expression <i>sitting in the city&#8217;s gateway</i> may mean that Lot was exercising some type of judicial function (see the use of the idiom in 2 Sam 19:8; Jer 26:10; 38:7; 39:3).</p>
<A NAME="193"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1021><b>tn</b> The imperatives have the force of invitation.</p>
<A NAME="194"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1022><b>tn</b> These two verbs form a verbal hendiadys: &#8220;you can rise up early and go&#8221; means &#8220;you can go early.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="195"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1023><b>sn</b> The <i>town square</i> refers to the wide street area at the gate complex of the city.</p>
<A NAME="196"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1024><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">patsar</font>, &#8220;to press, to insist&#8221;) ironically foreshadows the hostile actions of the men of the city (see v. 9, where the verb also appears). The repetition of the word serves to contrast Lot to his world.</p>
<A NAME="197"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1025><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shakhav</font>) means &#8220;to lie down, to recline,&#8221; that is, &#8220;to go to bed.&#8221; Here what appears to be an imperfect is a preterite after the adverb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">terem</font>). The nuance of potential (perfect) fits well.</p>
<A NAME="198"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1026><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, from the young to the old, all the people from the end [of the city].&#8221; The repetition of the phrase &#8220;men of&#8221; stresses all kinds of men.</p>
<A NAME="199"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1027><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text adds &#8220;and said to him.&#8221; This is redundant in English and has not been translated for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="1910"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1028><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yada</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to know&#8221;) is used here in the sense of &#8220;to lie with&#8221; or &#8220;to have sex with&#8221; (as in Gen 4:1). That this is indeed the meaning is clear from Lot&#8217;s warning that they not do so wickedly, and his willingness to give them his daughters instead. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The sin of the men of Sodom is debated. The fact that the sin involved a sexual act (see note on the phrase &#8220;have sex&#8221; in 19:5) precludes an association of the sin with inhospitality as is sometimes asserted (see W. Roth, &#8220;What of Sodom and Gomorrah? Homosexual Acts in the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>Explor</i> 1 [1974]: 7-14). The text at a minimum condemns forced sexual intercourse, i.e., rape. Other considerations, though, point to a condemnation of homosexual acts more generally. The narrator emphasizes the fact that the men of Sodom wanted to have sex with men: They demand that Lot release the angelic messengers (seen as men) to them for sex, and when Lot offers his daughters as a substitute they refuse them and attempt to take the angelic messengers by force. In addition the wider context of the Pentateuch condemns homosexual acts as sin (see, e.g., Lev 18:22). Thus a reading of this text within its narrative context, both immediate and broad, condemns not only the attempted rape but also the attempted homosexual act.</p>
<A NAME="1911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1029><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;may my brothers not act wickedly.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1030><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;who have not known.&#8221; Here this expression is a euphemism for sexual intercourse.</p>
<A NAME="1913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1031><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;according to what is good in your eyes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1032><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;shadow.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1033><b>sn</b> This chapter portrays Lot as a hypocrite. He is well aware of the way the men live in his city and is apparently comfortable in the midst of it. But when confronted by the angels, he finally draws the line. But he is nevertheless willing to sacrifice his daughters&#8217; virginity to protect his guests. His opposition to the crowds leads to his rejection as a foreigner by those with whom he had chosen to live. The one who attempted to rescue his visitors ends up having to be rescued by them.</p>
<A NAME="1916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1034><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;approach out there&#8221; which could be rendered &#8220;Get out of the way, stand back!&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1917"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1035><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to live as a resident alien.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1036><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he has judged, judging.&#8221; The infinitive absolute follows the finite verbal form for emphasis. This emphasis is reflected in the translation by the phrase &#8220;dares to judge.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1037><b>tn</b> The verb &#8220;to do wickedly&#8221; is repeated here (see v. 7). It appears that whatever &#8220;wickedness&#8221; the men of Sodom had intended to do to Lot&#8217;s visitors &#8211; probably nothing short of homosexual rape &#8211; they were now ready to inflict on Lot.</p>
<A NAME="1920"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1038><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they pressed against the man, against Lot, exceedingly.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1921"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1039><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they drew near.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1041><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text adds &#8220;their hand.&#8221; These words have not been translated for stylistic reasons.</p>

<A NAME="1925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1043><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from the least to the greatest.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1044><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they&#8221;; the referent (the men of Sodom outside the door) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1045><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the men,&#8221; referring to the angels inside Lot&#8217;s house. The word &#8220;visitors&#8221; has been supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1928"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1046><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Yet who [is there] to you here?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1929"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1047><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;Do you have&#8221; are supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="1930"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1048><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a son-in-law and your sons and your daughters and anyone who (is) to you in the city.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1931"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1049><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the place.&#8221; The Hebrew article serves here as a demonstrative.</p>
<A NAME="1932"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1050><b>tn</b> The Hebrew participle expresses an imminent action here.</p>
<A NAME="1933"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1051><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for their outcry.&#8221; The words &#8220;about this place&#8221; have been supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="1934"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1052><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The repetition of the divine name has been replaced in the translation by the pronoun &#8220;he&#8221; for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="1935"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1053><b>sn</b> The language has to be interpreted in the light of the context and the social customs. The men are called &#8220;sons-in-law&#8221; (literally &#8220;the takers of his daughters&#8221;), but the daughters had not yet had sex with a man. It is better to translate the phrase &#8220;who were going to marry his daughters.&#8221; Since formal marriage contracts were binding, the husbands-to-be could already be called sons-in-law.</p>
<A NAME="1936"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1054><b>tn</b> The Hebrew active participle expresses an imminent action.</p>
<A NAME="1937"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1055><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he was like one taunting in the eyes of his sons-in-law.&#8221; These men mistakenly thought Lot was ridiculing them and their lifestyle. Their response illustrates how morally insensitive they had become.</p>
<A NAME="1938"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1056><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;When dawn came up.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1939"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1057><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;who are found.&#8221; The wording might imply he had other daughters living in the city, but the text does not explicitly state this.</p>
<A NAME="1940"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1058><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;with the iniquity [i.e., punishment] of the city&#8221; (cf. NASB, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="1941"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1059><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Lot) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1942"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1060><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the compassion of the <sc>Lord to them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1943"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1061><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;brought him out and placed him.&#8221; The third masculine singular suffixes refer specifically to Lot, though his wife and daughters accompanied him (see v. 17). For stylistic reasons these have been translated as plural pronouns (&#8220;them&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1944"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1062><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;one of them&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he.&#8221; Several ancient versions (LXX, Vulgate, Syriac) read the plural &#8220;they.&#8221; See also the note on &#8220;your&#8221; in v. 19.</p>
<A NAME="1945"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1063><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;escape.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1946"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1064><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb translated &#8220;look&#8221; signifies an intense gaze, not a passing glance. This same verb is used later in v. 26 to describe Lot&#8217;s wife&#8217;s self-destructive look back at the city.</p>
<A NAME="1947"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1065><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;in the plain&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the circle,&#8221; referring to the &#8220;circle&#8221; or oval area of the Jordan Valley.</p>
<A NAME="1948"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1066><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;my lords.&#8221; See the following note on the problem of identifying the addressee here. The Hebrew term is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adonay</font>).</p>
<A NAME="1949"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1067><b>tn</b> The second person pronominal suffixes are singular in this verse (note &#8220;your eyes,&#8221; &#8220;you have made great,&#8221; and &#8220;you have acted&#8221;). Verse 18a seems to indicate that Lot is addressing the angels, but the use of the singular and the appearance of the divine title &#8220;Lord&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">adonay</font>) in v. 18b suggests he is speaking to God.</p>
<A NAME="1950"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1068><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in your eyes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1951"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1069><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you made great your kindness.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1952"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=1070><b>sn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khesed</font>) can refer to &#8220;faithful love&#8221; or to &#8220;kindness,&#8221; depending on the context. The precise nuance here is uncertain.</p>
<A NAME="1953"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1071><b>tn</b> The infinitive construct explains how God has shown Lot kindness.</p>
<A NAME="1954"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1072><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lest.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1955"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=1073><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">davaq</font>) normally means &#8220;to stick to, to cleave, to join.&#8221; Lot is afraid he cannot outrun the coming calamity.</p>
<A NAME="1956"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=1074><b>tn</b> The perfect verb form with <i>vav</i> consecutive carries the nuance of the imperfect verbal form before it.</p>
<A NAME="1957"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=1075><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ir</font>) can refer to either a city or a town, depending on the size of the place. Given that this place was described by Lot later in this verse as a &#8220;little place,&#8221; the translation uses &#8220;town.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1958"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=1076><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Look, this town is near to flee to there. And it is little.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1959"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=1077><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Let me escape to there.&#8221; The cohortative here expresses Lot&#8217;s request.</p>
<A NAME="1960"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=1078><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Is it not little?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1961"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=1079><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my soul will live.&#8221; After the cohortative the jussive with <i>vav</i> conjunctive here indicates purpose/result.</p>
<A NAME="1962"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=1080><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And he said, &#8216;Look, I will grant.&#8217;&#8221; The order of the clauses has been rearranged for stylistic reasons. The referent of the speaker (&#8220;he&#8221;) is somewhat ambiguous: It could be taken as the angel to whom Lot has been speaking (so NLT; note the singular references in vv. 18-19), or it could be that Lot is speaking directly to the <sc>Lord here. Most English translations leave the referent of the pronoun unspecified and maintain the ambiguity.</p>
<A NAME="1963"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=1081><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I have lifted up your face [i.e., shown you favor] also concerning this matter.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1964"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=1082><b>tn</b> The negated infinitive construct indicates either the consequence of God&#8217;s granting the request (&#8220;I have granted this request, so that I will not&#8221;) or the manner in which he will grant it (&#8220;I have granted your request by not destroying&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1965"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=1083><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Be quick! Escape to there!&#8221; The two imperatives form a verbal hendiadys, the first becoming adverbial.</p>
<A NAME="1966"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=1084><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Therefore the name of the city is called Zoar.&#8221; The name of the place, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1493;&#1465;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tso</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ar</font>) apparently means &#8220;Little Place,&#8221; in light of the wordplay with the term &#8220;little&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mits</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ar</font>) used twice by Lot to describe the town (v. 20).</p>

<A NAME="1968"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=1086><b>tn</b> The juxtaposition of the two disjunctive clauses indicates synchronic action. The first action (the sun&#8217;s rising) occurred as the second (Lot&#8217;s entering Zoar) took place. The disjunctive clauses also signal closure for the preceding scene.</p>
<A NAME="1969"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=1087><b>tn</b> The disjunctive clause signals the beginning of the next scene and highlights God&#8217;s action.</p>

Abraham had family in that area. He had rescued those people from the invasion. That was why he interceded. Yet he surely knew how wicked they were.
