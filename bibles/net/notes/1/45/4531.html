<A NAME="4531"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2813><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;do not be stirred up in the way.&#8221; The verb means &#8220;stir up.&#8221; Some understand the Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1490;&#1464;&#1494;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ragaz</font>, &#8220;to stir up&#8221;) as a reference to quarreling (see Prov 29:9, where it has this connotation), but in Exod 15:14 and other passages it means &#8220;to fear.&#8221; This might refer to a fear of robbers, but more likely it is an assuring word that they need not be fearful about returning to Egypt. They might have thought that once Jacob was in Egypt, Joseph would take his revenge on them.</p>
