<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=76><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Now every sprig of the field before it was.&#8221; The verb forms, although appearing to be imperfects, are technically preterites coming after the adverb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">terem</font>). The word order (conjunction + subject + predicate) indicates a disjunctive clause, which provides background information for the following narrative (as in 1:2). Two negative clauses are given (&#8220;before any sprig&#8230;&#8221;, and &#8220;before any cultivated grain&#8221; existed), followed by two causal clauses explaining them, and then a positive circumstantial clause is given &#8211; again dealing with water as in 1:2 (water would well up). </p>
