<A NAME="270"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=133><b>sn</b> This poetic section expresses the correspondence between the man and the woman. She is bone of his bones, flesh of his flesh. Note the wordplay (paronomasia) between &#8220;woman&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">ishah</font>) and &#8220;man&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">ish</font>). On the surface it appears that the word for woman is the feminine form of the word for man. But the two words are not etymologically related. The sound and the sense give that impression, however, and make for a more effective wordplay.</p>
