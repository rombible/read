<A NAME="258"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=121><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;fashioned.&#8221; To harmonize the order of events with the chronology of chapter one, some translate the prefixed verb form with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive as a past perfect (&#8220;had formed,&#8221; cf. NIV) here. (In chapter one the creation of the animals preceded the creation of man; here the animals are created after the man.) However, it is unlikely that the Hebrew construction can be translated in this way in the middle of this pericope, for the criteria for unmarked temporal overlay are not present here. See S. R. Driver, <i>A Treatise on the Use of the Tenses in Hebrew</i>, 84-88, and especially R. Buth, &#8220;Methodological Collision between Source Criticism and Discourse Analysis,&#8221; <i>Biblical Hebrew and Discourse Linguistics</i>, 138-54. For a contrary viewpoint see <i>IBHS</i> 552-53 §33.2.3 and C. J. Collins, &#8220;The <i>Wayyiqtol</i> as &#8216;Pluperfect&#8217;: When and Why,&#8221; <i>TynBul </i>46 (1995): 117-40.</p>
