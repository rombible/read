<A NAME="274"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=137><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they become one flesh.&#8221; The perfect with <i>vav</i> consecutive carries the same habitual or characteristic nuance as the preceding verbs in the verse. The retention of the word &#8220;flesh&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">basar</font>) in the translation often leads to improper or incomplete interpretations. The Hebrew word refers to more than just a sexual union. When they unite in marriage, the man and woman bring into being a new family unit (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;</font> + <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hayah</font> + <font face="Scholar">lamed</font> preposition means &#8220;become&#8221;). The phrase &#8220;one flesh&#8221; occurs only here and must be interpreted in light of v. 23. There the man declares that the woman is bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. To be one&#8217;s &#8220;bone and flesh&#8221; is to be related by blood to someone. For example, the phrase describes the relationship between Laban and Jacob (Gen 29:14); Abimelech and the Shechemites (Judg 9:2; his mother was a Shechemite); David and the Israelites (2 Sam 5:1); David and the elders of Judah (2 Sam 19:12); and David and his nephew Amasa (2 Sam 19:13, see 2 Sam 17:2; 1 Chr 2:16-17). The expression &#8220;one flesh&#8221; seems to indicate that they become, as it were, &#8220;kin,&#8221; at least legally (a new family unit is created) or metaphorically. In this first marriage in human history, the woman was literally formed from the man&#8217;s bone and flesh. Even though later marriages do not involve such a divine surgical operation, the first marriage sets the pattern for how later marriages are understood and explains why marriage supersedes the parent-child relationship.</p>
