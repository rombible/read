<A NAME="271"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=134><b>tn</b> This statement, introduced by the Hebrew phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al-ken</font>, &#8220;therefore&#8221; or &#8220;that is why&#8221;), is an editorial comment, not an extension of the quotation. The statement is describing what typically happens, not what will or should happen. It is saying, &#8220;This is why we do things the way we do.&#8221; It links a contemporary (with the narrator) practice with the historical event being narrated. The historical event narrated in v. 23 provides the basis for the contemporary practice described in v. 24. That is why the imperfect verb forms are translated with the present tense rather than future. </p>
