<A NAME="268"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=131><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text is very precise, stating: &#8220;of this one it will be said, &#8216;woman&#8217;.&#8221; The text is not necessarily saying that the man named his wife &#8211; that comes after the fall (Gen 3:20).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Some argue that naming implies the man&#8217;s authority or ownership over the woman here. Naming can indicate ownership or authority if one is calling someone or something <i>by</i> one&#8217;s name and/or calling a name <i>over</i> someone or something (see 2 Sam 12:28; 2 Chr 7:14; Isa 4:1; Jer 7:14; 15:16), especially if one is conquering and renaming a site. But the idiomatic construction used here (the Niphal of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">qara</font>&#8217;, with preposition lamed [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">lÿ</font>]) does not suggest such an idea. In each case where it is used, the one naming discerns something about the object being named and gives it an appropriate name (See 1 Sam 9:9; 2 Sam 18:18; Prov 16:21; Isa 1:26; 32:5; 35:8; 62:4, 12; Jer 19:6). Adam is not so much naming the woman as he is discerning her close relationship to him and referring to her accordingly. He may simply be anticipating that she will be given an appropriate name based on the discernible similarity.</p>
