<A NAME="232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=95><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;tree of the knowledge of good and evil&#8221; must be interpreted to mean that the tree would produce fruit which, when eaten, gives special knowledge of &#8220;good and evil.&#8221; Scholars debate what this phrase means here. For a survey of opinions, see G. J. Wenham, <i>Genesis </i>(WBC), 1:62-64. One view is that &#8220;good&#8221; refers to that which enhances, promotes, and produces life, while &#8220;evil&#8221; refers to anything that hinders, interrupts or destroys life. So eating from this tree would change human nature &#8211; people would be able to alter life for better (in their thinking) or for worse. See D. J. A. Clines, &#8220;The Tree of Knowledge and the Law of Yahweh,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 24 (1974): 8-14; and I. Engnell, &#8220;&#8216;Knowledge&#8217; and &#8216;Life&#8217; in the Creation Story,&#8221; <i>Wisdom in Israel and in the Ancient Near East</i> [VTSup], 103-19. Another view understands the &#8220;knowledge of good and evil&#8221; as the capacity to discern between moral good and evil. The following context suggests the tree&#8217;s fruit gives one wisdom (see the phrase &#8220;capable of making one wise&#8221; in 3:6, as well as the note there on the word &#8220;wise&#8221;), which certainly includes the capacity to discern between good and evil. Such wisdom is characteristic of divine beings, as the serpent&#8217;s promise implies (3:5) and as 3:22 makes clear. (Note, however, that this capacity does not include the ability to <i>do</i> what is right.) God prohibits man from eating of the tree. The prohibition becomes a test to see if man will be satisfied with his role and place, or if he will try to ascend to the divine level. There will be a time for man to possess moral discernment/wisdom, as God reveals and imparts it to him, but it is not something to be grasped at in an effort to become &#8220;a god.&#8221; In fact, the command to be obedient was the first lesson in moral discernment/wisdom. God was essentially saying: &#8220;Here is lesson one &#8211; respect my authority and commands. Disobey me and you will die.&#8221; When man disobeys, he decides he does not want to acquire moral wisdom God&#8217;s way, but instead tries to rise immediately to the divine level. Once man has acquired such divine wisdom by eating the tree&#8217;s fruit (3:22), he must be banned from the garden so that he will not be able to achieve his goal of being godlike and thus live forever, a divine characteristic (3:24). Ironically, man now has the capacity to discern good from evil (3:22), but he is morally corrupted and rebellious and will not consistently choose what is right.</p>
