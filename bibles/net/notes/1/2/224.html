<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=87><b>tn</b> Traditionally &#8220;garden,&#8221; but the subsequent description of this &#8220;garden&#8221; makes it clear that it is an orchard of fruit trees.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The </i><sc>Lord</><i> God planted an orchard</i>. Nothing is said of how the creation of this orchard took place. A harmonization with chap. 1 might lead to the conclusion that it was by decree, prior to the creation of human life. But the narrative sequence here in chap. 2 suggests the creation of the garden followed the creation of the man. Note also the past perfect use of the perfect in the relative clause in the following verse.</p>
