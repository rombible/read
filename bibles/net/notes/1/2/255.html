<A NAME="255"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=118><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;The being of man by himself is not good.&#8221; The meaning of &#8220;good&#8221; must be defined contextually. Within the context of creation, in which God instructs humankind to be fruitful and multiply, the man alone cannot comply. Being alone prevents the man from fulfilling the design of creation and therefore is not good.</p>
