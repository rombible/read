<A NAME="256"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=119><b>tn</b> Traditionally &#8220;helper.&#8221; The English word &#8220;helper,&#8221; because it can connote so many different ideas, does not accurately convey the connotation of the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1494;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ezer</font>). Usage of the Hebrew term does not suggest a subordinate role, a connotation which English &#8220;helper&#8221; can have. In the Bible God is frequently described as the &#8220;helper,&#8221; the one who does for us what we cannot do for ourselves, the one who meets our needs. In this context the word seems to express the idea of an &#8220;indispensable companion.&#8221; The woman would supply what the man was lacking in the design of creation and logically it would follow that the man would supply what she was lacking, although that is not stated here. See further M. L. Rosenzweig, &#8220;A Helper Equal to Him,&#8221; <i>Jud</i> 139 (1986): 277-80.</p>
