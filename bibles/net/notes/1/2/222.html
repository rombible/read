C. Mitchell, &#8220;The Old Testament Usage of <font face="Scholar">Nÿshama</font>,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 11 [1961]: 177-87). Its usage in the Bible conveys more than a breathing living organism (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473; &#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nefesh khayyah</font>). Whatever is given this breath of life becomes animated with the life from God, has spiritual understanding (Job 32:8), and has a functioning conscience (Prov 20:27).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Human life is described here as consisting of a body (made from soil from the ground) and breath (given by God). Both animals and humans are called &#8220;a living being&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473; &#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1492;</font>) but humankind became that in a different and more significant way.</p>
