<A NAME="234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=97><b>tn</b> The Hebrew active participle may be translated here as indicating past durative action, &#8220;was flowing,&#8221; or as a present durative, &#8220;flows.&#8221; Since this river was the source of the rivers mentioned in vv. 11-14, which appear to describe a situation contemporary with the narrator, it is preferable to translate the participle in v. 10 with the present tense. This suggests that Eden and its orchard still existed in the narrator&#8217;s time. According to ancient Jewish tradition, Enoch was taken to the Garden of Eden, where his presence insulated the garden from the destructive waters of Noah&#8217;s flood. See <i>Jub.</i> 4:23-24.</p>
