<A NAME="273"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=136><b>tn</b> The perfect with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive carries the same habitual or characteristic nuance as the preceding imperfect. The verb is traditionally translated &#8220;cleaves [to]&#8221;; it has the basic idea of &#8220;stick with/to&#8221; (e.g., it is used of Ruth resolutely staying with her mother-in-law in Ruth 1:14). In this passage it describes the <i>inseparable</i> relationship between the man and the woman in marriage as God intended it.</p>
