<A NAME="29"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=72><b>tn</b> The Hebrew phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492; &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1456;&#1491;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elle tolÿdot</font>) is traditionally translated as &#8220;these are the generations of&#8221; because the noun was derived from the verb &#8220;beget.&#8221; Its usage, however, shows that it introduces more than genealogies; it begins a narrative that traces what became of the entity or individual mentioned in the heading. In fact, a good paraphrase of this heading would be: &#8220;This is what became of the heavens and the earth,&#8221; for what follows is not another account of creation but a tracing of events from creation through the fall and judgment (the section extends from 2:4 through 4:26). See M. H. Woudstra, &#8220;The <i>Toledot</i> of the Book of Genesis and Their Redemptive-Historical Significance,&#8221; <i>CTJ </i>5 (1970): 184-89.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The expression <i>this is the account of</i> is an important title used throughout the Book of Genesis, serving as the organizing principle of the work. It is always a heading, introducing the subject matter that is to come. From the starting point of the title, the narrative traces the genealogy or the records or the particulars involved. Although some would make the heading in 2:4 a summary of creation (1:1&#8211;2:3), that goes against the usage in the book. As a heading it introduces the theme of the next section, the particulars about this creation that God made. Genesis 2 is not a simple parallel account of creation; rather, beginning with the account of the creation of man and women, the narrative tells what became of that creation. As a beginning, the construction of 2:4-7 forms a fine parallel to the construction of 1:1-3.

So, what became of the creation? Gen 2:4&#8211;4:26 will explain that sin entered the world and all but destroyed God&#8217;s perfect creation.</p>
