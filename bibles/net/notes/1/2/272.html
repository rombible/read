<A NAME="272"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=135><b>tn</b> The imperfect verb form has a habitual or characteristic nuance. For other examples of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al-ken</font>, &#8220;therefore, that is why&#8221;) with the imperfect in a narrative framework, see Gen 10:9; 32:32 (the phrase &#8220;to this day&#8221; indicates characteristic behavior is in view); Num 21:14, 27; 1 Sam 5:5 (note &#8220;to this day&#8221;); 19:24 (perhaps the imperfect is customary here, &#8220;were saying&#8221;); 2 Sam 5:8. The verb translated &#8220;leave&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1494;&#1464;&#1489;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">azab</font>) normally means &#8220;to abandon, to forsake, to leave behind, to discard,&#8221; when used with human subject and object (see Josh 22:3; 1 Sam 30:13; Ps 27:10; Prov 2:17; Isa 54:6; 60:15; 62:4; Jer 49:11). Within the context of the ancient Israelite extended family structure, this cannot refer to emotional or geographical separation. The narrator is using hyperbole to emphasize the change in perspective that typically overtakes a young man when his thoughts turn to love and marriage.</p>
