<A NAME="248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=111><b>sn</b> This is the first time in the Bible that the verb <font face="Scholar">tsavah</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, &#8220;to command&#8221;) appears. Whatever the man had to do in the garden, the main focus of the narrative is on keeping God&#8217;s commandments. God created humans with the capacity to obey him and then tested them with commands.</p>
