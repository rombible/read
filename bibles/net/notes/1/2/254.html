<A NAME="254"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=117><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;dying you will die.&#8221; The imperfect verb form here has the nuance of the specific future because it is introduced with the temporal clause, &#8220;when you eat&#8230;you will die.&#8221; That certainty is underscored with the infinitive absolute, &#8220;you will <i>surely</i> die.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Hebrew text (&#8220;dying you will die&#8221;) does not refer to two aspects of death (&#8220;dying spiritually, you will then die physically&#8221;). The construction simply emphasizes the certainty of death, however it is defined. Death is essentially separation. To die physically means separation from the land of the living, but not extinction. To die spiritually means to be separated from God. Both occur with sin, although the physical alienation is more gradual than instant, and the spiritual is immediate, although the effects of it continue the separation.</p>
