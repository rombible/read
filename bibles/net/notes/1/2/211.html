<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=74><b>sn</b> Advocates of the so-called documentary hypothesis of pentateuchal authorship argue that the introduction of the name Yahweh (<sc>Lord) here indicates that a new source (designated J), a parallel account of creation, begins here. In this scheme Gen 1:1-2:3 is understood as the priestly source (designated P) of creation. Critics of this approach often respond that the names, rather than indicating separate sources, were chosen to reflect the subject matter (see U. Cassuto, <i>The Documentary Hypothesis</i>). Gen 1:1&#8211;2:3 is the grand prologue of the book, showing the sovereign God creating by decree. The narrative beginning in 2:4 is the account of what this God invested in his creation. Since it deals with the close, personal involvement of the covenant God, the narrative uses the covenantal name Yahweh (<sc>Lord) in combination with the name God. For a recent discussion of the documentary hypothesis from a theologically conservative perspective, see D. A. Garrett, <i>Rethinking Genesis</i>. For an attempt by source critics to demonstrate the legitimacy of the source critical method on the basis of ancient Near Eastern parallels, see J. H. Tigay, ed., <i>Empirical Models for Biblical Criticism</i>. For reaction to the source critical method by literary critics, see I. M. Kikawada and A. Quinn, <i>Before Abraham Was</i>; R. Alter, <i>The Art of Biblical Narrative</i>, 131-54; and Adele Berlin, <i>Poetics and Interpretation of Biblical Narrative</i>, 111-34.</p>
