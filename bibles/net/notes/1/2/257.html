<A NAME="257"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=120><b>tn</b> The Hebrew expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1462;&#1490;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kÿnegdo</font>) literally means &#8220;according to the opposite of him.&#8221; Translations such as &#8220;suitable [for]&#8221; (NASB, NIV), &#8220;matching,&#8221; &#8220;corresponding to&#8221; all capture the idea. (Translations that render the phrase simply &#8220;partner&#8221; [cf. NEB, NRSV], while not totally inaccurate, do not reflect the nuance of correspondence and/or suitability.) The man&#8217;s form and nature are matched by the woman&#8217;s as she reflects him and complements him. Together they correspond. In short, this prepositional phrase indicates that she has everything that God had invested in him.</p>
