<A NAME="485"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2906><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Look, I am making you fruitful.&#8221; The participle following <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>) has the nuance of a certain and often imminent future.</p>
<A NAME="486"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2907><b>tn</b> The perfect verbal form with <i>vav</i> consecutive carries on the certain future idea.</p>

It is the noun form of the same verb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1494;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">akhaz</font>) that was used for the land given to them in Goshen (Gen 47:27).</p>
<A NAME="489"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2910><b>sn</b> <i>They will be mine</i>. Jacob is here adopting his two grandsons Manasseh and Ephraim as his sons, and so they will have equal share with the other brothers. They will be in the place of Joseph and Levi (who will become a priestly tribe) in the settlement of the land. See I. Mendelsohn, &#8220;A Ugaritic Parallel to the Adoption of Ephraim and Manasseh,&#8221; <i>IEJ</i> (1959): 180-83.</p>

<A NAME="4817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2918><b>tn</b> The cohortative with prefixed <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) indicates purpose after the imperative.</p>
<A NAME="4818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2919><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;heavy.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The disjunctive clause provides supplemental information that is important to the story. The weakness of Israel&#8217;s sight is one of several connections between this chapter and Gen 27. Here there are two sons, and it appears that the younger is being blessed over the older by a blind old man. While it was by Jacob&#8217;s deception in chap. 27, here it is with Jacob&#8217;s full knowledge.</p>
<A NAME="4819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2920><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Joseph) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>

<A NAME="4822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2923><b>tn</b> On the meaning of the Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">palal</font>) here, see E. A. Speiser, &#8220;The Stem <i>pll</i> in Hebrew,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 82 (1963): 301-6. Speiser argues that this verb means &#8220;to estimate&#8221; as in Exod 21:22.</p>
<A NAME="4823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2924><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your face.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2925><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;offspring.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2926><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Joseph brought them out from with his knees.&#8221; The two boys had probably been standing by Israel&#8217;s knees when being adopted and blessed. The referent of the pronoun &#8220;his&#8221; (Israel) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="4826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2927><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Joseph took the two of them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2928><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he brought near to him.&#8221; The referents of the pronouns &#8220;he&#8221; and &#8220;him&#8221; (Joseph and his father respectively) have been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="4828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2929><b>tn</b> The disjunctive clause is circumstantial-concessive here.</p>
<A NAME="4829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2930><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;shepherded me.&#8221; The verb has been translated as an English noun for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="4830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2931><b>sn</b> The Samaritan Pentateuch reads &#8220;king&#8221; here, but the traditional reading (&#8220;angel&#8221;) may be maintained. Jacob closely associates God with an angelic protective presence. This does not mean that Jacob viewed his God as a mere angel, but it does suggest that he was aware of an angelic presence sent by God to protect him. Here he so closely associates the two that they become virtually indistinguishable. In this culture messengers typically carried the authority of the one who sent them and could even be addressed as such. Perhaps Jacob thought that the divine blessing would be mediated through this angelic messenger.</p>
<A NAME="4831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2932><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ga</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) has the basic idea of &#8220;protect&#8221; as a near relative might do. It is used for buying someone out of bondage, marrying a deceased brother&#8217;s widow, paying off debts, avenging the family, and the like. The meanings of &#8220;deliver, protect, avenge&#8221; are most fitting when God is the subject (see A. R. Johnson, &#8220;The Primary Meaning of &#8730;<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1488;&#1500;</font>,&#8221; <i>Congress Volume: Copenhagen, 1953</i> [VTSup], 67-77).</p>
<A NAME="4832"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2933><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;be recalled through them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4833"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2934><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;it was bad in his eyes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4834"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2935><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fullness.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4835"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2936><b>tn</b> The pronoun is singular in the Hebrew text, apparently elevating Ephraim as the more prominent of the two. Note, however, that both are named in the blessing formula that follows.</p>
<A NAME="4836"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2937><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;pronounce a blessing.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4837"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2938><b>sn</b> On the elevation of <i>Ephraim</i> over <i>Manasseh </i>see E. C. Kingsbury, &#8220;He Set Ephraim Before Manasseh,&#8221; <i>HUCA</i> 38 (1967): 129-36; H. Mowvley, &#8220;The Concept and Content of &#8216;Blessing&#8217; in the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>BT</i> 16 (1965): 74-80; and I. Mendelsohn, &#8220;On the Preferential Status of the Eldest Son,&#8221; <i>BASOR</i> 156 (1959): 38-40.</p>
<A NAME="4838"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2939><b>tn</b> The pronouns translated &#8220;you,&#8221; &#8220;you,&#8221; and &#8220;your&#8221; in this verse are plural in the Hebrew text.</p>
<A NAME="4839"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2940><b>tn</b> The pronouns translated &#8220;your&#8221; and &#8220;you&#8221; in this verse are singular in the Hebrew text.</p>
<A NAME="4840"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=2941><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿkhem</font>) could be translated either as &#8220;mountain slope&#8221; or &#8220;shoulder, portion,&#8221; or even taken as the proper name &#8220;Shechem.&#8221; Jacob was giving Joseph either (1) one portion above his brothers, or (2) the mountain ridge he took from the Amorites, or (3) Shechem. The ambiguity actually allows for all three to be the referent. He could be referring to the land in Shechem he bought in Gen 33:18-19, but he mentions here that it was acquired by warfare, suggesting that the events of 34:25-29 are in view (even though at the time he denounced it, 34:30). Joseph was later buried in Shechem (Josh 24:32).</p>
