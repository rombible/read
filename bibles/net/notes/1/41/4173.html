<A NAME="4173"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=2555><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and at your mouth (i.e., instructions) all my people will kiss.&#8221; G. J. Wenham translates this &#8220;shall kowtow to your instruction&#8221; (<i>Genesis </i>[WBC], 2:395). Although there is some textual support for reading &#8220;will be judged, ruled by you,&#8221; this is probably an attempt to capture the significance of this word. Wenham lists a number of references where individuals have tried to make connections with other words or expressions &#8211; such as a root meaning &#8220;order themselves&#8221; lying behind &#8220;kiss,&#8221; or an idiomatic idea of &#8220;kiss&#8221; meaning &#8220;seal the mouth,&#8221; and so &#8220;be silent and submit to.&#8221; See K. A. Kitchen, &#8220;The Term <i>Nsq</i> in Genesis 41:40,&#8221; <i>ExpTim</i> 69 (1957): 30; D. S. Sperling, &#8220;Genesis 41:40: A New Interpretation,&#8221; <i>JANESCU</i> 10 (1978): 113-19.</p>
