<A NAME="41102"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">102</span><note=2584><b>sn</b> The name <i>Ephraim</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1508;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">efrayim</font>), a form of the Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">parah</font>), means &#8220;to bear fruit.&#8221; The theme of fruitfulness is connected with this line of the family from Rachel (30:2) on down (see Gen 49:22, Deut 33:13-17, and Hos 13:15). But there is some difficulty with the name &#8220;Ephraim&#8221; itself. It appears to be a dual, for which F. Delitzsch simply said it meant &#8220;double fruitfulness&#8221; (<i>New Commentary on Genesis</i>, 2:305). G. J. Spurrell suggested it was a diphthongal pronunciation of a name ending in <i>-an</i> or <i>-am</i>, often thought to be dual suffixes (<i>Notes on the text of the book of Genesis</i>, 334). Many, however, simply connect the name to the territory of Ephraim and interpret it to be &#8220;fertile land&#8221; (C. Fontinoy, &#8220;Les noms de lieux en <i>-ayim</i> dans la Bible,&#8221; <i>UF</i> 3 [1971]: 33-40). The dual would then be an old locative ending. There is no doubt that the name became attached to the land in which the tribe settled, and it is possible that is where the dual ending came from, but in this story it refers to Joseph&#8217;s God-given fruitfulness.</p>
