<A NAME="309"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1797><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and I will be built up, even I, from her.&#8221; The prefixed verbal form with the conjunction is subordinated to the preceding prefixed verbal form and gives the ultimate purpose for the proposed action. The idiom of &#8220;built up&#8221; here refers to having a family (see Gen 16:2, as well as Ruth 4:11 and BDB 125 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font>).</p>

<A NAME="3014"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1802><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and also he has heard my voice.&#8221; The expression means that God responded positively to Rachel&#8217;s cry and granted her request.</p>
<A NAME="3015"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1803><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;therefore.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1804><b>sn</b> The name <i>Dan</i> means &#8220;he vindicated&#8221; or &#8220;he judged.&#8221; The name plays on the verb used in the statement which appears earlier in the verse. The verb translated &#8220;vindicated&#8221; is from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">din</font>, &#8220;to judge, to vindicate&#8221;), the same verbal root from which the name is derived. Rachel sensed that God was righting the wrong.</p>
<A NAME="3017"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1805><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and she became pregnant again and Bilhah, the servant of Rachel, bore a second son for Jacob.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3018"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1806><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[with] a mighty struggle I have struggled with my sister, also I have prevailed.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;mighty struggle&#8221; reads literally &#8220;struggles of God.&#8221; The plural participle &#8220;struggles&#8221; reflects the ongoing nature of the struggle, while the divine name is used here idiomatically to emphasize the intensity of the struggle. See J. Skinner, <i>Genesis </i>(ICC), 387.</p>
<A NAME="3019"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1807><b>sn</b> The name <i>Naphtali</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">naftali</font>) must mean something like &#8220;my struggle&#8221; in view of the statement Rachel made in the preceding clause. The name plays on this earlier statement, &#8220;[with] a mighty struggle I have struggled with my sister.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3020"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1808><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;she took her servant Zilpah and gave her.&#8221; The verbs &#8220;took&#8221; and &#8220;gave&#8221; are treated as a hendiadys in the translation: &#8220;she gave.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1809><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Zilpah, the servant of Leah, bore for Jacob a son.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3022"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1810><b>tc</b> The statement in the <i>Kethib</i> (consonantal text) appears to mean literally &#8220;with good fortune,&#8221; if one takes the initial <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font> (<i>bet</i>) as a preposition indicating accompaniment. The <i>Qere</i> (marginal reading) means &#8220;good fortune has arrived.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1811><b>sn</b> The name <i>Gad</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">gad</font>) means &#8220;good fortune.&#8221; The name reflects Leah&#8217;s feeling that good fortune has come her way, as expressed in her statement recorded earlier in the verse.</p>
<A NAME="3024"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1812><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Zilpah, the servant of Leah, bore a second son for Jacob.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3025"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1813><b>tn</b> The Hebrew statement apparently means &#8220;with my happiness.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3026"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1814><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;daughters.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3027"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1815><b>sn</b> The name <i>Asher </i>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">asher</font>) apparently means &#8220;happy one.&#8221; The name plays on the words used in the statement which appears earlier in the verse. Both the Hebrew noun and verb translated &#8220;happy&#8221; and &#8220;call me happy,&#8221; respectively, are derived from the same root as the name Asher.</p>
<A NAME="3028"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1816><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;during the days.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3029"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1817><b>sn</b> <i>Mandrake plants</i> were popularly believed to be an aphrodisiac in the culture of the time.</p>
<A NAME="3030"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1818><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and she said to her&#8221;; the referent of the pronoun &#8220;she&#8221; (Leah) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3031"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1819><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;therefore.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3032"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1820><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;lie down.&#8221; The expression &#8220;lie down with&#8221; in this context (here and in the following verse) refers to sexual intercourse. The imperfect verbal form has a permissive nuance here.</p>
<A NAME="3033"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1821><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;must come in to me.&#8221; The imperfect verbal form has an obligatory nuance here. She has acquired him for the night and feels he is obligated to have sexual relations with her.</p>
<A NAME="3034"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1822><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I have surely hired.&#8221; The infinitive absolute precedes the finite verbal form for emphasis. The name Issachar (see v. 18) seems to be related to this expression.</p>
<A NAME="3035"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1823><b>tn</b> This is the same Hebrew verb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1489;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shakhav</font>) translated &#8220;sleep with&#8221; in v. 15. In direct discourse the more euphemistic &#8220;sleep with&#8221; was used, but here in the narrative &#8220;marital relations&#8221; reflects more clearly the emphasis on sexual intercourse.</p>
<A NAME="3036"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1824><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;listened to.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3037"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1825><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;she conceived&#8221; (also in v. 19).</p>
<A NAME="3038"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1826><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and she bore for Jacob a fifth son,&#8221; i.e., this was the fifth son that Leah had given Jacob.</p>
<A NAME="3039"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1827><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;God has given my reward.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3040"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1828><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;as a wife&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text, but are supplied for clarity (cf. v. 9).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Leah seems to regard the act of giving her <i>servant</i> Zilpah to her husband as a sacrifice, for which (she believes) God is now rewarding her with the birth of a son.</p>
<A NAME="3041"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1829><b>sn</b> The name <i>Issachar</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1499;&#1464;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yishakhar</font>) appears to mean &#8220;man of reward&#8221; or possibly &#8220;there is reward.&#8221; The name plays on the word used in the statement made earlier in the verse. The Hebrew noun translated &#8220;reward&#8221; is derived from the same root as the name Issachar. The irony is that Rachel thought the mandrakes would work for her, and she was willing to trade one night for them. But in that one night Leah became pregnant.</p>
<A NAME="3042"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1830><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and she bore a sixth son for Jacob,&#8221; i.e., this was the sixth son that Leah had given Jacob.</p>
<A NAME="3043"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1831><b>sn</b> The name <i>Zebulun</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1456;&#1489;&#1467;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">zevulun</font>) apparently means &#8220;honor.&#8221; The name plays on the verb used in the statement made earlier in the verse. The Hebrew verb translated &#8220;will honor&#8221; and the name Zebulun derive from the same root.</p>
<A NAME="3044"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1832><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;remembered.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3045"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1833><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and God listened to her and opened up her womb.&#8221; Since &#8220;God&#8221; is the subject of the previous clause, the noun has been replaced by the pronoun &#8220;he&#8221; in the translation for stylistic reasons</p>
<A NAME="3046"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1834><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;conceived.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3047"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1835><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my reproach.&#8221; A &#8220;reproach&#8221; is a cutting taunt or painful ridicule, but here it probably refers by metonymy to Rachel&#8217;s barren condition, which was considered shameful in this culture and was the reason why she was the object of taunting and ridicule.</p>
<A NAME="3048"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1836><b>sn</b> The name <i>Joseph</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1505;&#1461;&#1507;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yoseph</font>) means &#8220;may he add.&#8221; The name expresses Rachel&#8217;s desire to have an additional son. In Hebrew the name sounds like the verb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1507;</font>,&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asasf</font>) translated &#8220;taken away&#8221; in the earlier statement made in v. 23. So the name, while reflecting Rachel&#8217;s hope, was also a reminder that God had removed her shame.</p>
<A NAME="3049"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1837><b>tn</b> The perfect verbal form is translated as a past perfect because Rachel&#8217;s giving birth to Joseph preceded Jacob&#8217;s conversation with Laban.</p>
<A NAME="3050"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1838><b>tn</b> The imperatival form here expresses a request.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> For Jacob to ask to leave would mean that seven more years had passed. Thus all Jacob&#8217;s children were born within the range of seven years of each other, with Joseph coming right at the end of the seven years.</p>
<A NAME="3051"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1839><b>tn</b> Following the imperative, the cohortative with the prefixed conjunction indicates purpose or result.</p>
<A NAME="3052"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=1840><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to my place and to my land.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3053"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1841><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;give my wives and my children, for whom I have served you.&#8221; In one sense Laban had already &#8220;given&#8221; Jacob his two daughters as wives (Gen 29:21, 28). Here Jacob was asking for permission to take his own family along with him on the journey back to Canaan.</p>
<A NAME="3054"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1842><b>tn</b> Following the imperative, the cohortative with the prefixed conjunction indicates purpose or result.</p>

E. A.

Laban apparently thought that by separating out the spotted, striped, and dark colored animals he could minimize the production of spotted, striped, or dark offspring that would then belong to Jacob.</p>
<A NAME="3083"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">83</span><note=1871><b>tn</b> The disjunctive clause (introduced by the <i>vav</i> with subject) is circumstantial/temporal; Laban removed the animals while Jacob was taking care of the rest.</p>
<A NAME="3084"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">84</span><note=1872><b>sn</b> <i>He put the branches in front of the flocks&#8230;when they came to drink</i>. It was generally believed that placing such &#8220;visual aids&#8221; before the animals as they were mating, it was possible to influence the appearance of their offspring. E. A. Speiser notes that &#8220;Jacob finds a way to outwit his father-in-law, through prenatal conditioning of the flock by visual aids &#8211; in conformance with universal folk beliefs&#8221; (<i>Genesis</i> [AB], 238).
