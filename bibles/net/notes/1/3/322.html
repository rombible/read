<A NAME="322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=161><b>tn</b> The expression is traditionally rendered &#8220;cool of the day,&#8221; because the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ruakh</font>) can mean &#8220;wind.&#8221; U. Cassuto (<i>Genesis: From Adam to Noah</i>, 152-54) concludes after lengthy discussion that the expression refers to afternoon when it became hot and the sun was beginning to decline. J. J. Niehaus (<i>God at Sinai</i> [SOTBT], 155-57) offers a different interpretation of the phrase, relating <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yom</font>, usually understood as &#8220;day&#8221;) to an Akkadian cognate <font face="Scholar">umu</font> (&#8220;storm&#8221;) and translates the phrase &#8220;in the wind of the storm.&#8221; If Niehaus is correct, then God is not pictured as taking an afternoon stroll through the orchard, but as coming in a powerful windstorm to confront the man and woman with their rebellion. In this case <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500; &#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qol yÿhvah</font>, &#8220;sound of the <sc>Lord&#8221;) may refer to God&#8217;s thunderous roar, which typically accompanies his appearance in the storm to do battle or render judgment (e.g., see Ps 29).</p>
