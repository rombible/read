<A NAME="349"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=188><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mashal</font>) means &#8220;to rule over,&#8221; but in a way that emphasizes powerful control, domination, or mastery. This also is part of the baser human nature. The translation assumes the imperfect verb form has an objective/indicative sense here. Another option is to understand it as having a modal, desiderative nuance, &#8220;but he will want to dominate you.&#8221; In this case, the <sc>Lord simply announces the struggle without indicating who will emerge victorious.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This passage is a judgment oracle. It announces that conflict between man and woman will become the norm in human society. It does not depict the NT ideal, where the husband sacrificially loves his wife, as Christ loved the church, and where the wife recognizes the husband&#8217;s loving </p><p class="footnote">leadership in the family and voluntarily submits to it. Sin produces a conflict or power struggle between the man and the woman, but in Christ man and woman call a truce and live harmoniously (Eph 5:18-32).</p>
