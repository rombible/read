<A NAME="345"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=184><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you will attack him [on] the heel.&#8221; The verb (translated &#8220;attack&#8221;) is repeated here, a fact that is obscured by some translations (e.g., NIV &#8220;crush&#8230;strike&#8221;). The singular pronoun agrees grammatically with the collective singular noun &#8220;offspring.&#8221; For other examples of singular verb and pronominal forms being used with the collective singular &#8220;offspring,&#8221; see Gen 16:10; 22:17; 24:60. The word &#8220;heel&#8221; is an adverbial accusative, locating the blow. A bite on the heel from a poisonous serpent is potentially fatal.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The etiological nature of v. 15 is apparent, though its relevance for modern western man is perhaps lost because we rarely come face to face with poisonous snakes. Ancient Israelites, who often encountered snakes in their daily activities (see, for example, Eccl 10:8; Amos 5:19), would find the statement quite meaningful as an explanation for the hostility between snakes and humans. (In the broader ancient Near Eastern context, compare the Mesopotamian serpent omens. See H. W. F. Saggs, <i>The Greatness That Was Babylon</i>, 309.) This ongoing struggle, when interpreted in light of v. 15, is a tangible reminder of the conflict introduced into the world by the first humans&#8217; rebellion against God. Many Christian theologians (going back to Irenaeus) understand v. 15 as the so-called <i>protevangelium</i>, supposedly prophesying Christ&#8217;s victory over Satan (see W. Witfall, &#8220;Genesis 3:15 &#8211; a Protevangelium?&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 36 [1974]: 361-65; and R. A. Martin, &#8220;The Earliest Messianic Interpretation of Genesis 3:15,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 84 [1965]: 425-27). In this allegorical approach, the woman&#8217;s offspring is initially Cain, then the whole human race, and ultimately Jesus Christ, the <i>offspring</i> (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;seed&#8221;) of the woman (see Gal 4:4). The <i>offspring</i> of the serpent includes the evil powers and demons of the spirit world, as well as those humans who are in the kingdom of darkness (see John 8:44). According to this view, the passage gives the first hint of the gospel. Satan delivers a crippling blow to the Seed of the woman (Jesus), who in turn delivers a fatal blow to the Serpent (first defeating him through the death and resurrection [1 Cor 15:55-57] and then destroying him in the judgment [Rev 12:7-9; 20:7-10]). However, the grammatical structure of Gen 3:15b does not suggest this view. The repetition of the verb &#8220;attack,&#8221; as well as the word order, suggests mutual hostility is being depicted, not the defeat of the serpent. If the serpent&#8217;s defeat were being portrayed, it is odd that the alleged description of his death comes first in the sentence. If he has already been crushed by the woman&#8217;s &#8220;Seed,&#8221; how can he bruise his heel? To sustain the allegorical view, v. 15b must be translated in one of the following ways: &#8220;he will crush your head, even though you attack his heel&#8221; (in which case the second clause is concessive) or &#8220;he will crush your head as you attack his heel&#8221; (the clauses, both of which place the subject before the verb, may indicate synchronic action).</p>
