<A NAME="371"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=210><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word is traditionally transliterated &#8220;the cherubim.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Angelic sentries</i> (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;cherubim&#8221;). The cherubim in the Bible seem to be a class of angels that are composite in appearance. Their main task seems to be guarding. Here they guard the way to the tree of life. The curtain in the tabernacle was to be embroidered with cherubim as well, symbolically guarding the way to God. (See in addition A. S. Kapelrud, &#8220;The Gates of Hell and the Guardian Angels of Paradise,&#8221; <i>JAOS</i> 70 [1950]: 151-56; and D. N. Freedman and M. P. O&#8217;Connor, <i>TDOT</i> 7:307-19.)</p>
