<A NAME="363"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=202><b>sn</b> <i>The </i><sc>Lord</><i> God made garments from skin</i>. The text gives no indication of how this was done, or how they came by the skins. Earlier in the narrative (v. 7) the attempt of the man and the woman to cover their nakedness with leaves expressed their sense of alienation from each other and from God. By giving them more substantial coverings, God indicates this alienation is greater than they realize. This divine action is also ominous; God is preparing them for the more hostile environment in which they will soon be living (v. 23). At the same time, there is a positive side to the story in that God makes provision for the man&#8217;s and woman&#8217;s condition.</p>
