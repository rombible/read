<A NAME="313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=152><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;like God, knowing.&#8221; It is unclear how the plural participle translated &#8220;knowing&#8221; is functioning. On the one hand, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1465;&#1491;&#1456;&#1506;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yodÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">e</font>) could be taken as a substantival participle functioning as a predicative adjective in the sentence. In this case one might translate: &#8220;You will be, like God himself, knowers of good and evil.&#8221; On the other hand, it could be taken as an attributive adjective modifying <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohim</font>). In this case <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> has to be taken as a numerical plural referring to &#8220;gods,&#8221; &#8220;divine beings,&#8221; for if the one true God were the intended referent, a singular form of the participle would almost certainly appear as a modifier. Following this line of interpretation, one could translate, &#8220;You will be like divine beings who know good and evil.&#8221; The following context may favor this translation, for in 3:22 God says to an unidentified group, &#8220;Look, the man has become like one of <i>us</i>, knowing good and evil.&#8221; It is probable that God is addressing his heavenly court (see the note on the word &#8220;make&#8221; in 1:26), the members of which can be called &#8220;gods&#8221; or &#8220;divine beings&#8221; from the ancient Israelite perspective. (We know some of these beings as messengers or &#8220;angels.&#8221;) An examination of parallel constructions shows that a predicative understanding (&#8220;you will be, like God himself, knowers of good and evil,&#8221; cf. NIV, NRSV) is possible, but rare (see Gen 27:23, where &#8220;hairy&#8221; is predicative, complementing the verb &#8220;to be&#8221;). The statistical evidence strongly suggests that the participle is attributive, modifying &#8220;divine beings&#8221; (see Ps 31:12; Isa 1:30; 13:14; 16:2; 29:5; 58:11; Jer 14:9; 20:9; 23:9; 31:12; 48:41; 49:22; Hos 7:11; Amos 4:11). In all of these texts, where a comparative clause and accompanying adjective/participle follow a copulative (&#8220;to be&#8221;) verb, the adjective/participle is attributive after the noun in the comparative clause.</p>
