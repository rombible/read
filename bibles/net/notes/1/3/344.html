<A NAME="344"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=183><b>sn</b> <i>You will attack her offspring&#8217;s heel</i>. Though the conflict will actually involve the serpent&#8217;s offspring (snakes) and the woman&#8217;s offspring (human beings), v. 15b for rhetorical effect depicts the conflict as being between the serpent and the woman&#8217;s offspring, as if the serpent will outlive the woman. The statement is personalized for the sake of the addressee (the serpent) and reflects the ancient Semitic concept of corporate solidarity, which emphasizes the close relationship between a progenitor and his offspring. Note Gen 28:14, where the <sc>Lord says to Jacob, &#8220;Your offspring will be like the dust of the earth, and you [second masculine singular] will spread out in all directions.&#8221; Jacob will &#8220;spread out&#8221; in all directions through his offspring, but the text states the matter as if this will happen to him personally.</p>
