<A NAME="320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=159><b>sn</b> This pericope (3:1-7) is a fine example of Hebrew narrative structure. After an introductory disjunctive clause that introduces a new character and sets the stage (3:1), the narrative tension develops through dialogue, culminating in the action of the story. Once the dialogue is over, the action is told in a rapid sequence of verbs &#8211; she took, she ate, she gave, and he ate.</p>
