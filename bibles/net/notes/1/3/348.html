<A NAME="348"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=187><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and toward your husband [will be] your desire.&#8221; The nominal sentence does not have a verb; a future verb must be supplied, because the focus of the oracle is on the future struggle. The precise meaning of the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tÿshuqah</font>, &#8220;desire&#8221;) is debated. Many interpreters conclude that it refers to sexual desire here, because the subject of the passage is the relationship between a wife and her husband, and because the word is used in a romantic sense in Song 7:11 HT (7:10 ET). However, this interpretation makes little sense in Gen 3:16. First, it does not fit well with the assertion &#8220;he will dominate you.&#8221; Second, it implies that sexual desire was not part of the original creation, even though the man and the woman were told to multiply. And third, it ignores the usage of the word in Gen 4:7 where it refers to sin&#8217;s desire to control and dominate Cain. (Even in Song of Songs it carries the basic idea of &#8220;control,&#8221; for it describes the young man&#8217;s desire to &#8220;have his way sexually&#8221; with the young woman.) In Gen 3:16 the <sc>Lord announces a struggle, a conflict between the man and the woman. She will desire to control him, but he will dominate her instead. This interpretation also fits the tone of the passage, which is a judgment oracle. See further Susan T. Foh, &#8220;What is the Woman&#8217;s Desire?&#8221; <i>WTJ</i> 37 (1975): 376-83.</p>
