<A NAME="336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=175><b>sn</b> Note that God asks no question of the serpent, does not call for confession, as he did to the man and the woman; there is only the announcement of the curse. The order in this section is chiastic: The man is questioned, the woman is questioned, the serpent is cursed, sentence is passed on the woman, sentence is passed on the man.</p>
