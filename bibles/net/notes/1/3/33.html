<A NAME="33"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=142><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arum</font>) basically means &#8220;clever.&#8221; This idea then polarizes into the nuances &#8220;cunning&#8221; (in a negative sense, see Job 5:12; 15:5), and &#8220;prudent&#8221; in a positive sense (Prov 12:16, 23; 13:16; 14:8, 15, 18; 22:3; 27:12). This same polarization of meaning can be detected in related words derived from the same root (see Exod 21:14; Josh 9:4; 1 Sam 23:22; Job 5:13; Ps 83:3). The negative nuance obviously applies in Gen 3, where the snake attempts to talk the woman into disobeying God by using half-truths and lies.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> There is a wordplay in Hebrew between the words &#8220;naked&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">arummim</font>) in 2:25 and &#8220;shrewd&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">arum</font>) in 3:1. The point seems to be that the integrity of the man and the woman is the focus of the serpent&#8217;s craftiness. At the beginning they are naked and he is shrewd; afterward, they will be covered and he will be cursed.</p>
