<A NAME="330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=169><b>sn</b> The Hebrew word order (&#8220;Did you from the tree &#8211; which I commanded you not to eat from it &#8211; eat?&#8221;) is arranged to emphasize that the man&#8217;s and the woman&#8217;s eating of the fruit was an act of disobedience. The relative clause inserted immediately after the reference to the tree brings out this point very well.</p>
