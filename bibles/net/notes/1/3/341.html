<A NAME="341"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=180><b>sn</b> The Hebrew word translated &#8220;offspring&#8221; is a collective singular. The text anticipates the ongoing struggle between human beings (the woman&#8217;s offspring) and deadly poisonous snakes (the serpent&#8217;s offspring). An ancient Jewish interpretation of the passage states: &#8220;He made the serpent, cause of the deceit, press the earth with belly and flank, having bitterly driven him out. He aroused a dire enmity between them. The one guards his head to save it, the other his heel, for death is at hand in the proximity of men and malignant poisonous snakes.&#8221; See <i>Sib. Or.</i> 1:59-64. For a similar interpretation see Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 1.1.4 (1.50-51).</p>
