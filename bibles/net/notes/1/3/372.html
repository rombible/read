<A NAME="372"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=211><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the flame of the sword that turns round and round.&#8221; The noun &#8220;flame&#8221; is qualified by the genitive of specification, &#8220;the sword,&#8221; which in turn is modified by the attributive participle &#8220;whirling.&#8221; The Hitpael of the verb &#8220;turn&#8221; has an iterative function here, indicating repeated action. The form is used in Job 37:12 of swirling clouds and in Judg 7:13 of a tumbling roll of bread. Verse 24 depicts the sword as moving from side to side to prevent anyone from passing or as whirling around, ready to cut to shreds anyone who tries to pass.</p>
