<A NAME="36"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=145><b>sn</b> <i>God</i>. The serpent does not use the expression &#8220;Yahweh God&#8221; [<sc>Lord God] because there is no covenant relationship involved between God and the serpent. He only speaks of &#8220;God.&#8221; In the process the serpent draws the woman into his manner of speech so that she too only speaks of &#8220;God.&#8221;</p>
