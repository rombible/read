<A NAME="354"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=193><b>sn</b> <i>In painful toil you will eat</i>. The theme of eating is prominent throughout Gen 3. The prohibition was against eating from the tree of knowledge. The sin was in eating. The interrogation concerned the eating from the tree of knowledge. The serpent is condemned to eat the dust of the ground. The curse focuses on eating in a &#8220;measure for measure&#8221; justice. Because the man and the woman sinned by eating the forbidden fruit, God will forbid the ground to cooperate, and so it will be through painful toil that they will eat.</p>
