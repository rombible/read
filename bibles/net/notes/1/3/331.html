<A NAME="331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=170><b>tn</b> The Hebrew construction in this sentence uses an independent nominative absolute (formerly known as a <i>casus pendens</i>). &#8220;The woman&#8221; is the independent nominative absolute; it is picked up by the formal subject, the pronoun &#8220;she&#8221; written with the verb (&#8220;she gave&#8221;). The point of the construction is to throw the emphasis on &#8220;the woman.&#8221; But what makes this so striking is that a relative clause has been inserted to explain what is meant by the reference to the woman: &#8220;whom you gave me.&#8221; Ultimately, the man is blaming God for giving him the woman who (from the man&#8217;s viewpoint) caused him to sin.</p>
