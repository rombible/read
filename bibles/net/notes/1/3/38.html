<A NAME="38"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=147><b>tn</b> There is a notable change between what the <sc>Lord God had said and what the woman says. God said &#8220;you may freely eat&#8221; (the imperfect with the infinitive absolute, see 2:16), but the woman omits the emphatic infinitive, saying simply &#8220;we may eat.&#8221; Her words do not reflect the sense of eating to her heart&#8217;s content.</p>
