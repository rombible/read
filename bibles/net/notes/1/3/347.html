<A NAME="347"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=186><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your pain and your conception,&#8221; suggesting to some interpreters that having a lot of children was a result of the judgment (probably to make up for the loss through death). But the next clause shows that the pain is associated with conception and childbirth. The two words form a hendiadys (where two words are joined to express one idea, like &#8220;good and angry&#8221; in English), the second explaining the first. &#8220;Conception,&#8221; if the correct meaning of the noun, must be figurative here since there is no pain in conception; it is a synecdoche, representing the entire process of childbirth and child rearing from the very start. However, recent etymological research suggests the noun is derived from a root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1512;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hrr</font>), not <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1512;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hrh</font>), and means &#8220;trembling, pain&#8221; (see D. Tsumura, &#8220;A Note on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (Gen 3,16),&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 75 [1994]: 398-400). In this case &#8220;pain and trembling&#8221; refers to the physical effects of childbirth. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">itsÿvon</font>, &#8220;pain&#8221;), an abstract noun related to the verb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1489;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">atsav</font>), includes more than physical pain. It is emotional distress as well as physical pain. The same word is used in v. 17 for the man&#8217;s painful toil in the field.</p>
