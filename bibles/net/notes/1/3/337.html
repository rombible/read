<A NAME="337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=176><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word translated &#8220;cursed,&#8221; a passive participle from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arar</font>), either means &#8220;punished&#8221; or &#8220;banished,&#8221; depending on how one interprets the following preposition. If the preposition is taken as comparative, then the idea is &#8220;cursed [i.e., punished] are you above [i.e., more than] all the wild beasts.&#8221; In this case the comparative preposition reflects the earlier comparison: The serpent was more shrewd than all others, and so more cursed than all others. If the preposition is taken as separative (see the note on the word &#8220;ground&#8221; in 4:11), then the idea is &#8220;cursed and banished from all the wild beasts.&#8221; In this case the serpent is condemned to isolation from all the other animals.</p>
