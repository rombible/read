<A NAME="201"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1123><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the South [country]&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the land of the Negev.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Negev</i> is the name for the southern desert region in the land of Canaan.</p>
<A NAME="202"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1124><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he sojourned.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="203"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1125><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;came.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="204"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1126><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Look, you [are] dead.&#8221; The Hebrew construction uses the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>) with a second person pronominal particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>) with by the participle. It is a highly rhetorical expression.</p>
<A NAME="205"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1127><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and she is owned by an owner.&#8221; The disjunctive clause is causal or explanatory in this case.</p>
<A NAME="206"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1128><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term translated &#8220;Lord&#8221; here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adonay</font>).</p>
<A NAME="207"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1129><b>tn</b> Apparently Abimelech assumes that God&#8217;s judgment will fall on his entire nation. Some, finding the reference to a nation problematic, prefer to emend the text and read, &#8220;Would you really kill someone who is innocent?&#8221; See E. A. Speiser, <i>Genesis</i> (AB), 149.</p>
<A NAME="208"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1130><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="209"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1131><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and she, even she.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1132><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;with the integrity of my heart.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2011"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1133><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;with the integrity of your heart.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2012"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1134><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and I, even I, kept you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2013"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1135><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;therefore.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2014"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1136><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;for,&#8221; if the particle is understood as causal (as many English translations do) rather than asseverative.</p>
<A NAME="2015"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1137><b>sn</b> For a discussion of the term <i>prophet</i> see N. Walker, &#8220;What is a Nabhi?&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 73 (1961): 99-100.</p>
<A NAME="2016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1138><b>tn</b> After the preceding jussive (or imperfect), the imperative with <i>vav </i>conjunctive here indicates result.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>He will pray for you that you may live</i>. Abraham was known as a man of God whose prayer would be effectual. Ironically and sadly, he was also known as a liar.</p>
<A NAME="2017"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1139><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;if there is not you returning.&#8221; The suffix on the particle becomes the subject of the negated clause.</p>
<A NAME="2018"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1140><b>tn</b> The imperfect is preceded by the infinitive absolute to make the warning emphatic.</p>
<A NAME="2019"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1141><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And Abimelech rose early in the morning and he summoned.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2020"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1142><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qara</font>&#8217;)<i> </i>followed by the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lamed</font>) means &#8220;to summon.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1143><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And he spoke all these things in their ears.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2022"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1144><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the men.&#8221; This has been replaced by the pronoun &#8220;they&#8221; in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="2023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1145><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;How did I sin against you that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin?&#8221; The expression &#8220;great sin&#8221; refers to adultery. For discussion of the cultural background of the passage, see J. J. Rabinowitz, &#8220;The Great Sin in Ancient Egyptian Marriage Contracts,&#8221; <i>JNES</i> 18 (1959): 73, and W. L. Moran, &#8220;The Scandal of the &#8216;Great Sin&#8217; at Ugarit,&#8221; <i>JNES</i> 18 (1959): 280-81.</p>
<A NAME="2024"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1146><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Deeds which should not be done you have done to me.&#8221; The imperfect has an obligatory nuance here.</p>
<A NAME="2025"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1147><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And Abimelech said to.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2026"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1148><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;What did you see that you did this thing?&#8221; The question implies that Abraham had some motive for deceiving Abimelech.</p>
<A NAME="2027"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1149><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Because I said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2028"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1150><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;over the matter of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2029"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1151><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;but also.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2030"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1152><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb is plural. This may be a case of grammatical agreement with the name for God, which is plural in form. However, when this plural name refers to the one true God, accompanying predicates are usually singular in form. Perhaps Abraham is accommodating his speech to Abimelech&#8217;s polytheistic perspective. (See GKC 463 §145.<i>i</i>.) If so, one should translate, &#8220;when the gods made me wander.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2031"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1153><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;This is your loyal deed which you can do for me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2032"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1154><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;took and gave.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2033"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1155><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;In the [place that is] good in your eyes live!&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2034"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1156><b>sn</b> <i>A thousand pieces </i>[<i>Heb</i> &#8220;shekels&#8221;]<i> of silver</i>. The standards for weighing money varied considerably in the ancient Near East, but the generally accepted weight for the shekel is 11.5 grams (0.4 ounce). This makes the weight of silver here 11.5 kilograms, or 400 ounces (about 25 pounds).</p>
<A NAME="2035"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1157><b>sn</b> <i>To your &#8216;brother.&#8217;</i> Note the way that the king refers to Abraham. Was he being sarcastic? It was surely a rebuke to Sarah. What is amazing is how patient this king was. It is proof that the fear of God was in that place, contrary to what Abraham believed (see v. 11).</p>
<A NAME="2036"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1158><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Look, it is for you a covering of the eyes, for all who are with you, and with all, and you are set right.&#8221; The exact meaning of the statement is unclear. Apparently it means that the gift of money somehow exonerates her in other people&#8217;s eyes. They will not look on her as compromised (see G. J. Wenham, <i>Genesis </i>[WBC]<i>,</i> 2:74).</p>
<A NAME="2037"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1159><b>tn</b> In the Hebrew text the clause begins with &#8220;because.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2038"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1160><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> had completely closed up every womb.&#8221; In the Hebrew text infinitive absolute precedes the finite verb for emphasis.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The </i><sc>Lord</><i> had closed up every womb</i>. This fact indicates that Sarah was in Abimelech&#8217;s household for weeks or months before the dream revelation was given (20:6-7). No one in his household could have children after Sarah arrived on the scene.</p>
<A NAME="2039"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1161><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;because of.&#8221; The words &#8220;he took&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
