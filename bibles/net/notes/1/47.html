<A NAME="471"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2846><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Look they [are] in the land of Goshen.&#8221; Joseph draws attention to the fact of their presence in Goshen.</p>
<A NAME="472"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2847><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and from the whole of his brothers he took five men and presented them before Pharaoh.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="473"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2848><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his&#8221;; the referent (Joseph) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="474"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2849><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;both we and our fathers.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="475"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2850><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to sojourn.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="476"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2851><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for there.&#8221; The Hebrew uses a causal particle to connect what follows with what precedes. The translation divides the statement into two sentences for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="477"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2852><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;men of skill.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="478"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2853><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;make them rulers.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Put them in charge of my livestock</i>. Pharaoh is, in effect, offering Joseph&#8217;s brothers jobs as royal keepers of livestock, a position mentioned often in Egyptian inscriptions, because the Pharaohs owned huge herds of cattle.</p>
<A NAME="479"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2854><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;caused him to stand.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2855><b>sn</b> The precise meaning of the Hebrew verb translated &#8220;blessed&#8221; is difficult in this passage, because the content of Jacob&#8217;s blessing is not given. The expression could simply mean that he greeted Pharaoh, but that seems insufficient in this setting. Jacob probably praised Pharaoh, for the verb is used this way for praising God. It is also possible that he pronounced a formal prayer of blessing, asking God to reward Pharaoh for his kindness. </p>
<A NAME="4711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2856><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;How many are the days of the years of your life?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2857><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the days of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2858><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sojournings.&#8221; Jacob uses a term that depicts him as one who has lived an unsettled life, temporarily residing in many different places.</p>
<A NAME="4714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2859><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the days of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2860><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;) can sometimes mean &#8220;evil,&#8221; but that would give the wrong connotation here, where it refers to pain, difficulty, and sorrow. Jacob is thinking back through all the troubles he had to endure to get to this point.</p>
<A NAME="4716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2861><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they have not reached the days of the years of my fathers in the days of their sojournings.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2862><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from before Pharaoh.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2863><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a possession,&#8221; or &#8220;a holding.&#8221; Joseph gave them a plot of land with rights of ownership in the land of Goshen.</p>
<A NAME="4719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2864><b>sn</b> The <i>land of Rameses</i> is another designation for the region of Goshen. It is named Rameses because of a city in that region (Exod 1:11; 12:37). The use of this name may represent a modernization of the text for the understanding of the intended readers, substituting a later name for an earlier one. Alternatively, there may have been an earlier Rameses for which the region was named.</p>
<A NAME="4720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2865><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1463;&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lahah</font>, = <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">la</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>) means &#8220;to faint, to languish&#8221;; it figuratively describes the land as wasting away, drooping, being worn out.</p>
<A NAME="4721"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2866><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;in exchange.&#8221; On the use of the preposition here see BDB 90 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font>.</p>
<A NAME="4722"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2867><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;house.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2868><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all Egypt.&#8221; The expression is a metonymy and refers to all the people of Egypt.</p>
<A NAME="4724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2869><b>tn</b> The imperfect verbal form has a deliberative force here.</p>
<A NAME="4725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2870><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;food&#8221; has been supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="4726"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2871><b>tn</b> On the use of the preposition here see BDB 90 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font>.</p>
<A NAME="4727"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2872><b>tn</b> The definite article is translated here as a possessive pronoun.</p>
<A NAME="4728"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2873><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my.&#8221; The expression &#8220;my lord&#8221; occurs twice more in this verse.</p>
<A NAME="4729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2874><b>tn</b> After the imperative, the prefixed verbal form with <i>vav</i> here indicates consequence.</p>
<A NAME="4730"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2875><b>sn</b> <i>Pharaoh&#8217;s slaves</i>. The idea of slavery is not attractive to the modern mind, but in the ancient world it was the primary way of dealing with the poor and destitute. If the people became slaves of Pharaoh, it was Pharaoh&#8217;s responsibility to feed them and care for them. It was the best way for them to survive the famine.</p>
<A NAME="4731"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2876><b>tn</b> After the imperative, the prefixed verbal form with <i>vav</i> here indicates purpose or result.</p>
<A NAME="4732"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2877><b>tn</b> The disjunctive clause structure (<i>vav</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>] + subject + negated verb) highlights the statement and brings their argument to a conclusion.</p>
<A NAME="4733"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2878><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text connects this clause with the preceding one with a causal particle (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ki</font>). The translation divides the clauses into two sentences for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="4734"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2879><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text adds &#8220;upon them.&#8221; This has not been included in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="4735"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2880><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he&#8221;; the referent (Joseph) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="4736"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2881><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;and the people he removed to the cities,&#8221; which does not make a lot of sense in this context. The Samaritan Pentateuch and the LXX read &#8220;he enslaved them as slaves.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4737"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2882><b>tn</b> The perfect verbal form with the <i>vav</i> consecutive is equivalent to a command here.</p>
<A NAME="4738"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2883><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;the crop&#8221; have been supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="4739"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2884><b>tn</b> The perfect form with the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive is equivalent to an imperfect of instruction here.</p>
<A NAME="4740"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=2885><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;four parts.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4741"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=2886><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;we find favor in the eyes of my lord.&#8221; Some interpret this as a request, &#8220;may we find favor in the eyes of my lord.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="4742"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=2887><b>sn</b> <i>Slaves</i>. See the note on this word in v. 21.</p>
<A NAME="4743"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2888><b>tn</b> On the term translated &#8220;statute&#8221; see P. Victor, &#8220;A Note on <i>Hoq</i> in the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 16 (1966): 358-61.</p>
<A NAME="4744"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=2889><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;which is in effect&#8221; have been supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="4745"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=2890><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the days of the years.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4746"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=2891><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;days.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4747"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=2892><b>sn</b> On the expression <i>put your hand under my thigh</i> see Gen 24:2.</p>
<A NAME="4748"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=2893><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;deal with me in faithful love.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4749"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=2894><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lie down.&#8221; Here the expression &#8220;lie down&#8221; refers to death.</p>
<A NAME="4750"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=2895><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Joseph) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="4751"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=2896><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Jacob) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="4752"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=2897><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;swear on oath to me.&#8221; The words &#8220;that you will do so&#8221; have been supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="4753"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=2898><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Joseph) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="4754"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=2899><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;swore on oath to him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4755"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=2900><b>sn</b> The Hebrew verb normally means &#8220;bow down,&#8221; especially in worship or prayer. Here it might simply mean &#8220;bend low,&#8221; perhaps from weakness or approaching death. The narrative is ambiguous at this point and remains open to all these interpretations.</p>
<A NAME="4756"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=2901><b>tc</b> The MT reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1496;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mittah</font>, &#8220;bed, couch&#8221;). The LXX reads the word as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1496;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">matteh</font>, &#8220;staff, rod&#8221;) and interprets this to mean that Jacob bowed down in worship while leaning on the top of his staff. The LXX reading was used in turn by the writer of the Letter to the Hebrews (Heb 11:21).</p>
