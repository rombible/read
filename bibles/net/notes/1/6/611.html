<A NAME="611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=301><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his days will be 120 years.&#8221; Some interpret this to mean that the age expectancy of people from this point on would be 120, but neither the subsequent narrative nor reality favors this. It is more likely that this refers to the time remaining between this announcement of judgment and the coming of the flood.</p>
