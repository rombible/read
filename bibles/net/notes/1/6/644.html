<A NAME="644"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=334><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the end of all flesh is coming [or &#8220;has come&#8221;] before me.&#8221; (The verb form is either a perfect or a participle.) The phrase &#8220;end of all flesh&#8221; occurs only here. The term &#8220;end&#8221; refers here to the end of &#8220;life,&#8221; as v. 3 and the following context (which describes how God destroys all flesh) make clear. The statement &#8220;the end has come&#8221; occurs in Ezek 7:2, 6, where it is used of divine judgment. The phrase &#8220;come before&#8221; occurs in Exod 28:30, 35; 34:34; Lev 15:14; Num 27:17; 1 Sam 18:13, 16; 2 Sam 19:8; 20:8; 1 Kgs 1:23, 28, 32; Ezek 46:9; Pss 79:11 (groans come before God); 88:3 (a prayer comes before God); 100:2; 119:170 (prayer comes before God); Lam 1:22 (evil doing comes before God); Esth 1:19; 8:1; 9:25; 1 Chr 16:29. The expression often means &#8220;have an audience with&#8221; or &#8220;appear before.&#8221; But when used metaphorically, it can mean &#8220;get the attention of&#8221; or &#8220;prompt a response.&#8221; This is probably the sense in Gen 6:13. The necessity of ending the life of all flesh on earth is an issue that has gotten the attention of God. The term &#8220;end&#8221; may even be a metonymy for that which has prompted it &#8211; violence (see the following clause). </p>
