<A NAME="632"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=322><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Noah was a godly man, blameless in his generations.&#8221; The singular &#8220;generation&#8221; can refer to one&#8217;s contemporaries, i.e., those living at a particular point in time. The plural &#8220;generations&#8221; can refer to successive generations in the past or the future. Here, where it is qualified by &#8220;his&#8221; (i.e., Noah&#8217;s), it refers to Noah&#8217;s contemporaries, comprised of the preceding generation (his father&#8217;s generation), those of Noah&#8217;s generation, and the next generation (those the same age as his children). In other words, &#8220;his generations&#8221; means the generations contemporary with him. See BDB 190 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font>.</p>
