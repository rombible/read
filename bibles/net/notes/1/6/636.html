<A NAME="636"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=326><b>tn</b> Apart from Gen 6:11-12, the Niphal form of this verb occurs in Exod 8:20 HT (8:24 ET), where it describes the effect of the swarms of flies on the land of Egypt; Jer 13:7 and 18:4, where it is used of a &#8220;ruined&#8221; belt and &#8220;marred&#8221; clay pot, respectively; and Ezek 20:44, where it describes Judah&#8217;s morally &#8220;corrupt&#8221; actions. The sense &#8220;morally corrupt&#8221; fits well in Gen 6:11 because of the parallelism (note &#8220;the earth was filled with violence&#8221;). In this case &#8220;earth&#8221; would stand by metonymy for its sinful inhabitants. However, the translation &#8220;ruined&#8221; works just as well, if not better. In this case humankind&#8217;s sin is viewed has having an adverse effect upon the earth. Note that vv. 12b-13 make a distinction between the earth and the living creatures who live on it.</p>
