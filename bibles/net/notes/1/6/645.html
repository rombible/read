<A NAME="645"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=335><b>tn</b> The participle, especially after <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>) has an imminent future nuance. The Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shakhat</font>) here has the sense &#8220;to destroy&#8221; (in judgment). Note the wordplay involving this verb in vv. 11-13: The earth is &#8220;ruined&#8221; because all flesh has acted in a morally &#8220;corrupt&#8221; manner. Consequently, God will &#8220;destroy&#8221; all flesh (the referent of the suffix &#8220;them&#8221;) along with the ruined earth. They had ruined themselves and the earth with violence, and now God would ruin them with judgment. For other cases where &#8220;earth&#8221; occurs as the object of the Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1514;</font>, see 1 Sam 6:5; 1 Chr 20:1; Jer 36:29; 51:25.</p>
