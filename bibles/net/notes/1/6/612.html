<A NAME="612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=302><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1508;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nÿfilim</font>) is simply transliterated here, because the meaning of the term is uncertain. According to the text, the Nephilim became mighty warriors and gained great fame in the antediluvian world. The text may imply they were the offspring of the sexual union of the &#8220;sons of God&#8221; and the &#8220;daughters of humankind&#8221; (v. 2), but it stops short of saying this in a direct manner. The Nephilim are mentioned in the OT only here and in Num 13:33, where it is stated that they were giants (thus KJV, TEV, NLT &#8220;giants&#8221; here). The narrator observes that the Anakites of Canaan were descendants of the Nephilim. Certainly these later Anakite Nephilim could not be descendants of the antediluvian Nephilim (see also the following note on the word &#8220;this&#8221;).</p>
