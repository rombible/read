<A NAME="625"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=315><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and he was grieved to his heart.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">atsav</font>) can carry one of three semantic senses, depending on the context: (1) &#8220;to be injured&#8221; (Ps 56:5; Eccl 10:9; 1 Chr 4:10); (2) &#8220;to experience emotional pain&#8221;; &#8220;to be depressed emotionally&#8221;; &#8220;to be worried&#8221; (2 Sam 19:2; Isa 54:6; Neh 8:10-11); (3) &#8220;to be embarrassed&#8221;; &#8220;to be offended&#8221; (to the point of anger at another or oneself); &#8220;to be insulted&#8221; (Gen 34:7; 45:5; 1 Sam 20:3, 34; 1 Kgs 1:6; Isa 63:10; Ps 78:40). This third category develops from the second by metonymy. In certain contexts emotional pain leads to embarrassment and/or anger. In this last use the subject sometimes directs his anger against the source of grief (see especially Gen 34:7). The third category fits best in Gen 6:6 because humankind&#8217;s sin does not merely wound God emotionally. On the contrary, it prompts him to strike out in judgment against the source of his distress (see v. 7). The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1461;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyit</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">atsev</font>), a Hitpael from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1489;</font>, alludes to the judgment oracles in Gen 3:16-19. Because Adam and Eve sinned, their life would be filled with pain; but sin in the human race also brought pain to God. The wording of v. 6 is ironic when compared to Gen 5:29. Lamech anticipated relief (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nakham</font>) from their work (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ma</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aseh</font>) and their painful toil (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1465;&#1503;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">itsÿvon</font>), but now we read that God was sorry (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nakham</font>) that he had made (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">asah</font>) humankind for it brought him great pain (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1489;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">atsav</font>).</p>
