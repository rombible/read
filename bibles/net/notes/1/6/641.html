<A NAME="641"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=331><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;flesh.&#8221; Since moral corruption is in view here, most modern western interpreters understand the referent to be humankind. However, the phrase &#8220;all flesh&#8221; is used consistently of humankind and the animals in Gen 6-9 (6:17, 19; 7:15-16, 21; 8:17; 9:11, 15-17), suggesting that the author intends to picture all living creatures, humankind and animals, as guilty of moral failure. This would explain why the animals, not just humankind, are victims of the ensuing divine judgment. The OT sometimes views animals as morally culpable (Gen 9:5; Exod 21:28-29; Jonah 3:7-8). The OT also teaches that a person&#8217;s sin can contaminate others (people and animals) in the sinful person&#8217;s sphere (see the story of Achan, especially Josh 7:10). So the animals could be viewed here as morally contaminated because of their association with sinful humankind.</p>
