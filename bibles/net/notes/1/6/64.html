<A NAME="64"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=294><b>sn</b> The Hebrew phrase translated &#8220;sons of God&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bÿne-ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohim</font>) occurs only here (Gen 6:2, 4) and in Job 1:6; 2:1; 38:7. There are three major interpretations of the phrase here. (1) In the Book of Job the phrase clearly refers to angelic beings. In Gen 6 the &#8220;sons of God&#8221; are distinct from &#8220;humankind,&#8221; suggesting they were not human. This is consistent with the use of the phrase in Job. Since the passage speaks of these beings cohabiting with women, they must have taken physical form or possessed the bodies of men. An early Jewish tradition preserved in <i>1 En.</i> 6-7 elaborates on this angelic revolt and even names the ringleaders. (2) Not all scholars accept the angelic interpretation of the &#8220;sons of God,&#8221; however. Some argue that the &#8220;sons of God&#8221; were members of Seth&#8217;s line, traced back to God through Adam in Gen 5, while the &#8220;daughters of humankind&#8221; were descendants of Cain. But, as noted above, the text distinguishes the &#8220;sons of God&#8221; from humankind (which would include the Sethites as well as the Cainites) and suggests that the &#8220;daughters of humankind&#8221; are human women in general, not just Cainites. (3) Others identify the &#8220;sons of God&#8221; as powerful tyrants, perhaps demon-possessed, who viewed themselves as divine and, following the example of Lamech (see Gen 4:19), practiced polygamy. But usage of the phrase &#8220;sons of God&#8221; in Job militates against this view. For literature on the subject see G. J. Wenham, <i>Genesis</i> (WBC), 1:135.</p>
