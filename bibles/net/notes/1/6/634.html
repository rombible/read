<A NAME="634"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=324><b>tn</b> The construction translated &#8220;walked with&#8221; is used in Gen 5:22, 24 (see the note on this phrase in 5:22) and in 1 Sam 25:15, where it refers to David&#8217;s and Nabal&#8217;s men &#8220;rubbing shoulders&#8221; in the fields. Based on the use in 1 Sam 25:15, the expression seems to mean &#8220;live in close proximity to,&#8221; which may, by metonymy, mean &#8220;maintain cordial relations with.&#8221;</p>
