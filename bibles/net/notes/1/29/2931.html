<A NAME="2931"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1745><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the eyes of Leah were tender.&#8221; The disjunctive clause (introduced here by a conjunction and a noun) continues the parenthesis begun in v. 16. It is not clear what is meant by &#8220;tender&#8221; (or &#8220;delicate&#8221;) eyes. The expression may mean she had appealing eyes (cf. NAB, NRSV, NLT), though some suggest that they were plain, not having the brightness normally expected. Either way, she did not measure up to her gorgeous sister.</p>
