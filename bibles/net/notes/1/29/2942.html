<A NAME="2942"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1756><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and it happened in the evening that he took Leah his daughter and brought her.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>His daughter Leah</i>. Laban&#8217;s deception of Jacob by giving him the older daughter instead of the younger was God&#8217;s way of disciplining the deceiver who tricked his older brother. D. Kidner says this account is &#8220;the very embodiment of anti-climax, and this moment a miniature of man&#8217;s disillusion, experienced from Eden onwards&#8221; (<i>Genesis</i> [TOTC]<i>,</i> 160). G. von Rad notes, &#8220;That Laban secretly gave the unloved Leah to the man in love was, to be sure, a monstrous blow, a masterpiece of shameless treachery&#8230;It was certainly a move by which he won for himself far and wide the coarsest laughter&#8221; (<i>Genesis</i> [OTL], 291). </p>
