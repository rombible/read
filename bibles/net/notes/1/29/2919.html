<A NAME="2919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1733><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Laban, the brother of his mother.&#8221; The text says nothing initially about the beauty of Rachel. But the reader is struck by the repetition of &#8220;Laban the brother of his mother.&#8221; G. J. Wenham is no doubt correct when he observes that Jacob&#8217;s primary motive at this stage is to ingratiate himself with Laban (<i>Genesis </i>[WBC], 2:231).</p>
