<A NAME="1626"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=857><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the messenger of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; Some identify the angel of the <sc>Lord as the preincarnate Christ because in some texts the angel is identified with the <sc>Lord himself. However, it is more likely that the angel merely represents the <sc>Lord; he can speak for the <sc>Lord because he is sent with the <sc>Lord&#8217;s full authority. In some cases the angel is clearly distinct from the <sc>Lord (see Judg 6:11-23). It is not certain if the same angel is always in view. Though the proper name following the noun &#8220;angel&#8221; makes the construction definite, this may simply indicate that a definite angel sent from the <sc>Lord is referred to in any given context. It need not be the same angel on every occasion. Note the analogous expression &#8220;the servant of the <sc>Lord,&#8221; which refers to various individuals in the OT (see BDB 714 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1491;</font>).</p>
