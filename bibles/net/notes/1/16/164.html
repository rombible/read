<A NAME="164"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=835><b>sn</b> The passage records the birth of Ishmael to Abram through an Egyptian woman. The story illustrates the limits of Abram&#8217;s faith as he tries to obtain a son through social custom. The barrenness of Sarai poses a challenge to Abram&#8217;s faith, just as the famine did in chap. 12. As in chap. 12, an Egyptian figures prominently. (Perhaps Hagar was obtained as a slave during Abram&#8217;s stay in Egypt.)</p>
