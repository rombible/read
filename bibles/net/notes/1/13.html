<A NAME="132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=679><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all which was his, and Lot with him, to the Negev.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=680><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;heavy.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=681><b>tn</b> This parenthetical clause, introduced by the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) disjunctive (translated &#8220;now&#8221;), provides information necessary to the point of the story.</p>
<A NAME="135"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=682><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;on his journeys&#8221;; the verb and noun combination means to pick up the tents and move from camp to camp.</p>
<A NAME="136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=683><b>map</b> For location see Map4-G4; Map5-C1; Map6-E3; Map7-D1; Map8-G3.</p>
<A NAME="137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=684><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;he returned&#8221; are supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=685><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;where his tent had been.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="139"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=686><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to the place of the altar which he had made there in the beginning&#8221; (cf. Gen 12:7-8).</p>
<A NAME="1310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=687><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he called in the name of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The expression refers to worshiping the Lord through prayer and sacrifice (see Gen 4:26; 12:8; 21:33; 26:25). See G. J. Wenham, <i>Genesis </i>(WBC), 1:116, 281.</p>
<A NAME="1311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=688><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;was going.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=689><b>tn</b> The Hebrew idiom is &#8220;to Lot&#8230;there was,&#8221; the preposition here expressing possession.</p>
<A NAME="1313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=690><b>tn</b> The potential nuance for the perfect tense is necessary here, and supported by the parallel clause that actually uses &#8220;to be able.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=691><b>tn</b> The infinitive construct <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lashevet</font>, from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1489;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yashav</font>) explains what it was that the land could not support: &#8220;the land could not support them to live side by side.&#8221; See further J. C. de Moor, &#8220;Lexical Remarks Concerning Yahad and Yahdaw,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 7 (1957): 350-55.</p>
<A NAME="1315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=692><b>tn</b> The same infinitive occurs here, serving as the object of the verb.</p>
<A NAME="1316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=693><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">riv</font>) means &#8220;strife, conflict, quarreling.&#8221; In later texts it has the meaning of &#8220;legal controversy, dispute.&#8221; See B. Gemser, &#8220;The <font face="Scholar">rîb</font> &#8211; or Controversy &#8211; Pattern in Hebrew Mentality,&#8221; <i>Wisdom in Israel and in the Ancient Near East</i> [VTSup], 120-37.</p>
<A NAME="1317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=694><b>sn</b> Since the quarreling was between the herdsmen, the dispute was no doubt over water and vegetation for the animals.</p>
<A NAME="1318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=695><b>tn</b> This parenthetical clause, introduced with the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) disjunctive (translated &#8220;now&#8221;), again provides critical information. It tells in part why the land cannot sustain these two bedouins, and it also hints of the danger of weakening the family by inner strife.</p>
<A NAME="1319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=696><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;men, brothers [are] we.&#8221; Here &#8220;brothers&#8221; describes the closeness of the relationship, but could be misunderstood if taken literally, since Abram was Lot&#8217;s uncle.</p>
<A NAME="1320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=697><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;you go&#8221; have been supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons both times in this verse.</p>
<A NAME="1321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=698><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lifted up his eyes and saw.&#8221; The expression draws attention to the act of looking, indicating that Lot took a good look. It also calls attention to the importance of what was seen.</p>
<A NAME="1322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=699><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;plain&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;circle.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=700><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;he noticed&#8221; are supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="1324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=701><b>sn</b> <i>Obliterated</i>. The use of the term &#8220;destroy&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1495;&#1461;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shakhet</font>) is reminiscent of the Noahic flood (Gen 6:13). Both at the flood and in Sodom the place was obliterated by catastrophe and only one family survived (see C. Westermann, <i>Genesis</i>, 2:178).</p>
<A NAME="1325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=702><b>tn</b> This short temporal clause (preposition + Piel infinitive construct + subjective genitive + direct object) is strategically placed in the middle of the lavish descriptions to sound an ominous note. The entire clause is parenthetical in nature. Most English translations place the clause at the end of v. 10 for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="1326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=703><b>sn</b> The narrative places emphasis on what Lot saw so that the reader can appreciate how it aroused his desire for the best land. It makes allusion to <i>the garden of the </i><sc>Lord and to <i>the land of Egypt</i> for comparison. Just as the tree in the garden of Eden had awakened Eve&#8217;s desire, so the fertile valley attracted Lot. And just as certain memories of Egypt would cause the Israelites to want to turn back and abandon the trek to the promised land, so Lot headed for the good life.</p>
<A NAME="1327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=704><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Lot traveled.&#8221; The proper name has not been repeated in the translation at this point for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="1328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=705><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a man from upon his brother.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Separated from each other</i>. For a discussion of the significance of this event, see L. R. Helyer, &#8220;The Separation of Abram and Lot: Its Significance in the Patriarchal Narratives,&#8221; <i>JSOT </i>26 (1983): 77-88.</p>
<A NAME="1329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=706><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the cities of the plain&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[the cities of] the circle,&#8221; referring to the &#8220;circle&#8221; or oval area of the Jordan Valley.</p>
<A NAME="1330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=707><b>tn</b> Here is another significant parenthetical clause in the story, signaled by the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1493;</font>) disjunctive (translated &#8220;now&#8221;) on the noun at the beginning of the clause.</p>
<A NAME="1331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=708><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;men.&#8221; However, this is generic in sense; it is unlikely that only the male residents of Sodom were sinners.</p>
<A NAME="1332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=709><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;wicked and sinners against the <sc>Lord exceedingly.&#8221; The description of the sinfulness of the Sodomites is very emphatic. First, two nouns are used to form a hendiadys: &#8220;wicked and sinners&#8221; means &#8220;wicked sinners,&#8221; the first word becoming adjectival. The text is saying these were no ordinary sinners; they were wicked sinners, the type that cause pain for others. Then to this phrase is added &#8220;against the <sc>Lord,&#8221; stressing their violation of the laws of heaven and their culpability. Finally, to this is added <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1488;&#1465;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">od</font>, &#8220;exceedingly,&#8221; translated here as &#8220;extremely&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=710><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the <sc>Lord said to Abram after Lot separated himself from with him.&#8221; The disjunctive clause at the beginning of the verse signals a new scene.</p>
<A NAME="1334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=711><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lift up your eyes and see.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Look</i>. Earlier Lot &#8220;looked up&#8221; (v. 10), but here Abram is told by God to do so. The repetition of the expression (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;lift up the eyes&#8221;) here underscores how the <sc>Lord will have the last word and actually do for Abram what Abram did for Lot &#8211; give him the land. It seems to be one of the ways that God rewards faith.</p>
<A NAME="1335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=712><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for all the land which you see to you I will give it and to your descendants.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=713><b>tn</b> The translation &#8220;can be counted&#8221; (potential imperfect) is suggested by the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yukhal</font>, &#8220;is able&#8221;) in the preceding clause.</p>
<A NAME="1337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=714><b>tn</b> The connective &#8220;and&#8221; is not present in the Hebrew text; it has been supplied for purposes of English style.</p>
<A NAME="1338"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=715><b>tn</b> The Hitpael form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hithallekh</font>) means &#8220;to walk about&#8221;; it also can carry the ideas of moving about, traversing, going back and forth, or living in an area. It here has the connotation of traversing the land to survey it, to look it over.</p>
<A NAME="1339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=716><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the land to its length and to its breadth.&#8221; This phrase has not been included in the translation because it is somewhat redundant (see the note on the word &#8220;throughout&#8221; in this verse).</p>
<A NAME="1340"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=717><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he came and lived.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1341"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=718><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;terebinths.&#8221;</p>
