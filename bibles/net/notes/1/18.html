<A NAME="186"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=943><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lifted up his eyes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="187"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=944><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and saw, and look.&#8221; The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>) draws attention to what he saw. The drawn-out description focuses the reader&#8217;s attention on Abraham&#8217;s deliberate, fixed gaze and indicates that what he is seeing is significant.</p>
<A NAME="188"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=945><b>tn</b> The Hebrew preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) indicates the three men were nearby, but not close by, for Abraham had to run to meet them.</p>
<A NAME="189"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=946><b>tn</b> The pronoun &#8220;them&#8221; has been supplied in the translation for clarification. In the Hebrew text the verb has no stated object.</p>
<A NAME="1810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=947><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyishtakhu</font>, &#8220;and bowed low&#8221;) is from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hishtakhavah</font>, &#8220;to worship, bow low to the ground&#8221;). It is probably from a root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khavah</font>), though some derive it from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shakhah</font>).</p>
<A NAME="1811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=948><b>sn</b> The reader knows this is a theophany. The three visitors are probably the <sc>Lord and two angels (see Gen 19:1). It is not certain how soon Abraham recognized the true identity of the visitors. His actions suggest he suspected this was something out of the ordinary, though it is possible that his lavish treatment of the visitors was done quite unwittingly. Bowing down to the ground would be reserved for obeisance of kings or worship of the <sc>Lord. Whether he was aware of it or not, Abraham&#8217;s action was most appropriate.</p>
<A NAME="1812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=949><b>tc</b> The MT has the form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adonay</font>, &#8220;Master&#8221;) which is reserved for God. This may reflect later scribal activity. The scribes, knowing it was the <sc>Lord, may have put the proper pointing with the word instead of the more common <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adoni</font>, &#8220;my master&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=950><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;do not pass by from upon your servant.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=951><b>tn</b> The imperative after the jussive indicates purpose here.</p>
<A NAME="1815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=952><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;all&#8221; has been supplied in the translation because the Hebrew verb translated &#8220;wash&#8221; and the pronominal suffix on the word &#8220;feet&#8221; are plural, referring to all three of the visitors.</p>
<A NAME="1816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=953><b>tn</b> The Qal cohortative here probably has the nuance of polite request.</p>
<A NAME="1817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=954><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a piece of bread.&#8221; The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1462;&#1495;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lekhem</font>) can refer either to bread specifically or to food in general. Based on Abraham&#8217;s directions to Sarah in v. 6, bread was certainly involved, but v. 7 indicates that Abraham had a more elaborate meal in mind.</p>
<A NAME="1818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=955><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;strengthen your heart.&#8221; The imperative after the cohortative indicates purpose here.</p>
<A NAME="1819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=956><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;so that you may refresh yourselves, after [which] you may be on your way &#8211; for therefore you passed by near your servant.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=957><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;take&#8221; is supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons. In the Hebrew text the sentence lacks a verb other than the imperative &#8220;hurry.&#8221; The elliptical structure of the language reflects Abraham&#8217;s haste to get things ready quickly.</p>
<A NAME="1821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=958><b>sn</b> <i>Three measures</i> (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;three seahs&#8221;) was equivalent to about twenty quarts (twenty-two liters) of flour, which would make a lot of bread. The animal prepared for the meal was far more than the three visitors needed. This was a banquet for royalty. Either it had been a lonely time for Abraham and the presence of visitors made him very happy, or he sensed this was a momentous visit.</p>
<A NAME="1822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=959><b>sn</b> The <i>bread</i> was the simple, round bread made by bedouins that is normally prepared quickly for visitors.</p>
<A NAME="1823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=960><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the young man.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=961><b>tn</b> The construction uses the Piel preterite, &#8220;he hurried,&#8221; followed by the infinitive construct; the two probably form a verbal hendiadys: &#8220;he quickly prepared.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=962><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Abraham) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=963><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;the food&#8221; are supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons. In the Hebrew text the verb has no stated object.</p>
<A NAME="1827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=964><b>tn</b> The disjunctive clause is a temporal circumstantial clause subordinate to the main verb.</p>
<A NAME="1828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=965><b>tn</b> The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>) often accompanies a gesture of pointing or a focused gaze.</p>
<A NAME="1829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=966><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (one of the three men introduced in v. 2) has been specified in the translation for clarity. Some English translations have specified the referent as the <sc>Lord (cf. RSV, NIV) based on vv. 1, 13, but the Hebrew text merely has &#8220;he said&#8221; at this point, referring to one of the three visitors. Aside from the introductory statement in v. 1, the incident is narrated from Abraham&#8217;s point of view, and the suspense is built up for the reader as Abraham&#8217;s elaborate banquet preparations in the preceding verses suggest he suspects these are important guests. But not until the promise of a son later in this verse does it become clear who is speaking. In v. 13 the Hebrew text explicitly mentions the <sc>Lord.</p>
<A NAME="1830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=967><b>tn</b> The Hebrew construction is emphatic, using the infinitive absolute with the imperfect tense.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>I will surely return</i>. If Abraham had not yet figured out who this was, this interchange would have made it clear. Otherwise, how would a return visit from this man mean Sarah would have a son?</p>
<A NAME="1831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=968><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;as/when the time lives&#8221; or &#8220;revives,&#8221; possibly referring to the springtime.</p>
<A NAME="1832"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=969><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and there will be (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>) a son for Sarah.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1833"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=970><b>tn</b> This is the first of two disjunctive parenthetical clauses preparing the reader for Sarah&#8217;s response (see v. 12).</p>
<A NAME="1834"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=971><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;days.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1835"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=972><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;it had ceased to be for Sarah [after] a way like women.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1836"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=973><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;saying.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1837"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=974><b>tn</b> It has been suggested that this word should be translated &#8220;conception,&#8221; not &#8220;pleasure.&#8221; See A. A. McIntosh, &#8220;A Third Root <i>&#8216;adah</i> in Biblical Hebrew,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 24 (1974): 454-73.</p>
<A NAME="1838"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=975><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;too&#8221; has been added in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="1839"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=976><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Why, this?&#8221; The demonstrative pronoun following the interrogative pronoun is enclitic, emphasizing the <sc>Lord&#8217;s amazement: &#8220;Why on earth did Sarah laugh?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1840"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=977><b>tn</b> The Hebrew construction uses both <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1488;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">af</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1467;&#1502;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">umnam</font>): &#8220;Indeed, truly, will I have a child?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1841"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=978><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pala</font>&#8217;) means &#8220;to be wonderful, to be extraordinary, to be surpassing, to be amazing.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1842"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=979><b>sn</b> <i>Sarah will have a son</i>. The passage brings God&#8217;s promise into clear focus. As long as it was a promise for the future, it really could be believed without much involvement. But now, when it seemed so impossible from the human standpoint, when the <sc>Lord fixed an exact date for the birth of the child, the promise became rather overwhelming to Abraham and Sarah. But then this was the <sc>Lord of creation, the one they had come to trust. The point of these narratives is that the creation of Abraham&#8217;s offspring, which eventually became Israel, is no less a miraculous work of creation than the creation of the world itself.</p>
<A NAME="1843"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=980><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And he said, &#8216;No, but you did laugh.&#8217;&#8221; The referent (the <sc>Lord) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1844"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=981><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And the men arose from there.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1845"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=982><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;toward the face of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1846"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=983><b>tn</b> The disjunctive parenthetical clause sets the stage for the following speech.</p>
<A NAME="1847"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=984><b>tn</b> The Piel of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shalakh</font>) means &#8220;to lead out, to send out, to expel&#8221;; here it is used in the friendly sense of seeing the visitors on their way.</p>
<A NAME="1848"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=985><b>tn</b> The active participle here refers to an action that is imminent.</p>
<A NAME="1849"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=986><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;And Abraham.&#8221; The disjunctive clause is probably causal, giving a reason why God should not hide his intentions from Abraham. One could translate, &#8220;Should I hide from Abraham what I am about to do, seeing that Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1850"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=987><b>tn</b> The infinitive absolute lends emphasis to the finite verb that follows.</p>
<A NAME="1851"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=988><b>tn</b> Theoretically the Niphal can be translated either as passive or reflexive/reciprocal. (The Niphal of &#8220;bless&#8221; is only used in formulations of the Abrahamic covenant. See Gen 12:2; 18:18; 28:14.) Traditionally the verb is taken as passive here, as if Abram were going to be a channel or source of blessing. But in later formulations of the Abrahamic covenant (see Gen 22:18; 26:4) the Hitpael replaces this Niphal form, suggesting a translation &#8220;will bless [i.e., &#8220;pronounce blessings upon&#8221;] themselves [or &#8220;one another&#8221;].&#8221; The Hitpael of &#8220;bless&#8221; is used with a reflexive/reciprocal sense in Deut 29:18; Ps 72:17; Isa 65:16; Jer 4:2. Gen 18:18 (like 12:2) predicts that Abraham will be held up as a paradigm of divine blessing and that people will use his name in their blessing formulae. For examples of blessing formulae utilizing an individual as an example of blessing see Gen 48:20 and Ruth 4:11.</p>
<A NAME="1852"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=989><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;For I have known him.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yada</font>&#8217;) here means &#8220;to recognize and treat in a special manner, to choose&#8221; (see Amos 3:2). It indicates that Abraham stood in a special covenantal relationship with the <sc>Lord.</p>
<A NAME="1853"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=990><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they will keep.&#8221; The perfect verbal form with <i>vav</i> consecutive carries on the subjective nuance of the preceding imperfect verbal form (translated &#8220;so that he may command&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1854"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=991><b>tn</b> The infinitive construct here indicates manner, explaining how Abraham&#8217;s children and his household will keep the way of the <sc>Lord.</p>
<A NAME="1855"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=992><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;bring on.&#8221; The infinitive after <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿma</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">an</font>) indicates result here.</p>
<A NAME="1856"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=993><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;spoke to.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1857"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=994><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the outcry of Sodom,&#8221; which apparently refers to the outcry for divine justice from those (unidentified persons) who observe its sinful ways.</p>
<A NAME="1858"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=995><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;heavy.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1859"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=996><b>tn</b> The cohortative indicates the <sc>Lord&#8217;s resolve.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>I must go down</i>. The descent to &#8220;see&#8221; Sodom is a bold anthropomorphism, stressing the careful judgment of God. The language is reminiscent of the <sc>Lord going down to see the Tower of Babel in Gen 11:1-9.</p>
<A NAME="1860"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=997><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[if] according to the outcry that has come to me they have done completely.&#8221; Even the <sc>Lord, who is well aware of the human capacity to sin, finds it hard to believe that anyone could be as bad as the &#8220;outcry&#8221; against Sodom and Gomorrah suggests.</p>
<A NAME="1861"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=998><b>sn</b> The short phrase <i>if not</i> provides a ray of hope and inspires Abraham&#8217;s intercession.</p>
<A NAME="1862"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=999><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And the men turned from there.&#8221; The word &#8220;two&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but is supplied here for clarity. Gen 19:1 mentions only two individuals (described as &#8220;angels&#8221;), while Abraham had entertained three visitors (18:2). The implication is that the <sc>Lord was the third visitor, who remained behind with Abraham here. The words &#8220;from there&#8221; are not included in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="1863"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=1000><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;went.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1864"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=1001><b>tc</b> An ancient Hebrew scribal tradition reads &#8220;but the <sc>Lord remained standing before Abraham.&#8221; This reading is problematic because the phrase &#8220;standing before&#8221; typically indicates intercession, but the <sc>Lord would certainly not be interceding before Abraham.</p>
