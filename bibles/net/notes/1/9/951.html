<A NAME="951"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=485><b>tn</b> The word translated &#8220;garment&#8221; has the Hebrew definite article on it. The article may simply indicate that the garment is definite and vivid in the mind of the narrator, but it could refer instead to Noah&#8217;s garment. Did Ham bring it out when he told his brothers?</p>
