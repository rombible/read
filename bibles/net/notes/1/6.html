<A NAME="61"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=291><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has the article prefixed to the noun. Here the article indicates the generic use of the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adam</font>): &#8220;humankind.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="62"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=292><b>tn</b> This disjunctive clause (conjunction + subject + verb) is circumstantial to the initial temporal clause. It could be rendered, &#8220;with daughters being born to them.&#8221; For another example of such a disjunctive clause following the construction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayÿhiki</font>, &#8220;and it came to pass when&#8221;), see 2 Sam 7:1.</p>
<A NAME="63"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=293><b>tn</b> The pronominal suffix is third masculine plural, indicating that the antecedent &#8220;humankind&#8221; is collective.</p>
<A NAME="64"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=294><b>sn</b> The Hebrew phrase translated &#8220;sons of God&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bÿne-ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohim</font>) occurs only here (Gen 6:2, 4) and in Job 1:6; 2:1; 38:7. There are three major interpretations of the phrase here. (1) In the Book of Job the phrase clearly refers to angelic beings. In Gen 6 the &#8220;sons of God&#8221; are distinct from &#8220;humankind,&#8221; suggesting they were not human. This is consistent with the use of the phrase in Job. Since the passage speaks of these beings cohabiting with women, they must have taken physical form or possessed the bodies of men. An early Jewish tradition preserved in <i>1 En.</i> 6-7 elaborates on this angelic revolt and even names the ringleaders. (2) Not all scholars accept the angelic interpretation of the &#8220;sons of God,&#8221; however. Some argue that the &#8220;sons of God&#8221; were members of Seth&#8217;s line, traced back to God through Adam in Gen 5, while the &#8220;daughters of humankind&#8221; were descendants of Cain. But, as noted above, the text distinguishes the &#8220;sons of God&#8221; from humankind (which would include the Sethites as well as the Cainites) and suggests that the &#8220;daughters of humankind&#8221; are human women in general, not just Cainites. (3) Others identify the &#8220;sons of God&#8221; as powerful tyrants, perhaps demon-possessed, who viewed themselves as divine and, following the example of Lamech (see Gen 4:19), practiced polygamy. But usage of the phrase &#8220;sons of God&#8221; in Job militates against this view. For literature on the subject see G. J. Wenham, <i>Genesis</i> (WBC), 1:135.</p>
<A NAME="65"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=295><b>tn</b> The verb form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yadon</font>) only occurs here. Some derive it from the verbal root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">din</font>, &#8220;to judge&#8221;) and translate &#8220;strive&#8221; or &#8220;contend with&#8221; (so NIV), but in this case one expects the form to be <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yadin</font>). The Old Greek has &#8220;remain with,&#8221; a rendering which may find support from an Arabic cognate (see C. Westermann, <i>Genesis</i>, 1:375). If one interprets the verb in this way, then it is possible to understand <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ruakh</font>) as a reference to the divine life-giving spirit or breath, rather than the <sc>Lord&#8217;s personal Spirit. E. A. Speiser argues that the term is cognate with an Akkadian word meaning &#8220;protect&#8221; or &#8220;shield.&#8221; In this case, the <sc>Lord&#8217;s Spirit will not always protect humankind, for the race will suddenly be destroyed (E. A. Speiser, &#8220;YDWN, Gen. 6:3,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 75 [1956]: 126-29). </p>

<A NAME="67"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=297><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿshagam</font>) appears to be a compound of the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">beth</font>, &#8220;in&#8221;), the relative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;</font> (<font face="Scholar">she</font>, &#8220;who&#8221; or &#8220;which&#8221;), and the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gam</font>, &#8220;also, even&#8221;). It apparently means &#8220;because even&#8221; (see BDB 980 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;</font>).</p>
<A NAME="68"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=298><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the plural pronoun has been used in the translation since &#8220;man&#8221; earlier in the verse has been understood as a collective (&#8220;humankind&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="69"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=299><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;flesh.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=300><b>tn</b> See the note on &#8220;they&#8221; earlier in this verse.</p>
<A NAME="611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=301><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his days will be 120 years.&#8221; Some interpret this to mean that the age expectancy of people from this point on would be 120, but neither the subsequent narrative nor reality favors this. It is more likely that this refers to the time remaining between this announcement of judgment and the coming of the flood.</p>
<A NAME="612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=302><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1508;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nÿfilim</font>) is simply transliterated here, because the meaning of the term is uncertain. According to the text, the Nephilim became mighty warriors and gained great fame in the antediluvian world. The text may imply they were the offspring of the sexual union of the &#8220;sons of God&#8221; and the &#8220;daughters of humankind&#8221; (v. 2), but it stops short of saying this in a direct manner. The Nephilim are mentioned in the OT only here and in Num 13:33, where it is stated that they were giants (thus KJV, TEV, NLT &#8220;giants&#8221; here). The narrator observes that the Anakites of Canaan were descendants of the Nephilim. Certainly these later Anakite Nephilim could not be descendants of the antediluvian Nephilim (see also the following note on the word &#8220;this&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=303><b>tn</b> This observation is parenthetical, explaining that there were Nephilim even after the flood. If all humankind, with the exception of Noah and his family, died in the flood, it is difficult to understand how the postdiluvian Nephilim could be related to the antediluvian Nephilim or how the Anakites of Canaan could be their descendants (see Num 13:33). It is likely that the term Nephilim refers generally to &#8220;giants&#8221; (see <i>HALOT</i> 709 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1508;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>) without implying any ethnic connection between the antediluvian and postdiluvian varieties.</p>
<A NAME="614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=304><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;were entering to,&#8221; referring euphemistically to sexual intercourse here. The Hebrew imperfect verbal form draws attention to the ongoing nature of such sexual unions during the time before the flood.</p>
<A NAME="615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=305><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they gave birth to them.&#8221; The masculine plural suffix &#8220;them&#8221; refers to the &#8220;sons of God,&#8221; to whom the &#8220;daughters of humankind&#8221; bore children. After the Qal form of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yalad</font>, &#8220;to give birth&#8221;) the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿ</font>, &#8220;to&#8221;) introduces the father of the child(ren). See Gen 16:1, 15; 17:19, 21; 21:2-3, 9; 22:23; 24:24, 47; 25:2, etc.</p>
<A NAME="616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=306><b>tn</b> The parenthetical/explanatory clause uses the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">haggibborim</font>) to describe these Nephilim. The word means &#8220;warriors; mighty men; heroes.&#8221; The appositional statement further explains that they were &#8220;men of renown.&#8221; The text refers to superhuman beings who held the world in their power and who lived on in ancient lore outside the Bible. See E. A. Speiser, <i>Genesis </i>(AB), 45-46; C. Westermann, <i>Genesis</i>, 1:379-80; and Anne D. Kilmer, &#8220;The Mesopotamian Counterparts of the Biblical <i>Nephilim</i>,&#8221; <i>Perspectives on Language and Text</i>, 39-43.</p>
<A NAME="617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=307><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;men of name&#8221; (i.e., famous men).</p>

<A NAME="619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=309><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1461;&#1510;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yetser</font>) is related to the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatsar</font>, &#8220;to form, to fashion [with a design]&#8221;). Here it refers to human plans or intentions (see Gen 8:21; 1 Chr 28:9; 29:18). People had taken their God-given capacities and used them to devise evil. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1461;&#1510;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yetser</font>) became a significant theological term in Rabbinic literature for what might be called the sin nature &#8211; the evil inclination (see also R. E. Murphy, &#8220;Yeser in the Qumran Literature,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 39 [1958]: 334-44).</p>
<A NAME="620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=310><b>tn</b> The related verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hashav</font>) means &#8220;to think, to devise, to reckon.&#8221; The noun (here) refers to thoughts or considerations.</p>
<A NAME="621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=311><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his heart&#8221; (referring to collective &#8220;humankind&#8221;). The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1461;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lev</font>, &#8220;heart&#8221;) frequently refers to the seat of one&#8217;s thoughts (see BDB 524 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1461;&#1489;</font>). In contemporary English this is typically referred to as the &#8220;mind.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=312><b>sn</b> <i>Every inclination of the thoughts of their minds was only evil</i>. There is hardly a stronger statement of the wickedness of the human race than this. Here is the result of falling into the &#8220;knowledge of good and evil&#8221;: Evil becomes dominant, and the good is ruined by the evil.</p>
<A NAME="623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=313><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all the day.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The author of Genesis goes out of his way to emphasize the depth of human evil at this time.

<A NAME="624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=314><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;was grieved&#8221;; &#8220;was sorry.&#8221; In the Niphal stem the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakham</font>) can carry one of four semantic meanings, depending on the context: (1) &#8220;to experience emotional pain or weakness,&#8221; &#8220;to feel regret,&#8221; often concerning a past action (see Exod 13:17; Judg 21:6, 15; 1 Sam 15:11, 35; Job 42:6; Jer 31:19). In several of these texts <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>, &#8220;because&#8221;) introduces the cause of the emotional sorrow. (2) Another meaning is &#8220;to be comforted&#8221; or &#8220;to comfort oneself&#8221; (sometimes by taking vengeance). See Gen 24:67; 38:12; 2 Sam 13:39; Ps 77:3; Isa 1:24; Jer 31:15; Ezek 14:22; 31:16; 32:31. (This second category represents a polarization of category one.) (3) The meaning &#8220;to relent from&#8221; or &#8220;to repudiate&#8221; a course of action which is already underway is also possible (see Judg 2:18; 2 Sam 24:16 = 1 Chr 21:15; Pss 90:13; 106:45; Jer 8:6; 20:16; 42:10). (4) Finally, &#8220;to retract&#8221; (a statement) or &#8220;to relent or change one&#8217;s mind concerning,&#8221; &#8220;to deviate from&#8221; (a stated course of action) is possible (see Exod 32:12, 14; 1 Sam 15:29; Ps 110:4; Isa 57:6; Jer 4:28; 15:6; 18:8, 10; 26:3, 13, 19; Ezek 24:14; Joel 2:13-14; Am 7:3, 6; Jonah 3:9-10; 4:2; Zech 8:14). See R. B. Chisholm, &#8220;Does God &#8216;Change His Mind&#8217;?&#8221; <i>BSac</i> 152 (1995): 388. The first category applies here because the context speaks of God&#8217;s grief and emotional pain (see the following statement in v. 6) as a result of a past action (his making humankind). For a thorough study of the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, see H. Van Dyke Parunak, &#8220;A Semantic Survey of <i>NHM</i>,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 56 (1975): 512-32.</p>
<A NAME="625"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=315><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and he was grieved to his heart.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">atsav</font>) can carry one of three semantic senses, depending on the context: (1) &#8220;to be injured&#8221; (Ps 56:5; Eccl 10:9; 1 Chr 4:10); (2) &#8220;to experience emotional pain&#8221;; &#8220;to be depressed emotionally&#8221;; &#8220;to be worried&#8221; (2 Sam 19:2; Isa 54:6; Neh 8:10-11); (3) &#8220;to be embarrassed&#8221;; &#8220;to be offended&#8221; (to the point of anger at another or oneself); &#8220;to be insulted&#8221; (Gen 34:7; 45:5; 1 Sam 20:3, 34; 1 Kgs 1:6; Isa 63:10; Ps 78:40). This third category develops from the second by metonymy. In certain contexts emotional pain leads to embarrassment and/or anger. In this last use the subject sometimes directs his anger against the source of grief (see especially Gen 34:7). The third category fits best in Gen 6:6 because humankind&#8217;s sin does not merely wound God emotionally. On the contrary, it prompts him to strike out in judgment against the source of his distress (see v. 7). The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1461;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyit</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">atsev</font>), a Hitpael from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1489;</font>, alludes to the judgment oracles in Gen 3:16-19. Because Adam and Eve sinned, their life would be filled with pain; but sin in the human race also brought pain to God. The wording of v. 6 is ironic when compared to Gen 5:29. Lamech anticipated relief (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nakham</font>) from their work (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ma</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aseh</font>) and their painful toil (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1465;&#1503;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">itsÿvon</font>), but now we read that God was sorry (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nakham</font>) that he had made (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">asah</font>) humankind for it brought him great pain (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1489;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">atsav</font>).</p>

The plural &#8220;generations&#8221; can refer to successive generations in the past or the future. Here, where it is qualified by &#8220;his&#8221; (i.e., Noah&#8217;s), it refers to Noah&#8217;s contemporaries, comprised of the preceding generation (his father&#8217;s generation), those of Noah&#8217;s generation, and the next generation (those the same age as his children). In other words, &#8220;his generations&#8221; means the generations contemporary with him. See BDB 190 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font>.</p>
<A NAME="633"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=323><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Noah.&#8221; The proper name has been replaced with the pronoun in the translation for stylistic reasons. </p>
<A NAME="634"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=324><b>tn</b> The construction translated &#8220;walked with&#8221; is used in Gen 5:22, 24 (see the note on this phrase in 5:22) and in 1 Sam 25:15, where it refers to David&#8217;s and Nabal&#8217;s men &#8220;rubbing shoulders&#8221; in the fields. Based on the use in 1 Sam 25:15, the expression seems to mean &#8220;live in close proximity to,&#8221; which may, by metonymy, mean &#8220;maintain cordial relations with.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="635"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=325><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fathered.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="636"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=326><b>tn</b> Apart from Gen 6:11-12, the Niphal form of this verb occurs in Exod 8:20 HT (8:24 ET), where it describes the effect of the swarms of flies on the land of Egypt; Jer 13:7 and 18:4, where it is used of a &#8220;ruined&#8221; belt and &#8220;marred&#8221; clay pot, respectively; and Ezek 20:44, where it describes Judah&#8217;s morally &#8220;corrupt&#8221; actions. The sense &#8220;morally corrupt&#8221; fits well in Gen 6:11 because of the parallelism (note &#8220;the earth was filled with violence&#8221;). In this case &#8220;earth&#8221; would stand by metonymy for its sinful inhabitants. However, the translation &#8220;ruined&#8221; works just as well, if not better. In this case humankind&#8217;s sin is viewed has having an adverse effect upon the earth. Note that vv. 12b-13 make a distinction between the earth and the living creatures who live on it.</p>

<A NAME="641"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=331><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;flesh.&#8221; Since moral corruption is in view here, most modern western interpreters understand the referent to be humankind. However, the phrase &#8220;all flesh&#8221; is used consistently of humankind and the animals in Gen 6-9 (6:17, 19; 7:15-16, 21; 8:17; 9:11, 15-17), suggesting that the author intends to picture all living creatures, humankind and animals, as guilty of moral failure. This would explain why the animals, not just humankind, are victims of the ensuing divine judgment. The OT sometimes views animals as morally culpable (Gen 9:5; Exod 21:28-29; Jonah 3:7-8). The OT also teaches that a person&#8217;s sin can contaminate others (people and animals) in the sinful person&#8217;s sphere (see the story of Achan, especially Josh 7:10). So the animals could be viewed here as morally contaminated because of their association with sinful humankind.</p>

The Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shakhat</font>) means &#8220;to ruin, to destroy, to corrupt,&#8221; often as here in a moral/ethical sense. The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">derekh</font>, &#8220;way&#8221;) here refers to behavior or moral character, a sense that it frequently carries (see BDB 203 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> 6.a).</p>

<A NAME="644"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=334><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the end of all flesh is coming [or &#8220;has come&#8221;] before me.&#8221; (The verb form is either a perfect or a participle.) The phrase &#8220;end of all flesh&#8221; occurs only here. The term &#8220;end&#8221; refers here to the end of &#8220;life,&#8221; as v. 3 and the following context (which describes how God destroys all flesh) make clear. The statement &#8220;the end has come&#8221; occurs in Ezek 7:2, 6, where it is used of divine judgment. The phrase &#8220;come before&#8221; occurs in Exod 28:30, 35; 34:34; Lev 15:14; Num 27:17; 1 Sam 18:13, 16; 2 Sam 19:8; 20:8; 1 Kgs 1:23, 28, 32; Ezek 46:9; Pss 79:11 (groans come before God); 88:3 (a prayer comes before God); 100:2; 119:170 (prayer comes before God); Lam 1:22 (evil doing comes before God); Esth 1:19; 8:1; 9:25; 1 Chr 16:29. The expression often means &#8220;have an audience with&#8221; or &#8220;appear before.&#8221; But when used metaphorically, it can mean &#8220;get the attention of&#8221; or &#8220;prompt a response.&#8221; This is probably the sense in Gen 6:13. The necessity of ending the life of all flesh on earth is an issue that has gotten the attention of God. The term &#8220;end&#8221; may even be a metonymy for that which has prompted it &#8211; violence (see the following clause). </p>
<A NAME="645"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=335><b>tn</b> The participle, especially after <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>) has an imminent future nuance. The Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shakhat</font>) here has the sense &#8220;to destroy&#8221; (in judgment). Note the wordplay involving this verb in vv. 11-13: The earth is &#8220;ruined&#8221; because all flesh has acted in a morally &#8220;corrupt&#8221; manner. Consequently, God will &#8220;destroy&#8221; all flesh (the referent of the suffix &#8220;them&#8221;) along with the ruined earth. They had ruined themselves and the earth with violence, and now God would ruin them with judgment.

<A NAME="646"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=336><b>sn</b> The Hebrew verb is an imperative. A motif of this section is that Noah did as the <sc>Lord commanded him &#8211; he was obedient. That obedience had to come from faith in the word of the <sc>Lord.

While the exact nature of the wood involved is uncertain (cf. NLT &#8220;resinous wood&#8221;), many modern translations render the Hebrew term as &#8220;cypress&#8221; (so NEB, NIV, NRSV).</p>

Some authorities regard the form in v. 14 as a homonym of the much more common Levitical term (see BDB 498 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1508;&#1464;&#1512;</font>).</p>
