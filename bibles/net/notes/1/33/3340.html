<A NAME="3340"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=2122><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;God, the God of Israel.&#8221; Rather than translating the name, a number of modern translations merely transliterate it from the Hebrew as &#8220;El Elohe Israel&#8221; (cf. NIV, NRSV, REB). It is not entirely clear how the name should be interpreted grammatically. One option is to supply an equative verb, as in the translation: &#8220;The God of Israel [is] God.&#8221; Another interpretive option is &#8220;the God of Israel [is] strong [or &#8220;mighty&#8221;].&#8221; Buying the land and settling down for a while was a momentous step for the patriarch, so the commemorative naming of the altar is significant.</p>
