<A NAME="3334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2116><b>sn</b> <i>But Jacob traveled to Succoth</i>. There are several reasons why Jacob chose not to go to Mt. Seir after Esau. First, as he said, his herds and children probably could not keep up with the warriors. Second, he probably did not fully trust his brother. The current friendliness could change, and he could lose everything. And third, God did tell him to return to his land, not Seir. But Jacob is still not able to deal truthfully, probably because of fear of Esau.</p>
