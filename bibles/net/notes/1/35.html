<A NAME="358"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2193><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;day of distress.&#8221; See Ps 20:1 which utilizes similar language.</p>

<A NAME="3510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2195><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in their hand.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2196><b>sn</b> On the basis of a comparison with Gen 34 and Num 31, G. J. Wenham argues that the <i>foreign gods</i> and the <i>rings</i> could have been part of the plunder that came from the destruction of Shechem (<i>Genesis </i>[WBC], 2:324).</p>
<A NAME="3512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2197><b>sn</b> <i>Jacob buried them</i>. On the burial of the gods, see E. Nielson, &#8220;The Burial of the Foreign Gods,&#8221; <i>ST</i> 8 (1954/55): 102-22.</p>

<A NAME="3514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2199><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they journeyed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2200><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the fear of God was upon the cities which were round about them.&#8221; The expression &#8220;fear of God&#8221; apparently refers (1) to a fear of God (objective genitive; God is the object of their fear). (2) But it could mean &#8220;fear from God,&#8221; that is, fear which God placed in them (cf. NRSV &#8220;a terror from God&#8221;). Another option (3) is that the divine name is used as a superlative here, referring to &#8220;tremendous fear&#8221; (cf. NEB &#8220;were panic-stricken&#8221;; NASB &#8220;a great terror&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="3516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2201><b>map</b> For location see Map4-G4; Map5-C1; Map6-E3; Map7-D1; Map8-G3.</p>
<A NAME="3517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2202><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Jacob came to Luz which is in the land of Canaan &#8211; it is Bethel &#8211; he and all the people who were with him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2203><b>sn</b> The name <i>El-Bethel</i> means &#8220;God of Bethel.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2204><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;revealed themselves.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">niglu</font>), translated &#8220;revealed himself,&#8221; is plural, even though one expects the singular form with the plural of majesty. Perhaps <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohim</font>) is here a numerical plural, referring both to God and the angelic beings that appeared to Jacob. See the note on the word &#8220;know&#8221; in Gen 3:5.</p>
<A NAME="3520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2205><b>sn</b> <i>Deborah</i>. This woman had been Rebekah&#8217;s nurse, but later attached herself to Jacob. She must have been about one hundred and eighty years old when she died.</p>
<A NAME="3521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2206><b>tn</b> &#8220;and he called its name.&#8221; There is no expressed subject, so the verb can be translated as passive.</p>
<A NAME="3522"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2207><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Allon Bacuth,&#8221; if one transliterates the Hebrew name (cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV). An oak tree was revered in the ancient world and often designated as a shrine or landmark. This one was named for the weeping (mourning) occasioned by the death of Deborah.</p>
<A NAME="3523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2208><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he called his name Israel.&#8221; The referent of the pronoun &#8220;he&#8221; (God) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The name <i>Israel</i> means &#8220;God fights&#8221; (although some interpret the meaning as &#8220;he fights [with] God&#8221;). See Gen 32:28.</p>
<A NAME="3524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2209><b>tn</b> The name <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500; &#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el shadday</font>, &#8220;El Shaddai&#8221;) has often been translated &#8220;God Almighty,&#8221; primarily because Jerome translated it <i>omnipotens</i> (&#8220;all powerful&#8221;) in the Latin Vulgate. There has been much debate over the meaning of the name. For discussion see W. F. Albright,<i> </i>&#8220;The Names <i>Shaddai</i> and <i>Abram</i>,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 54 (1935): 173-210; R. Gordis, &#8220;The Biblical Root <i>sdy-sd</i>,&#8221; <i>JTS</i> 41 (1940): 34-43; and especially T. N. D. Mettinger, <i>In Search of God</i>, 69-72. Shaddai/El Shaddai is the sovereign king of the world who grants, blesses, and judges. In the Book of Genesis he blesses the patriarchs with fertility and promises numerous descendants. Outside Genesis he both blesses/protects and takes away life/happiness. The patriarchs knew God primarily as El Shaddai (Exod 6:3). While the origin and meaning of this name are uncertain its significance is clear. The name is used in contexts where God appears as the source of fertility and life. For a fuller discussion see the note on &#8220;sovereign God&#8221; in Gen 17:1.</p>
<A NAME="3525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2210><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;A nation and a company of nations will be from you and kings from your loins will come out.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>A nation&#8230;will descend from you</i>. The promise is rooted in the Abrahamic promise (see Gen 17). God confirms what Isaac told Jacob (see Gen 28:3-4). Here, though, for the first time Jacob is promised kings as descendants.</p>
<A NAME="3526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2211><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb translated &#8220;gave&#8221; refers to the Abrahamic promise of the land. However, the actual possession of that land lay in the future. The decree of the <sc>Lord made it certain; but it has the sense &#8220;promised to give.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3527"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2212><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and to your offspring after you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3528"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2213><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;went up from upon him in the place.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3529"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2214><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Jacob set up a sacred pillar in the place where he spoke with him, a sacred pillar of stone&#8221; (see the notes on the term &#8220;sacred stone&#8221; in Gen 28:18). This passage stands parallel to Gen 28:18-19, where Jacob set up a sacred stone, poured oil on it, and called the place Bethel. Some commentators see these as two traditions referring to the same event, but it is more likely that Jacob reconsecrated the place in fulfillment of the vow he had made here earlier. In support of this is the fact that the present narrative alludes to and is built on the previous one.</p>
<A NAME="3530"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2215><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nasakh</font>) means &#8220;to pour out, to make libations,&#8221; and the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nesekh</font>) is a &#8220;drink-offering,&#8221; usually of wine or of blood. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatsaq</font>) means &#8220;to pour out,&#8221; often of anointing oil, but of other elements as well.</p>
<A NAME="3531"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2216><b>sn</b> <i>Called the name of the place</i>. In view of the previous naming of Bethel in Gen 28:19, here Jacob was confirming or affirming the name through an official ritual marking the fulfillment of the vow. This place now did become Bethel, the house of God.</p>
<A NAME="3532"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2217><b>tn</b> The name <i>Bethel</i> means &#8220;house of God&#8221; in Hebrew.</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map4-G4; Map5-C1; Map6-E3; Map7-D1; Map8-G3.</p>
<A NAME="3533"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2218><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and there was still a stretch of the land to go to Ephrath.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3534"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2219><b>tn</b> Normally the verb would be translated &#8220;she gave birth,&#8221; but because that obviously had not happened yet, it is better to translate the verb as ingressive, &#8220;began to give birth&#8221; (cf. NIV) or &#8220;went into labor.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3535"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2220><b>tn</b> The construction uses a Hiphil infinitive, which E. A. Speiser classifies as an elative Hiphil. The contrast is with the previous Piel: there &#8220;she had hard labor,&#8221; and here, &#8220;her labor was at its hardest.&#8221; Failure to see this, Speiser notes, has led to redundant translations and misunderstandings (<i>Genesis</i> [AB], 273). </p>
<A NAME="3536"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2221><b>sn</b> <i>Another son</i>. The episode recalls and fulfills the prayer of Rachel at the birth of Joseph (Gen 30:24): &#8220;may he add&#8221; another son.</p>
<A NAME="3537"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2222><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the going out of her life, for she was dying.&#8221; Rachel named the child with her dying breath.</p>
<A NAME="3538"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2223><b>sn</b> The name <i>Ben-Oni</i> means &#8220;son of my suffering.&#8221; It is ironic that Rachel&#8217;s words to Jacob in Gen 30:1, &#8220;Give me children or I&#8217;ll die,&#8221; take a different turn here, for it was having the child that brought about her death.</p>
<A NAME="3539"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2224><b>tn</b> The disjunctive clause is contrastive.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>His father called him Benjamin</i>. There was a preference for giving children good or positive names in the ancient world, and &#8220;son of my suffering&#8221; would not do (see the incident in 1 Chr 4:9-10), because it would be a reminder of the death of Rachel (in this connection, see also D. Daube, &#8220;The Night of Death,&#8221; <i>HTR </i>61 [1968]: 629-32). So Jacob named him <i>Benjamin</i>, which means &#8220;son of the [or &#8220;my&#8221;] right hand.&#8221; The name Benjamin appears in the Mari texts. There have been attempts to connect this name to the resident tribe listed at Mari, &#8220;sons of the south&#8221; (since the term &#8220;right hand&#8221; can also mean &#8220;south&#8221; in Hebrew), but this assumes a different reading of the story. See J. Muilenburg, &#8220;The Birth of Benjamin,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 75 (1956): 194-201.</p>
<A NAME="3540"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=2225><b>sn</b> This explanatory note links the earlier name <i>Ephrath</i> with the later name <i>Bethlehem</i>.</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map7-E2; Map8-E2; Map10-B4.</p>
<A NAME="3541"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=2226><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;standing stone.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3542"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=2227><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;it is known as&#8221; (cf. NEB).</p>
<A NAME="3543"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2228><b>sn</b> The location of <i>Migdal Eder </i>is not given. It appears to be somewhere between Bethlehem and Hebron. Various traditions have identified it as at the shepherds&#8217; fields near Bethlehem (the Hebrew name <i>Migdal Eder</i> means &#8220;tower of the flock&#8221;; see Mic 4:8) or located it near Solomon&#8217;s pools.</p>
<A NAME="3544"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=2229><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Reuben went and lay with.&#8221; The expression &#8220;lay with&#8221; is a euphemism for having sexual intercourse.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Reuben&#8217;s act of having <i>sexual relations with Bilhah </i>probably had other purposes than merely satisfying his sexual desire. By having sex with Bilhah, Reuben (Leah&#8217;s oldest son) would have prevented Bilhah from succeeding Rachel as the favorite wife, and by sleeping with his father&#8217;s concubine he would also be attempting to take over leadership of the clan &#8211; something Absalom foolishly attempted later on in Israel&#8217;s history (2 Sam 16:21-22).</p>
<A NAME="3545"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=2230><b>tn</b> This is an adverbial accusative of location.</p>
<A NAME="3546"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=2231><b>tn</b> The name &#8220;Kiriath Arba&#8221; is in apposition to the preceding name, &#8220;Mamre.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3547"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=2232><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gur</font>), traditionally rendered &#8220;to sojourn,&#8221; refers to temporary settlement without ownership rights.</p>
<A NAME="3548"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=2233><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And the days of Isaac were one hundred and eighty years.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3549"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=2234><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Isaac expired and died and he was gathered to his people.&#8221; In the ancient Israelite view he joined his deceased ancestors in Sheol, the land of the dead.</p>
<A NAME="3550"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=2235><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;old and full of years.&#8221;</p>
