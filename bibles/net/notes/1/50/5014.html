<A NAME="5014"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=3003><b>sn</b> The location of <i>the threshing floor of Atad</i> is not certain. The expression <i>the other side of the Jordan </i>could refer to the eastern or western bank, depending on one&#8217;s perspective. However, it is commonly used in the OT for Transjordan. This would suggest that the entourage came up the Jordan Valley and crossed into the land at Jericho, just as the Israelites would in the time of Joshua.</p>
