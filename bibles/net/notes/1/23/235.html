<A NAME="235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1280><b>tn</b> Some translate the Hebrew term &#8220;Heth&#8221; as &#8220;Hittites&#8221; here (also in vv. 5, 7, 10, 16, 18, 20), but this gives the impression that these people were the classical Hittites of Anatolia. However, there is no known connection between these sons of Heth, apparently a Canaanite group (see Gen 10:15), and the Hittites of Asia Minor. See H. A. Hoffner, Jr., &#8220;Hittites,&#8221; <i>Peoples of the Old Testament World</i>, 152-53.</p>
