<A NAME="3027"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1815><b>sn</b> The name <i>Asher </i>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">asher</font>) apparently means &#8220;happy one.&#8221; The name plays on the words used in the statement which appears earlier in the verse. Both the Hebrew noun and verb translated &#8220;happy&#8221; and &#8220;call me happy,&#8221; respectively, are derived from the same root as the name Asher.</p>
