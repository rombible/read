<A NAME="3041"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1829><b>sn</b> The name <i>Issachar</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1499;&#1464;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yishakhar</font>) appears to mean &#8220;man of reward&#8221; or possibly &#8220;there is reward.&#8221; The name plays on the word used in the statement made earlier in the verse. The Hebrew noun translated &#8220;reward&#8221; is derived from the same root as the name Issachar. The irony is that Rachel thought the mandrakes would work for her, and she was willing to trade one night for them. But in that one night Leah became pregnant.</p>
