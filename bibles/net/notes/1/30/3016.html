<A NAME="3016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1804><b>sn</b> The name <i>Dan</i> means &#8220;he vindicated&#8221; or &#8220;he judged.&#8221; The name plays on the verb used in the statement which appears earlier in the verse. The verb translated &#8220;vindicated&#8221; is from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">din</font>, &#8220;to judge, to vindicate&#8221;), the same verbal root from which the name is derived. Rachel sensed that God was righting the wrong.</p>
