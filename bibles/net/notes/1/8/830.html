<A NAME="830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=425><b>sn</b> <i>Offered burnt offerings on the altar</i>. F. D. Maurice includes a chapter on the sacrifice of Noah in <i>The Doctrine of Sacrifice</i>. The whole burnt offering, according to Leviticus 1, represented the worshiper&#8217;s complete surrender and dedication to the <sc>Lord. After the flood Noah could see that God was not only a God of wrath, but a God of redemption and restoration. The one who escaped the catastrophe could best express his gratitude and submission through sacrificial worship, acknowledging God as the sovereign of the universe.</p>
