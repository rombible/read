<A NAME="811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=406><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;opened the window in the ark which he had made.&#8221; The perfect tense (&#8220;had made&#8221;) refers to action preceding the opening of the window, and is therefore rendered as a past perfect. Since in English &#8220;had made&#8221; could refer to either the ark or the window, the order of the phrases was reversed in the translation to clarify that the window is the referent.</p>
