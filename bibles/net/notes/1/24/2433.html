<A NAME="2433"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1350><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And the young woman was very good of appearance, a virgin, and a man she had not known.&#8221; Some argue that the Hebrew noun translated &#8220;virgin&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bÿtulah</font>) is better understood in a general sense, &#8220;young woman&#8221; (see Joel 1:8, where the word appears to refer to one who is married). In this case the circumstantial clause (&#8220;and a man she had not known&#8221;) would be restrictive, rather than descriptive. If the term actually means &#8220;virgin,&#8221; one wonders why the circumstantial clause is necessary (see Judg 21:12 as well). Perhaps the repetition emphasizes her sexual purity as a prerequisite for her role as the mother of the covenant community.</p>
