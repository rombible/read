<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1227><b>sn</b> The Hebrew verb used here means &#8220;to test; to try; to prove.&#8221; In this passage God tests Abraham to see if he would be obedient. See T. W. Mann, <i>The Book of the Torah</i>, 44-48. See also J. L. Crenshaw, <i>A Whirlpool of Torment </i>(OBT), 9-30; and J. I. Lawlor, &#8220;The Test of Abraham,&#8221; <i>GTJ</i> 1 (1980): 19-35.</p>
<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1228><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Abraham) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1229><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (God) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1230><b>sn</b> <i>Take your son&#8230;Isaac</i>. The instructions are very clear, but the details are deliberate. With every additional description the commandment becomes more challenging. </p>
<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1231><b>sn</b> There has been much debate over the location of <i>Moriah</i>; 2 Chr 3:1 suggests it may be the site where the temple was later built in Jerusalem.</p>
<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1232><b>sn</b> A whole <i>burnt offering</i> signified the complete surrender of the worshiper and complete acceptance by God. The demand for a human sacrifice was certainly radical and may have seemed to Abraham out of character for God. Abraham would have to obey without fully understanding what God was about.</p>
<A NAME="227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1233><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;which I will say to.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1234><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his donkey.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1235><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he arose and he went.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1236><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lifted up his eyes and saw.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1237><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And Abraham.&#8221; The proper name has been replaced in the translation by the pronoun (&#8220;he&#8221;) for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="2212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1238><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb is masculine plural, referring to the two young servants who accompanied Abraham and Isaac on the journey.</p>
<A NAME="2213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1239><b>tn</b> The disjunctive clause (with the compound subject preceding the verb) may be circumstantial and temporal.</p>
<A NAME="2214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1240><b>tn</b> This Hebrew word literally means &#8220;to bow oneself close to the ground.&#8221; It often means &#8220;to worship.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1241><b>sn</b> It is impossible to know what Abraham was thinking when he said, &#8220;we will&#8230;return to you.&#8221; When he went he knew (1) that he was to sacrifice Isaac, and (2) that God intended to fulfill his earlier promises through Isaac. How he reconciled those facts is not clear in the text. Heb 11:17-19 suggests that Abraham believed God could restore Isaac to him through resurrection.</p>
<A NAME="2216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1242><b>sn</b> <i>He took the fire and the knife in his hand</i>. These details anticipate the sacrifice that lies ahead.</p>
<A NAME="2217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1243><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text adds &#8220;and said.&#8221; This is redundant and has not been translated for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="2218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1244><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Here I am&#8221; (cf. Gen 22:1).</p>
<A NAME="2219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1245><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he said, &#8216;Here is the fire and the wood.&#8217;&#8221; The referent (Isaac) has been specified in the translation for clarity. Here and in the following verse the order of the introductory clauses and the direct discourse has been rearranged in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="2220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1246><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;will see for himself.&#8221; The construction means &#8220;to look out for; to see to it; to provide.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>God will provide</i> is the central theme of the passage and the turning point in the story. Note Paul&#8217;s allusion to the story in Rom 8:32 (&#8220;how shall he not freely give us all things?&#8221;) as well as H. J. Schoeps, &#8220;The Sacrifice of Isaac in Paul&#8217;s Theology,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 65 (1946): 385-92. </p>
<A NAME="2221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1247><b>sn</b> <i>Abraham built an altar there</i>. The theme of Abraham&#8217;s altar building culminates here. He has been a faithful worshiper. Will he continue to worship when called upon to make such a radical sacrifice?</p>
<A NAME="2222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1248><b>sn</b> <i>Then he tied up</i>. This text has given rise to an important theme in Judaism known as the Aqedah, from the Hebrew word for &#8220;binding.&#8221; When sacrifices were made in the sanctuary, God remembered the binding of Isaac, for which a substitute was offered. See D. Polish, &#8220;The Binding of Isaac,&#8221; <i>Jud</i> 6 (1957): 17-21.</p>
<A NAME="2223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1249><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in order to slaughter.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1250><b>sn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the messenger of the <sc>Lord&#8221; (also in v. 15). Some identify the angel of the <sc>Lord as the preincarnate Christ because in some texts the angel is identified with the <sc>Lord himself. However, see the note on the phrase &#8220;the <sc>Lord&#8217;s angel&#8221; in Gen 16:7.</p>
<A NAME="2225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1251><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Do not extend your hand toward the boy.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1252><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he said, &#8216;Do not extend&#8230;&#8217;&#8221;; the referent (the angel) has been specified in the context for clarity. The order of the introductory clause and the direct discourse has been rearranged in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="2227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1253><b>sn</b> <i>For now I know</i>. The test was designed to see if Abraham would be obedient (see v. 1). </p>
<A NAME="2228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1254><b>sn</b> In this context <i>fear</i> refers by metonymy to obedience that grows from faith.</p>
<A NAME="2229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1255><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lifted his eyes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1256><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and saw, and look.&#8221; The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>, &#8220;look&#8221;) draws attention to what Abraham saw and invites the audience to view the scene through his eyes.</p>
<A NAME="2231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1257><b>tc</b> The translation follows the reading of the MT; a number of Hebrew <sc>mss, the LXX, Syriac, and Samaritan Pentateuch read &#8220;one&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1491;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">ekhad</font>) instead of &#8220;behind him&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1512;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">akhar</font>).</p>
<A NAME="2232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1258><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Abraham&#8221;; the proper name has been replaced by the pronoun (&#8220;he&#8221;) in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="2233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1259><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the Lord sees&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492; &#1497;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yÿhvah yir</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eh</font>, traditionally transliterated &#8220;Jehovah Jireh&#8221;; see the note on the word &#8220;provide&#8221; in v. 8). By so naming the place Abraham preserved in the memory of God&#8217;s people the amazing event that took place there.</p>
<A NAME="2234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1260><b>sn</b> On the expression <i>to this day</i> see B. Childs, &#8220;A Study of the Formula &#8216;Until this Day&#8217;,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 82 (1963): 279-92.</p>
<A NAME="2235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1261><b>sn</b> The saying connected with these events has some ambiguity, which was probably intended. The Niphal verb could be translated (1) &#8220;in the mountain of the Lord it will be seen/provided&#8221; or (2) &#8220;in the mountain the Lord will appear.&#8221; If the temple later stood here (see the note on &#8220;Moriah&#8221; in Gen 22:2), the latter interpretation might find support, for the people went to the temple to appear before the Lord, who &#8220;appeared&#8221; to them by providing for them his power and blessings. See S. R. Driver, <i>Genesis</i>, 219.</p>
<A NAME="2236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1262><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;By myself I swear.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1263><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the oracle of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The phrase refers to a formal oracle or decree from the <sc>Lord.</p>
<A NAME="2238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1264><b>tn</b> The use of the infinitive absolute before the finite verbal form (either an imperfect or cohortative) emphasizes the certainty of the blessing.</p>
<A NAME="2239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1265><b>tn</b> Here too the infinitive absolute is used for emphasis before the following finite verb (either an imperfect or cohortative).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>I will greatly multiply</i>. The <sc>Lord here ratifies his earlier promise to give Abram a multitude of descendants. For further discussion see R. B. Chisholm, &#8220;Evidence from Genesis,&#8221; <i>A Case for Premillennialism</i>, 35-54. </p>
<A NAME="2240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1266><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1462;&#1512;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zera</font>&#8217;) occurring here and in v. 18 may mean &#8220;seed&#8221; (for planting), &#8220;offspring&#8221; (occasionally of animals, but usually of people), or &#8220;descendants&#8221; depending on the context.</p>
<A NAME="2241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1267><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;inherit.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1268><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;gate,&#8221; which here stands for a walled city. To break through the gate complex would be to conquer the city, for the gate complex was the main area of defense (hence the translation &#8220;stronghold&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="2243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1269><b>tn</b> In the Hebrew text this causal clause comes at the end of the sentence. The translation alters the word order for stylistic reasons.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Because you have obeyed me</i>. Abraham&#8217;s obedience brought God&#8217;s ratification of the earlier conditional promise (see Gen 12:2).</p>
<A NAME="2244"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1270><b>tn</b> Traditionally the verb is taken as passive (&#8220;will be blessed&#8221;) here, as if Abraham&#8217;s descendants were going to be a channel or source of blessing to the nations. But the Hitpael<i> </i>is better understood here as reflexive/reciprocal, &#8220;will bless [i.e., pronounce blessings on] themselves/one another&#8221; (see also Gen 26:4). Elsewhere the Hitpael of the verb &#8220;to bless&#8221; is used with a reflexive/reciprocal sense in Deut 29:18; Ps 72:17; Isa 65:16; Jer 4:2. Gen 12:2 predicts that Abram will be held up as a paradigm of divine blessing and that people will use his name in their blessing formulae. For examples of blessing formulae utilizing an individual as an example of blessing see Gen 48:20 and Ruth 4:11. Earlier formulations of this promise (see Gen 12:2; 18:18) use the Niphal stem. (See also Gen 28:14.)</p>
<A NAME="2245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1271><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they arose and went together.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2246"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1272><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Abraham stayed in Beer Sheba. This has been translated as a relative clause for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="2247"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1273><b>tn</b> In the Hebrew text the sentence begins with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>, &#8220;look&#8221;) which draws attention to the statement.</p>
<A NAME="2248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1274><b>sn</b> This parenthetical note about Kemuel&#8217;s descendant is probably a later insertion by the author/compiler of Genesis and not part of the original announcement.</p>
<A NAME="2249"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1275><b>tn</b> The disjunctive clause gives information that is important but parenthetical to the narrative. Rebekah would become the wife of Isaac (Gen 24:15).</p>
