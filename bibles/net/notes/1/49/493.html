<A NAME="493"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2944><b>tn</b> The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1494;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pakhaz</font>) only occurs here in the OT. A related verb occurs twice in the prophets (Jer 23:32; Zeph 3:4) for false prophets inventing their messages, and once in Judges for unscrupulous men bribed to murder (Judg 9:4). It would describe Reuben as being &#8220;frothy, boiling, turbulent&#8221; as water. The LXX has &#8220;run riot,&#8221; the Vulgate has &#8220;poured out,&#8221; and <i>Tg. Onq.</i> has &#8220;you followed your own direction.&#8221; It is a reference to Reuben&#8217;s misconduct in Gen 35, but the simile and the rare word invite some speculation. H. Pehlke suggests &#8220;destructive like water,&#8221; for Reuben acted with pride and presumption; see his &#8220;An Exegetical and Theological Study of Genesis 49:1-28&#8221; (Th.D. dissertation, Dallas Theological Seminary, 1985).</p>
