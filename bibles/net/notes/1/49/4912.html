<A NAME="4912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2953><b>tn</b> The Hebrew form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shiloh</font>) is a major interpretive problem. There are at least four major options (with many variations and less likely alternatives): (1) Some prefer to leave the text as it is, reading &#8220;Shiloh&#8221; and understanding it as the place where the ark rested for a while in the time of the Judges. (2) By repointing the text others arrive at the translation &#8220;until the [or &#8220;his&#8221;] ruler comes,&#8221; a reference to a Davidic ruler or the Messiah. (3) Another possibility that does not require emendation of the consonantal text, but only repointing, is &#8220;until tribute is brought to him&#8221; (so NEB, JPS, NRSV), which has the advantage of providing good parallelism with the following line, &#8220;the nations will obey him.&#8221; (4) The interpretation followed in the present translation, &#8220;to whom it [belongs]&#8221; (so RSV, NIV, REB), is based on the ancient versions. Again, this would refer to the Davidic dynasty or, ultimately, to the Messiah.</p>
