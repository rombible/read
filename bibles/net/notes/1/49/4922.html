<A NAME="4922"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2963><b>sn</b> The comparison of the tribe of <i>Dan</i> to a venomous <i>serpent</i> is meant to say that Dan, though small, would be potent, gaining victory through its skill and shrewdness. Jewish commentators have linked the image in part with Samson. That link at least illustrates the point: Though a minority tribe, Dan would gain the upper hand over others.</p>
