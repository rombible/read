<A NAME="4930"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2971><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text appears to mean &#8220;[is] a son of fruitfulness.&#8221; The second word is an active participle, feminine singular, from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">parah</font>, &#8220;to be fruitful&#8221;). The translation &#8220;bough&#8221; is employed for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ben</font>, elsewhere typically &#8220;son&#8221;) because Joseph is pictured as a healthy and fruitful vine growing by the wall. But there are difficulties with this interpretation. The word &#8220;son&#8221; nowhere else refers to a plant and the noun translated &#8220;branches&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;daughters&#8221;) in the third line is a plural form whereas its verb is singular. In the other oracles of Gen 49 an animal is used for comparison and not a plant, leading some to translate the opening phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503; &#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ben parah</font>, &#8220;fruitful bough&#8221;) as &#8220;wild donkey&#8221; (JPS, NAB). Various other interpretations involving more radical emendation of the text have also been offered.</p>
