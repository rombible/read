<A NAME="497"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2948><b>tn</b> The meaning of the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1499;&#1461;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿkherah</font>) is uncertain. It has been rendered (1) &#8220;habitations&#8221;; (2) &#8220;merchandise&#8221;; (3) &#8220;counsels&#8221;; (4) &#8220;swords&#8221;; (5) &#8220;wedding feasts.&#8221; If it is from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">karat</font>) and formed after noun patterns for instruments and tools (<i>maqtil, miqtil</i> form), then it would refer to &#8220;knives.&#8221; Since the verb is used in Exod 4:25 for circumcision, the idea would be &#8220;their circumcision knives,&#8221; an allusion to the events of Gen 34 (see M. J. Dahood, &#8220;&#8216;MKRTYHM&#8217; in Genesis 49,5,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 23 [1961]: 54-56). Another explanation also connects the word to the events of Gen 34 as a reference to the intended &#8220;wedding feast&#8221; for Dinah which could take place only after the men of Shechem were circumcised (see D. W. Young, &#8220;A Ghost Word in the Testament of Jacob (Gen 49:5)?&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 100 [1981]: 335-422).</p>
