<A NAME="401"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2450><b>sn</b> The Hebrew term <i>cupbearer</i> corresponds to the Egyptian <font face="Scholar">wb</font>&#8217;, an official (frequently a foreigner) who often became a confidant of the king and wielded political power (see K. A. Kitchen, <i>NBD<sup>3</sup></i> 248). Nehemiah held this post in Persia.</p>
<A NAME="402"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2451><b>sn</b> The <i>baker</i> may be the Egyptian <font face="Scholar">retehti</font>, the head of the bakers, who had privileges in the royal court.</p>
<A NAME="403"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2452><b>sn</b> The Hebrew verb translated <i>offended</i> here is the same one translated &#8220;sin&#8221; in 39:9. Perhaps there is an intended contrast between these officials, who deserve to be imprisoned, and Joseph, who refused to sin against God, but was thrown into prison in spite of his innocence.</p>
<A NAME="404"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2453><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1505;</font> (<font face="Scholar">saris</font>), used here of these two men and of Potiphar (see 39:1), normally means &#8220;eunuch.&#8221; But evidence from Akkadian texts shows that in early times the title was used of a court official in general. Only later did it become more specialized in its use.</p>
<A NAME="405"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2454><b>sn</b> <i>He served them</i>. This is the same Hebrew verb, meaning &#8220;to serve as a personal attendant,&#8221; that was translated &#8220;became [his] servant&#8221; in 39:4.</p>
<A NAME="406"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2455><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they were days in custody.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="407"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2456><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;dreamed a dream.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="408"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2457><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a man his dream in one night.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="409"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2458><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a man according to the interpretation of his dream.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2459><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">za</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">af</font>) only occurs here and Dan 1:10. It means &#8220;to be sick, to be emaciated,&#8221; probably in this case because of depression.</p>
<A NAME="4011"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2460><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;why are your faces sad today?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4012"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2461><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a dream we dreamed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4013"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2462><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;them&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but has been supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="4014"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2463><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text adds &#8220;and he said to him.&#8221; This has not been translated because it is redundant in English.</p>
<A NAME="4015"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2464><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the cup of Pharaoh.&#8221; The pronoun &#8220;his&#8221; has been used here in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="4016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2465><b>sn</b> The cupbearer&#8217;s dream is dominated by sets of three: three branches, three stages of growth, and three actions of the cupbearer.</p>
<A NAME="4017"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2466><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the three branches [are].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4018"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2467><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Pharaoh will lift up your head.&#8221; This Hebrew idiom usually refers to restoring dignity, office, or power. It is comparable to the modern saying &#8220;someone can hold his head up high.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4019"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2468><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;according to the former custom.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4020"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2469><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;but you have remembered me with you.&#8221; The perfect verbal form may be used rhetorically here to emphasize Joseph&#8217;s desire to be remembered. He speaks of the action as already being accomplished in order to make it clear that he expects it to be done. The form can be translated as volitional, expressing a plea or a request.</p>
<A NAME="4021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2470><b>tn</b> This perfect verbal form with the prefixed conjunction (and the two that immediately follow) carry the same force as the preceding perfect.</p>
<A NAME="4022"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2471><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;deal with me [in] kindness.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2472><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zakhar</font>) in the Hiphil stem means &#8220;to cause to remember, to make mention, to boast.&#8221; The implication is that Joseph would be pleased for them to tell his story and give him the credit due him so that Pharaoh would release him. Since Pharaoh had never met Joseph, the simple translation of &#8220;cause him to remember me&#8221; would mean little.</p>
<A NAME="4024"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2473><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;house.&#8221; The word &#8220;prison&#8221; has been substituted in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="4025"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2474><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ganav</font>) means &#8220;to steal,&#8221; but in the Piel<i>/</i>Pual stem &#8220;to steal away.&#8221; The idea of &#8220;kidnap&#8221; would be closer to the sense, meaning he was stolen and carried off. The preceding infinitive absolute underscores the point Joseph is making.</p>
<A NAME="4026"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2475><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;that [the] interpretation [was] good.&#8221; The words &#8220;the first dream&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="4027"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2476><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;three wicker baskets.&#8221; The meaning of the Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khori</font>, &#8220;white bread, cake&#8221;) is uncertain; some have suggested the meaning &#8220;wicker&#8221; instead. Comparison with texts from Ebla suggests the meaning &#8220;pastries made with white flour&#8221; (M. Dahood, &#8220;Eblaite <font face="Scholar">h¬a-rí </font>and Genesis 40,16 <font face="Scholar">h£o&#8222;rî</font>,&#8221; <i>BN</i> 13 [1980]: 14-16).</p>
<A NAME="4028"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2477><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the three baskets [are].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4029"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2478><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Pharaoh will lift up your head from upon you.&#8221; Joseph repeats the same expression from the first interpretation (see v. 13), but with the added words &#8220;from upon you,&#8221; which allow the statement to have a more literal and ominous meaning &#8211; the baker will be decapitated.</p>
<A NAME="4030"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2479><b>tn</b> The translation puts the verb in quotation marks because it is used rhetorically here and has a double meaning. With respect to the cup bearer it means &#8220;reinstate&#8221; (see v. 13), but with respect to the baker it means &#8220;decapitate&#8221; (see v. 19).</p>
<A NAME="4031"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2480><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his cupbearing.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4032"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2481><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;had interpreted for them.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The dreams were fulfilled exactly <i>as Joseph had predicted</i>, down to the very detail. Here was confirmation that Joseph could interpret dreams and that his own dreams were still valid. It would have been a tremendous encouragement to his faith, but it would also have been a great disappointment to spend two more years in jail.</p>
<A NAME="4033"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2482><b>tn</b> The <i>wayyiqtol </i>verbal form here has a reiterative or emphasizing function.</p>
