<A NAME="515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=281><b>sn</b> With the seventh panel there is a digression from the pattern. Instead of simply saying that Enoch lived, the text observes that he &#8220;walked with God.&#8221; The rare expression &#8220;walked with&#8221; (the Hitpael form of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1498;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">halakh</font>, &#8220;to walk&#8221; collocated with the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">et</font>, &#8220;with&#8221;) is used in 1 Sam 25:15 to describe how David&#8217;s men maintained a cordial and cooperative relationship with Nabal&#8217;s men as they worked and lived side by side in the fields. In Gen 5:22 the phrase suggests that Enoch and God &#8220;got along.&#8221; This may imply that Enoch lived in close fellowship with God, leading a life of devotion and piety. An early Jewish tradition, preserved in <i>1 En.</i> 1:9 and alluded to in Jude 14, says that Enoch preached about the coming judgment. See F. S. Parnham, &#8220;Walking with God,&#8221; <i>EvQ</i> 46 (1974): 117-18.</p>
