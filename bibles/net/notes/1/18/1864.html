<A NAME="1864"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=1001><b>tc</b> An ancient Hebrew scribal tradition reads &#8220;but the <sc>Lord remained standing before Abraham.&#8221; This reading is problematic because the phrase &#8220;standing before&#8221; typically indicates intercession, but the <sc>Lord would certainly not be interceding before Abraham.</p>
