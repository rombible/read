<A NAME="1842"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=979><b>sn</b> <i>Sarah will have a son</i>. The passage brings God&#8217;s promise into clear focus. As long as it was a promise for the future, it really could be believed without much involvement. But now, when it seemed so impossible from the human standpoint, when the <sc>Lord fixed an exact date for the birth of the child, the promise became rather overwhelming to Abraham and Sarah. But then this was the <sc>Lord of creation, the one they had come to trust. The point of these narratives is that the creation of Abraham&#8217;s offspring, which eventually became Israel, is no less a miraculous work of creation than the creation of the world itself.</p>
