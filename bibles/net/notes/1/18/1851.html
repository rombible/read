<A NAME="1851"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=988><b>tn</b> Theoretically the Niphal can be translated either as passive or reflexive/reciprocal. (The Niphal of &#8220;bless&#8221; is only used in formulations of the Abrahamic covenant. See Gen 12:2; 18:18; 28:14.) Traditionally the verb is taken as passive here, as if Abram were going to be a channel or source of blessing. But in later formulations of the Abrahamic covenant (see Gen 22:18; 26:4) the Hitpael replaces this Niphal form, suggesting a translation &#8220;will bless [i.e., &#8220;pronounce blessings upon&#8221;] themselves [or &#8220;one another&#8221;].&#8221; The Hitpael of &#8220;bless&#8221; is used with a reflexive/reciprocal sense in Deut 29:18; Ps 72:17; Isa 65:16; Jer 4:2. Gen 18:18 (like 12:2) predicts that Abraham will be held up as a paradigm of divine blessing and that people will use his name in their blessing formulae. For examples of blessing formulae utilizing an individual as an example of blessing see Gen 48:20 and Ruth 4:11.</p>
