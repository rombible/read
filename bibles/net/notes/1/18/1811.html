<A NAME="1811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=948><b>sn</b> The reader knows this is a theophany. The three visitors are probably the <sc>Lord and two angels (see Gen 19:1). It is not certain how soon Abraham recognized the true identity of the visitors. His actions suggest he suspected this was something out of the ordinary, though it is possible that his lavish treatment of the visitors was done quite unwittingly. Bowing down to the ground would be reserved for obeisance of kings or worship of the <sc>Lord. Whether he was aware of it or not, Abraham&#8217;s action was most appropriate.</p>
