Gen 19:1 mentions only two individuals (described as &#8220;angels&#8221;), while Abraham had entertained three visitors (18:2). The implication is that the <sc>Lord was the third visitor, who remained behind with Abraham here. The words &#8220;from there&#8221; are not included in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
