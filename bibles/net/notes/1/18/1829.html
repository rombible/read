<A NAME="1829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=966><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (one of the three men introduced in v. 2) has been specified in the translation for clarity. Some English translations have specified the referent as the <sc>Lord (cf. RSV, NIV) based on vv. 1, 13, but the Hebrew text merely has &#8220;he said&#8221; at this point, referring to one of the three visitors. Aside from the introductory statement in v. 1, the incident is narrated from Abraham&#8217;s point of view, and the suspense is built up for the reader as Abraham&#8217;s elaborate banquet preparations in the preceding verses suggest he suspects these are important guests. But not until the promise of a son later in this verse does it become clear who is speaking. In v. 13 the Hebrew text explicitly mentions the <sc>Lord.</p>
