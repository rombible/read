<A NAME="291"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1715><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Jacob lifted up his feet.&#8221; This unusual expression suggests that Jacob had a new lease on life now that God had promised him the blessing he had so desperately tried to gain by his own efforts. The text portrays him as having a new step in his walk.</p>
<A NAME="292"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1716><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the land of the sons of the east.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="293"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1717><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he saw, and look.&#8221; As in Gen 28:12-15, the narrator uses the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>, &#8220;look&#8221;) here and in the next clause to draw the reader into the story.</p>
<A NAME="294"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1718><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and look, there.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="295"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1719><b>tn</b> The disjunctive clause (introduced by the noun with the prefixed conjunction) provides supplemental information that is important to the story.</p>
<A NAME="296"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1720><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they&#8221;; the referent (the shepherds) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="297"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1721><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;son.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="298"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1722><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they said, &#8216;We know.&#8217;&#8221; The word &#8220;him&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but has been supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons. In the translation several introductory clauses throughout this section have been placed after the direct discourse they introduce for stylistic reasons as well.</p>
<A NAME="299"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1723><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he said to them, &#8216;Is there peace to him?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2910"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1724><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;peace.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1725><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he&#8221;; the referent (Jacob) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1726><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the day is great.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1727><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;water the sheep and go and pasture [them].&#8221; The verbal forms are imperatives, but Jacob would hardly be giving direct orders to someone else&#8217;s shepherds. The nuance here is probably one of advice.</p>
<A NAME="2914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1728><b>tn</b> The perfect verbal forms with the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive carry on the sequence begun by the initial imperfect form.</p>
<A NAME="2915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1729><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;was a shepherdess.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1730><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Laban, the brother of his mother&#8221; (twice in this verse).</p>
<A NAME="2917"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1731><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Jacob.&#8221; The proper name has been replaced by the pronoun (&#8220;he&#8221;) in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="2918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1732><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;drew near, approached.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1733><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Laban, the brother of his mother.&#8221; The text says nothing initially about the beauty of Rachel. But the reader is struck by the repetition of &#8220;Laban the brother of his mother.&#8221; G. J. Wenham is no doubt correct when he observes that Jacob&#8217;s primary motive at this stage is to ingratiate himself with Laban (<i>Genesis </i>[WBC], 2:231).</p>
<A NAME="2920"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1734><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he lifted up his voice and wept.&#8221; The idiom calls deliberate attention to the fact that Jacob wept out loud.</p>
<A NAME="2921"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1735><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;declared.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2922"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1736><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;that he [was] the brother of her father.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1737><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Jacob) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2924"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1738><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he told to Laban all these things.&#8221; This might mean Jacob told Laban how he happened to be there, but Laban&#8217;s response (see v. 14) suggests &#8220;all these things&#8221; refers to what Jacob had previously told Rachel (see v. 12).</p>
<A NAME="2925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1739><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;indeed, my bone and my flesh are you.&#8221; The expression sounds warm enough, but the presence of &#8220;indeed&#8221; may suggest that Laban had to be convinced of Jacob&#8217;s identity before permitting him to stay. To be one&#8217;s &#8220;bone and flesh&#8221; is to be someone&#8217;s blood relative. For example, the phrase describes the relationship between Abimelech and the Shechemites (Judg 9:2; his mother was a Shechemite); David and the Israelites (2 Sam 5:1); David and the elders of Judah (2 Sam 19:12,); and David and his nephew Amasa (2 Sam 19:13, see 2 Sam 17:2; 1 Chr 2:16-17).</p>
<A NAME="2926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1740><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he&#8221;; the referent (Jacob) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1741><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a month of days.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2928"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1742><b>tn</b> The verb is the perfect with the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive; the nuance in the question is deliberative.</p>
<A NAME="2929"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1743><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my brother.&#8221; The term &#8220;brother&#8221; is used in a loose sense; actually Jacob was Laban&#8217;s nephew.</p>
<A NAME="2930"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1744><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and to Laban [there were] two daughters.&#8221; The disjunctive clause (introduced here by a conjunction and a prepositional phrase) provides supplemental material that is important to the story. Since this material is parenthetical in nature, vv. 16-17 have been set in parentheses in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="2931"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1745><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the eyes of Leah were tender.&#8221; The disjunctive clause (introduced here by a conjunction and a noun) continues the parenthesis begun in v. 16. It is not clear what is meant by &#8220;tender&#8221; (or &#8220;delicate&#8221;) eyes. The expression may mean she had appealing eyes (cf. NAB, NRSV, NLT), though some suggest that they were plain, not having the brightness normally expected. Either way, she did not measure up to her gorgeous sister.</p>
<A NAME="2932"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1746><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Rachel was beautiful of form and beautiful of appearance.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2933"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1747><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Jacob loved.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2934"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1748><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Better my giving her to you than my giving her to another man.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2935"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1749><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in exchange for Rachel.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2936"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1750><b>sn</b> <i>But they seemed like only a few days to him</i>. This need not mean that the time passed quickly. More likely it means that the price seemed insignificant when compared to what he was getting in the bargain.</p>
<A NAME="2937"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1751><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;because of his love for her.&#8221; The words &#8220;was so great&#8221; are supplied for stylistic reasons.</p>

<A NAME="2939"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1753><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my days are fulfilled.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2940"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1754><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and I will go in to her.&#8221; The verb is a cohortative; it may be subordinated to the preceding request, &#8220;that I may go in,&#8221; or it may be an independent clause expressing his desire. The verb &#8220;go in&#8221; in this context refers to sexual intercourse (i.e., the consummation of the marriage). </p>
<A NAME="2941"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1755><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;men.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2942"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1756><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and it happened in the evening that he took Leah his daughter and brought her.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>His daughter Leah</i>. Laban&#8217;s deception of Jacob by giving him the older daughter instead of the younger was God&#8217;s way of disciplining the deceiver who tricked his older brother. D. Kidner says this account is &#8220;the very embodiment of anti-climax, and this moment a miniature of man&#8217;s disillusion, experienced from Eden onwards&#8221; (<i>Genesis</i> [TOTC]<i>,</i> 160). G. von Rad notes, &#8220;That Laban secretly gave the unloved Leah to the man in love was, to be sure, a monstrous blow, a masterpiece of shameless treachery&#8230;It was certainly a move by which he won for himself far and wide the coarsest laughter&#8221; (<i>Genesis</i> [OTL], 291). </p>
<A NAME="2943"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1757><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to him&#8221;; the referent (Jacob) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>

<A NAME="2945"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1759><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;went in to her.&#8221; The expression &#8220;went in to&#8221; in this context refers to sexual intercourse, i.e., the consummation of the marriage.</p>
<A NAME="2946"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1760><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Laban gave to her Zilpah his female servant, to Leah his daughter [for] a servant.&#8221; This clause gives information parenthetical to the narrative.</p>
<A NAME="2947"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1761><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and it happened in the morning that look, it was Leah.&#8221; By the use of the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>, &#8220;look&#8221;), the narrator invites the reader to view the scene through Jacob&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<A NAME="2950"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1764><b>sn</b> The Hebrew verb translated <i>tricked</i> here (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ramah</font>) is cognate to the noun used in Gen 27:35 to describe Jacob&#8217;s deception of Esau. Jacob is discovering that what goes around, comes around. See J. A. Diamond, &#8220;The Deception of Jacob: A New Perspective on an Ancient Solution to the Problem,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 34 (1984): 211-13.</p>
<A NAME="2951"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1765><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Laban said, &#8216;It is not done so in our place.&#8217;&#8221; The order of the introductory clause and the direct discourse has been rearranged in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>

<A NAME="2965"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=1779><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;hated.&#8221; The rhetorical device of overstatement is used (note v. 30, which says simply that Jacob loved Rachel more than he did Leah) to emphasize that Rachel, as Jacob&#8217;s true love and the primary object of his affections, had an advantage over Leah.</p>
<A NAME="2966"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=1780><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he opened up her womb.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="2969"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=1783><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;looked on my affliction.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Leah&#8217;s explanation of the name Reuben reflects a popular etymology, not an exact one. The name means literally &#8220;look, a son.&#8221; Playing on the Hebrew verb &#8220;look,&#8221; she observes that the <sc>Lord has &#8220;looked&#8221; with pity on her oppressed condition. See further S. R. Driver, <i>Genesis,</i> 273. </p>
<A NAME="2970"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=1784><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;hated.&#8221; See the note on the word &#8220;unloved&#8221; in v. 31.</p>

<A NAME="2972"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=1786><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;will be joined to me.&#8221;</p>
