<A NAME="4020"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2469><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;but you have remembered me with you.&#8221; The perfect verbal form may be used rhetorically here to emphasize Joseph&#8217;s desire to be remembered. He speaks of the action as already being accomplished in order to make it clear that he expects it to be done. The form can be translated as volitional, expressing a plea or a request.</p>
