<A NAME="4023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2472><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zakhar</font>) in the Hiphil stem means &#8220;to cause to remember, to make mention, to boast.&#8221; The implication is that Joseph would be pleased for them to tell his story and give him the credit due him so that Pharaoh would release him. Since Pharaoh had never met Joseph, the simple translation of &#8220;cause him to remember me&#8221; would mean little.</p>
