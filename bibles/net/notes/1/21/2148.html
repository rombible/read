<A NAME="2148"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1209><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb used here means &#8220;to argue; to dispute&#8221;; it can focus on the beginning of the dispute (as here), the dispute itself, or the resolution of a dispute (Isa 1:18). Apparently the complaint was lodged before the actual oath was taken.</p>
