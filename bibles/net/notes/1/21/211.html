<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1162><b>sn</b> The Hebrew verb translated &#8220;visit&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">paqad</font> ) often describes divine intervention for blessing or cursing; it indicates God&#8217;s special attention to an individual or a matter, always with respect to his people&#8217;s destiny. He may visit (that is, destroy) the Amalekites; he may visit (that is, deliver) his people in Egypt. Here he visits Sarah, to allow her to have the promised child. One&#8217;s destiny is changed when the <sc>Lord &#8220;visits.&#8221; For a more detailed study of the term, see G. André, <i>Determining the Destiny </i>(ConBOT).</p>
