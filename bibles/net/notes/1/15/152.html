<A NAME="152"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=779><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your reward [in] great abundance.&#8221; When the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; &#1502;&#1456;&#1488;&#1465;&#1491;&#1461;</font> (<font face="Scholar">harbeh mÿod</font>) follows a noun it invariably modifies the noun and carries the nuance &#8220;very great&#8221; or &#8220;in great abundance.&#8221; (See its use in Gen 41:49; Deut 3:5; Josh 22:8; 2 Sam 8:8; 12:2; 1 Kgs 4:29; 10:10-11; 2 Chr 14:13; 32:27; Jer 40:12.) Here the noun &#8220;reward&#8221; is in apposition to &#8220;shield&#8221; and refers by metonymy to God as the source of the reward. Some translate here &#8220;your reward will be very great&#8221; (cf. NASB, NRSV), taking the statement as an independent clause and understanding the Hiphil infinitive absolute as a substitute for a finite verb. However, the construction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; &#1502;&#1456;&#1488;&#1465;&#1491;&#1461;</font> is never used this way elsewhere, where it either modifies a noun (see the texts listed above) or serves as an adverb in relation to a finite verb (see Josh 13:1; 1 Sam 26:21; 2 Sam 12:30; 2 Kgs 21:16; 1 Chr 20:2; Neh 2:2).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Abram has just rejected all the spoils of war, and the <sc>Lord promises to reward him <i>in great abundance</i>.
