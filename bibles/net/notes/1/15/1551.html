<A NAME="1551"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=828><b>tn</b> The perfect verbal form is understood as instantaneous (&#8220;I here and now give&#8221;). Another option is to understand it as rhetorical, indicating certitude (&#8220;I have given&#8221; meaning it is as good as done, i.e., &#8220;I will surely give&#8221;).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>To your descendants I give this land</i>. The <sc>Lord here unconditionally promises that Abram&#8217;s descendants will possess the land, but he does not yet ratify his earlier promises to give Abram a multitude of descendants and eternal possession of the land. The fulfillment of those aspects of the promise remain conditional (see Gen 17:1-8) and are ratified after Abraham offers up his son Isaac (see Gen 22:1-19). For a fuller discussion see R. B. Chisholm, &#8220;Evidence from Genesis,&#8221; <i>A Case for Premillennialism</i>, 35-54.</p>
