<A NAME="1523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=800><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;righteousness&#8221;; or &#8220;evidence of steadfast commitment.&#8221; The noun is an adverbial accusative. The verb translated &#8220;considered&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;reckoned&#8221;) also appears with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsÿdaqah</font>, &#8220;righteousness&#8221;) in Ps 106:31. Alluding to the events recorded in Numbers 25, the psalmist notes that Phinehas&#8217; actions were &#8220;credited to him as righteousness for endless generations to come.&#8221; Reference is made to the unconditional, eternal covenant with which God rewarded Phinehas&#8217; loyalty (Num 25:12-13). So <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1492;</font> seems to carry by metonymy the meaning &#8220;loyal, rewardable behavior&#8221; here, a nuance that fits nicely in Genesis 15, where God responds to Abram&#8217;s faith by formally ratifying his promise to give Abram and his descendants the land. (See R. B. Chisholm, &#8220;Evidence from Genesis,&#8221; <i>A Case for Premillennialism</i>, 40.) In Phoenician and Old Aramaic inscriptions cognate nouns glossed as &#8220;correct, justifiable conduct&#8221; sometimes carry this same semantic nuance (<i>DNWSI</i> 2:962).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This episode is basic to the NT teaching of Paul on justification (Romans 4). Paul weaves this passage and Psalm 32 together, for both use this word. Paul explains that for the one who believes in the <sc>Lord, like Abram, God credits him with righteousness but does not credit his sins against him because he is forgiven. Justification does not mean that the believer is righteous; it means that God credits him with righteousness, so that in the records of heaven (as it were) he is declared righteous. See M. G. Kline, &#8220;Abram&#8217;s Amen,&#8221; <i>WTJ</i> 31 (1968): 1-11.</p>
