<A NAME="1520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=797><b>tn</b> The nonconsecutive <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) is on a perfect verbal form. If the composer of the narrative had wanted to show simple sequence, he would have used the <i>vav</i> consecutive with the preterite. The perfect with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> conjunctive (where one expects the preterite with <i>vav </i>consecutive) in narrative contexts can have a variety of discourse functions, but here it probably serves to highlight Abram&#8217;s response to God&#8217;s promise. For a detailed discussion of the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> + perfect construction in Hebrew narrative, see R. Longacre, &#8220;<i>Weqatal</i> Forms in Biblical Hebrew Prose: A Discourse-modular Approach,&#8221; <i>Biblical Hebrew and Discourse Linguistics</i>, 50-98. The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aman</font>) means &#8220;to confirm, to support&#8221; in the Qal verbal stem. Its derivative nouns refer to something or someone that/who provides support, such as a &#8220;pillar,&#8221; &#8220;nurse,&#8221; or &#8220;guardian, trustee.&#8221; In the Niphal stem it comes to mean &#8220;to be faithful, to be reliable, to be dependable,&#8221; or &#8220;to be firm, to be sure.&#8221; In the Hiphil, the form used here, it takes on a declarative sense: &#8220;to consider something reliable [or &#8220;dependable&#8221;].&#8221; Abram regarded the God who made this promise as reliable and fully capable of making it a reality.</p>
