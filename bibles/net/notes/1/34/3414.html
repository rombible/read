<A NAME="3414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2136><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">atsav</font>) can carry one of three semantic nuances depending on the context: (1) &#8220;to be injured&#8221; (Ps 56:5; Eccl 10:9; 1 Chr 4:10); (2) &#8220;to experience emotional pain; to be depressed emotionally; to be worried&#8221; (2 Sam 19:2; Isa 54:6; Neh 8:10-11); (3) &#8220;to be embarrassed; to be insulted; to be offended&#8221; (to the point of anger at another or oneself; Gen 6:6; 45:5; 1 Sam 20:3, 34; 1 Kgs 1:6; Isa 63:10; Ps 78:40). This third category develops from the second by metonymy. In certain contexts emotional pain leads to embarrassment and/or anger. In this last use the subject sometimes directs his anger against the source of grief (see especially Gen 6:6). The third category fits best in Gen 34:7 because Jacob&#8217;s sons were not merely wounded emotionally. On the contrary, Shechem&#8217;s action prompted them to strike out in judgment against the source of their distress.</p>
