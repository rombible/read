<A NAME="3419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2141><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Shechem my son, his soul is attached to your daughter.&#8221; The verb means &#8220;to love&#8221; in the sense of being emotionally attached to or drawn to someone. This is a slightly different way of saying what was reported earlier (v. 3). However, there is no mention here of the offense. Even though Hamor is speaking to Dinah&#8217;s brothers, he refers to her as their daughter (see v. 17).</p>
