<A NAME="3914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2409><b>sn</b> The passage gives us a good picture of Joseph as a young man who was responsible and faithful, both to his master and to his God. This happened within a very short time of his being sold into Egypt. It undermines the view that Joseph was a liar, a tattletale, and an arrogant adolescent.</p>
