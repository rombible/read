<A NAME="3949"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=2444><b>sn</b> The story of Joseph is filled with cycles and repetition: He has two dreams (chap. 37), he interprets two dreams in prison (chap. 40) and the two dreams of Pharaoh (chap. 41), his brothers make two trips to see him (chaps. 42-43), and here, for the second time (see 37:24), he is imprisoned for no good reason, with only his coat being used as evidence. For further discussion see H. Jacobsen, &#8220;A Legal Note on Potiphar&#8217;s Wife,&#8221; <i>HTR</i> 69 (1976): 177.</p>
