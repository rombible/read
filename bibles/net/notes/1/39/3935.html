<A NAME="3935"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2430><b>tn</b> The verb has no expressed subject, and so it could be treated as a passive (&#8220;a Hebrew man was brought in&#8221;; cf. NIV). But it is clear from the context that her husband brought Joseph into the household, so Potiphar is the apparent referent here. Thus the translation supplies &#8220;my husband&#8221; as the referent of the unspecified pronominal subject of the verb (cf. NEB, NRSV).</p>
