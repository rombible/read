<A NAME="421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2592><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;saw.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2593><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Jacob.&#8221; Here the proper name has been replaced by the pronoun (&#8220;he&#8221;) in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2594><b>sn</b> <i>Why are you looking at each other?</i> The point of Jacob&#8217;s question is that his sons should be going to get grain rather than sitting around doing nothing. Jacob, as the patriarch, still makes the decisions for the whole clan.</p>
<A NAME="424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2595><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and buy for us from there.&#8221; The word &#8220;grain,&#8221; the direct object of &#8220;buy,&#8221; has been supplied for clarity, and the words &#8220;from there&#8221; have been omitted in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2596><b>tn</b> Following the imperatives, the prefixed verbal form with prefixed <i>vav</i> expresses purpose of result.</p>
<A NAME="426"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2597><b>tn</b> The imperfect tense continues the nuance of the verb before it.</p>
<A NAME="427"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2598><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;But Benjamin, the brother of Joseph, Jacob did not send with his brothers.&#8221; The disjunctive clause highlights the contrast between Benjamin and the other ten.</p>
<A NAME="428"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2599><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amar</font>, &#8220;to say&#8221;) could also be translated &#8220;thought&#8221; (i.e., &#8220;he said to himself&#8221;) here, giving Jacob&#8217;s reasoning rather than spoken words.</p>
<A NAME="429"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2600><b>tn</b> The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1505;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ason</font>) is a rare word meaning &#8220;accident, harm.&#8221; Apart from its use in these passages it occurs in Exodus 21:22-23 of an accident to a pregnant woman. The term is a rather general one, but Jacob was no doubt thinking of his loss of Joseph.</p>
<A NAME="4210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2601><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;encounters.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2602><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the midst of the coming ones.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2603><b>tn</b> The disjunctive clause either introduces a new episode in the unfolding drama or provides the reader with supplemental information necessary to understanding the story.</p>
<A NAME="4213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2604><b>sn</b> <i>Joseph&#8217;s brothers came and bowed down before him</i>. Here is the beginning of the fulfillment of Joseph&#8217;s dreams (see Gen 37). But it is not the complete fulfillment, since all his brothers and his parents must come. The point of the dream, of course, was not simply to get the family to bow to Joseph, but that Joseph would be placed in a position of rule and authority to save the family and the world (41:57).</p>
<A NAME="4214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2605><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;faces&#8221; is an adverbial accusative, so the preposition has been supplied in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="4215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2606><b>sn</b> <i>But pretended to be a stranger</i>. Joseph intends to test his brothers to see if they have changed and have the integrity to be patriarchs of the tribes of Israel. He will do this by putting them in the same situations that they and he were in before. The first test will be to awaken their conscience.</p>
<A NAME="4216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2607><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2608><b>tn</b> The verb is denominative, meaning &#8220;to buy grain&#8221;; the word &#8220;food&#8221; could simply be the direct object, but may also be an adverbial accusative.</p>
<A NAME="4218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2609><b>sn</b> <i>You are spies</i>. Joseph wanted to see how his brothers would react if they were accused of spying.</p>
<A NAME="4219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2610><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to see the nakedness of the land you have come.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2611><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they said to him.&#8221; In context this is best understood as an exclamation.</p>
<A NAME="4221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2612><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he said, &#8216;No, for the nakedness of the land you have come to see.&#8217;&#8221; The order of the introductory clause and the direct discourse has been rearranged in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="4222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2613><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;twelve [were] your servants, brothers [are] we.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2614><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;today.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2615><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the one is not.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2616><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to you, saying.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2617><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[By] the life of Pharaoh.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>As surely as Pharaoh lives</i>. Joseph uses an oath formula to let the brothers know the certainty of what he said. There is some discussion in the commentaries on swearing by the life of Pharaoh, but since the formulation here reflects the Hebrew practice, it would be hard to connect the ideas exactly to Egyptian practices. Joseph did this to make the point in a way that his Hebrew brothers would understand. See M. R. Lehmann, &#8220;Biblical Oaths,&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 81 (1969): 74-92. </p>
<A NAME="4227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2618><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;send from you one and let him take.&#8221; After the imperative, the prefixed verbal form with prefixed <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) indicates purpose.</p>
<A NAME="4228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2619><b>tn</b> The disjunctive clause is here circumstantial-temporal.</p>
<A NAME="4229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2620><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;bound.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2621><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;to see&#8221; have been supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="4231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2622><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the truth [is] with you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2623><b>sn</b> The same Hebrew word is used for Joseph&#8217;s imprisonment in 40:3, 4, 7. There is some mirroring going on in the narrative. The Hebrew word used here (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1507;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">asaf</font>, &#8220;to gather&#8221;) is not normally used in a context like this (for placing someone in prison), but it forms a wordplay on the name Joseph (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1505;&#1461;&#1507;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yosoef</font>) and keeps the comparison working.</p>
<A NAME="4233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2624><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Do this.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2625><b>tn</b> After the preceding imperative, the imperative with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) can, as here, indicate logical sequence.</p>
<A NAME="4235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2626><b>sn</b> <i>For I fear God</i>. Joseph brings God into the picture to awaken his brothers&#8217; consciences. The godly person cares about the welfare of people, whether they live or die. So he will send grain back, but keep one of them in Egypt. This action contrasts with their crime of selling their brother into slavery.</p>
<A NAME="4236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2627><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;bound in the house of your prison.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2628><b>tn</b> The disjunctive clause is circumstantial-temporal.</p>
<A NAME="4238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2629><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[for] the hunger of your households.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2630><b>tn</b> The imperfect here has an injunctive force.</p>
<A NAME="4240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=2631><b>tn</b> After the injunctive imperfect, this imperfect with <i>vav</i> indicates purpose or result.</p>
<A NAME="4241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=2632><b>tn</b> The Niphal form of the verb has the sense of &#8220;to be faithful; to be sure; to be reliable.&#8221; Joseph will test his brothers to see if their words are true.</p>
<A NAME="4242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=2633><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they did so.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2634><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a man to his neighbor.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4244"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=2635><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;we are guilty&#8221;; the Hebrew word can also refer to the effect of being guilty, i.e., &#8220;we are being punished for guilt.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=2636><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the distress of his soul.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4246"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=2637><b>sn</b> The repetition of the Hebrew noun translated <i>distress</i> draws attention to the fact that they regard their present distress as appropriate punishment for their refusal to ignore their brother when he was in distress.</p>
<A NAME="4247"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=2638><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and also his blood, look, it is required.&#8221; God requires compensation, as it were, from those who shed innocent blood (see Gen 9:6). In other words, God exacts punishment for the crime of murder.</p>
<A NAME="4248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=2639><b>tn</b> The disjunctive clause provides supplemental information that is important to the story.</p>
<A NAME="4249"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=2640><b>tn</b> &#8220;was listening.&#8221; The brothers were not aware that Joseph could understand them as they spoke the preceding words in their native language.</p>
<A NAME="4250"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=2641><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for [there was] an interpreter between them.&#8221; On the meaning of the word here translated &#8220;interpreter&#8221; see <i>HALOT</i> 590 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1509;</font> and M. A. Canney, &#8220;The Hebrew <i>melis</i> (Prov IX 12; Gen XLII 2-3),&#8221; <i>AJSL</i> 40 (1923/24): 135-37.</p>
<A NAME="4251"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=2642><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he turned to them and spoke to them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4252"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=2643><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;took Simeon.&#8221; This was probably done at Joseph&#8217;s command, however; the grand vizier of Egypt would not have personally seized a prisoner.</p>
<A NAME="4253"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=2644><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he bound him.&#8221; See the note on the preceding verb &#8220;taken.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4254"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=2645><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they filled.&#8221; The clause appears to be elliptical; one expects &#8220;Joseph gave orders to fill&#8230;and they filled.&#8221; See GKC 386 §120.<i>f</i>.</p>
<A NAME="4255"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=2646><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he did for them so.&#8221; Joseph would appear to be the subject of the singular verb. If the text is retained, the statement seems to be a summary of the preceding, more detailed statement. However, some read the verb as plural, &#8220;and they did for them so.&#8221; In this case the statement indicates that Joseph&#8217;s subordinates carried out his orders. Another alternative is to read the singular verb as passive (with unspecified subject), &#8220;and this was done for them so&#8221; (cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="4256"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=2647><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they went from there.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4257"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=2648><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the one.&#8221; The article indicates that the individual is vivid in the mind of the narrator, yet it is not important to identify him by name.</p>
<A NAME="4258"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=2649><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;at the lodging place.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4259"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=2650><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and look, it [was] in the mouth of his sack.&#8221; By the use of the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>, &#8220;look&#8221;), the narrator invites the reader to look through the eyes of the character and thereby draws attention to the money.</p>
<A NAME="4260"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=2651><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and their heart went out.&#8221; Since this expression is used only here, the exact meaning is unclear. The following statement suggests that it may refer to a sudden loss of emotional strength, so &#8220;They were dismayed&#8221; adequately conveys the meaning (cf. NRSV); NIV has &#8220;Their hearts sank.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4261"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=2652><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they trembled, a man to his neighbor.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4262"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=2653><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;What is this God has done to us?&#8221; The demonstrative pronoun (&#8220;this&#8221;) adds emphasis to the question.</p>
<A NAME="4263"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=2654><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;made us.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4264"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=2655><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;if we were&#8221; have been supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="4265"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=2656><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;twelve [were] we, brothers, sons of our father [are] we.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4266"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=2657><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the one is not.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4267"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=2658><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;today.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4268"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=2659><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;grain&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but has been supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="4269"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=2660><b>tn</b> After the imperative, the cohortative with prefixed <i>vav</i> indicates purpose/result.</p>
<A NAME="4270"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=2661><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;that you are not spies, that you are honest men.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4271"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=2662><b>sn</b> Joseph&#8217;s brothers soften the news considerably, making it sound like Simeon was a guest of Joseph (<i>Leave one of your brothers with me</i>) instead of being bound in prison. They do not mention the threat of death and do not at this time speak of the money in the one sack.</p>
<A NAME="4272"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=2663><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;is not.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4273"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=2664><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;is not.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4274"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=2665><b>tn</b> The nuance of the imperfect verbal form is desiderative here.</p>
<A NAME="4275"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">75</span><note=2666><b>tn</b> The nuance of the imperfect verbal form is permissive here.</p>
<A NAME="4276"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">76</span><note=2667><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my hand.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4277"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=2668><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Jacob) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="4278"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=2669><b>sn</b> The expression <i>he alone is left</i> meant that (so far as Jacob knew) Benjamin was the only surviving child of his mother Rachel.</p>
<A NAME="4279"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">79</span><note=2670><b>sn</b> The expression <i>bring down my gray hair</i> is figurative, using a part for the whole &#8211; they would put Jacob in the grave. But the gray head signifies a long life of worry and trouble.</p>
<A NAME="4280"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">80</span><note=2671><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to Sheol,&#8221; the dwelling place of the dead.</p>
