<A NAME="371"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2263><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the land of the sojournings of his father.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="372"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2264><b>sn</b> The next section begins with the heading <i>This is the account of Jacob</i> in Gen 37:2, so this verse actually forms part of the preceding section as a concluding contrast with Esau and his people. In contrast to all the settled and expanded population of Esau, Jacob was still moving about in the land without a permanent residence and without kings. Even if the Edomite king list was added later (as the reference to kings in Israel suggests), its placement here in contrast to Jacob and his descendants is important. Certainly the text deals with Esau before dealing with Jacob &#8211; that is the pattern. But the detail is so great in chap. 36 that the contrast cannot be missed.</p>
<A NAME="373"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2265><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a son of seventeen years.&#8221; The word &#8220;son&#8221; is in apposition to the name &#8220;Joseph.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="374"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2266><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;tending&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;shepherding&#8221; or &#8220;feeding.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="375"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2267><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;a helper.&#8221; The significance of this statement is unclear. It may mean &#8220;now the lad was with,&#8221; or it may suggest Joseph was like a servant to them.</p>
<A NAME="376"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2268><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he [was] a young man with the sons of Bilhah and with the sons of Zilpah, the wives of his father.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="377"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2269><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;their bad report.&#8221; The pronoun is an objective genitive, specifying that the bad or damaging report was about the brothers.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Some interpreters portray Joseph as a tattletale for bringing back <i>a bad report about them</i> [i.e., his brothers], but the entire Joseph story has some of the characteristics of wisdom literature. Joseph is presented in a good light &#8211; not because he was perfect, but because the narrative is showing how wisdom rules. In light of that, this section portrays Joseph as faithful to his father in little things, even though unpopular &#8211; and so he will eventually be given authority over greater things.</p>
<A NAME="378"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2270><b>tn</b> The disjunctive clause provides supplemental information vital to the story. It explains in part the brothers&#8217; animosity toward Joseph.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The statement <i>Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons</i> brings forward a motif that played an important role in the family of Isaac &#8211; parental favoritism. Jacob surely knew what that had done to him and his brother Esau, and to his own family. But now he showers affection on Rachel&#8217;s son Joseph.</p>
<A NAME="379"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2271><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a son of old age was he to him.&#8221; This expression means &#8220;a son born to him when he [i.e., Jacob] was old.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2272><b>tn</b> It is not clear what this tunic was like, because the meaning of the Hebrew word that describes it is uncertain. The idea that it was a coat of many colors comes from the Greek translation of the OT. An examination of cognate terms in Semitic suggests it was either a coat or tunic with long sleeves (cf. NEB, NRSV), or a tunic that was richly embroidered (cf. NIV). It set Joseph apart as the favored one.</p>
<A NAME="3711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2273><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his&#8221;; the referent (Joseph) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2274><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;of his brothers.&#8221; This is redundant in contemporary English and has been replaced in the translation by the pronoun &#8220;them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2275><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;him&#8221;; the referent (Joseph) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2276><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;speak to him for peace.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2277><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he&#8221;; the referent (Joseph) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2278><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;dreamed a dream.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2279><b>sn</b> Some interpreters see Joseph as gloating over his brothers, but the text simply says <i>he told his brothers about it</i> (i.e., the dream). The text gives no warrant for interpreting his manner as arrogant or condescending. It seems normal that he would share a dream with the family.</p>
<A NAME="3718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2280><b>tn</b> The construction uses a hendiadys, &#8220;they added to hate,&#8221; meaning they hated him even more.</p>
<A NAME="3719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2281><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;hear this dream which I dreamed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2282><b>tn</b> All three clauses in this dream report begin with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿhinneh</font>, &#8220;and look&#8221;), which lends vividness to the report. This is represented in the translation by the expression &#8220;there we were.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3721"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2283><b>tn</b> The verb means &#8220;to bow down to the ground.&#8221; It is used to describe worship and obeisance to masters.</p>
<A NAME="3722"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2284><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Ruling, will you rule over us, or reigning, will you reign over us?&#8221; The statement has a poetic style, with the two questions being in synonymous parallelism. Both verbs in this statement are preceded by the infinitive absolute, which lends emphasis. It is as if Joseph&#8217;s brothers said, &#8220;You don&#8217;t really think you will rule over us, do you? You don&#8217;t really think you will have dominion over us, do you?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2285><b>tn</b> This construction is identical to the one in Gen 37:5.</p>
<A NAME="3724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2286><b>sn</b> The response of Joseph&#8217;s brothers is understandable, given what has already been going on in the family. But here there is a hint of uneasiness &#8211; they hated him <i>because of his dream and because of his words</i>. The dream bothered them, as well as his telling them. And their words in the rhetorical question are ironic, for this is exactly what would happen. The dream was God&#8217;s way of revealing it.</p>
<A NAME="3725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2287><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And he dreamed yet another dream.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3726"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2288><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he said, &#8216;Look.&#8217;&#8221; The order of the introductory clause and the direct discourse have been rearranged in the translation for stylistic reasons. Both clauses of the dream report begin with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>, &#8220;look&#8221;), which lends vividness to the report.</p>
<A NAME="3727"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2289><b>sn</b> The question <i>What is this dream that you had? </i>expresses Jacob&#8217;s dismay at what he perceives to be Joseph&#8217;s audacity.</p>
<A NAME="3728"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2290><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Coming, will we come, I and your mother and your brothers, to bow down to you to the ground?&#8221; The verb &#8220;come&#8221; is preceded by the infinitive absolute, which lends emphasis. It is as if Jacob said, &#8220;You don&#8217;t really think we will come&#8230;to bow down&#8230;do you?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2291><b>sn</b> Joseph&#8217;s brothers were already <i>jealous of him</i>, but this made it even worse. Such jealousy easily leads to action, as the next episode in the story shows. Yet dreams were considered a form of revelation, and their jealousy was not only of the favoritism of their father, but of the dreams. This is why Jacob kept the matter in mind.</p>
<A NAME="3730"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2292><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;kept the word.&#8221; The referent of the Hebrew term &#8220;word&#8221; has been specified as &#8220;what Joseph said&#8221; in the translation for clarity, and the words &#8220;in mind&#8221; have been supplied for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="3731"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2293><b>tn</b> The text uses an interrogative clause: &#8220;Are not your brothers,&#8221; which means &#8220;your brothers are.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="3732"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2294><b>sn</b> With these words Joseph is depicted here as an obedient son who is ready to do what his father commands.</p>
<A NAME="3733"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2295><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he said, &#8216;Here I am.&#8217;&#8221; The referent of the pronoun &#8220;he&#8221; (Joseph) has been specified in the translation for clarity, and the order of the introductory clause and the direct discourse has been rearranged for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="3734"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2296><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Jacob) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3735"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2297><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;see.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3736"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2298><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;peace.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3737"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2299><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Jacob) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3738"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2300><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he [i.e., Joseph] went to Shechem.&#8221; The referent (Joseph) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3739"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2301><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and a man found him and look, he was wandering in the field.&#8221; By the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿhinneh</font>, &#8220;and look&#8221;), the narrator invites the reader to see the action through this unnamed man&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<A NAME="3740"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=2302><b>tn</b> The imperative in this sentence has more of the nuance of a request than a command.</p>
<A NAME="3741"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=2303><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they traveled from this place.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3742"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=2304><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they&#8221;; the referent (Joseph&#8217;s brothers) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3743"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2305><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Look, this master of dreams is coming.&#8221; The brothers&#8217; words have a sarcastic note and indicate that they resent his dreams.</p>
<A NAME="3744"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=2306><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word can sometimes carry the nuance &#8220;evil,&#8221; but when used of an animal it refers to a dangerous wild animal.</p>
<A NAME="3745"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=2307><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;what his dreams will be.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3746"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=2308><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;him&#8221;; the referent (Joseph) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3747"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=2309><b>sn</b> <i>From their hands</i>. The instigators of this plot may have been the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah (see v. 2).</p>
<A NAME="3748"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=2310><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3749"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=2311><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;we must not strike him down [with respect to] life.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3750"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=2312><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Reuben said to them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3751"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=2313><b>sn</b> The verbs translated <i>shed</i>, <i>throw</i>, and <i>lay</i> sound alike in Hebrew; the repetition of similar sounds draws attention to Reuben&#8217;s words.</p>
<A NAME="3752"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=2314><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;Reuben said this&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text, but have been supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="3753"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=2315><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;him&#8221;; the referent (Joseph) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3754"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=2316><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from their hands&#8221; (cf. v. 21). This expression has been translated as &#8220;them&#8221; here for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="3755"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=2317><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Joseph&#8221;; the proper name has been replaced by the pronoun (&#8220;him&#8221;) in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="3756"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=2318><b>tn</b> The disjunctive clause gives supplemental information that helps the reader or hearer to picture what happened.</p>
<A NAME="3757"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=2319><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lifted up their eyes.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="3759"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=2321><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and their camels were carrying spices, balm, and myrrh, going to go down to Egypt.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="3761"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=2323><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;listened.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3762"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=2324><b>sn</b> On the close relationship between <i>Ishmaelites</i> (v. 25) and <i>Midianites</i>, see Judg 8:24.</p>
<A NAME="3763"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=2325><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they drew and they lifted up.&#8221; The referent (Joseph&#8217;s brothers) has been specified in the translation for clarity; otherwise the reader might assume the Midianites had pulled Joseph from the cistern (but cf. NAB).</p>
<A NAME="3764"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=2326><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Joseph&#8221; (both here and in the following clause); the proper name has been replaced both times by the pronoun &#8220;him&#8221; in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="3765"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=2327><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they&#8221;; the referent (the Ishmaelites) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>

<A NAME="3767"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=2329><b>sn</b> It was with two young goats that Jacob deceived his father (Gen 27:9); now with a <i>young goat</i> his sons continue the deception that dominates this family.</p>
<A NAME="3768"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=2330><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they sent the special tunic and they brought [it] to their father.&#8221; The text as it stands is problematic. It sounds as if they sent the tunic on ahead and then came and brought it to their father. Some emend the second verb to a Qal form and read &#8220;and they came.&#8221; In this case, they sent the tunic on ahead.</p>
<A NAME="3769"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=2331><b>sn</b> <i>A wild animal has eaten him</i>. Jacob draws this conclusion on his own without his sons actually having to lie with their words (see v. 20). Dipping the tunic in the goat&#8217;s blood was the only deception needed.</p>
<A NAME="3770"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=2332><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and put sackcloth on his loins.&#8221;</p>

It is likely that the MT is corrupt at this point, with the letter <i>yod</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font>) being accidentally omitted. The LXX, Vulgate, Samaritan Pentateuch, and Syriac read &#8220;Midianites&#8221; here. Some prefer to read &#8220;Medanites&#8221; both here and in v. 28, but Judg 8:24, which identifies the Midianites and Ishmaelites, favors the reading &#8220;Midianites.&#8221;</p>
