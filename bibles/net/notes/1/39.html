<A NAME="391"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2396><b>tn</b> The disjunctive clause resumes the earlier narrative pertaining to Joseph by recapitulating the event described in 37:36. The perfect verbal form is given a past perfect translation to restore the sequence of the narrative for the reader.</p>
<A NAME="392"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2397><b>sn</b> <i>Captain of the guard</i>. See the note on this phrase in Gen 37:36.</p>
<A NAME="393"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2398><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from the hand of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="394"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2399><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he was a prosperous man.&#8221; This does not mean that Joseph became wealthy, but that he was successful in what he was doing, or making progress in his situation (see 24:21).</p>
<A NAME="395"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2400><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he was.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="396"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2401><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text adds &#8220;in his hand,&#8221; a phrase not included in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="397"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2402><b>sn</b> The Hebrew verb translated <i>became his personal attendant</i> refers to higher domestic service, usually along the lines of a personal attendant. Here Joseph is made the household steward, a position well-attested in Egyptian literature.</p>
<A NAME="398"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2403><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;him&#8221;; the referent (Joseph) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="399"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2404><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;put into his hand.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3910"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2405><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and it was from then.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2406><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Potiphar) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2407><b>sn</b> The Hebrew word translated <i>blessed</i> carries the idea of enrichment, prosperity, success. It is the way believers describe success at the hand of God. The text illustrates the promise made to Abraham that whoever blesses his descendants will be blessed (Gen 12:1-3).</p>
<A NAME="3913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2408><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the house and in the field.&#8221; The word &#8220;both&#8221; has been supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="3914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2409><b>sn</b> The passage gives us a good picture of Joseph as a young man who was responsible and faithful, both to his master and to his God. This happened within a very short time of his being sold into Egypt. It undermines the view that Joseph was a liar, a tattletale, and an arrogant adolescent.</p>
<A NAME="3915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2410><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Potiphar) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2411><b>sn</b> The Hebrew verb translated <i>left</i> indicates he relinquished the care of it to Joseph. This is stronger than what was said earlier. Apparently Potiphar had come to trust Joseph so much that he knew it was in better care with Joseph than with anyone else.</p>
<A NAME="3917"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2412><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;hand.&#8221; This is a metonymy for being under the control or care of Joseph.</p>
<A NAME="3918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2413><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;did not know.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2414><b>sn</b> The expression <i>except the food he ate</i> probably refers to Potiphar&#8217;s private affairs and should not be limited literally to what he ate.</p>
<A NAME="3920"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2415><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;handsome of form and handsome of appearance.&#8221; The same Hebrew expressions were used in Gen 29:17 for Rachel.</p>
<A NAME="3921"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2416><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;she lifted up her eyes toward,&#8221; an expression that emphasizes her deliberate and careful scrutiny of him.</p>
<A NAME="3922"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2417><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lie with me.&#8221; Here the expression &#8220;lie with&#8221; is a euphemism for sexual intercourse.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The story of Joseph and Potiphar&#8217;s wife has long been connected with the wisdom warnings about the strange woman who tries to seduce the young man with her boldness and directness (see Prov 5-7, especially 7:6-27). This is part of the literary background of the story of Joseph that gives it a wisdom flavor. See G. von Rad, <i>God at Work in Israel</i>, 19-35; and G. W. Coats, &#8220;The Joseph Story and Ancient Wisdom: A Reappraisal,&#8221; <i>CBQ </i>35 (1973): 285-97. </p>
<A NAME="3923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2418><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3924"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2419><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;know.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2420><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;here&#8221; has been supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="3926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2421><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;hand.&#8221; This is a metonymy for being under the control or care of Joseph.</p>
<A NAME="3927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2422><b>tn</b> The nuance of potential imperfect fits this context.</p>
<A NAME="3928"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2423><b>tn</b> The verse begins with the temporal indicator, followed by the infinitive construct with the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kÿ</font>). This clause could therefore be taken as temporal.</p>
<A NAME="3929"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2424><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;listen to.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3930"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2425><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to lie beside her to be with her.&#8221; Here the expression &#8220;to lie beside&#8221; is a euphemism for sexual intercourse.</p>
<A NAME="3931"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2426><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and it was about this day.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3932"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2427><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the men of the house.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3933"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2428><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he fled and he went out.&#8221; The construction emphasizes the point that Joseph got out of there quickly.</p>
<A NAME="3934"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2429><b>sn</b> For discussion of this episode, see A. M. Honeyman, &#8220;The Occasion of Joseph&#8217;s Temptation,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 2 (1952): 85-87.</p>
<A NAME="3935"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2430><b>tn</b> The verb has no expressed subject, and so it could be treated as a passive (&#8220;a Hebrew man was brought in&#8221;; cf. NIV). But it is clear from the context that her husband brought Joseph into the household, so Potiphar is the apparent referent here. Thus the translation supplies &#8220;my husband&#8221; as the referent of the unspecified pronominal subject of the verb (cf. NEB, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="3936"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2431><b>sn</b> <i>A Hebrew man</i>. Potiphar&#8217;s wife raises the ethnic issue when talking to her servants about what their boss had done.</p>
<A NAME="3937"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2432><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to make fun of us.&#8221; The verb translated &#8220;to humiliate us&#8221; here means to hold something up for ridicule, or to toy with something harmfully. Attempted rape would be such an activity, for it would hold the victim in contempt.</p>
<A NAME="3938"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2433><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he came to me to lie with me.&#8221; Here the expression &#8220;lie with&#8221; is a euphemism for sexual intercourse.</p>
<A NAME="3939"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2434><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and I cried out with a loud voice.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3940"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=2435><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;that I raised.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3941"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=2436><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and she spoke to him according to these words, saying.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3942"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=2437><b>sn</b> <i>That Hebrew slave</i>. Now, when speaking to her husband, Potiphar&#8217;s wife refers to Joseph as a Hebrew slave, a very demeaning description.</p>
<A NAME="3943"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2438><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;came to me to make fun of me.&#8221; The statement needs no explanation because of the connotations of &#8220;came to me&#8221; and &#8220;to make fun of me.&#8221; See the note on the expression &#8220;humiliate us&#8221; in v. 14.</p>
<A NAME="3944"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=2439><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and when his master heard the words of his wife which she spoke to him, saying.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3945"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=2440><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;according to these words.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3946"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=2441><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;did to me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3947"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=2442><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his anger burned.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3948"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=2443><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the house of roundness,&#8221; suggesting that the prison might have been a fortress or citadel.</p>
<A NAME="3949"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=2444><b>sn</b> The story of Joseph is filled with cycles and repetition: He has two dreams (chap. 37), he interprets two dreams in prison (chap. 40) and the two dreams of Pharaoh (chap. 41), his brothers make two trips to see him (chaps. 42-43), and here, for the second time (see 37:24), he is imprisoned for no good reason, with only his coat being used as evidence. For further discussion see H. Jacobsen, &#8220;A Legal Note on Potiphar&#8217;s Wife,&#8221; <i>HTR</i> 69 (1976): 177.</p>
<A NAME="3950"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=2445><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he extended to him loyal love.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3951"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=2446><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the chief jailer&#8221; (also in the following verses).</p>
<A NAME="3952"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=2447><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all which they were doing there, he was doing.&#8221; This probably means that Joseph was in charge of everything that went on in the prison.</p>
<A NAME="3953"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=2448><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;was not looking at anything.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3954"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=2449><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his&#8221;; the referent (Joseph) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
