<A NAME="1714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=893><b>sn</b> <i>Your name will be Abraham</i>. The renaming of Abram was a sign of confirmation to the patriarch. Every time the name was used it would be a reminder of God&#8217;s promise. &#8220;Abram&#8221; means &#8220;exalted father,&#8221; probably referring to Abram&#8217;s father Terah. The name looks to the past; Abram came from noble lineage. The name &#8220;Abraham&#8221; is a dialectical variant of the name Abram. But its significance is in the wordplay with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1489;&#1470;&#1492;&#1458;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">av-hamon</font>, &#8220;the father of a multitude,&#8221; which sounds like <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">avraham</font>, &#8220;Abraham&#8221;). The new name would be a reminder of God&#8217;s intention to make Abraham the father of a multitude. For a general discussion of renaming, see O. Eissfeldt, &#8220;Renaming in the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>Words and Meanings</i>, 70-83.</p>
