<A NAME="177"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=886><b>tn</b> Following the imperative, the cohortative indicates consequence. If Abram is blameless, then the <sc>Lord will ratify the covenant. Earlier the <sc>Lord ratified part of his promise to Abram (see Gen 15:18-21), guaranteeing him that his descendants would live in the land. But the expanded form of the promise, which includes numerous descendants and eternal possession of the land, remains to be ratified. This expanded form of the promise is in view here (see vv. 2b, 4-8). See the note at Gen 15:18 and R. B. Chisholm, &#8220;Evidence from Genesis,&#8221; <i>A Case for Premillennialism</i>, 35-54.</p>
