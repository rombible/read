<A NAME="176"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=885><b>tn</b> There are two imperatives here: &#8220;walk&#8230;and be blameless [or &#8220;perfect&#8221;].&#8221; The second imperative may be purely sequential (see the translation) or consequential: &#8220;walk before me and then you will be blameless.&#8221; How one interprets the sequence depends on the meaning of &#8220;walk before&#8221;: (1) If it simply refers in a neutral way to serving the <sc>Lord, then the second imperative is likely sequential. (2) But if it has a positive moral connotation (&#8220;serve me faithfully&#8221;), then the second imperative probably indicates purpose (or result). For other uses of the idiom see 1 Sam 2:30, 35 and 12:2 (where it occurs twice).</p>
