<A NAME="2734"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1612><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;so that your soul may bless me.&#8221; These words, though not reported by Rebekah to Jacob (see v. 7) accurately reflect what Isaac actually said to Esau (see v. 4). Perhaps Jacob knew more than Rebekah realized, but it is more likely that this was an idiom for sincere blessing with which Jacob was familiar. At any rate, his use of the precise wording was a nice, convincing touch.</p>
