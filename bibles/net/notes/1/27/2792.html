<A NAME="2792"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">92</span><note=1670><b>tn</b> Some translate the Hebrew term &#8220;Heth&#8221; as &#8220;Hittites&#8221; here (see also Gen 23:3), but this gives the impression that these people were the classical Hittites of Anatolia. However, there is no known connection between these sons of Heth, apparently a Canaanite group (see Gen 10:15), and the Hittites of Asia Minor. See H. A. Hoffner, Jr., &#8220;Hittites,&#8221; <i>Peoples of the Old Testament World</i>, 152-53.</p>
