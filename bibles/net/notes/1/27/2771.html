<A NAME="2771"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=1649><b>sn</b> <i>He has tripped me up</i>. When originally given, the name Jacob was a play on the word &#8220;heel&#8221; (see Gen 25:26). The name (since it is a verb) probably means something like &#8220;may he protect,&#8221; that is, as a rearguard, dogging the heels. This name was probably chosen because of the immediate association with the incident of grabbing the heel. Esau gives the name &#8220;Jacob&#8221; a negative connotation here, the meaning &#8220;to trip up; to supplant.&#8221;</p>
