<A NAME="1326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=703><b>sn</b> The narrative places emphasis on what Lot saw so that the reader can appreciate how it aroused his desire for the best land. It makes allusion to <i>the garden of the </i><sc>Lord and to <i>the land of Egypt</i> for comparison. Just as the tree in the garden of Eden had awakened Eve&#8217;s desire, so the fertile valley attracted Lot. And just as certain memories of Egypt would cause the Israelites to want to turn back and abandon the trek to the promised land, so Lot headed for the good life.</p>
