<A NAME="1334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=711><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lift up your eyes and see.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Look</i>. Earlier Lot &#8220;looked up&#8221; (v. 10), but here Abram is told by God to do so. The repetition of the expression (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;lift up the eyes&#8221;) here underscores how the <sc>Lord will have the last word and actually do for Abram what Abram did for Lot &#8211; give him the land. It seems to be one of the ways that God rewards faith.</p>
