<A NAME="1332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=709><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;wicked and sinners against the <sc>Lord exceedingly.&#8221; The description of the sinfulness of the Sodomites is very emphatic. First, two nouns are used to form a hendiadys: &#8220;wicked and sinners&#8221; means &#8220;wicked sinners,&#8221; the first word becoming adjectival. The text is saying these were no ordinary sinners; they were wicked sinners, the type that cause pain for others. Then to this phrase is added &#8220;against the <sc>Lord,&#8221; stressing their violation of the laws of heaven and their culpability. Finally, to this is added <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1488;&#1465;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">od</font>, &#8220;exceedingly,&#8221; translated here as &#8220;extremely&#8221;).</p>
