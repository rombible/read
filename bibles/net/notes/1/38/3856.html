<A NAME="3856"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=2395><b>sn</b> Perhaps the child was named <i>Zerah</i> because of the <i>scarlet thread</i>. Though the Hebrew word used for &#8220;scarlet thread&#8221; in v. 28 is not related to the name Zerah, there is a related root in Babylonian and western Aramaic that means &#8220;scarlet&#8221; or &#8220;scarlet thread.&#8221; In Hebrew the name appears to be derived from a root meaning &#8220;to shine.&#8221; The name could have originally meant something like &#8220;shining one&#8221; or &#8220;God has shined.&#8221; Zerah became the head of a tribe (Num 26:20) from whom Achan descended (Josh 7:1).</p>
