<A NAME="3841"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=2380><b>sn</b> The Hebrew noun translated &#8220;cult prostitute&#8221; is derived from a verb meaning &#8220;to be set apart; to be distinct.&#8221; Thus the term refers to a woman who did not marry, but was dedicated to temple service as a cult prostitute. The masculine form of this noun is used for male cult prostitutes. Judah thought he had gone to an ordinary prostitute (v. 15); but Hirah went looking for a cult prostitute, perhaps because it had been a sheep-shearing festival. For further discussion see E. M. Yamauchi, &#8220;Cultic Prostitution,&#8221; <i>Orient and Occident </i>(AOAT), 213-23.</p>
