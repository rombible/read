<A NAME="3850"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=2389><b>tn</b> Traditionally &#8220;more righteous&#8221;; cf. NCV, NRSV, NLT &#8220;more in the right.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>She is more upright than I</i>. Judah had been irresponsible and unfaithful to his duty to see that the family line continued through the levirate marriage of his son Shelah. Tamar fought for her right to be the mother of Judah&#8217;s line. When she was not given Shelah and Judah&#8217;s wife died, she took action on her own to ensure that the line did not die out. Though deceptive, it was a desperate and courageous act. For Tamar it was within her rights; she did nothing that the law did not entitle her to do. But for Judah it was wrong because he thought he was going to a prostitute.
