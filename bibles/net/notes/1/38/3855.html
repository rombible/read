<A NAME="3855"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=2394><b>sn</b> The name <i>Perez</i> means &#8220;he who breaks through,&#8221; referring to Perez reaching out his hand at birth before his brother was born. The naming signified the completion of Tamar&#8217;s struggle and also depicted the destiny of the tribe of Perez who later became dominant (Gen 46:12 and Num 26:20). Judah and his brothers had sold Joseph into slavery, thinking they could thwart God&#8217;s plan that the elder brothers should serve the younger. God demonstrated that principle through these births in Judah&#8217;s own family, affirming that the elder will serve the younger, and that Joseph&#8217;s leadership could not so easily be set aside. See J. Goldin, &#8220;The Youngest Son; or, Where Does Genesis 38 Belong?&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 96 (1977): 27-44.</p>
