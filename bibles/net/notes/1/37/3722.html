<A NAME="3722"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2284><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Ruling, will you rule over us, or reigning, will you reign over us?&#8221; The statement has a poetic style, with the two questions being in synonymous parallelism. Both verbs in this statement are preceded by the infinitive absolute, which lends emphasis. It is as if Joseph&#8217;s brothers said, &#8220;You don&#8217;t really think you will rule over us, do you? You don&#8217;t really think you will have dominion over us, do you?&#8221;</p>
