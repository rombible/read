<A NAME="372"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2264><b>sn</b> The next section begins with the heading <i>This is the account of Jacob</i> in Gen 37:2, so this verse actually forms part of the preceding section as a concluding contrast with Esau and his people. In contrast to all the settled and expanded population of Esau, Jacob was still moving about in the land without a permanent residence and without kings. Even if the Edomite king list was added later (as the reference to kings in Israel suggests), its placement here in contrast to Jacob and his descendants is important. Certainly the text deals with Esau before dealing with Jacob &#8211; that is the pattern. But the detail is so great in chap. 36 that the contrast cannot be missed.</p>
