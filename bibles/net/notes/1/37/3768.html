<A NAME="3768"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=2330><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they sent the special tunic and they brought [it] to their father.&#8221; The text as it stands is problematic. It sounds as if they sent the tunic on ahead and then came and brought it to their father. Some emend the second verb to a Qal form and read &#8220;and they came.&#8221; In this case, they sent the tunic on ahead.</p>
