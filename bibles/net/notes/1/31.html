<A NAME="312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1882><b>sn</b> The Hebrew word translated &#8220;gotten rich&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">cavod</font>) has the basic idea of &#8220;weight.&#8221; If one is heavy with possessions, then that one is wealthy (13:2). Abraham, Jacob, and Joseph all became wealthy when they left the promised land. Jacob&#8217;s wealth foreshadows what will happen to Israel when they leave the land of Egypt (Exod 12:35-38).</p>
<A NAME="313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1883><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and from that which belonged to our father he has gained all this wealth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1884><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Jacob saw the face of Laban, and look, he was not with him as formerly.&#8221; Jacob knew from the expression on Laban&#8217;s face that his attitude toward him had changed &#8211; Jacob had become <i>persona non grata</i>.</p>
<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1885><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;ancestors&#8221; (so NRSV), although the only &#8220;ancestors&#8221; Jacob had there were his grandfather Abraham and his father Isaac.</p>

<A NAME="3112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1892><b>tn</b> This rare verb means &#8220;to make a fool of&#8221; someone. It involves deceiving someone so that their public reputation suffers (see Exod 8:25).</p>
<A NAME="3113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1893><b>tn</b> In the protasis (&#8220;if&#8221; section) of this conditional clause, the imperfect verbal form has a customary nuance &#8211; whatever <i>he would say</i> worked to Jacob&#8217;s benefit.</p>
<A NAME="3114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1894><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;speckled&#8221; (twice this verse). The word &#8220;animals&#8221; (after the first occurrence of &#8220;speckled&#8221;) and &#8220;offspring&#8221; (after the second) have been supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons. The same two terms (&#8220;animals&#8221; and &#8220;offspring&#8221;) have been supplied after the two occurrences of &#8220;streaked&#8221; later in this verse.</p>
<A NAME="3115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1895><b>tn</b> The sentence begins with the temporal indicator, &#8220;and it happened at the time of.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="3121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1901><b>sn</b> <i>You anointed the sacred stone</i>. In Gen 28:18 the text simply reported that Jacob poured oil on top of the stone. Now that pouring is interpreted by the <sc>Lord as an anointing. Jacob had consecrated the place.</p>
<A NAME="3122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1902><b>sn</b> <i>And made a vow to me</i>. The second clause reminds Jacob of the vow he made to the <sc>Lord when he anointed the stone (Gen 28:20-22). God is now going to take him back to the land, and so he will have to fulfill his vow.</p>
<A NAME="3123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1903><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;arise, leave!&#8221; The first imperative draws attention to the need for immediate action.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Leave this land immediately</i>. The decision to leave was a wise one in view of the changed attitude in Laban and his sons. But more than that, it was the will of God. Jacob needed to respond to God&#8217;s call &#8211; the circumstances simply made it easier.</p>
<A NAME="3124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1904><b>tn</b> The two nouns may form a hendiadys, meaning &#8220;a share in the inheritance&#8221; or &#8220;a portion to inherit.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1905><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he devoured, even devouring.&#8221; The infinitive absolute (following the finite verb here) is used for emphasis.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>He sold us and&#8230;wasted our money</i>. The precise nature of Rachel&#8217;s and Leah&#8217;s complaint is not entirely clear. Since Jacob had to work to pay for them, they probably mean that their father has cheated Jacob and therefore cheated them as well. See M. Burrows, &#8220;The Complaint of Laban&#8217;s Daughters,&#8221; <i>JAOS</i> 57 (1937): 250-76. </p>
<A NAME="3126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1906><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;our money.&#8221; The word &#8220;money&#8221; is used figuratively here; it means the price paid for Leah and Rachel. A literal translation (&#8220;our money&#8221;) makes it sound as if Laban wasted money that belonged to Rachel and Leah, rather than the money paid for them.</p>
<A NAME="3127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1907><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Jacob arose and he lifted up his sons and his wives on to the camels.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1908><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;drove,&#8221; but this is subject to misunderstanding in contemporary English.</p>
<A NAME="3129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1909><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he led away all his cattle and all his moveable property which he acquired, the cattle he obtained, which he acquired in Paddan Aram to go to Isaac his father to the land of Canaan.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3130"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1910><b>tn</b> This disjunctive clause (note the pattern conjunction + subject + verb) introduces a new scene. In the English translation it may be subordinated to the following clause.</p>
<A NAME="3131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1911><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;household gods.&#8221; Some translations merely transliterate the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1508;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tÿrafim</font>) as &#8220;teraphim,&#8221; which apparently refers to household idols. Some contend that possession of these idols guaranteed the right of inheritance, but it is more likely that they were viewed simply as protective deities. See M. Greenberg, &#8220;Another Look at Rachel&#8217;s Theft of the Teraphim,&#8221; <i>JBL </i>81 (1962): 239-48.</p>
<A NAME="3132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1912><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;stole the heart of,&#8221; an expression which apparently means &#8220;to deceive.&#8221; The repetition of the verb &#8220;to steal&#8221; shows that Jacob and Rachel are kindred spirits. Any thought that Laban would have resigned himself to their departure was now out of the question.</p>
<A NAME="3133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1913><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fleeing,&#8221; which reflects Jacob&#8217;s viewpoint.</p>

<A NAME="3145"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1925><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lest you speak with Jacob from good to evil.&#8221; The precise meaning of the expression, which occurs only here and in v. 29, is uncertain. Since Laban proceeded to speak to Jacob at length, it cannot mean to maintain silence. Nor does it seem to be a prohibition against criticism (see vv. 26-30). Most likely it refers to a formal pronouncement, whether it be a blessing or a curse. Laban was to avoid saying anything to Jacob that would be intended to enhance him or to harm him.</p>
<A NAME="3146"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1926><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Jacob pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban pitched with his brothers in the hill country of Gilead.&#8221; The juxtaposition of disjunctive clauses (note the pattern conjunction + subject + verb in both clauses) indicates synchronism of action.</p>
<A NAME="3147"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1927><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and you have stolen my heart.&#8221; This expression apparently means &#8220;to deceive&#8221; (see v. 20).</p>

<A NAME="3149"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1929><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Why did you hide in order to flee?&#8221; The verb &#8220;hide&#8221; and the infinitive &#8220;to flee&#8221; form a hendiadys, the infinitive becoming the main verb and the other the adverb: &#8220;flee secretly.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3150"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1930><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and steal me.&#8221;</p>

For this reason the words &#8220;I left secretly&#8221; are supplied in the translation to indicate the connection to Laban&#8217;s earlier question in v. 27. Additionally the order of the introductory clause and the direct discourse have been rearranged in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>

The words &#8220;for every missing animal&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarity; the following clause in Hebrew, &#8220;stolen by day or stolen by night,&#8221; probably means &#8220;stolen by wild beasts&#8221; and refers to the same animals &#8220;torn by wild beasts&#8221; in the previous clause, although it may refer to animals stolen by people.

Neither Laban nor Jacob felt safe with each other, and so they agreed to go their separate ways, trusting the <sc>Lord to keep watch at the border.

<A NAME="31112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">112</span><note=1992><b>tn</b> <i>The God of Abraham and the god of Nahor</i>. The Hebrew verb translated &#8220;judge&#8221; is plural, suggesting that Laban has more than one &#8220;god&#8221; in mind. The Samaritan Pentateuch and the LXX, apparently in an effort to make the statement monotheistic, have a singular verb. In this case one could translate, &#8220;May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.&#8221; However, Laban had a polytheistic world view, as evidenced by his possession of household idols (cf. 31:19). The translation uses &#8220;God&#8221; when referring to Abraham&#8217;s God, for Genesis makes it clear that Abraham worshiped the one true God. It employs &#8220;god&#8221; when referring to Nahor&#8217;s god, for in the Hebrew text Laban refers to a different god here, probably one of the local deities.</p>
