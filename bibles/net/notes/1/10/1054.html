<A NAME="1054"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=550><b>tn</b> Several commentators prefer to reverse the order of the words to put this clause after the next word, since the Philistines came from Crete (where the Caphtorites lived). But the table may suggest migration rather than lineage, and the Philistines, like the Israelites, came through the Nile Delta region of Egypt. For further discussion of the origin and migration of the Philistines, see D. M. Howard, &#8220;Philistines,&#8221; <i>Peoples of the Old Testament World</i>, 232.</p>
