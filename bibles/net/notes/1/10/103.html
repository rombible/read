<A NAME="103"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=499><b>tn</b> It appears that the Table of Nations is a composite of at least two ancient sources: Some sections begin with the phrase &#8220;the sons of&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bÿne</font>) while other sections use &#8220;begot&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yalad</font>). It may very well be that the &#8220;sons of&#8221; list was an old, &#8220;bare bones&#8221; list that was retained in the family records, while the &#8220;begot&#8221; sections were editorial inserts by the writer of Genesis, reflecting his special interests. See A. P. Ross, &#8220;The Table of Nations in Genesis 10 &#8211; Its Structure,&#8221; <i>BSac</i> 137 (1980): 340-53; idem, &#8220;The Table of Nations in Genesis 10 &#8211; Its Content,&#8221; <i>BSac</i> 138 (1981): 22-34.</p>
