<A NAME="1075"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">75</span><note=571><b>sn</b> <i>Asshur</i> is the name for the Assyrians. Asshur was the region in which Nimrod expanded his power (see v. 11, where the name is also mentioned). When names appear in both sections of a genealogical list, it probably means that there were both Hamites and Shemites living in that region in antiquity, especially if the name is a place name.</p>
