<A NAME="1019"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=515><b>tc</b> Most of the MT <sc>mss read &#8220;Dodanim&#8221; here, but 1 Chr 1:7 has &#8220;Rodanim,&#8221; perhaps referring to the island of Rhodes. But the <i>Qere</i> reading in 1 Chr 1:7 suggests &#8220;Dodanim.&#8221; Dodona is one of the most ancient and revered spots in ancient Greece.</p>
