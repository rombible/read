If the text is retained, the statement seems to be a summary of the preceding, more detailed statement. However, some read the verb as plural, &#8220;and they did for them so.&#8221; In this case the statement indicates that Joseph&#8217;s subordinates carried out his orders. Another alternative is to read the singular verb as passive (with unspecified subject), &#8220;and this was done for them so&#8221; (cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV).</p>
