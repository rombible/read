<A NAME="4260"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=2651><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and their heart went out.&#8221; Since this expression is used only here, the exact meaning is unclear. The following statement suggests that it may refer to a sudden loss of emotional strength, so &#8220;They were dismayed&#8221; adequately conveys the meaning (cf. NRSV); NIV has &#8220;Their hearts sank.&#8221;</p>
