<A NAME="4235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2626><b>sn</b> <i>For I fear God</i>. Joseph brings God into the picture to awaken his brothers&#8217; consciences. The godly person cares about the welfare of people, whether they live or die. So he will send grain back, but keep one of them in Egypt. This action contrasts with their crime of selling their brother into slavery.</p>
