<A NAME="161"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=832><b>tn</b> The disjunctive clause signals the beginning of a new episode in the story.</p>
<A NAME="162"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=833><b>sn</b> On the cultural background of the story of Sarai&#8217;s childlessness see J. Van Seters, &#8220;The Problem of Childlessness in Near Eastern Law and the Patriarchs of Israel,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 87 (1968): 401-8.</p>
<A NAME="163"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=834><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shifkhah</font>, translated &#8220;servant&#8221; here and in vv. 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8) refers to a menial female servant.</p>
<A NAME="164"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=835><b>sn</b> The passage records the birth of Ishmael to Abram through an Egyptian woman. The story illustrates the limits of Abram&#8217;s faith as he tries to obtain a son through social custom. The barrenness of Sarai poses a challenge to Abram&#8217;s faith, just as the famine did in chap. 12. As in chap. 12, an Egyptian figures prominently. (Perhaps Hagar was obtained as a slave during Abram&#8217;s stay in Egypt.)</p>
<A NAME="165"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=836><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;look.&#8221; The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>) introduces the foundational clause for the imperative to follow.</p>
<A NAME="166"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=837><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;enter to.&#8221; The expression is a euphemism for sexual relations (also in v. 4).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Hebrew expression translated <i>have sexual relations with</i> does not convey the intimacy of other expressions, such as &#8220;so and so knew his wife.&#8221; Sarai simply sees this as the social custom of having a child through a surrogate. For further discussion see C. F. Fensham, &#8220;The Son of a Handmaid in Northwest Semitic,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 19 (1969): 312-21. </p>
<A NAME="167"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=838><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;perhaps I will be built from her.&#8221; Sarai hopes to have a family established through this surrogate mother.</p>
<A NAME="168"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=839><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;listened to the voice of,&#8221; which is an idiom meaning &#8220;obeyed.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Abram did what Sarai told him</i>. This expression was first used in Gen 3:17 of Adam&#8217;s obeying his wife. In both cases the text highlights weak faith and how it jeopardized the plan of God.</p>
<A NAME="169"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=840><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;at the end of ten years, to live, Abram.&#8221; The prepositional phrase introduces the temporal clause, the infinitive construct serves as the verb, and the name &#8220;Abram&#8221; is the subject.</p>
<A NAME="1610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=841><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the Egyptian, her female servant.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=842><b>sn</b> <i>To be his wife</i>. Hagar became a slave wife, not on equal standing with Sarai. However, if Hagar produced the heir, she would be the primary wife in the eyes of society. When this eventually happened, Hagar become insolent, prompting Sarai&#8217;s anger.</p>
<A NAME="1612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=843><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;entered to.&#8221; See the note on the same expression in v. 2.</p>
<A NAME="1613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=844><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;she conceived&#8221; (also in v. 5)</p>
<A NAME="1614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=845><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and she saw that she was pregnant and her mistress was despised in her eyes.&#8221; The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qalal</font>) means &#8220;to despise, to treat lightly, to treat with contempt.&#8221; In Hagar&#8217;s opinion Sarai had been demoted.</p>
<A NAME="1615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=846><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my wrong is because of you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=847><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I placed my female servant in your bosom.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=848><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;saw.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=849><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I was despised in her eyes.&#8221; The passive verb has been translated as active for stylistic reasons. Sarai was made to feel supplanted and worthless by Hagar the servant girl.</p>
<A NAME="1619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=850><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;me and you.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>May the </i><sc>Lord</><i> judge between you and me</i>. Sarai blamed Abram for Hagar&#8217;s attitude, not the pregnancy. Here she expects to be vindicated by the <sc>Lord who will prove Abram responsible. A colloquial rendering might be, &#8220;God will get you for this.&#8221; It may mean that she thought Abram had encouraged the servant girl in her elevated status.</p>
<A NAME="1620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=851><b>tn</b> The clause is introduced with the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>), introducing a foundational clause for the coming imperative: &#8220;since&#8230;do.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=852><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in your hand.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=853><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;what is good in your eyes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=854><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;her&#8221;; the referent (Hagar) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=855><b>tn</b> In the Piel stem the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anah</font>) means &#8220;to afflict, to oppress, to treat harshly, to mistreat.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1625"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=856><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and she fled from her presence.&#8221; The referent of &#8220;her&#8221; (Sarai) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1626"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=857><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the messenger of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; Some identify the angel of the <sc>Lord as the preincarnate Christ because in some texts the angel is identified with the <sc>Lord himself. However, it is more likely that the angel merely represents the <sc>Lord; he can speak for the <sc>Lord because he is sent with the <sc>Lord&#8217;s full authority. In some cases the angel is clearly distinct from the <sc>Lord (see Judg 6:11-23). It is not certain if the same angel is always in view. Though the proper name following the noun &#8220;angel&#8221; makes the construction definite, this may simply indicate that a definite angel sent from the <sc>Lord is referred to in any given context. It need not be the same angel on every occasion. Note the analogous expression &#8220;the servant of the <sc>Lord,&#8221; which refers to various individuals in the OT (see BDB 714 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1491;</font>).</p>
<A NAME="1627"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=858><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And the angel of the <sc>Lord found her near the spring of water in the desert, near the spring on the way to Shur.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1628"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=859><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from the presence of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1629"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=860><b>tn</b> The imperative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿhit</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anni</font>) is the Hitpael of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anah</font>, here translated &#8220;submit&#8221;), the same word used for Sarai&#8217;s harsh treatment of her. Hagar is instructed not only to submit to Sarai&#8217;s authority, but to whatever mistreatment that involves. God calls for Hagar to humble herself.</p>
<A NAME="1630"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=861><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The <sc>Lord&#8217;s angel said, &#8216;I will greatly multiply your descendants&#8230;.&#8221; The order of the clauses has been rearranged in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="1631"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=862><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;cannot be numbered because of abundance.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1632"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=863><b>tn</b> The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>) focuses on her immediate situation: &#8220;Here you are pregnant.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1633"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=864><b>tn</b> The active participle refers here to something that is about to happen.</p>
<A NAME="1634"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=865><b>sn</b> The name <i>Ishmael</i> consists of the imperfect or jussive form of the Hebrew verb with the theophoric element added as the subject. It means &#8220;God hears&#8221; or &#8220;may God hear.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1635"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=866><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;affliction,&#8221; which must refer here to Hagar&#8217;s painful groans of anguish.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This clause gives the explanation of the name <i>Ishmael</i>, using a wordplay. Ishmael&#8217;s name will be a reminder that &#8220;God hears&#8221; Hagar&#8217;s painful cries.</p>
<A NAME="1636"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=867><b>sn</b> <i>A wild donkey of a man</i>. The prophecy is not an insult. The wild donkey lived a solitary existence in the desert away from society. Ishmael would be free-roaming, strong, and like a bedouin; he would enjoy the freedom his mother sought.</p>
<A NAME="1637"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=868><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;His hand will be against everyone.&#8221; The &#8220;hand&#8221; by metonymy represents strength. His free-roaming life style would put him in conflict with those who follow social conventions. There would not be open warfare, only friction because of his antagonism to their way of life.</p>
<A NAME="1638"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=869><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;And the hand of everyone will be against him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1639"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=870><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;opposite, across from.&#8221; Ishmael would live on the edge of society (cf. NASB &#8220;to the east of&#8221;). Some take this as an idiom meaning &#8220;be at odds with&#8221; (cf. NRSV, NLT) or &#8220;live in hostility toward&#8221; (cf. NIV).</p>
<A NAME="1640"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=871><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;God of my seeing.&#8221; The pronominal suffix may be understood either as objective (&#8220;who sees me,&#8221; as in the translation) or subjective (&#8220;whom I see&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1641"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=872><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;after one who sees me.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> For a discussion of Hagar&#8217;s exclamation, see T. Booij, &#8220;Hagar&#8217;s Words in Genesis 16:13b,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 30 (1980): 1-7.</p>
<A NAME="1642"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=873><b>tn</b> The verb does not have an expressed subject and so is rendered as passive in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="1643"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=874><b>sn</b> The Hebrew name <i>Beer Lahai Roi</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1512; &#1500;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1497; &#1512;&#1465;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">er lakhay ro</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">i</font>) means &#8220;The well of the Living One who sees me.&#8221; The text suggests that God takes up the cause of those who are oppressed.</p>
<A NAME="1644"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=875><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;look.&#8221; The words &#8220;it is located&#8221; are supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="1645"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=876><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Abram called the name of his son whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Whom Abram named Ishmael</i>. Hagar must have informed Abram of what the angel had told her. See the note on the name &#8220;Ishmael&#8221; in 16:11.</p>
<A NAME="1646"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=877><b>tn</b> The disjunctive clause gives information that is parenthetical to the narrative.</p>
<A NAME="1647"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=878><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the son of eighty-six years.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1648"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=879><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text adds, &#8220;for Abram.&#8221; This has not been included in the translation for stylistic reasons; it is somewhat redundant given the three occurrences of Abram&#8217;s name in this and the previous verse.</p>
