<A NAME="332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2084><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;and look, Esau was coming.&#8221; By the use of the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>, &#8220;look&#8221;), the narrator invites the reader to view the scene through Jacob&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<A NAME="333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2085><b>sn</b> This kind of ranking according to favoritism no doubt fed the jealousy over Joseph that later becomes an important element in the narrative. It must have been painful to the family to see that they were expendable.</p>
<A NAME="334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2086><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he&#8221;; the referent (Jacob) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2087><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;until his drawing near unto his brother.&#8221; The construction uses the preposition with the infinitive construct to express a temporal clause.</p>
<A NAME="336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2088><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he&#8221;; the referent (Esau) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>

<A NAME="339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2091><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb means &#8220;to be gracious; to show favor&#8221;; here it carries the nuance &#8220;to give graciously.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2092><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the female servants drew near, they and their children and they bowed down.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="3314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2096><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he&#8221;; the referent (Jacob) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2097><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Jacob said, &#8216;No, please.&#8217;&#8221; The words &#8220;take them&#8221; have been supplied in the translation for clarity, and the order of the introductory clause and the direct discourse rearranged for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="3316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2098><b>tn</b> The form is the perfect tense with a <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive, expressing a contingent future nuance in the &#8220;then&#8221; section of the conditional sentence.</p>
<A NAME="3317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2099><b>tn</b> The verbal form is the preterite with a <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive, indicating result here.</p>
<A NAME="3318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2100><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for therefore I have seen your face like seeing the face of God and you have accepted me.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This is an allusion to the preceding episode (32:22-31) in which Jacob saw <i>the face of God</i> and realized his prayer was answered.</p>
<A NAME="3319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2101><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;blessing.&#8221; It is as if Jacob is trying to repay what he stole from his brother twenty years earlier.</p>
<A NAME="3320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2102><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;gracious,&#8221; but in the specific sense of prosperity.</p>

<A NAME="3322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2104><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he urged him and he took.&#8221; The referent of the first pronoun in the sequence (&#8220;he&#8221;) has been specified as &#8220;Jacob&#8221; in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2105><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he&#8221;; the referent (Esau) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2106><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;let us travel and let us go.&#8221; The two cohortatives are used in combination with the sense, &#8220;let&#8217;s travel along, get going, be on our way.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2107><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Jacob) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2108><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;weak.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2109><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the sheep and the cattle nursing [are] upon me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2110><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and I, I will move along according to my leisure at the foot of the property which is before me and at the foot of the children.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2111><b>tn</b> The cohortative verbal form here indicates a polite offer of help.</p>
<A NAME="3330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2112><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he said, &#8216;Why this?&#8217;&#8221; The referent of the pronoun &#8220;he&#8221; (Jacob) has been specified for clarity, and the order of the introductory clause and the direct discourse has been rearranged in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="3331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2113><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I am finding favor in the eyes of my lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2114><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;returned on his way.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2115><b>tn</b> The disjunctive clause contrasts Jacob&#8217;s action with Esau&#8217;s.</p>
<A NAME="3334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2116><b>sn</b> <i>But Jacob traveled to Succoth</i>. There are several reasons why Jacob chose not to go to Mt. Seir after Esau. First, as he said, his herds and children probably could not keep up with the warriors. Second, he probably did not fully trust his brother. The current friendliness could change, and he could lose everything. And third, God did tell him to return to his land, not Seir. But Jacob is still not able to deal truthfully, probably because of fear of Esau.</p>
<A NAME="3335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2117><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;why he called.&#8221; One could understand &#8220;Jacob&#8221; as the subject of the verb, but it is more likely that the subject is indefinite, in which case the verb is better translated as passive.</p>
<A NAME="3336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2118><b>sn</b> The name <i>Succoth</i> means &#8220;shelters,&#8221; an appropriate name in light of the <i>shelters</i> Jacob built there for his livestock.</p>
<A NAME="3337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2119><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in front of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3338"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2120><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;he bought it&#8221; are supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons. In the Hebrew text v. 19 is one long sentence.</p>
<A NAME="3339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2121><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qÿsitah</font>) is generally understood to refer to a unit of money, but the value is unknown. (However, cf. REB, which renders the term as &#8220;sheep&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="3340"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=2122><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;God, the God of Israel.&#8221; Rather than translating the name, a number of modern translations merely transliterate it from the Hebrew as &#8220;El Elohe Israel&#8221; (cf. NIV, NRSV, REB). It is not entirely clear how the name should be interpreted grammatically. One option is to supply an equative verb, as in the translation: &#8220;The God of Israel [is] God.&#8221; Another interpretive option is &#8220;the God of Israel [is] strong [or &#8220;mighty&#8221;].&#8221; Buying the land and settling down for a while was a momentous step for the patriarch, so the commemorative naming of the altar is significant.</p>
