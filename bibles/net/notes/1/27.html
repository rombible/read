<A NAME="271"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1579><b>tn</b> The clause begins with the temporal indicator (&#8220;and it happened&#8221;), making it subordinate to the main clause that follows later in the sentence.</p>

<A NAME="276"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1584><b>tn</b> The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>, &#8220;look&#8221;) here introduces a logically foundational statement, upon which the coming instruction will be based.</p>
<A NAME="277"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1585><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I do not know the day of my death.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="278"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1586><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word is to be spelled either <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsayid</font>) following the marginal reading (<i>Qere</i>), or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1461;&#1497;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsedah</font>) following the consonantal text (<i>Kethib</i>). Either way it is from the same root as the imperative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsudah</font>, &#8220;hunt down&#8221;). </p>
<A NAME="279"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1587><b>tn</b> Following the imperative, the cohortative (with the prefixed conjunction) indicates purpose or result.</p>
<A NAME="2710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1588><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;so that my soul may bless you.&#8221; The use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nafshi</font>, &#8220;my soul&#8221;) as the subject emphasizes that the blessing will be made with all Isaac&#8217;s desire and vitality. The conjunction &#8220;so that&#8221; closely relates the meal to the blessing, suggesting that this will be a ritual meal in conjunction with the giving of a formal blessing.</p>
<A NAME="2711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1589><b>tn</b> The disjunctive clause (introduced by a conjunction with the subject, followed by the predicate) here introduces a new scene in the story.</p>
<A NAME="2712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1590><b>tc</b> The LXX adds here &#8220;to his father,&#8221; which may have been accidentally omitted in the MT.</p>
<A NAME="2713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1591><b>tn</b> Following the imperative, the cohortative (with the prefixed conjunction) indicates purpose or result.</p>
<A NAME="2714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1592><b>tn</b> The cohortative, with the prefixed conjunction, also expresses logical sequence. See vv. 4, 19, 27.</p>
<A NAME="2715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1593><b>tn</b> In her report to Jacob, Rebekah plays down Isaac&#8217;s strong desire to bless Esau by leaving out <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nafshi</font>, &#8220;my soul&#8221;), but by adding the phrase &#8220;in the presence of the <sc>Lord,&#8221; she stresses how serious this matter is.</p>
<A NAME="2716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1594><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;listen to my voice.&#8221; The Hebrew idiom means &#8220;to comply; to obey.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1595><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to that which I am commanding you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1596><b>tn</b> Following the imperative, the cohortative (with the prefixed conjunction) indicates purpose or result.</p>
<A NAME="2719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1597><b>tn</b> The form is the perfect tense with the <i>vav </i>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive. It carries forward the tone of instruction initiated by the command to &#8220;go&#8230;and get&#8221; in the preceding verse.</p>
<A NAME="2720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1598><b>tn</b> The form is the perfect with the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive; it carries the future nuance of the preceding verbs of instruction, but by switching the subject to Jacob, indicates the expected result of the subterfuge.</p>
<A NAME="2721"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1599><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;so that.&#8221; The conjunction indicates purpose or result.</p>
<A NAME="2722"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1600><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, &#8216;Look, Esau my brother is a hairy man, but I am a smooth [skinned] man.&#8217;&#8221; The order of the introductory clause and the direct discourse has been rearranged in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="2723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1601><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Perhaps my father will feel me and I will be in his eyes like a mocker.&#8221; The Hebrew expression &#8220;I will be in his eyes like&#8221; means &#8220;I would appear to him as.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1602><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;upon me your curse.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1603><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;only listen to my voice.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2726"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1604><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;the goats&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text, but are supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="2727"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1605><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his mother.&#8221; This has been replaced by the pronoun &#8220;she&#8221; in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="2728"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1606><b>tn</b> In the Hebrew text the object (&#8220;the skins of the young goats&#8221;) precedes the verb. The disjunctive clause draws attention to this key element in the subterfuge.</p>
<A NAME="2729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1607><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;hands&#8221; probably includes the forearms here. How the skins were attached is not specified in the Hebrew text; cf. NLT &#8220;she made him a pair of gloves.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2730"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1608><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;gave&#8230;into the hand of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2731"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1609><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he said&#8221;; the referent (Isaac) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2732"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1610><b>sn</b> <i>Which are you, my son?</i> Isaac&#8217;s first question shows that the deception is going to require more subterfuge than Rebekah had anticipated. Jacob will have to pull off the deceit.</p>
<A NAME="2733"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1611><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;get up and sit.&#8221; This may mean simply &#8220;sit up,&#8221; or it may indicate that he was to get up from his couch and sit at a table.</p>
<A NAME="2734"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1612><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;so that your soul may bless me.&#8221; These words, though not reported by Rebekah to Jacob (see v. 7) accurately reflect what Isaac actually said to Esau (see v. 4). Perhaps Jacob knew more than Rebekah realized, but it is more likely that this was an idiom for sincere blessing with which Jacob was familiar. At any rate, his use of the precise wording was a nice, convincing touch.</p>
<A NAME="2735"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1613><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;What is this?&#8221; The enclitic pronoun &#8220;this&#8221; adds emphasis to the question, which is comparable to the English rhetorical question, &#8220;How in the world?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2736"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1614><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you hastened to find.&#8221; In translation the infinitive becomes the main verb and the first verb becomes adverbial.</p>

<A NAME="2739"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1617><b>tn</b> Following the imperative, the cohortative (with prefixed conjunction) indicates purpose or result.</p>
<A NAME="2740"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1618><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Are you this one, Esau, my son, or not?&#8221; On the use of the interrogative particle here, see BDB 210 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1458;</font>.</p>
<A NAME="2741"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1619><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he blessed him.&#8221; The referents of the pronouns &#8220;he&#8221; (Isaac) and &#8220;him&#8221; (Jacob) have been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2742"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1620><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Jacob) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>

<A NAME="2744"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1622><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Bring near to me and I will eat of the wild game, my son.&#8221; Following the imperative, the cohortative with the prefixed conjunction indicates purpose or result.</p>
<A NAME="2745"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1623><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;so that my soul may bless you.&#8221; The presence of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nafshi</font>, &#8220;my soul&#8221;) as subject emphasizes Isaac&#8217;s heartfelt desire to do this. The conjunction indicates that the ritual meal must be first eaten before the formal blessing may be given.</p>

<A NAME="2753"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1631><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and be.&#8221; The verb is an imperative, which is used rhetorically in this oracle of blessing. It is an invitation to exercise authority his brothers and indicates that he is granted such authority by the patriarch of the family. Furthermore, the blessing enables the recipient to accomplish this.</p>
<A NAME="2754"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1632><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gevir</font>, &#8220;lord, mighty one&#8221;). The one being blessed will be stronger and therefore more powerful than his brother. See Gen 25:23. The feminine form of this rare noun means &#8220;mistress&#8221; or &#8220;queen-mother.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2755"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=1633><b>tn</b> Following the imperative, the prefixed verbal form (which is either an imperfect or a jussive) with the prefixed conjunction indicates purpose or result.</p>
<A NAME="2756"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=1634><b>tn</b> The use of the infinitive absolute before the finite form of the verb makes the construction emphatic.</p>
<A NAME="2757"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=1635><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the presence of Isaac his father.&#8221; The repetition of the proper name (&#8220;Isaac&#8221;) was </p>

<A NAME="2760"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=1638><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;arise&#8221; (i.e., sit up).</p>
<A NAME="2761"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=1639><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;so that your soul may bless me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2762"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=1640><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2763"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=1641><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he said, &#8216;I [am] your son, your firstborn.&#8217;&#8221; The order of the introductory clause and the direct discourse has been rearranged for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="2764"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=1642><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Isaac trembled with a great trembling to excess.&#8221; The verb &#8220;trembled&#8221; is joined with a cognate accusative, which is modified by an adjective &#8220;great,&#8221; and a prepositional phrase &#8220;to excess.&#8221; All of this is emphatic, showing the violence of Isaac&#8217;s reaction to the news.</p>
<A NAME="2765"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=1643><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Who then is he who hunted game and brought [it] to me so that I ate from all before you arrived and blessed him?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2766"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=1644><b>tn</b> The temporal clause is introduced with the temporal indicator and has the infinitive as its verb.</p>
<A NAME="2767"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=1645><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he yelled [with] a great and bitter yell to excess.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="2770"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=1648><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Is he not rightly named Jacob?&#8221; The rhetorical question, since it expects a positive reply, has been translated as a declarative statement.</p>
<A NAME="2771"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=1649><b>sn</b> <i>He has tripped me up</i>. When originally given, the name Jacob was a play on the word &#8220;heel&#8221; (see Gen 25:26). The name (since it is a verb) probably means something like &#8220;may he protect,&#8221; that is, as a rearguard, dogging the heels. This name was probably chosen because of the immediate association with the incident of grabbing the heel. Esau gives the name &#8220;Jacob&#8221; a negative connotation here, the meaning &#8220;to trip up; to supplant.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2772"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=1650><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Bless me, me also, my father.&#8221; The words &#8220;my father&#8221; have not been repeated in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>

<A NAME="2776"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">76</span><note=1654><b>sn</b> <i>You will tear off his yoke from your neck</i>. It may be that this prophetic blessing found its fulfillment when Jerusalem fell and Edom got its revenge. The oracle makes Edom subservient to Israel and suggests the Edomites would live away from the best land and be forced to sustain themselves by violent measures.</p>
<A NAME="2777"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=1655><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;bore a grudge against&#8221; (cf. NAB, NASB, NIV). The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1496;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">satam</font>) describes persistent hatred.</p>
<A NAME="2778"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=1656><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;because of the blessing which his father blessed him.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="2780"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">80</span><note=1658><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;days.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2781"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">81</span><note=1659><b>tn</b> The cohortative here expresses Esau&#8217;s determined resolve to kill Jacob.</p>

She probably expects Esau&#8217;s anger to die down quickly. However, Jacob ends up being gone twenty years and he never sees Rebekah again.</p>
<A NAME="2788"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">88</span><note=1666><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;stay there&#8221; are supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
