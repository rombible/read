<A NAME="2547"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1483><b>tn</b> The rare term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">la</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">at</font>), translated &#8220;feed,&#8221; is used in later Hebrew for feeding animals (see Jastrow, 714). If this nuance was attached to the word in the biblical period, then it may depict Esau in a negative light, comparing him to a hungry animal. Famished Esau comes in from the hunt, only to enter the trap. He can only point at the red stew and ask Jacob to feed him.</p>
