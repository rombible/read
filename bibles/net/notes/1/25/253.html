<A NAME="253"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1439><b>sn</b> The names <i>Sheba</i> and <i>Dedan</i> appear in Gen 10:7 as descendants of Ham through Cush and Raamah. Since these two names are usually interpreted to be place names, one plausible suggestion is that some of Abraham&#8217;s descendants lived in those regions and took names linked with it.</p>
