<A NAME="2540"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1476><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And he called his name Jacob.&#8221; Some ancient witnesses read &#8220;they called his name Jacob&#8221; (see v. 25). In either case the subject is indefinite.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The name <i>Jacob</i> is a play on the Hebrew word for &#8220;heel&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1511;&#1461;&#1489;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">aqev</font>). The name (since it is a verb) probably means something like &#8220;may he protect,&#8221; that is, as a rearguard, dogging the heels. It did not have a negative connotation until Esau redefined it. This name was probably chosen because of the immediate association with the incident of grabbing the heel. After receiving such an oracle, the parents would have preserved in memory almost every detail of the unusual births.</p>
