<A NAME="2546"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1482><b>sn</b> <i>Jacob cooked some stew</i>. There are some significant words and wordplays in this story that help clarify the points of the story. The verb &#8220;cook&#8221; is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zid</font>), which sounds like the word for &#8220;hunter&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tsayid</font>). This is deliberate, for the hunter becomes the hunted in this story. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;</font> means &#8220;to cook, to boil,&#8221; but by the sound play with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1491;</font> it comes to mean &#8220;set a trap by cooking.&#8221; The usage of the word shows that it can also have the connotation of acting presumptuously (as in boiling over). This too may be a comment on the scene. For further discussion of the rhetorical devices in the Jacob narratives, see J. P. Fokkelman, <i>Narrative Art in Genesis </i>(SSN).</p>
