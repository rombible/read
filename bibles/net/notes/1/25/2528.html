<A NAME="2528"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1464><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">atar</font>), translated &#8220;prayed [to]&#8221; here, appears in the story of God&#8217;s judgment on Egypt in which Moses asked the <sc>Lord to remove the plagues. The cognate word in Arabic means &#8220;to slaughter for sacrifice,&#8221; and the word is used in Zeph 3:10 to describe worshipers who bring offerings. Perhaps some ritual accompanied Isaac&#8217;s prayer here.</p>
