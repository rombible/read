<A NAME="2549"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1485><b>sn</b> Esau&#8217;s descendants would eventually be called <i>Edom</i>. Edom was the place where they lived, so-named probably because of the reddish nature of the hills. The writer can use the word &#8220;red&#8221; to describe the stew that Esau gasped for to convey the nature of Esau and his descendants. They were a lusty, passionate, and profane people who lived for the moment. Again, the wordplay is meant to capture the &#8220;omen in the nomen.&#8221;</p>
