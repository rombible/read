<A NAME="4840"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=2941><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿkhem</font>) could be translated either as &#8220;mountain slope&#8221; or &#8220;shoulder, portion,&#8221; or even taken as the proper name &#8220;Shechem.&#8221; Jacob was giving Joseph either (1) one portion above his brothers, or (2) the mountain ridge he took from the Amorites, or (3) Shechem. The ambiguity actually allows for all three to be the referent. He could be referring to the land in Shechem he bought in Gen 33:18-19, but he mentions here that it was acquired by warfare, suggesting that the events of 34:25-29 are in view (even though at the time he denounced it, 34:30). Joseph was later buried in Shechem (Josh 24:32).</p>
