<A NAME="4831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2932><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ga</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) has the basic idea of &#8220;protect&#8221; as a near relative might do. It is used for buying someone out of bondage, marrying a deceased brother&#8217;s widow, paying off debts, avenging the family, and the like. The meanings of &#8220;deliver, protect, avenge&#8221; are most fitting when God is the subject (see A. R. Johnson, &#8220;The Primary Meaning of &#8730;<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1488;&#1500;</font>,&#8221; <i>Congress Volume: Copenhagen, 1953</i> [VTSup], 67-77).</p>
