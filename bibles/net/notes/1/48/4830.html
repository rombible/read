<A NAME="4830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2931><b>sn</b> The Samaritan Pentateuch reads &#8220;king&#8221; here, but the traditional reading (&#8220;angel&#8221;) may be maintained. Jacob closely associates God with an angelic protective presence. This does not mean that Jacob viewed his God as a mere angel, but it does suggest that he was aware of an angelic presence sent by God to protect him. Here he so closely associates the two that they become virtually indistinguishable. In this culture messengers typically carried the authority of the one who sent them and could even be addressed as such. Perhaps Jacob thought that the divine blessing would be mediated through this angelic messenger.</p>
