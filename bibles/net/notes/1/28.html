<A NAME="287"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1678><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and may he give to you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your offspring with you.&#8221; The name &#8220;Abraham&#8221; is an objective genitive here; this refers to the blessing that God gave to Abraham.</p>
<A NAME="288"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1679><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;the land&#8221; have been supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="289"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1680><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the land of your sojournings,&#8221; that is, the land where Jacob had been living as a resident alien, as his future descendants would after him.</p>
<A NAME="2810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1681><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to take for himself from there a wife.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1682><b>tn</b> The infinitive construct with the preposition and the suffix form a temporal clause.</p>

<A NAME="2813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1684><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;saw.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1685><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the daughters of Canaan.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1686><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;evil in the eyes of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1687><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;took for a wife.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1688><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the place.&#8221; The article may indicate simply that the place is definite in the mind of the narrator. However, as the story unfolds the place is transformed into a holy place. See A. P. Ross, &#8220;Jacob&#8217;s Vision: The Founding of Bethel,&#8221; <i>BSac</i> 142 (1985): 224-37.</p>
<A NAME="2818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1689><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he spent the night there because the sun had gone down.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1690><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he took from the stones of the place,&#8221; which here means Jacob took one of the stones (see v. 18).</p>
<A NAME="2820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1691><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he put [it at] the place of his head.&#8221; The text does not actually say the stone was placed under his head to serve as a pillow, although most interpreters and translators assume this. It is possible the stone served some other purpose. Jacob does not seem to have been a committed monotheist yet (see v. 20-21) so he may have believed it contained some spiritual power. Note that later in the story he anticipates the stone becoming the residence of God (see v. 22). Many cultures throughout the world view certain types of stones as magical and/or sacred. See J. G. Fraser, <i>Folklore in the Old Testament</i>, 231-37.</p>
<A NAME="2821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1692><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lay down.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1693><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and dreamed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1694><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and look.&#8221; The scene which Jacob witnessed is described in three clauses introduced with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>). In this way the narrator invites the reader to witness the scene through Jacob&#8217;s eyes. J. P. Fokkelman points out that the particle goes with a lifted arm and an open mouth: &#8220;There, a ladder! Oh, angels! and look, the <sc>Lord himself&#8221; (<i>Narrative Art in Genesis </i>[SSN], 51-52).</p>
<A NAME="2824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1695><b>tn</b> The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1467;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sullam</font>, &#8220;ladder, stairway&#8221;) occurs only here in the OT, but there appears to be an Akkadian cognate <font face="Scholar">simmiltu</font> (with metathesis of the second and third consonants and a feminine ending) which has a specialized meaning of &#8220;stairway, ramp.&#8221; See H. R. Cohen, <i>Biblical Hapax Legomena </i>(SBLDS), 34. For further discussion see C. Houtman, &#8220;What Did Jacob See in His Dream at Bethel? Some Remarks on Genesis 28:10-22,&#8221; <i>VT </i>27 (1977): 337-52; J. G. Griffiths, &#8220;The Celestial Ladder and the Gate of Heaven,&#8221; <i>ExpTim</i> 76 (1964/65): 229-30; and A. R. Millard, &#8220;The Celestial Ladder and the Gate of Heaven,&#8221; <i>ExpTim</i> 78 (1966/67): 86-87.</p>
<A NAME="2825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1696><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac.&#8221; The Hebrew word for &#8220;father&#8221; can typically be used in a broader sense than the English word, in this case referring to Abraham (who was Jacob&#8217;s grandfather). For stylistic reasons and for clarity, the words &#8220;your father&#8221; are supplied with &#8220;Isaac&#8221; in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="2826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1697><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">erets</font>) can mean &#8220;[the] earth,&#8221; &#8220;land,&#8221; &#8220;region,&#8221; &#8220;piece of ground,&#8221; or &#8220;ground&#8221; depending on the context. Here the term specifically refers to the plot of ground on which Jacob was lying, but at the same time this stands by metonymy for the entire land of Canaan.</p>
<A NAME="2827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1698><b>tn</b> This is the same Hebrew word translated &#8220;ground&#8221; in the preceding verse.</p>
<A NAME="2828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1699><b>tn</b> The verb is singular in the Hebrew; Jacob is addressed as the representative of his descendants.</p>
<A NAME="2829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1700><b>tn</b> Theoretically the Niphal stem can be translated either as passive or reflexive/reciprocal. (The Niphal of &#8220;bless&#8221; is only used in formulations of the Abrahamic covenant. See Gen 12:2; 18:18; 28:14.) Traditionally the verb is taken as passive here, as if Jacob were going to be a channel or source of blessing. But in other formulations of the Abrahamic covenant (see Gen 22:18; 26:4) the Hitpael replaces this Niphal form, suggesting a translation &#8220;will bless (i.e., pronounce blessings upon) themselves/one another.&#8221; The Hitpael of &#8220;bless&#8221; is used with a reflexive/reciprocal sense in Deut 29:18; Ps 72:17; Isa 65:16; Jer 4:2. Gen 28:14 predicts that Jacob will be held up as a paradigm of divine blessing and that people will use his name in their blessing formulae (see Gen 12:2 and 18:18 as well, where Abram/Abraham receives this promise). For examples of blessing formulae utilizing an individual as an example of blessing see Gen 48:20 and Ruth 4:11.</p>
<A NAME="2830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1701><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they will pronounce blessings by you, all the families of the earth, and by your offspring.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1702><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Look, I [am] with you.&#8221; The clause is a nominal clause; the verb to be supplied could be present (as in the translation) or future, &#8220;Look, I [will be] with you&#8221; (cf. NEB).</p>
<A NAME="2832"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1703><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;woke up from his sleep.&#8221; This has been simplified in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="2833"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1704><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2834"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1705><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he got up early&#8230;and he took.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2835"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1706><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Jacob) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2836"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1707><b>tn</b> See the note on this phrase in v. 11.</p>
<A NAME="2837"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1708><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;standing stone.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Sacred stone</i>. Such a stone could be used as a boundary marker, a burial stone, or as a shrine. Here the stone is intended to be a reminder of the stairway that was &#8220;erected&#8221; and on which the <sc>Lord &#8220;stood.&#8221; (In Hebrew the word translated &#8220;sacred stone&#8221; is derived from the verb translated &#8220;erected&#8221; in v. 12 and &#8220;stood&#8221; in v. 13. Since the top of the stairway reached the heavens where the <sc>Lord stood, Jacob poured oil on the top of the stone. See C. F. Graesser, &#8220;Standing Stones in Ancient Palestine,&#8221; <i>BA</i> 35 (1972): 34-63; and E. Stockton, &#8220;Sacred Pillars in the Bible,&#8221; <i>ABR</i> 20 (1972): 16-32.</p>
<A NAME="2838"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1709><b>tn</b> The name <i>Bethel</i> means &#8220;house of God&#8221; in Hebrew (see v. 17).</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map4-G4; Map5-C1; Map6-E3; Map7-D1; Map8-G3.</p>

<A NAME="2841"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1712><b>tn</b> The disjunctive clause structure (conjunction + noun/subject) is used to highlight the statement.</p>
<A NAME="2842"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1713><b>tn</b> The infinitive absolute is used before the finite verb for emphasis.</p>
<A NAME="2843"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1714><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and all which you give to me I will surely give a tenth of it to you.&#8221; The disjunctive clause structure (conjunction + noun/object) highlights this statement as well.</p>
