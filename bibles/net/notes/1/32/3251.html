<A NAME="3251"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=2050><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term used here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yeled</font>) which typically describes male offspring. Some translations render the term &#8220;children&#8221; but this is a problem because by this time Jacob had twelve children in all, including one daughter, Dinah, born to Leah (Gen 30:21). Benjamin, his twelfth son and thirteenth child, was not born until later (Gen 35:16-19).</p>
