<A NAME="3268"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=2067><b>sn</b> <i>You have fought</i>. The explanation of the name Israel includes a sound play. In Hebrew the verb translated &#8220;you have fought&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;</font>, <font face="Scholar">sarita</font>) sounds like the name &#8220;Israel&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yisra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font> ), meaning &#8220;God fights&#8221; (although some interpret the meaning as &#8220;he fights [with] God&#8221;). The name would evoke the memory of the fight and what it meant. A. Dillmann says that ever after this the name would tell the Israelites that, when Jacob contended successfully with God, he won the battle with man (<i>Genesis</i>, 2:279). To be successful with God meant that he had to be crippled in his own self-sufficiency (A. P. Ross, &#8220;Jacob at the Jabboq, Israel at Peniel,&#8221; <i>BSac</i> 142 [1985]: 51-62).</p>
