<A NAME="327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2006><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I am sending.&#8221; The form is a preterite with the <i>vav</i> consecutive; it could be rendered as an English present tense &#8211; as the Hebrew perfect/preterite allows &#8211; much like an epistolary aorist in Greek. The form assumes the temporal perspective of the one who reads the message.</p>
