<A NAME="3244"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=2043><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will appease his face.&#8221; The cohortative here expresses Jacob&#8217;s resolve. In the Book of Leviticus the Hebrew verb translated &#8220;appease&#8221; has the idea of removing anger due to sin or guilt, a nuance that fits this passage very well. Jacob wanted to buy Esau off with a gift of more than five hundred and fifty animals.</p>
