<A NAME="321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2000><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>angels of God</i> occurs only here and in Gen 28:12 in the OT. Jacob saw a vision of angels just before he left the promised land. Now he encounters angels as he prepares to return to it. The text does not give the details of the encounter, but Jacob&#8217;s response suggests it was amicable. This location was a spot where heaven made contact with earth, and where God made his presence known to the patriarch. See C. Houtman, &#8220;Jacob at Mahanaim: Some Remarks on Genesis XXXII 2-3,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 28 (1978): 37-44.</p>
