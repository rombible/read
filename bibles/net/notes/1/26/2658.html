<A NAME="2658"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=1550><b>sn</b> The name <i>Rehoboth</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1456;&#1492;&#1465;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">rehovot</font>) is derived from a verbal root meaning &#8220;to make room.&#8221; The name was a reminder that God had made room for them. The story shows Isaac&#8217;s patience with the opposition; it also shows how God&#8217;s blessing outdistanced the men of Gerar. They could not stop it or seize it any longer.</p>
