<A NAME="2623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1515><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Because I said, &#8216;Lest I die on account of her.&#8217;&#8221; Since the verb &#8220;said&#8221; probably means &#8220;said to myself&#8221; (i.e., &#8220;thought&#8221;) here, the direct discourse in the Hebrew statement has been converted to indirect discourse in the translation. In addition the simple prepositional phrase &#8220;on account of her&#8221; has been clarified in the translation as &#8220;to get her&#8221; (cf. v. 7).</p>
