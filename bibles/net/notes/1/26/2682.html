<A NAME="2682"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">82</span><note=1574><b>sn</b> The name <i>Beer Sheba</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1506;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">er shava</font>&#8217;) means &#8220;well of an oath&#8221; or &#8220;well of seven.&#8221; According to Gen 21:31 Abraham gave Beer Sheba its name when he made a treaty with the Philistines. Because of the parallels between this earlier story and the account in 26:26-33, some scholars see chaps. 21 and 26 as two versions (or doublets) of one original story. However, if one takes the text as it stands, it appears that Isaac made a later treaty agreement with the people of the land that was similar to his father&#8217;s. Abraham dug a well at the site and named the place Beer Sheba; Isaac dug another well there and named the well Shibah. Later generations then associated the name Beer Sheba with Isaac, even though Abraham gave the place its name at an earlier time.</p>
