<A NAME="262"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1494><b>sn</b> This account is parallel to two similar stories about Abraham (see Gen 12:10-20; 20:1-18). Many scholars do not believe there were three similar incidents, only one that got borrowed and duplicated. Many regard the account about Isaac as the original, which then was attached to the more important person, Abraham, with supernatural elements being added. For a critique of such an approach, see R. Alter, <i>The Art of Biblical Narrative</i>, 47-62. It is more likely that the story illustrates the proverb &#8220;like father, like son&#8221; (see T. W. Mann, <i>The Book of the Torah</i>, 53). In typical human fashion the son follows his father&#8217;s example of lying to avoid problems. The appearance of similar events reported in a similar way underscores the fact that the blessing has now passed to Isaac, even if he fails as his father did.</p>
