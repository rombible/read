<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1><b>tn</b> The translation assumes that the form translated &#8220;beginning&#8221; is in the absolute state rather than the construct (&#8220;in the beginning of,&#8221; or &#8220;when God created&#8221;). In other words, the clause in v. 1 is a main clause, v. 2 has three clauses that are descriptive and supply background information, and v. 3 begins the narrative sequence proper. The referent of the word &#8220;beginning&#8221; has to be defined from the context since there is no beginning or ending with God.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>In the beginning</i>. The verse refers to the beginning of the world as we know it; it affirms that it is entirely the product of the creation of God. But there are two ways that this verse can be interpreted: (1) It may be taken to refer to the original act of creation with the rest of the events on the days of creation completing it. This would mean that the disjunctive clauses of v. 2 break the sequence of the creative work of the first day. (2) It may be taken as a summary statement of what the chapter will record, that is, vv. 3-31 are about God&#8217;s creating the world as we know it. If the first view is adopted, then we have a reference here to original creation; if the second view is taken, then Genesis itself does not account for the original creation of matter. To follow this view does not deny that the Bible teaches that God created everything out of nothing (cf. John 1:3) &#8211; it simply says that Genesis is not making that affirmation. This second view presupposes the existence of pre-existent matter, when God said, &#8220;Let there be light.&#8221; The first view includes the description of the primordial state as part of the events of day one. The following narrative strongly favors the second view, for the &#8220;heavens/sky&#8221; did not exist prior to the second day of creation (see v. 8) and &#8220;earth/dry land&#8221; did not exist, at least as we know it, prior to the third day of creation (see v. 10).</p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2><b>sn</b> <i>God</i>. This frequently used Hebrew name for God (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>,&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohim</font> ) is a plural form. When it refers to the one true God, the singular verb is normally used, as here. The plural form indicates majesty; the name stresses God&#8217;s sovereignty and incomparability &#8211; he is the &#8220;God of gods.&#8221; </p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3><b>tn</b> The English verb &#8220;create&#8221; captures well the meaning of the Hebrew term in this context. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bara</font>&#8217;) always describes the divine activity of fashioning something new, fresh, and perfect. The verb does not necessarily describe creation out of nothing (see, for example, v. 27, where it refers to the creation of man); it often stresses forming anew, reforming, renewing (see Ps 51:10; Isa 43:15, 65:17).</p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the entire universe&#8221;; or &#8220;the sky and the dry land.&#8221; This phrase is often interpreted as a merism, referring to the entire ordered universe, including the heavens and the earth and everything in them. The &#8220;heavens and the earth&#8221; were completed in seven days (see Gen 2:1) and are characterized by fixed laws (see Jer 33:25). &#8220;Heavens&#8221; refers specifically to the sky, created on the second day (see v. 8), while &#8220;earth&#8221; refers specifically to the dry land, created on the third day (see v. 10). Both are distinct from the sea/seas (see v. 10 and Exod 20:11). </p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>tn</b> The disjunctive clause (conjunction + subject + verb) at the beginning of v. 2 gives background information for the following narrative, explaining the state of things when &#8220;God said&#8230;&#8221; (v. 3). Verse one is a title to the chapter, v. 2 provides information about the state of things when God spoke, and v. 3 begins the narrative per se with the typical narrative construction (<i>vav</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>] consecutive followed by the prefixed verbal form). (This literary structure is paralleled in the second portion of the book: Gen 2:4 provides the title or summary of what follows, 2:5-6 use disjunctive clause structures to give background information for the following narrative, and 2:7 begins the narrative with the <i>vav </i>consecutive attached to a prefixed verbal form.) Some translate 1:2a &#8220;and the earth became,&#8221; arguing that v. 1 describes the original creation of the earth, while v. 2 refers to a judgment that reduced it to a chaotic condition. Verses 3ff. then describe the re-creation of the earth. However, the disjunctive clause at the beginning of v. 2 cannot be translated as if it were relating the next event in a sequence. If v. 2 were sequential to v. 1, the author would have used the <i>vav</i> consecutive followed by a prefixed verbal form and the subject.</p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=6><b>tn</b> That is, what we now call &#8220;the earth.&#8221; The creation of the earth as we know it is described in vv. 9-10. Prior to this the substance which became the earth (= dry land) lay dormant under the water.</p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=7><b>tn</b> Traditional translations have followed a more literal rendering of &#8220;waste and void.&#8221; The words describe a condition that is without form and empty. What we now know as &#8220;the earth&#8221; was actually an unfilled mass covered by water and darkness. Later <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1465;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tohu</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bohu</font>), when used in proximity, describe a situation resulting from judgment (Isa 34:11; Jer 4:23). Both prophets may be picturing judgment as the reversal of creation in which God&#8217;s judgment causes the world to revert to its primordial condition. This later use of the terms has led some to conclude that Gen 1:2 presupposes the judgment of a prior world, but it is unsound method to read the later application of the imagery (in a context of judgment) back into Gen 1:2.</p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=8><b>sn</b> <i>Darkness</i>. The Hebrew word simply means &#8220;darkness,&#8221; but in the Bible it has come to symbolize what opposes God, such as judgment (Exod 10:21), death (Ps 88:13), oppression (Isa 9:1), the wicked (1 Sam 2:9) and in general, sin. In Isa 45:7 it parallels &#8220;evil.&#8221; It is a fitting cover for the primeval waste, but it prepares the reader for the fact that God is about to reveal himself through his works.</p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=9><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tÿhom</font>, &#8220;deep&#8221;) refers to the watery deep, the salty ocean &#8211; especially the primeval ocean that surrounds and underlies the earth (see Gen 7:11).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The watery deep</i>. In the Babylonian account of creation Marduk killed the goddess Tiamat (the salty sea) and used her carcass to create heaven and earth. The form of the Hebrew word for &#8220;deep&#8221; is distinct enough from the name &#8220;Tiamat&#8221; to deny direct borrowing; however, it is possible that there is a polemical stress here. Ancient Israel does not see the ocean as a powerful deity to be destroyed in creation, only a force of nature that can be controlled by God. </p>
<a name="110"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=10><b>tn</b> The traditional rendering &#8220;Spirit of God&#8221; is preserved here, as opposed to a translation like &#8220;wind from/breath of God&#8221; (cf. NRSV) or &#8220;mighty wind&#8221; (cf. NEB), taking the word &#8220;God&#8221; to represent the superlative. Elsewhere in the OT the phrase refers consistently to the divine spirit that empowers and energizes individuals (see Gen 41:38; Exod 31:3; 35:31; Num 24:2; 1 Sam 10:10; 11:6; 19:20, 23; Ezek 11:24; 2 Chr 15:1; 24:20).</p>
<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb has been translated &#8220;hovering&#8221; or &#8220;moving&#8221; (as a bird over her young, see Deut 32:11). The Syriac cognate term means &#8220;to brood over; to incubate.&#8221; How much of that sense might be attached here is hard to say, but the verb does depict the presence of the Spirit of God moving about mysteriously over the waters, presumably preparing for the acts of creation to follow. If one reads &#8220;mighty wind&#8221; (cf. NEB) then the verse describes how the powerful wind begins to blow in preparation for the creative act described in vv. 9-10. (God also used a wind to drive back the flood waters in Noah&#8217;s day. See Gen 8:1.) </p>
<a name="112"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=12><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;face.&#8221;</p>
<a name="113"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=13><b>sn</b> <i>The water</i>. The text deliberately changes now from the term for the watery deep to the general word for water. The arena is now the life-giving water and not the chaotic abyss-like deep. The change may be merely stylistic, but it may also carry some significance. The deep carries with it the sense of the abyss, chaos, darkness &#8211; in short, that which is not good for life.</p>
<a name="114"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=14><b>tn</b> The prefixed verb form with the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive introduces the narrative sequence. Ten times in the chapter the decree of God in creation will be so expressed. For the power of the divine word in creation, see Ps 33:9, John 1:1-3, 1 Cor 8:6, and Col 1:16.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>God said</i>. By speaking, God brings the world into existence. The efficacious nature of the word of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is a prominent theme in this chapter. It introduces the Law, the words and commandments from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> that must be obeyed. The ten decrees of God in this chapter anticipate the ten words in the Decalogue (Exod 20:2-17).</p>
<a name="115"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=15><b>tn</b> &#8220;Let there be&#8221; is the short jussive form of the verb &#8220;to be&#8221;; the following expression &#8220;and there was&#8221; is the short preterite form of the same verb. As such, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿhi</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayÿhi</font>) form a profound wordplay to express both the calling into existence and the complete fulfillment of the divine word. </p>
<a name="116"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=16><b>sn</b> <i>Light</i>. The Hebrew word simply means &#8220;light,&#8221; but it is used often in scripture to convey the ideas of salvation, joy, knowledge, righteousness, and life. In this context one cannot ignore those connotations, for it is the antithesis of the darkness. The first thing God does is correct the darkness; without the light there is only chaos.</p>
<a name="117"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=17><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And God saw the light, that it was good.&#8221; The verb &#8220;saw&#8221; in this passage carries the meaning &#8220;reflected on,&#8221; &#8220;surveyed,&#8221; &#8220;concluded,&#8221; &#8220;noted.&#8221; It is a description of reflection of the mind &#8211; it is God&#8217;s opinion. </p>
<a name="118"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=18><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tov</font>) in this context signifies whatever enhances, promotes, produces, or is conducive for life. It is the light that God considers &#8220;good,&#8221; not the darkness. Whatever is conducive to life in God&#8217;s creation is good, for God himself is good, and that goodness is reflected in all of his works.</p>
<a name="119"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=19><b>tn</b> The verb &#8220;separate, divide&#8221; here explains how God used the light to dispel the darkness. It did not do away with the darkness completely, but made a separation. The light came alongside the darkness, but they are mutually exclusive &#8211; a theme that will be developed in the Gospel of John (cf. John 1:5).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The idea of separation is critical to this chapter. <i>God separated</i> light from darkness, upper water from lower water, day from night, etc. The verb is important to the Law in general. In Leviticus God separates between clean and unclean, holy and profane (Lev 10:10, 11:47 and 20:24); in Exodus God separates the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place (Exod 26:33). There is a preference for the light over the darkness, just as there will be a preference for the upper waters, the rain water which is conducive to life, over the sea water.</p>
<a name="120"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=20><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;he called to,&#8221; meaning &#8220;he named.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>God called</i>. Seven times in this chapter naming or blessing follows some act of creation. There is clearly a point being made beyond the obvious idea of naming. In the Babylonian creation story <i>Enuma Elish,</i> naming is equal to creating. In the Bible the act of naming, like creating, can be an indication of sovereignty (see 2 Kgs 23:34). In this verse God is sovereign even over the darkness.</p>
<a name="121"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=21><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the darkness he called night.&#8221; The words &#8220;he called&#8221; have not been repeated in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<a name="122"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=22><b>tn</b> Another option is to translate, &#8220;Evening came, and then morning came.&#8221; This formula closes the six days of creation. It seems to follow the Jewish order of reckoning time: from evening to morning. Day one started with the dark, continued through the creation of light, and ended with nightfall. Another alternative would be to translate, &#8220;There was night and then there was day, one day.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The first day</i>. The exegetical evidence suggests the word &#8220;day&#8221; in this chapter refers to a literal twenty-four hour day. It is true that the word can refer to a longer period of time (see Isa 61:2, or the idiom in 2:4, &#8220;in the day,&#8221; that is, &#8220;when&#8221;). But this chapter uses &#8220;day,&#8221; &#8220;night,&#8221; &#8220;morning,&#8221; &#8220;evening,&#8221; &#8220;years,&#8221; and &#8220;seasons.&#8221; Consistency would require sorting out how all these terms could be used to express ages. Also, when the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yom</font>) is used with a numerical adjective, it refers to a literal day. Furthermore, the commandment to keep the sabbath clearly favors this interpretation. One is to work for six days and then rest on the seventh, just as God did when he worked at creation. </p>
<a name="123"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=23><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word refers to an expanse of air pressure between the surface of the sea and the clouds, separating water below from water above. In v. 8 it is called &#8220;sky.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>An expanse</i>. In the poetic texts the writers envision, among other things, something rather strong and shiny, no doubt influencing the traditional translation &#8220;firmament&#8221; (cf. NRSV &#8220;dome&#8221;). Job 37:18 refers to the skies poured out like a molten mirror. Dan 12:3 and Ezek 1:22 portray it as shiny. The sky or atmosphere may have seemed like a glass dome. For a detailed study of the Hebrew conception of the heavens and sky, see L. I. J. Stadelmann, <i>The Hebrew Conception of the World</i> (AnBib), 37-60.</p>
<a name="124"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=24><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the waters from the waters.&#8221;</p>
<a name="125"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=25><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the expanse.&#8221;</p>
<a name="126"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=26><b>tn</b> This statement indicates that it happened the way God designed it, underscoring the connection between word and event. </p>
<a name="127"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=27><b>tn</b> Though the Hebrew word can mean &#8220;heaven,&#8221; it refers in this context to &#8220;the sky.&#8221;</p>
<a name="128"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=28><b>sn</b> <i>Let the water&#8230;be gathered to one place</i>. In the beginning the water covered the whole earth; now the water was to be restricted to an area to form the ocean. The picture is one of the dry land as an island with the sea surrounding it. Again the sovereignty of God is revealed. Whereas the pagans saw the sea as a force to be reckoned with, God controls the boundaries of the sea. And in the judgment at the flood he will blur the boundaries so that chaos returns.</p>
<a name="129"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=29><b>tn</b> When the waters are collected to one place, dry land emerges above the surface of the receding water.</p>
<a name="130"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=30><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;earth,&#8221; but here the term refers to the dry ground as opposed to the sea.</p>
<a name="131"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=31><b>tn</b> The Hebrew construction employs a cognate accusative, where the nominal object (&#8220;vegetation&#8221;) derives from the verbal root employed. It stresses the abundant productivity that God created.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Vegetation</i>. The Hebrew word translated &#8220;vegetation&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">deshe</font>&#8217;) normally means &#8220;grass,&#8221; but here it probably refers more generally to vegetation that includes many of the plants and trees. In the verse the plants and the trees are qualified as self-perpetuating with seeds, but not the word &#8220;vegetation,&#8221; indicating it is the general term and the other two terms are sub-categories of it. Moreover, in vv. 29 and 30 the word vegetation/grass does not appear. The Samaritan Pentateuch adds an &#8220;and&#8221; before the fruit trees, indicating it saw the arrangement as bipartite (The Samaritan Pentateuch tends to eliminate asyndetic constructions). </p>
<a name="132"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=32><b>sn</b> <i>After their kinds</i>. The Hebrew word translated &#8220;kind&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">min</font>) indicates again that God was concerned with defining and dividing time, space, and species. The point is that creation was with order, as opposed to chaos. And what God created and distinguished with boundaries was not to be confused (see Lev 19:19 and Deut 22:9-11). </p>
<a name="133"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=33><b>tn</b> The conjunction &#8220;and&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but has been supplied in the translation to clarify the relationship of the clauses.</p>
<a name="134"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=34><b>sn</b> <i>Let there be lights</i>. Light itself was created before the light-bearers. The order would not seem strange to the ancient Hebrew mind that did not automatically link daylight with the sun (note that dawn and dusk appear to have light without the sun).</p>
<a name="135"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=35><b>tn</b> The language describing the cosmos, which reflects a prescientific view of the world, must be interpreted as phenomenal, describing what appears to be the case. The sun and the moon are not <i>in</i> the sky (below the clouds), but from the viewpoint of a person standing on the earth, they appear that way. Even today we use similar phenomenological expressions, such as &#8220;the sun is rising&#8221; or &#8220;the stars in the sky.&#8221;</p>
<a name="136"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=36><b>tn</b> The text has &#8220;for signs and for seasons and for days and years.&#8221; It seems likely from the meanings of the words involved that &#8220;signs&#8221; is the main idea, followed by two categories, &#8220;seasons&#8221; and &#8220;days and years.&#8221; This is the simplest explanation, and one that matches vv. 11-13. It could even be rendered &#8220;signs for the fixed seasons, that is [explicative <i>vav </i>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>)] days and years.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Let them be for signs</i>. The point is that the sun and the moon were important to fix the days for the seasonal celebrations for the worshiping community.</p>
<a name="137"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=37><b>sn</b> <i>Two great lights</i>. The text goes to great length to discuss the creation of these lights, suggesting that the subject was very important to the ancients. Since these &#8220;lights&#8221; were considered deities in the ancient world, the section serves as a strong polemic (see G. Hasel, &#8220;The Polemical Nature of the Genesis Cosmology,&#8221; <i>EvQ </i>46 [1974]: 81-102). The Book of Genesis is affirming they are created entities, not deities. To underscore this the text does not even give them names. If used here, the usual names for the sun and moon [<i>Shemesh </i>and <i>Yarih</i>, respectively] might have carried pagan connotations, so they are simply described as greater and lesser lights. Moreover, they serve in the capacity that God gives them, which would not be the normal function the pagans ascribed to them. They merely divide, govern, and give light in God&#8217;s creation.</p>
<a name="138"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=38><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the stars.&#8221; Now the term &#8220;stars&#8221; is added as a third object of the verb &#8220;made.&#8221; Perhaps the language is phenomenological, meaning that the stars appeared in the sky from this time forward.</p>
<a name="139"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=39><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;them&#8221;; the referent (the lights mentioned in the preceding verses) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<a name="140"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=40><b>sn</b> In days one to three there is a naming by God; in days five and six there is a blessing by God. But on day four there is neither. It could be a mere stylistic variation. But it could also be a deliberate design to avoid naming &#8220;sun&#8221; and &#8220;moon&#8221; or promoting them beyond what they are, things that God made to serve in his creation.</p>
<a name="141"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=41><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text again uses a cognate construction (&#8220;swarm with swarms&#8221;) to emphasize the abundant fertility. The idea of the verb is one of swift movement back and forth, literally swarming. This verb is used in Exod 1:7 to describe the rapid growth of the Israelite population in bondage.</p>
<a name="142"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=42><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text uses the Polel form of the verb instead of the simple Qal; it stresses a swarming flight again to underscore the abundant fruitfulness.</p>
<a name="143"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=43><b>tn</b> For the first time in the narrative proper the verb &#8220;create&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bara</font>&#8217;) appears. (It is used in the summary statement of v. 1.) The author wishes to underscore that these creatures &#8211; even the great ones &#8211; are part of God&#8217;s perfect creation. The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1504;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tanninim</font>) is used for snakes (Exod 7:9), crocodiles (Ezek 29:3), or other powerful animals (Jer 51:34). In Isa 27:1 the word is used to describe a mythological sea creature that symbolizes God&#8217;s enemies.</p>
<a name="144"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=44><b>tn</b> While the translation &#8220;blessed&#8221; has been retained here for the sake of simplicity, it would be most helpful to paraphrase it as &#8220;God endowed them with fruitfulness&#8221; or something similar, for here it refers to God&#8217;s giving the animals the capacity to reproduce. The expression &#8220;blessed&#8221; needs clarification in its different contexts, for it is one of the unifying themes of the Book of Genesis. The divine blessing occurs after works of creation and is intended to continue that work &#8211; the word of blessing guarantees success. The word means &#8220;to enrich; to endow,&#8221; and the most visible evidence of that enrichment is productivity or fruitfulness. See C. Westermann, <i>Blessing in the Bible and the Life of the Church </i>(OBT).</p>
<a name="145"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=45><b>sn</b> The instruction God gives to creation is properly a fuller expression of the statement just made (&#8220;God blessed them&#8221;), that he enriched them with the ability to reproduce. It is not saying that these were rational creatures who heard and obeyed the word; rather, it stresses that fruitfulness in the animal world is a result of the divine decree and not of some pagan cultic ritual for fruitfulness. The repeated emphasis of &#8220;be fruitful &#8211; multiply &#8211; fill&#8221; adds to this abundance God has given to life. The meaning is underscored by the similar sounds: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">barakh</font>) with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bara</font>&#8217;), and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">parah</font>) with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ravah</font>).</p>
<a name="146"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=46><b>tn</b> There are three groups of land animals here: the cattle or livestock (mostly domesticated), things that creep or move close to the ground (such as reptiles or rodents), and the wild animals (all animals of the field). The three terms are general classifications without specific details.</p>
<a name="147"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=47><b>sn</b> The plural form of the verb has been the subject of much discussion through the years, and not surprisingly several suggestions have been put forward. Many Christian theologians interpret it as an early hint of plurality within the Godhead, but this view imposes later trinitarian concepts on the ancient text. Some have suggested the plural verb indicates majesty, but the plural of majesty is not used with verbs. C. Westermann (<i>Genesis</i>, 1:145) argues for a plural of &#8220;deliberation&#8221; here, but his proposed examples of this use (2 Sam 24:14; Isa 6:8) do not actually support his theory. In 2 Sam 24:14 David uses the plural as representative of all Israel, and in Isa 6:8 the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> speaks on behalf of his heavenly court. In its ancient Israelite context the plural is most naturally understood as referring to God and his heavenly court (see 1 Kgs 22:19-22; Job 1:6-12; 2:1-6; Isa 6:1-8). (The most well-known members of this court are God&#8217;s messengers, or angels. In Gen 3:5 the serpent may refer to this group as &#8220;gods/divine beings.&#8221; See the note on the word &#8220;evil&#8221; in 3:5.) If this is the case, God invites the heavenly court to participate in the creation of humankind (perhaps in the role of offering praise, see Job 38:7), but he himself is the one who does the actual creative work (v. 27). Of course, this view does assume that the members of the heavenly court possess the divine &#8220;image&#8221; in some way. Since the image is closely associated with rulership, perhaps they share the divine image in that they, together with God and under his royal authority, are the executive authority over the world.</p>
<a name="148"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=48><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adam</font>), which can sometimes refer to man, as opposed to woman. The term refers here to humankind, comprised of male and female. The singular is clearly collective (see the plural verb, &#8220;[that] they may rule&#8221; in v. 26b) and the referent is defined specifically as &#8220;male and female&#8221; in v. 27. Usage elsewhere in Gen 1-11 supports this as well. In 5:2 we read: &#8220;Male and female he created them, and he blessed them and called their name &#8216;humankind&#8217; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501;</font>).&#8221; The noun also refers to humankind in 6:1, 5-7 and in 9:5-6.</p>
<a name="149"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=49><b>tn</b> The two prepositions translated &#8220;in&#8221; and &#8220;according to&#8221; have overlapping fields of meaning and in this context seem to be virtually equivalent. In 5:3 they are reversed with the two words. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tselem</font>, &#8220;image&#8221;) is used frequently of statues, models, and images &#8211; replicas (see D. J. A. Clines, &#8220;The Etymology of Hebrew <i>selem</i>,&#8221; <i>JNSL</i> 3 [1974]: 19-25). The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dÿmut</font>, &#8220;likeness&#8221;) is an abstract noun; its verbal root means &#8220;to be like; to resemble.&#8221; In the Book of Genesis the two terms describe human beings who in some way reflect the form and the function of the creator. The form is more likely stressing the spiritual rather than the physical. The &#8220;image of God&#8221; would be the God-given mental and spiritual capacities that enable people to relate to God and to serve him by ruling over the created order as his earthly vice-regents.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>In our image, after our likeness</i>. Similar language is used in the instructions for building the tabernacle. Moses was told to make it &#8220;according to the pattern&#8221; he was shown on the mount (Exod 25:9, 10). Was he shown a form, a replica, of the spiritual sanctuary in the heavenly places? In any case, what was produced on earth functioned as the heavenly sanctuary does, but with limitations.</p>
<a name="150"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=50><b>tn</b> Following the cohortative (&#8220;let us make&#8221;), the prefixed verb form with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) conjunctive indicates purpose/result (see Gen 19:20; 34:23; 2 Sam 3:21). God&#8217;s purpose in giving humankind his image is that they might rule the created order on behalf of the heavenly king and his royal court. So the divine image, however it is defined, gives humankind the capacity and/or authority to rule over creation.</p>
<a name="151"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=51><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;earth&#8221;; the Syriac reads &#8220;wild animals&#8221; (cf. NRSV).</p>

<a name="153"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=53><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has the article prefixed to the noun (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adam</font>). The article does not distinguish man from woman here (&#8220;the man&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;the woman&#8221;), but rather indicates previous reference (see v. 26, where the noun appears without the article). It has the same function as English &#8220;the aforementioned.&#8221;</p>
<a name="154"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=54><b>tn</b> The third person suffix on the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et</font>) is singular here, but collective.</p>
<a name="155"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=55><b>sn</b> The distinction of &#8220;humankind&#8221; as &#8220;male&#8221; and &#8220;female&#8221; is another point of separation in God&#8217;s creation. There is no possibility that the verse is teaching that humans were first androgynous (having both male and female physical characteristics) and afterward were separated. The mention of male and female prepares for the blessing to follow.</p>
<a name="156"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=56><b>tn</b> As in v. 22 the verb &#8220;bless&#8221; here means &#8220;to endow with the capacity to reproduce and be fruitful,&#8221; as the following context indicates. As in v. 22, the statement directly precedes the command &#8220;be fruitful and multiply.&#8221; The verb carries this same nuance in Gen 17:16 (where God&#8217;s blessing of Sarai imparts to her the capacity to bear a child); Gen 48:16 (where God&#8217;s blessing of Joseph&#8217;s sons is closely associated with their having numerous descendants); and Deut 7:13 (where God&#8217;s blessing is associated with fertility in general, including numerous descendants). See also Gen 49:25 (where Jacob uses the noun derivative in referring to &#8220;blessings of the breast and womb,&#8221; an obvious reference to fertility) and Gen 27:27 (where the verb is used of a field to which God has given the capacity to produce vegetation).</p>
<a name="157"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=57><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and God said.&#8221; For stylistic reasons &#8220;God&#8221; has not been repeated here in the translation.</p>
<a name="158"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=58><b>tn</b> Elsewhere the Hebrew verb translated &#8220;subdue&#8221; means &#8220;to enslave&#8221; (2 Chr 28:10; Neh 5:5; Jer 34:11, 16), &#8220;to conquer,&#8221; (Num 32:22, 29; Josh 18:1; 2 Sam 8:11; 1 Chr 22:18; Zech 9:13; and probably Mic 7:19), and &#8220;to assault sexually&#8221; (Esth 7:8). None of these nuances adequately meets the demands of this context, for humankind is not viewed as having an adversarial relationship with the world. The general meaning of the verb appears to be &#8220;to bring under one&#8217;s control for one&#8217;s advantage.&#8221; In Gen 1:28 one might paraphrase it as follows: &#8220;harness its potential and use its resources for your benefit.&#8221; In an ancient Israelite context this would suggest cultivating its fields, mining its mineral riches, using its trees for construction, and domesticating its animals.</p>
<a name="159"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=59><b>sn</b> The several imperatives addressed to both males and females together (plural imperative forms) actually form two commands: reproduce and rule. God&#8217;s word is not merely a form of blessing, but is now addressed to them personally; this is a distinct emphasis with the creation of human beings. But with the blessing comes the ability to be fruitful and to rule. In procreation they will share in the divine work of creating human life and passing on the divine image (see 5:1-3); in ruling they will serve as God&#8217;s vice-regents on earth. They together, the human race collectively, have the responsibility of seeing to the welfare of that which is put under them and the privilege of using it for their benefit.</p>
