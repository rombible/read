<A NAME="3624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2259><b>tn</b> Typically the Hebrew expression &#8220;the River&#8221; refers to the Euphrates River, but it is not certain whether that is the case here. Among the modern English versions which take this as a reference to the Euphrates are NASB, NCV, NRSV, CEV, NLT. Cf. NAB, TEV &#8220;Rehoboth-on-the-River.&#8221;</p>
