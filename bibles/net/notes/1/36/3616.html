<A NAME="3616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2251><b>sn</b> The same pattern of sons, grandsons, and chiefs is now listed for <i>Seir the Horite</i>. &#8220;Seir&#8221; is both the name of the place and the name of the ancestor of these tribes. The name &#8220;Horite&#8221; is probably not to be identified with &#8220;Hurrian.&#8221; The clan of Esau settled in this area, intermarried with these Horites and eventually dispossessed them, so that they all became known as Edomites (Deut 2:12 telescopes the whole development).</p>
