<A NAME="111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=594><b>sn</b> <i>The whole earth</i>. Here &#8220;earth&#8221; is a metonymy of subject, referring to the people who lived in the earth. Genesis 11 begins with everyone speaking a common language, but chap. 10 has the nations arranged by languages. It is part of the narrative art of Genesis to give the explanation of the event after the narration of the event. On this passage see A. P. Ross, &#8220;The Dispersion of the Nations in Genesis 11:1-9,&#8221; <i>BSac</i> 138 (1981): 119-38.</p>
<A NAME="112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=595><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;one lip and one [set of] words.&#8221; The term &#8220;lip&#8221; is a metonymy of cause, putting the instrument for the intended effect. They had one language. The term &#8220;words&#8221; refers to the content of their speech. They had the same vocabulary.</p>
<A NAME="113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=596><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they&#8221;; the referent (the people) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=597><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;from the east&#8221; (NRSV) or &#8220;in the east.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=598><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the land of Shinar.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Shinar</i> is the region of Babylonia.</p>
<A NAME="116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=599><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a man to his neighbor.&#8221; The Hebrew idiom may be translated &#8220;to each other&#8221; or &#8220;one to another.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=600><b>tn</b> The speech contains two cohortatives of exhortation followed by their respective cognate accusatives: &#8220;let us brick bricks&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492; &#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1461;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nilbbÿnah lÿvenim</font>) and &#8220;burn for burning&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1456;&#1508;&#1464;&#1492; &#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1508;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nisrÿfah lisrefah</font>). This stresses the intensity of the undertaking; it also reflects the Akkadian text which uses similar constructions (see E. A. Speiser, <i>Genesis </i>[AB], 75-76).</p>
<A NAME="118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=601><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;bitumen&#8221; (cf. NEB, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=602><b>tn</b> The disjunctive clause gives information parenthetical to the narrative.</p>
<A NAME="1110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=603><b>tn</b> A translation of &#8220;heavens&#8221; for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shamayim</font>) fits this context because the Babylonian ziggurats had temples at the top, suggesting they reached to the heavens, the dwelling place of the gods.</p>
<A NAME="1111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=604><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿna</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aseh</font>, from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;</font>, &#8220;do, make&#8221;) could be either the imperfect or the cohortative with a <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) conjunction (&#8220;and let us make&#8230;&#8221;). Coming after the previous cohortative, this form expresses purpose.</p>
<A NAME="1112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=605><b>tn</b> The Hebrew particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pen</font>) expresses a negative purpose; it means &#8220;that we be not scattered.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=606><b>sn</b> The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1464;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pavats</font>, translated &#8220;scatter&#8221;) is a key term in this passage. The focal point of the account is the dispersion (&#8220;scattering&#8221;) of the nations rather than the Tower of Babel. But the passage also forms a polemic against Babylon, the pride of the east and a cosmopolitan center with a huge ziggurat. To the Hebrews it was a monument to the judgment of God on pride.</p>
<A NAME="1114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=607><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the sons of man.&#8221; The phrase is intended in this polemic to portray the builders as mere mortals, not the lesser deities that the Babylonians claimed built the city.</p>
<A NAME="1115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=608><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text simply has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">banu</font>), but since v. 8 says they left off building the city, an ingressive idea (&#8220;had started building&#8221;) should be understood here.</p>
<A NAME="1116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=609><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and one lip to all of them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=610><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and now.&#8221; The foundational clause beginning with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hen</font>) expresses the condition, and the second clause the result. It could be rendered &#8220;If this&#8230;then now.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=611><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all that they purpose to do will not be withheld from them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=612><b>tn</b> The cohortatives mirror the cohortatives of the people. They build to ascend the heavens; God comes down to destroy their language. God speaks here to his angelic assembly. See the notes on the word &#8220;make&#8221; in 1:26 and &#8220;know&#8221; in 3:5, as well as <i>Jub.</i> 10:22-23, where an angel recounts this incident and says &#8220;And the <sc>Lord our God said to us&#8230;. And the <sc>Lord went down and we went down with him. And we saw the city and the tower which the sons of men built.&#8221; On the chiastic structure of the story, see G. J. Wenham, <i>Genesis</i> (WBC), 1:235.</p>
<A NAME="1120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=613><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they will not hear, a man the lip of his neighbor.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=614><b>tn</b> The infinitive construct <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">livnot</font>, &#8220;building&#8221;) here serves as the object of the verb &#8220;they ceased, stopped,&#8221; answering the question of what they stopped doing.</p>
<A NAME="1122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=615><b>tn</b> The verb has no expressed subject and so can be rendered as a passive in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="1123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=616><b>sn</b> <i>Babel</i>. Here is the climax of the account, a parody on the pride of Babylon. In the Babylonian literature the name <font face="Scholar">bab-ili</font> meant &#8220;the gate of God,&#8221; but in Hebrew it sounds like the word for &#8220;confusion,&#8221; and so retained that connotation. The name &#8220;Babel&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1462;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bavel</font>)<i> </i>and the verb translated &#8220;confused&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">balal</font>) form a paronomasia (sound play). For the many wordplays and other rhetorical devices in Genesis, see J. P. Fokkelman, <i>Narrative Art in Genesis </i>(SSN).</p>
<A NAME="1124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=617><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;other&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but is supplied for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="1125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=618><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;other&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but is supplied for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="1126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=619><b>tc</b> The reading of the MT is followed in vv. 11-12; the LXX reads, &#8220;And [= when] Arphaxad had lived thirty-five years, [and] he fathered [= became the father of] Cainan. And after he fathered [= became the father of] Cainan, Arphaxad lived four hundred and thirty years and fathered [= had] [other] sons and daughters, and [then] he died. And [= when] Cainan had lived one hundred and thirty years, [and] he fathered [= became the father of] Sala [= Shelah]. And after he fathered [= became the father of] Sala [= Shelah], Cainan lived three hundred and thirty years and fathered [= had] [other] sons and daughters, and [then] he died.&#8221; See also the note on &#8220;Shelah&#8221; in Gen 10:24; the LXX reading also appears to lie behind Luke 3:35-36.</p>
<A NAME="1127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=620><b>tn</b> Here and in vv. 16, 19, 21, 23, 25 the word &#8220;other&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but is supplied for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="1128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=621><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>of the Chaldeans</i> is a later editorial clarification for the readers, designating the location of Ur. From all evidence there would have been no Chaldeans in existence at this early date; they are known in the time of the neo-Babylonian empire in the first millennium <sc>b.c.</></p>
<A NAME="1129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=622><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;upon the face of Terah his father.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1130"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=623><b>sn</b> The name <i>Sarai</i> (a variant spelling of &#8220;Sarah&#8221;) means &#8220;princess&#8221; (or &#8220;lady&#8221;). <i>Sharratu</i> was the name of the wife of the moon god Sin. The original name may reflect the culture out of which the patriarch was called, for the family did worship other gods in Mesopotamia.</p>
<A NAME="1131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=624><b>sn</b> The name <i>Milcah</i> means &#8220;Queen.&#8221; But more to the point here is the fact that <i>Malkatu</i> was a title for Ishtar, the daughter of the moon god. If the women were named after such titles (and there is no evidence that this was the motivation for naming the girls &#8220;Princess&#8221; or &#8220;Queen&#8221;), that would not necessarily imply anything about the faith of the two women themselves.</p>
<A NAME="1132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=625><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And the days of Terah were.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=626><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Terah&#8221;; the pronoun has been substituted for the proper name in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
