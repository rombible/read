<A NAME="321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2000><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>angels of God</i> occurs only here and in Gen 28:12 in the OT. Jacob saw a vision of angels just before he left the promised land. Now he encounters angels as he prepares to return to it. The text does not give the details of the encounter, but Jacob&#8217;s response suggests it was amicable. This location was a spot where heaven made contact with earth, and where God made his presence known to the patriarch. See C. Houtman, &#8220;Jacob at Mahanaim: Some Remarks on Genesis XXXII 2-3,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 28 (1978): 37-44.</p>
<A NAME="322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2001><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Jacob said when he saw them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2002><b>sn</b> The name <i>Mahanaim</i> apparently means &#8220;two camps.&#8221; Perhaps the two camps were those of God and of Jacob.</p>
<A NAME="324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2003><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;before him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2004><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;field.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2005><b>sn</b> <i>Your servant</i>. The narrative recounts Jacob&#8217;s groveling in fear before Esau as he calls his brother his &#8220;lord,&#8221; as if to minimize what had been done twenty years ago.</p>
<A NAME="327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2006><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I am sending.&#8221; The form is a preterite with the <i>vav</i> consecutive; it could be rendered as an English present tense &#8211; as the Hebrew perfect/preterite allows &#8211; much like an epistolary aorist in Greek. The form assumes the temporal perspective of the one who reads the message.</p>
<A NAME="328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2007><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;this message&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text, but have been supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2008><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;If Esau comes to one camp and attacks it.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2009><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he said, &#8216;If Esau comes to one camp and attacks it.&#8221; The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amar</font>) here represents Jacob&#8217;s thought or reasoning, and is therefore translated &#8220;he thought.&#8221; The order of the introductory clause and the direct discourse has been rearranged in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="3211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2010><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the surviving camp will be for escape.&#8221; The word &#8220;escape&#8221; is a feminine noun. The term most often refers to refugees from war.</p>
<A NAME="3212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2011><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2012><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the one who said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2013><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will cause good&#8221; or &#8220;I will treat well [or &#8220;favorably&#8221;].&#8221; The idea includes more than prosperity, though that is its essential meaning. Here the form is subordinated to the preceding imperative and indicates purpose or result. Jacob is reminding God of his promise in the hope that God will honor his word.</p>
<A NAME="3215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2014><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the loving deeds and faithfulness&#8221; (see 24:27, 49).</p>

<A NAME="3217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2016><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for with my staff.&#8221; The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1511;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">maqel</font>), traditionally translated &#8220;staff,&#8221; has been rendered as &#8220;walking stick&#8221; because a &#8220;staff&#8221; in contemporary English refers typically to the support personnel in an organization.</p>
<A NAME="3218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2017><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;this Jordan.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2018><b>tn</b> The imperative has the force of a prayer here, not a command.</p>
<A NAME="3220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2019><b>tn</b> The &#8220;hand&#8221; here is a metonymy for &#8220;power.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2020><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2021><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for I am afraid of him, lest he come.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2022><b>sn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;me, [the] mother upon [the] sons.&#8221; The first person pronoun &#8220;me&#8221; probably means here &#8220;me and mine,&#8221; as the following clause suggests.</p>
<A NAME="3224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2023><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;But you, you said.&#8221; One of the occurrences of the pronoun &#8220;you&#8221; has been left untranslated for stylistic reasons.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Some commentators have thought this final verse of the prayer redundant, but it actually follows the predominant form of a lament in which God is motivated to act. The primary motivation Jacob can offer to God is God&#8217;s promise, and so he falls back on that at the end of the prayer.</p>
<A NAME="3225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2024><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;will certainly deal well with you.&#8221; The infinitive absolute appears before the imperfect, underscoring God&#8217;s promise to bless. The statement is more emphatic than in v. 9.</p>
<A NAME="3226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2025><b>tn</b> The form is the perfect tense with a <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive, carrying the nuance of the preceding verb forward.</p>
<A NAME="3227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2026><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;which cannot be counted because of abundance.&#8221; The imperfect verbal form indicates potential here.</p>
<A NAME="3228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2027><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he&#8221;; the referent (Jacob) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2028><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he took from that which was going into his hand,&#8221; meaning that he took some of what belonged to him.</p>
<A NAME="3230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2029><b>sn</b> The Hebrew noun translated <i>gift</i> can in some contexts refer to the tribute paid by a subject to his lord. Such a nuance is possible here, because Jacob refers to Esau as his lord and to himself as Esau&#8217;s servant (v. 4).</p>
<A NAME="3231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2030><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he put them in the hand of.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="3233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2032><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the first&#8221;; this has been specified as &#8220;the servant leading the first herd&#8221; in the translation for clarity.</p>

<A NAME="3236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2035><b>tn</b> The form is the perfect tense with the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive; it has the nuance of an imperfect of instruction.</p>
<A NAME="3237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2036><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;they belong&#8221; have been supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="3238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2037><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to your servant, to Jacob.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2038><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to my lord, to Esau.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=2039><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and look, also he [is] behind us.&#8221; The referent of the pronoun &#8220;he&#8221; (Jacob) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=2040><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And he commanded also the second, also the third, also all the ones going after the herds, saying: &#8216;According to this word you will speak when you find him.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=2041><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and look, your servant Jacob [is] behind us.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2042><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for he said.&#8221; The referent (Jacob) has been specified in the translation for clarity. The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1511;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">maqel</font>), traditionally represents Jacob&#8217;s thought or reasoning, and is therefore translated &#8220;thought.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3244"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=2043><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will appease his face.&#8221; The cohortative here expresses Jacob&#8217;s resolve. In the Book of Leviticus the Hebrew verb translated &#8220;appease&#8221; has the idea of removing anger due to sin or guilt, a nuance that fits this passage very well. Jacob wanted to buy Esau off with a gift of more than five hundred and fifty animals.</p>
<A NAME="3245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=2044><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;with a gift going before me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3246"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=2045><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will see his face.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3247"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=2046><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Perhaps he will lift up my face.&#8221; In this context the idiom refers to acceptance.</p>
<A NAME="3248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=2047><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the gift passed over upon his face.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3249"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=2048><b>tn</b> The disjunctive clause is circumstantial/temporal.</p>
<A NAME="3250"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=2049><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he arose in that night and he took.&#8221; The first verb is adverbial, indicating that he carried out the crossing right away.</p>
<A NAME="3251"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=2050><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term used here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yeled</font>) which typically describes male offspring. Some translations render the term &#8220;children&#8221; but this is a problem because by this time Jacob had twelve children in all, including one daughter, Dinah, born to Leah (Gen 30:21). Benjamin, his twelfth son and thirteenth child, was not born until later (Gen 35:16-19).</p>
<A NAME="3252"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=2051><b>sn</b> Hebrew narrative style often includes a summary statement of the whole passage followed by a more detailed report of the event. Here v. 22 is the summary statement, while v. 23 begins the detailed account.</p>
<A NAME="3253"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=2052><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he sent across what he had.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3254"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=2053><b>sn</b> Reflecting Jacob&#8217;s perspective at the beginning of the encounter, the narrator calls the opponent simply &#8220;a man.&#8221; Not until later in the struggle does Jacob realize his true identity.</p>
<A NAME="3255"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=2054><b>sn</b> The verb translated &#8220;wrestled&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1461;&#1511;</font>, <font face="Scholar">vayye</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aveq</font>) sounds in Hebrew like the names &#8220;Jacob&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1511;&#1465;&#1489;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aqov</font>) and &#8220;Jabbok&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1511;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yabboq</font>). In this way the narrator links the setting, the main action, and the main participant together in the mind of the reader or hearer.</p>
<A NAME="3256"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=2055><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;until the rising of the dawn.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3257"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=2056><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (the man) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3258"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=2057><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;him&#8221;; the referent (Jacob) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3259"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=2058><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;injured&#8221;; traditionally &#8220;touched.&#8221; The Hebrew verb translated &#8220;struck&#8221; has the primary meanings &#8220;to touch; to reach; to strike.&#8221; It can, however, carry the connotation &#8220;to harm; to molest; to injure.&#8221; God&#8217;s &#8220;touch&#8221; cripples Jacob &#8211; it would be comparable to a devastating blow.</p>
<A NAME="3260"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=2059><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (the man) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>

<A NAME="3262"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=2061><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he said, &#8216;I will not let you go.&#8217;&#8221; The referent of the pronoun &#8220;he&#8221; (Jacob) has been specified for clarity, and the order of the introductory clause and the direct discourse has been rearranged in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="3263"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=2062><b>sn</b> Jacob wrestled with a man thinking him to be a mere man, and on that basis was equal to the task. But when it had gone on long enough, the night visitor touched Jacob and crippled him. Jacob&#8217;s request for a blessing can only mean that he now knew that his opponent was supernatural. Contrary to many allegorical interpretations of the passage that make fighting equivalent to prayer, this passage shows that Jacob stopped fighting, and then asked for a blessing.</p>
<A NAME="3264"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=2063><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he said to him.&#8221; The referent of the pronoun &#8220;he&#8221; (the man who wrestled with Jacob) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3265"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=2064><b>sn</b> <i>What is your name?</i> The question is rhetorical, since the <sc>Lord obviously knew Jacob&#8217;s identity. But since the <sc>Lord is going to change Jacob&#8217;s name, this question is designed to bring focus Jacob&#8217;s attention on all that his name had come to signify.</p>
<A NAME="3266"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=2065><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he said.&#8221; The referent of the pronoun &#8220;he&#8221; (the man who wrestled with Jacob) has been specified for clarity, and the order of the introductory clause and the direct discourse has been rearranged in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="3267"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=2066><b>sn</b> The name <i>Israel</i> is a common construction, using a verb with a theophoric element (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;</font>, <i>&#8217;el</i>) that usually indicates the subject of the verb. Here it means &#8220;God fights.&#8221; This name will replace the name Jacob; it will be both a promise and a call for faith. In essence, the <sc>Lord was saying that Jacob would have victory and receive the promises because God would fight for him.</p>
<A NAME="3268"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=2067><b>sn</b> <i>You have fought</i>. The explanation of the name Israel includes a sound play. In Hebrew the verb translated &#8220;you have fought&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;</font>, <font face="Scholar">sarita</font>) sounds like the name &#8220;Israel&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yisra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font> ), meaning &#8220;God fights&#8221; (although some interpret the meaning as &#8220;he fights [with] God&#8221;). The name would evoke the memory of the fight and what it meant. A. Dillmann says that ever after this the name would tell the Israelites that, when Jacob contended successfully with God, he won the battle with man (<i>Genesis</i>, 2:279). To be successful with God meant that he had to be crippled in his own self-sufficiency (A. P. Ross, &#8220;Jacob at the Jabboq, Israel at Peniel,&#8221; <i>BSac</i> 142 [1985]: 51-62).</p>
<A NAME="3269"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=2068><b>sn</b> <i>Tell me your name</i>. In primitive thought to know the name of a deity or supernatural being would enable one to use it for magical manipulation or power (A. S. Herbert, <i>Genesis 12-50</i> [TBC], 108). For a thorough structural analysis of the passage discussing the plays on the names and the request of Jacob, see R. Barthes, &#8220;The Struggle with the Angel: Textual Analysis of Genesis 32:23-33,&#8221; <i>Structural Analysis and Biblical Exegesis</i> (PTMS), 21-33.</p>

<A NAME="3272"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=2071><b>tn</b> The verb here means that the <sc>Lord endowed Jacob with success; he would be successful in everything he did, including meeting Esau.</p>

It was commonly understood that no one could see God and live (Gen 48:16; Exod 19:21, 24:10; and Judg 6:11, 22). On the surface Jacob seems to be saying that he saw God and survived. But the statement may have a double meaning, in light of his prayer for deliverance in v. 11. Jacob recognizes that he has survived his encounter with God and that his safety has now been guaranteed.</p>
<A NAME="3279"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">79</span><note=2078><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;shone.&#8221;</p>
