<A NAME="2030"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1152><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb is plural. This may be a case of grammatical agreement with the name for God, which is plural in form. However, when this plural name refers to the one true God, accompanying predicates are usually singular in form. Perhaps Abraham is accommodating his speech to Abimelech&#8217;s polytheistic perspective. (See GKC 463 §145.<i>i</i>.) If so, one should translate, &#8220;when the gods made me wander.&#8221;</p>
