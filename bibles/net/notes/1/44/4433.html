<A NAME="4433"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2762><b>sn</b> <i>You are just like Pharaoh</i>. Judah&#8217;s speech begins with the fear and trembling of one who stands condemned. Joseph has as much power as Pharaoh, either to condemn or to pardon. Judah will make his appeal, wording his speech in such a way as to appeal to Joseph&#8217;s compassion for the father, whom he mentions no less than fourteen times in the speech.</p>
