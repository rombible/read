<A NAME="4424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2753><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;What is this deed you have done?&#8221; The demonstrative pronoun (&#8220;this&#8221;) adds emphasis to the question. A literal translation seems to contradict the following statement, in which Joseph affirms that he is able to divine such matters. Thus here the emotive force of the question has been reflected in the translation, &#8220;What did you think you were doing?&#8221;</p>
