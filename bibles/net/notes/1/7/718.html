<A NAME="718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=374><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tÿhom</font>, &#8220;deep&#8221;) refers to the watery deep, the salty ocean &#8211; especially the primeval ocean that surrounds and underlies the earth (see Gen 1:2).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The watery deep</i>. The same Hebrew term used to describe the watery deep in Gen 1:2 (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tihom</font>) appears here. The text seems to picture here subterranean waters coming from under the earth and contributing to the rapid rise of water. The significance seems to be, among other things, that in this judgment God was returning the world to its earlier condition of being enveloped with water &#8211; a judgment involving the reversal of creation. On Gen 7:11 see G. F. Hasel, &#8220;The Fountains of the Great Deep,&#8221; <i>Origins</i> 1 (1974): 67-72; idem, &#8220;The Biblical View of the Extent of the Flood,&#8221; <i>Origins</i> 2 (1975): 77-95.</p>
