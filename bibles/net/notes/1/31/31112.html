<A NAME="31112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">112</span><note=1992><b>tn</b> <i>The God of Abraham and the god of Nahor</i>. The Hebrew verb translated &#8220;judge&#8221; is plural, suggesting that Laban has more than one &#8220;god&#8221; in mind. The Samaritan Pentateuch and the LXX, apparently in an effort to make the statement monotheistic, have a singular verb. In this case one could translate, &#8220;May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.&#8221; However, Laban had a polytheistic world view, as evidenced by his possession of household idols (cf. 31:19). The translation uses &#8220;God&#8221; when referring to Abraham&#8217;s God, for Genesis makes it clear that Abraham worshiped the one true God. It employs &#8220;god&#8221; when referring to Nahor&#8217;s god, for in the Hebrew text Laban refers to a different god here, probably one of the local deities.</p>
