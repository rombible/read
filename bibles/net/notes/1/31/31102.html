<A NAME="31102"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">102</span><note=1982><b>sn</b> <i>Galeed</i> also means &#8220;witness pile&#8221; or &#8220;the pile is a witness,&#8221; but this name is Canaanite or Western Semitic and closer to later Hebrew. Jacob, though certainly capable of speaking Aramaic, here prefers to use the western dialect.</p>
