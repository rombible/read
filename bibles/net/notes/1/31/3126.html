<A NAME="3126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1906><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;our money.&#8221; The word &#8220;money&#8221; is used figuratively here; it means the price paid for Leah and Rachel. A literal translation (&#8220;our money&#8221;) makes it sound as if Laban wasted money that belonged to Rachel and Leah, rather than the money paid for them.</p>
