<A NAME="312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1882><b>sn</b> The Hebrew word translated &#8220;gotten rich&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">cavod</font>) has the basic idea of &#8220;weight.&#8221; If one is heavy with possessions, then that one is wealthy (13:2). Abraham, Jacob, and Joseph all became wealthy when they left the promised land. Jacob&#8217;s wealth foreshadows what will happen to Israel when they leave the land of Egypt (Exod 12:35-38).</p>
