<A NAME="3160"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=1940><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Jacob answered and said to Laban, &#8216;Because I was afraid.&#8217;&#8221; This statement is a not a response to the question about Laban&#8217;s household gods that immediately precedes, but to the earlier question about Jacob&#8217;s motivation for leaving so quickly and secretly (see v. 27). For this reason the words &#8220;I left secretly&#8221; are supplied in the translation to indicate the connection to Laban&#8217;s earlier question in v. 27. Additionally the order of the introductory clause and the direct discourse have been rearranged in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
