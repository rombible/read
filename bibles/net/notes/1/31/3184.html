<A NAME="3184"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">84</span><note=1964><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from my hand you exacted it.&#8221; The imperfect verbal form again indicates that this was a customary or typical action. The words &#8220;for every missing animal&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarity; the following clause in Hebrew, &#8220;stolen by day or stolen by night,&#8221; probably means &#8220;stolen by wild beasts&#8221; and refers to the same animals &#8220;torn by wild beasts&#8221; in the previous clause, although it may refer to animals stolen by people. The translation used here, &#8220;missing,&#8221; is ambiguous enough to cover either eventuality.</p>
