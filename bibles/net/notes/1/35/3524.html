<A NAME="3524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2209><b>tn</b> The name <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500; &#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el shadday</font>, &#8220;El Shaddai&#8221;) has often been translated &#8220;God Almighty,&#8221; primarily because Jerome translated it <i>omnipotens</i> (&#8220;all powerful&#8221;) in the Latin Vulgate. There has been much debate over the meaning of the name. For discussion see W. F. Albright,<i> </i>&#8220;The Names <i>Shaddai</i> and <i>Abram</i>,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 54 (1935): 173-210; R. Gordis, &#8220;The Biblical Root <i>sdy-sd</i>,&#8221; <i>JTS</i> 41 (1940): 34-43; and especially T. N. D. Mettinger, <i>In Search of God</i>, 69-72. Shaddai/El Shaddai is the sovereign king of the world who grants, blesses, and judges. In the Book of Genesis he blesses the patriarchs with fertility and promises numerous descendants. Outside Genesis he both blesses/protects and takes away life/happiness. The patriarchs knew God primarily as El Shaddai (Exod 6:3). While the origin and meaning of this name are uncertain its significance is clear. The name is used in contexts where God appears as the source of fertility and life. For a fuller discussion see the note on &#8220;sovereign God&#8221; in Gen 17:1.</p>
