<A NAME="3535"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2220><b>tn</b> The construction uses a Hiphil infinitive, which E. A. Speiser classifies as an elative Hiphil. The contrast is with the previous Piel: there &#8220;she had hard labor,&#8221; and here, &#8220;her labor was at its hardest.&#8221; Failure to see this, Speiser notes, has led to redundant translations and misunderstandings (<i>Genesis</i> [AB], 273). </p>
