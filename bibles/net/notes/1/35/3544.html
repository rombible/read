By having sex with Bilhah, Reuben (Leah&#8217;s oldest son) would have prevented Bilhah from succeeding Rachel as the favorite wife, and by sleeping with his father&#8217;s concubine he would also be attempting to take over leadership of the clan &#8211; something Absalom foolishly attempted later on in Israel&#8217;s history (2 Sam 16:21-22).</p>
