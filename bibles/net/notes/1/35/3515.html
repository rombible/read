<A NAME="3515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2200><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the fear of God was upon the cities which were round about them.&#8221; The expression &#8220;fear of God&#8221; apparently refers (1) to a fear of God (objective genitive; God is the object of their fear). (2) But it could mean &#8220;fear from God,&#8221; that is, fear which God placed in them (cf. NRSV &#8220;a terror from God&#8221;). Another option (3) is that the divine name is used as a superlative here, referring to &#8220;tremendous fear&#8221; (cf. NEB &#8220;were panic-stricken&#8221;; NASB &#8220;a great terror&#8221;).</p>
