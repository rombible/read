<A NAME="3539"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2224><b>tn</b> The disjunctive clause is contrastive.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>His father called him Benjamin</i>. There was a preference for giving children good or positive names in the ancient world, and &#8220;son of my suffering&#8221; would not do (see the incident in 1 Chr 4:9-10), because it would be a reminder of the death of Rachel (in this connection, see also D. Daube, &#8220;The Night of Death,&#8221; <i>HTR </i>61 [1968]: 629-32). So Jacob named him <i>Benjamin</i>, which means &#8220;son of the [or &#8220;my&#8221;] right hand.&#8221; The name Benjamin appears in the Mari texts. There have been attempts to connect this name to the resident tribe listed at Mari, &#8220;sons of the south&#8221; (since the term &#8220;right hand&#8221; can also mean &#8220;south&#8221; in Hebrew), but this assumes a different reading of the story. See J. Muilenburg, &#8220;The Birth of Benjamin,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 75 (1956): 194-201.</p>
