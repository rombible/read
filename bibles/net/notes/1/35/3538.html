<A NAME="3538"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2223><b>sn</b> The name <i>Ben-Oni</i> means &#8220;son of my suffering.&#8221; It is ironic that Rachel&#8217;s words to Jacob in Gen 30:1, &#8220;Give me children or I&#8217;ll die,&#8221; take a different turn here, for it was having the child that brought about her death.</p>
