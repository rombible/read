<A NAME="3529"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2214><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Jacob set up a sacred pillar in the place where he spoke with him, a sacred pillar of stone&#8221; (see the notes on the term &#8220;sacred stone&#8221; in Gen 28:18). This passage stands parallel to Gen 28:18-19, where Jacob set up a sacred stone, poured oil on it, and called the place Bethel. Some commentators see these as two traditions referring to the same event, but it is more likely that Jacob reconsecrated the place in fulfillment of the vow he had made here earlier. In support of this is the fact that the present narrative alludes to and is built on the previous one.</p>
