<A NAME="3543"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2228><b>sn</b> The location of <i>Migdal Eder </i>is not given. It appears to be somewhere between Bethlehem and Hebron. Various traditions have identified it as at the shepherds&#8217; fields near Bethlehem (the Hebrew name <i>Migdal Eder</i> means &#8220;tower of the flock&#8221;; see Mic 4:8) or located it near Solomon&#8217;s pools.</p>
