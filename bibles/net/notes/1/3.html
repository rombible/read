<A NAME="31"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=140><b>tn</b> The chapter begins with a disjunctive clause (conjunction + subject + predicate) that introduces a new character and a new scene in the story. </p>
<A NAME="32"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=141><b>sn</b> Many theologians identify or associate <i>the serpent</i> with Satan. In this view Satan comes in the disguise of a serpent or speaks through a serpent. This explains the serpent&#8217;s capacity to speak. While later passages in the Bible may indicate there was a satanic presence behind the serpent (see, for example, Rev 12:9), the immediate context pictures the serpent as simply one of the animals of the field created by God (see vv. 1, 14). An ancient Jewish interpretation explains the reference to the serpent in a literal manner, attributing the capacity to speak to all the animals in the orchard. This text (<i>Jub.</i> 3:28) states, &#8220;On that day [the day the man and woman were expelled from the orchard] the mouth of all the beasts and cattle and birds and whatever walked or moved was stopped from speaking because all of them used to speak to one another with one speech and one language [presumed to be Hebrew, see 12:26].&#8221; Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 1.1.4 (1.41) attributes the serpent&#8217;s actions to jealousy. He writes that &#8220;the serpent, living in the company of Adam and his wife, grew jealous of the blessings which he supposed were destined for them if they obeyed God&#8217;s behests, and, believing that disobedience would bring trouble on them, he maliciously persuaded the woman to taste of the tree of wisdom.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="33"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=142><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arum</font>) basically means &#8220;clever.&#8221; This idea then polarizes into the nuances &#8220;cunning&#8221; (in a negative sense, see Job 5:12; 15:5), and &#8220;prudent&#8221; in a positive sense (Prov 12:16, 23; 13:16; 14:8, 15, 18; 22:3; 27:12). This same polarization of meaning can be detected in related words derived from the same root (see Exod 21:14; Josh 9:4; 1 Sam 23:22; Job 5:13; Ps 83:3). The negative nuance obviously applies in Gen 3, where the snake attempts to talk the woman into disobeying God by using half-truths and lies.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> There is a wordplay in Hebrew between the words &#8220;naked&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">arummim</font>) in 2:25 and &#8220;shrewd&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">arum</font>) in 3:1. The point seems to be that the integrity of the man and the woman is the focus of the serpent&#8217;s craftiness. At the beginning they are naked and he is shrewd; afterward, they will be covered and he will be cursed.</p>
<A NAME="34"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=143><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;animals of the field.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="35"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=144><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Indeed that God said.&#8221; The beginning of the quotation is elliptical and therefore difficult to translate. One must supply a phrase like &#8220;is it true&#8221;: &#8220;Indeed, [is it true] that God said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="36"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=145><b>sn</b> <i>God</i>. The serpent does not use the expression &#8220;Yahweh God&#8221; [<sc>Lord God] because there is no covenant relationship involved between God and the serpent. He only speaks of &#8220;God.&#8221; In the process the serpent draws the woman into his manner of speech so that she too only speaks of &#8220;God.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="37"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=146><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;you must not eat from all the tree[s] of the orchard.&#8221; After the negated prohibitive verb, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mikkol</font>, &#8220;from all&#8221;) has the meaning &#8220;from any.&#8221; Note the construction in Lev 18:26, where the statement &#8220;you must not do from all these abominable things&#8221; means &#8220;you must not do <i>any</i> of these abominable things.&#8221; See Lev 22:25 and Deut 28:14 as well.</p>
<A NAME="38"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=147><b>tn</b> There is a notable change between what the <sc>Lord God had said and what the woman says. God said &#8220;you may freely eat&#8221; (the imperfect with the infinitive absolute, see 2:16), but the woman omits the emphatic infinitive, saying simply &#8220;we may eat.&#8221; Her words do not reflect the sense of eating to her heart&#8217;s content.</p>
<A NAME="39"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=148><b>sn</b> <i>And you must not touch it</i>. The woman adds to God&#8217;s prohibition, making it say more than God expressed. G. von Rad observes that it is as though she wanted to set a law for herself by means of this exaggeration (<i>Genesis </i>[OTL], 86).</p>
<A NAME="310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=149><b>tn</b> The Hebrew construction is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pen</font>) with the imperfect tense, which conveys a negative purpose: &#8220;lest you die&#8221; = &#8220;in order that you not die.&#8221; By stating the warning in this way, the woman omits the emphatic infinitive used by God (&#8220;you shall surely die,&#8221; see 2:17).</p>
<A NAME="311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=150><b>tn</b> The response of the serpent includes the infinitive absolute with a blatant negation equal to saying: &#8220;Not &#8211; you will surely die&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488; &#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514; &#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1502;&#1467;&#1514;&#1506;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> mot tÿmutun</font>). The construction makes this emphatic because normally the negative particle precedes the finite verb. The serpent is a liar, denying that there is a penalty for sin (see John 8:44).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Surely you will not die</i>. Here the serpent is more aware of what the <sc>Lord God said than the woman was; he simply adds a blatant negation to what God said. In the account of Jesus&#8217; temptation Jesus is victorious because he knows the scripture better than Satan (Matt 4:1-11).</p>
<A NAME="312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=151><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;you will have understanding.&#8221; This obviously refers to the acquisition of the &#8220;knowledge of good and evil,&#8221; as the next statement makes clear.</p>
<A NAME="313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=152><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;like God, knowing.&#8221; It is unclear how the plural participle translated &#8220;knowing&#8221; is functioning. On the one hand, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1465;&#1491;&#1456;&#1506;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yodÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">e</font>) could be taken as a substantival participle functioning as a predicative adjective in the sentence. In this case one might translate: &#8220;You will be, like God himself, knowers of good and evil.&#8221; On the other hand, it could be taken as an attributive adjective modifying <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohim</font>). In this case <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> has to be taken as a numerical plural referring to &#8220;gods,&#8221; &#8220;divine beings,&#8221; for if the one true God were the intended referent, a singular form of the participle would almost certainly appear as a modifier. Following this line of interpretation, one could translate, &#8220;You will be like divine beings who know good and evil.&#8221; The following context may favor this translation, for in 3:22 God says to an unidentified group, &#8220;Look, the man has become like one of <i>us</i>, knowing good and evil.&#8221; It is probable that God is addressing his heavenly court (see the note on the word &#8220;make&#8221; in 1:26), the members of which can be called &#8220;gods&#8221; or &#8220;divine beings&#8221; from the ancient Israelite perspective. (We know some of these beings as messengers or &#8220;angels.&#8221;) An examination of parallel constructions shows that a predicative understanding (&#8220;you will be, like God himself, knowers of good and evil,&#8221; cf. NIV, NRSV) is possible, but rare (see Gen 27:23, where &#8220;hairy&#8221; is predicative, complementing the verb &#8220;to be&#8221;). The statistical evidence strongly suggests that the participle is attributive, modifying &#8220;divine beings&#8221; (see Ps 31:12; Isa 1:30; 13:14; 16:2; 29:5; 58:11; Jer 14:9; 20:9; 23:9; 31:12; 48:41; 49:22; Hos 7:11; Amos 4:11). In all of these texts, where a comparative clause and accompanying adjective/participle follow a copulative (&#8220;to be&#8221;) verb, the adjective/participle is attributive after the noun in the comparative clause.</p>
<A NAME="314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=153><b>sn</b> <i>You will be like divine beings who know good and evil</i>. The serpent raises doubts about the integrity of God. He implies that the only reason for the prohibition was that God was protecting the divine domain. If the man and woman were to eat, they would enter into that domain. The temptation is to overstep divinely established boundaries. (See D. E. Gowan, <i>When Man Becomes God </i>[PTMS], 25.)</p>
<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=154><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And the woman saw.&#8221; The clause can be rendered as a temporal clause subordinate to the following verb in the sequence.</p>
<A NAME="316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=155><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;that the tree was good for food.&#8221; The words &#8220;produced fruit that was&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text, but are implied.</p>
<A NAME="317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=156><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ta</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avah</font>, translated &#8220;attractive&#8221; here) actually means &#8220;desirable.&#8221; This term and the later term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1495;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nekhmad</font>, &#8220;desirable&#8221;) are synonyms.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Attractive </i>(<i>Heb</i> &#8220;desirable&#8221;)<i>&#8230;desirable</i>. These are different words in Hebrew. The verbal roots for both of these forms appear in Deut 5:21 in the prohibition against coveting. Strong desires usually lead to taking.</p>
<A NAME="318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=157><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;that good was the tree for food, and that desirable it was to the eyes, and desirable was the tree to make one wise.&#8221; On the connection between moral wisdom and the &#8220;knowledge of good and evil,&#8221; see the note on the word &#8220;evil&#8221; in 2:9.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Desirable for making one wise</i>. The quest for wisdom can follow the wrong course, as indeed it does here. No one can become like God by disobeying God. It is that simple. The Book of Proverbs stresses that obtaining wisdom begins with the fear of God that is evidenced through obedience to his word. Here, in seeking wisdom, Eve disobeys God and ends up afraid of God.</p>
<A NAME="319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=158><b>tn</b> The pronoun &#8220;it&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but is supplied (here and also after &#8220;ate&#8221; at the end of this verse) for stylistic reasons.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>She took&#8230;and ate it</i>. The critical word now discloses the disobedience: &#8220;[she] ate.&#8221; Since the <sc>Lord God had said, &#8220;You shall not eat,&#8221; the main point of the divine inquisition will be, &#8220;Did you eat,&#8221; meaning, &#8220;did you disobey the command?&#8221; The woman ate, being deceived by the serpent (1 Tim 2:14), but then the man ate, apparently willingly when the woman gave him the fruit (see Rom 5:12, 17-19).</p>
<A NAME="320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=159><b>sn</b> This pericope (3:1-7) is a fine example of Hebrew narrative structure. After an introductory disjunctive clause that introduces a new character and sets the stage (3:1), the narrative tension develops through dialogue, culminating in the action of the story. Once the dialogue is over, the action is told in a rapid sequence of verbs &#8211; she took, she ate, she gave, and he ate.</p>
<A NAME="321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=160><b>tn</b> The Hitpael participle of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">halakh</font>, &#8220;to walk, to go&#8221;) here has an iterative sense, &#8220;moving&#8221; or &#8220;going about.&#8221; While a translation of &#8220;walking about&#8221; is possible, it assumes a theophany, the presence of the <sc>Lord God in a human form. This is more than the text asserts.</p>
<A NAME="322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=161><b>tn</b> The expression is traditionally rendered &#8220;cool of the day,&#8221; because the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ruakh</font>) can mean &#8220;wind.&#8221; U. Cassuto (<i>Genesis: From Adam to Noah</i>, 152-54) concludes after lengthy discussion that the expression refers to afternoon when it became hot and the sun was beginning to decline. J. J. Niehaus (<i>God at Sinai</i> [SOTBT], 155-57) offers a different interpretation of the phrase, relating <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yom</font>, usually understood as &#8220;day&#8221;) to an Akkadian cognate <font face="Scholar">umu</font> (&#8220;storm&#8221;) and translates the phrase &#8220;in the wind of the storm.&#8221; If Niehaus is correct, then God is not pictured as taking an afternoon stroll through the orchard, but as coming in a powerful windstorm to confront the man and woman with their rebellion. In this case <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500; &#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qol yÿhvah</font>, &#8220;sound of the <sc>Lord&#8221;) may refer to God&#8217;s thunderous roar, which typically accompanies his appearance in the storm to do battle or render judgment (e.g., see Ps 29).</p>
<A NAME="323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=162><b>tn</b> The verb used here is the Hitpael, giving the reflexive idea (&#8220;they hid themselves&#8221;). In v. 10, when Adam answers the <sc>Lord, the Niphal form is used with the same sense: &#8220;I hid.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=163><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qara</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to call&#8221;) followed by the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</font> or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el-</font> or <font face="Scholar">lÿ</font>, &#8220;to, unto&#8221;) often carries the connotation of &#8220;summon.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=164><b>sn</b> <i>Where are you?</i> The question is probably rhetorical (a figure of speech called erotesis) rather than literal, because it was spoken to the man, who answers it with an explanation of <i>why</i> he was hiding rather than a location. The question has more the force of &#8220;Why are you hiding?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=165><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and he said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=166><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;your sound.&#8221; If one sees a storm theophany here (see the note on the word &#8220;time&#8221; in v. 8), then one could translate, &#8220;your powerful voice.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=167><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and he said.&#8221; The referent (the <sc>Lord God) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=168><b>sn</b> <i>Who told you that you were naked?</i> This is another rhetorical question, asking more than what it appears to ask. The second question in the verse reveals the <sc>Lord God&#8217;s real concern.</p>
<A NAME="330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=169><b>sn</b> The Hebrew word order (&#8220;Did you from the tree &#8211; which I commanded you not to eat from it &#8211; eat?&#8221;) is arranged to emphasize that the man&#8217;s and the woman&#8217;s eating of the fruit was an act of disobedience. The relative clause inserted immediately after the reference to the tree brings out this point very well.</p>
<A NAME="331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=170><b>tn</b> The Hebrew construction in this sentence uses an independent nominative absolute (formerly known as a <i>casus pendens</i>). &#8220;The woman&#8221; is the independent nominative absolute; it is picked up by the formal subject, the pronoun &#8220;she&#8221; written with the verb (&#8220;she gave&#8221;). The point of the construction is to throw the emphasis on &#8220;the woman.&#8221; But what makes this so striking is that a relative clause has been inserted to explain what is meant by the reference to the woman: &#8220;whom you gave me.&#8221; Ultimately, the man is blaming God for giving him the woman who (from the man&#8217;s viewpoint) caused him to sin.</p>
<A NAME="332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=171><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;some fruit&#8221; here and the pronoun &#8220;it&#8221; at the end of the sentence are not in the Hebrew text, but are supplied for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=172><b>tn</b> The use of the demonstrative pronoun is enclitic, serving as an undeclined particle for emphasis. It gives the sense of &#8220;What in the world have you done?&#8221; (see R. J. Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 24, §118).</p>
<A NAME="334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=173><b>sn</b> The Hebrew word order puts the subject (&#8220;the serpent&#8221;) before the verb here, giving prominence to it.</p>
<A NAME="335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=174><b>tn</b> This verb (the Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nasha</font>) is used elsewhere of a king or god misleading his people into false confidence (2 Kgs 18:29 = 2 Chr 32:15 = Isa 36:14; 2 Kgs 19:10 = Isa 37:10), of an ally deceiving a partner (Obad 7), of God deceiving his sinful people as a form of judgment (Jer 4:10), of false prophets instilling their audience with false hope (Jer 29:8), and of pride and false confidence producing self-deception (Jer 37:9; 49:16; Obad 3). </p>
<A NAME="336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=175><b>sn</b> Note that God asks no question of the serpent, does not call for confession, as he did to the man and the woman; there is only the announcement of the curse. The order in this section is chiastic: The man is questioned, the woman is questioned, the serpent is cursed, sentence is passed on the woman, sentence is passed on the man.</p>
<A NAME="337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=176><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word translated &#8220;cursed,&#8221; a passive participle from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arar</font>), either means &#8220;punished&#8221; or &#8220;banished,&#8221; depending on how one interprets the following preposition. If the preposition is taken as comparative, then the idea is &#8220;cursed [i.e., punished] are you above [i.e., more than] all the wild beasts.&#8221; In this case the comparative preposition reflects the earlier comparison: The serpent was more shrewd than all others, and so more cursed than all others. If the preposition is taken as separative (see the note on the word &#8220;ground&#8221; in 4:11), then the idea is &#8220;cursed and banished from all the wild beasts.&#8221; In this case the serpent is condemned to isolation from all the other animals.</p>
<A NAME="338"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=177><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;go&#8221;; &#8220;walk,&#8221; but in English &#8220;crawl&#8221; or &#8220;slither&#8221; better describes a serpent&#8217;s movement.</p>
<A NAME="339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=178><b>sn</b> <i>Dust you will eat</i>. Being restricted to crawling on the ground would necessarily involve &#8220;eating dust,&#8221; although that is not the diet of the serpent. The idea of being brought low, of &#8220;eating dust&#8221; as it were, is a symbol of humiliation.</p>
<A NAME="340"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=179><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word translated &#8220;hostility&#8221; is derived from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ev</font>, &#8220;to be hostile, to be an adversary [or enemy]&#8221;). The curse announces that there will be continuing hostility between the serpent and the woman. The serpent will now live in a &#8220;battle zone,&#8221; as it were.</p>
<A NAME="341"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=180><b>sn</b> The Hebrew word translated &#8220;offspring&#8221; is a collective singular. The text anticipates the ongoing struggle between human beings (the woman&#8217;s offspring) and deadly poisonous snakes (the serpent&#8217;s offspring). An ancient Jewish interpretation of the passage states: &#8220;He made the serpent, cause of the deceit, press the earth with belly and flank, having bitterly driven him out.

Though the conflict will actually involve the serpent&#8217;s offspring (snakes) and the woman&#8217;s offspring (human beings), v. 15b for rhetorical effect depicts the conflict as being between the serpent and the woman&#8217;s offspring, as if the serpent will outlive the woman. The statement is personalized for the sake of the addressee (the serpent) and reflects the ancient Semitic concept of corporate solidarity, which emphasizes the close relationship between a progenitor and his offspring. Note Gen 28:14, where the <sc>Lord says to Jacob, &#8220;Your offspring will be like the dust of the earth, and you [second masculine singular] will spread out in all directions.&#8221; Jacob will &#8220;spread out&#8221; in all directions through his offspring, but the text states the matter as if this will happen to him personally.</p>

The singular pronoun agrees grammatically with the collective singular noun &#8220;offspring.&#8221; For other examples of singular verb and pronominal forms being used with the collective singular &#8220;offspring,&#8221; see Gen 16:10; 22:17; 24:60. The word &#8220;heel&#8221; is an adverbial accusative, locating the blow. A bite on the heel from a poisonous serpent is potentially fatal.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The etiological nature of v. 15 is apparent, though its relevance for modern western man is perhaps lost because we rarely come face to face with poisonous snakes. Ancient Israelites, who often encountered snakes in their daily activities (see, for example, Eccl 10:8; Amos 5:19), would find the statement quite meaningful as an explanation for the hostility between snakes and humans. (In the broader ancient Near Eastern context, compare the Mesopotamian serpent omens. See H. W. F. Saggs, <i>The Greatness That Was Babylon</i>, 309.) This ongoing struggle, when interpreted in light of v. 15, is a tangible reminder of the conflict introduced into the world by the first humans&#8217; rebellion against God. Many Christian theologians (going back to Irenaeus) understand v. 15 as the so-called <i>protevangelium</i>, supposedly prophesying Christ&#8217;s victory over Satan (see W. Witfall, &#8220;Genesis 3:15 &#8211; a Protevangelium?&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 36 [1974]: 361-65; and R. A. Martin, &#8220;The Earliest Messianic Interpretation of Genesis 3:15,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 84 [1965]: 425-27). In this allegorical approach, the woman&#8217;s offspring is initially Cain, then the whole human race, and ultimately Jesus Christ, the <i>offspring</i> (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;seed&#8221;) of the woman (see Gal 4:4). The <i>offspring</i> of the serpent includes the evil powers and demons of the spirit world, as well as those humans who are in the kingdom of darkness (see John 8:44). According to this view, the passage gives the first hint of the gospel. Satan delivers a crippling blow to the Seed of the woman (Jesus), who in turn delivers a fatal blow to the Serpent (first defeating him through the death and resurrection [1 Cor 15:55-57] and then destroying him in the judgment [Rev 12:7-9; 20:7-10]). However, the grammatical structure of Gen 3:15b does not suggest this view. The repetition of the verb &#8220;attack,&#8221; as well as the word order, suggests mutual hostility is being depicted, not the defeat of the serpent. If the serpent&#8217;s defeat were being portrayed, it is odd that the alleged description of his death comes first in the sentence. If he has already been crushed by the woman&#8217;s &#8220;Seed,&#8221; how can he bruise his heel? To sustain the allegorical view, v. 15b must be translated in one of the following ways: &#8220;he will crush your head, even though you attack his heel&#8221; (in which case the second clause is concessive) or &#8220;he will crush your head as you attack his heel&#8221; (the clauses, both of which place the subject before the verb, may indicate synchronic action).</p>

But the next clause shows that the pain is associated with conception and childbirth. The two words form a hendiadys (where two words are joined to express one idea, like &#8220;good and angry&#8221; in English), the second explaining the first. &#8220;Conception,&#8221; if the correct meaning of the noun, must be figurative here since there is no pain in conception; it is a synecdoche, representing the entire process of childbirth and child rearing from the very start. However, recent etymological research suggests the noun is derived from a root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1512;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hrr</font>), not <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1512;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hrh</font>), and means &#8220;trembling, pain&#8221; (see D.

In this case &#8220;pain and trembling&#8221; refers to the physical effects of childbirth. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">itsÿvon</font>, &#8220;pain&#8221;), an abstract noun related to the verb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1489;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">atsav</font>), includes more than physical pain. It is emotional distress as well as physical pain. The same word is used in v. 17 for the man&#8217;s painful toil in the field.</p>

Many interpreters conclude that it refers to sexual desire here, because the subject of the passage is the relationship between a wife and her husband, and because the word is used in a romantic sense in Song 7:11 HT (7:10 ET). However, this interpretation makes little sense in Gen 3:16. First, it does not fit well with the assertion &#8220;he will dominate you.&#8221; Second, it implies that sexual desire was not part of the original creation, even though the man and the woman were told to multiply. And third, it ignores the usage of the word in Gen 4:7 where it refers to sin&#8217;s desire to control and dominate Cain. (Even in Song of Songs it carries the basic idea of &#8220;control,&#8221; for it describes the young man&#8217;s desire to &#8220;have his way sexually&#8221; with the young woman.) In Gen 3:16 the <sc>Lord announces a struggle, a conflict between the man and the woman. She will desire to control him, but he will dominate her instead. This interpretation also fits the tone of the passage, which is a judgment oracle. See further Susan T. Foh, &#8220;What is the Woman&#8217;s Desire?&#8221; <i>WTJ</i> 37 (1975): 376-83.</p>
