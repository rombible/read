<A NAME="428"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=239><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;cursed are you from the ground.&#8221; As in Gen 3:14, the word &#8220;cursed,&#8221; a passive participle from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arar</font>), either means &#8220;punished&#8221; or &#8220;banished,&#8221; depending on how one interprets the following preposition. If the preposition is taken as indicating source, then the idea is &#8220;cursed (i.e., punished) are you from [i.e., &#8220;through the agency of&#8221;] the ground&#8221; (see v. 12a). If the preposition is taken as separative, then the idea is &#8220;cursed and banished from the ground.&#8221; In this case the ground rejects Cain&#8217;s efforts in such a way that he is banished from the ground and forced to become a fugitive out in the earth (see vv. 12b, 14).</p>
