<A NAME="448"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=259><b>tn</b> The traditional rendering here, &#8220;who forged&#8221; (or &#8220;a forger of&#8221;) is now more commonly associated with counterfeit or fraud (e.g., &#8220;forged copies&#8221; or &#8220;forged checks&#8221;) than with the forging of metal. The phrase &#8220;heated metal and shaped [it]&#8221; has been used in the translation instead.</p>
