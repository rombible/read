<A NAME="45"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=216><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;with the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et</font>) is not the accusative/object sign, but the preposition &#8220;with&#8221; as the ancient versions attest. Some take the preposition in the sense of &#8220;with the help of&#8221; (see BDB 85 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1514;</font>; cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV), while others prefer &#8220;along with&#8221; in the sense of &#8220;like, equally with, in common with&#8221; (see Lev 26:39; Isa 45:9; Jer 23:28). Either works well in this context; the latter is reflected in the present translation. Some understand <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;</font> as the accusative/object sign and translate, &#8220;I have acquired a man &#8211; the <sc>Lord.&#8221; They suggest that the woman thought (mistakenly) that she had given birth to the incarnate <sc>Lord, the Messiah who would bruise the Serpent&#8217;s head. This fanciful suggestion is based on a questionable allegorical interpretation of Gen 3:15 (see the note there on the word &#8220;heel&#8221;).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Since Exod 6:3 seems to indicate that the name Yahweh (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yÿhvah</font>, translated <sc>Lord) was first revealed to Moses (see also Exod 3:14), it is odd to see it used in quotations in Genesis by people who lived long before Moses. This problem has been resolved in various ways: (1) Source critics propose that Exod 6:3 is part of the &#8220;P&#8221; (or priestly) tradition, which is at odds with the &#8220;J&#8221; (or Yahwistic) tradition. (2) Many propose that &#8220;name&#8221; in Exod 6:3 does not refer to the divine name per se, but to the character suggested by the name. God appeared to the patriarchs primarily in the role of El Shaddai, the giver of fertility, not as Yahweh, the one who fulfills his promises. In this case the patriarchs knew the name Yahweh, but had not experienced the full significance of the name. In this regard it is possible that Exod 6:3b should not be translated as a statement of denial, but as an affirmation followed by a rhetorical question implying that the patriarchs did indeed know God by the name of Yahweh, just as they knew him as El Shaddai. D. A. Garrett, following the lead of F. Andersen, sees Exod 6:2-3 as displaying a paneled A/B parallelism and translates them as follows: (A) &#8220;I am Yahweh.&#8221; (B) &#8220;And I made myself known to Abraham&#8230;as El Shaddai.&#8221; (A') &#8220;And my name is Yahweh&#8221;; (B') &#8220;Did I not make myself known to them?&#8221; (D. A. Garrett, <i>Rethinking Genesis</i>, 21). However, even if one translates the text this way, the <sc>Lord&#8217;s words do not necessarily mean that he made the name Yahweh known to the fathers. God is simply affirming that he now wants to be called Yahweh (see Exod 3:14-16) and that he revealed himself in prior times as El Shaddai. If we stress the parallelism with B, the implied answer to the concluding question might be: &#8220;Yes, you did make yourself known to them &#8211; as El Shaddai!&#8221; The main point of the verse would be that El Shaddai, the God of the fathers, and the God who has just revealed himself to Moses as Yahweh are one and the same. (3) G. J. Wenham suggests that pre-Mosaic references to Yahweh are the product of the author/editor of Genesis, who wanted to be sure that Yahweh was identified with the God of the fathers. In this regard, note how Yahweh is joined with another divine name or title in Gen 9:26-27; 14:22; 15:2, 8; 24:3, 7, 12, 27, 42, 48; 27:20; 32:9. The angel uses the name Yahweh when instructing Hagar concerning her child&#8217;s name, but the actual name (Ishma-el, &#8220;El hears&#8221;) suggests that El, not Yahweh, originally appeared in the angel&#8217;s statement (16:11). In her response to the angel Hagar calls God El, not Yahweh (16:13). In 22:14 Abraham names the place of sacrifice &#8220;Yahweh Will Provide&#8221; (cf. v. 16), but in v. 8 he declares, &#8220;God will provide.&#8221; God uses the name Yahweh when speaking to Jacob at Bethel (28:13) and Jacob also uses the name when he awakens from the dream (28:16). Nevertheless he names the place Beth-el (&#8220;house of El&#8221;). In 31:49 Laban prays, &#8220;May Yahweh keep watch,&#8221; but in v. 50 he declares, &#8220;God is a witness between you and me.&#8221; Yahweh&#8217;s use of the name in 15:7 and 18:14 may reflect theological idiom, while the use in 18:19 is within a soliloquy. (Other uses of Yahweh in quotations occur in 16:2, 5; 24:31, 35, 40, 42, 44, 48, 50, 51, 56; 26:22, 28-29; 27:7, 27; 29:32-35; 30:24, 30; 49:18. In these cases there is no contextual indication that a different name was originally used.) For a fuller discussion of this proposal, see G. J. Wenham, &#8220;The Religion of the Patriarchs,&#8221; <i>Essays on the Patriarchal Narratives</i>, 189-93.</p>
