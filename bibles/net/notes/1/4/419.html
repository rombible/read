<A NAME="419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=230><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term translated &#8220;crouching&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1465;&#1489;&#1461;&#1509;</font>, <font face="Scholar">rovets</font>) is an active participle. Sin is portrayed with animal imagery here as a beast crouching and ready to pounce (a figure of speech known as zoomorphism). An Akkadian cognate refers to a type of demon; in this case perhaps one could translate, &#8220;Sin is the demon at the door&#8221; (see E. A. Speiser, <i>Genesis </i>[AB], 29, 32-33).</p>
