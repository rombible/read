<A NAME="433"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=244><b>tn</b> The primary meaning of the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avon</font>) is &#8220;sin, iniquity.&#8221; But by metonymy it can refer to the &#8220;guilt&#8221; of sin, or to &#8220;punishment&#8221; for sin. The third meaning applies here. Just before this the <sc>Lord announces the punishment for Cain&#8217;s actions, and right after this statement Cain complains of the severity of the punishment. Cain is not portrayed as repenting of his sin.</p>
