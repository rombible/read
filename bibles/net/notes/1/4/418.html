<A NAME="418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=229><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text is difficult, because only one word occurs, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et</font>), which appears to be the infinitive construct from the verb &#8220;to lift up&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;</font>, <font face="Scholar">na</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">as</font>). The sentence reads: &#8220;If you do well, uplifting.&#8221; On the surface it seems to be the opposite of the fallen face. Everything will be changed if he does well. God will show him favor, he will not be angry, and his face will reflect that. But more may be intended since the second half of the verse forms the contrast: &#8220;If you do not do well, sin is crouching&#8230;.&#8221; Not doing well leads to sinful attack; doing well leads to victory and God&#8217;s blessing.</p>
