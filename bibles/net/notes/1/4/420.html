<A NAME="420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=231><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and toward you [is] its desire, but you must rule over it.&#8221; As in Gen 3:16, the Hebrew noun &#8220;desire&#8221; refers to an urge to control or dominate. Here the desire is that which sin has for Cain, a desire to control for the sake of evil, but Cain must have mastery over it. The imperfect is understood as having an obligatory sense. Another option is to understand it as expressing potential (&#8220;you can have [or &#8220;are capable of having&#8221;] mastery over it.&#8221;). It will be a struggle, but sin can be defeated by righteousness. In addition to this connection to Gen 3, other linguistic and thematic links between chaps. 3 and 4 are discussed by A. J. Hauser, &#8220;Linguistic and Thematic Links Between Genesis 4:1-6 and Genesis 2&#8211;3,&#8221; <i>JETS</i> 23 (1980): 297-306.</p>
