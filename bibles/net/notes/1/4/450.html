<A NAME="450"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=261><b>sn</b> <i>Seventy-seven times</i>. Lamech seems to reason this way: If Cain, a murderer, is to be avenged seven times (see v. 15), then how much more one who has been unjustly wronged! Lamech misses the point of God&#8217;s merciful treatment of Cain. God was not establishing a principle of justice when he warned he would avenge Cain&#8217;s murder. In fact he was trying to limit the shedding of blood, something Lamech wants to multiply instead. The use of &#8220;seventy-seven,&#8221; a multiple of seven, is hyperbolic, emphasizing the extreme severity of the vengeance envisioned by Lamech.</p>
