<A NAME="413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=224><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>) simply means &#8220;to gaze at, to have regard for, to look on with favor [or &#8220;with devotion&#8221;].&#8221; The text does not indicate how this was communicated, but it indicates that Cain and Abel knew immediately. Either there was some manifestation of divine pleasure given to Abel and withheld from Cain (fire consuming the sacrifice?), or there was an inner awareness of divine response.</p>
