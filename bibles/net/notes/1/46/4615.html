<A NAME="4615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2831><b>sn</b> <i>The sons of Benjamin</i>. It is questionable whether youthful Benjamin had ten sons by the time he went into Egypt, but it is not impossible. If Benjamin was born when Joseph was six or seven, he was ten when Joseph was sold into Egypt, and would have been thirty-two at this point. Some suggest that the list originally served another purpose and included the names of all who were in the immediate family of the sons, whether born in Canaan or later in Egypt.</p>
