<A NAME="4628"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2844><b>sn</b> <i>So that you may live in the land of Goshen</i>. Joseph is apparently trying to stress to Pharaoh that his family is self-sufficient, that they will not be a drain on the economy of Egypt. But they will need land for their animals and so <i>Goshen</i>, located on the edge of Egypt, would be a suitable place for them to live. The settled Egyptians were uneasy with nomadic people, but if Jacob and his family settled in Goshen they would represent no threat.</p>
