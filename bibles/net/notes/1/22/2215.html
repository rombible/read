<A NAME="2215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1241><b>sn</b> It is impossible to know what Abraham was thinking when he said, &#8220;we will&#8230;return to you.&#8221; When he went he knew (1) that he was to sacrifice Isaac, and (2) that God intended to fulfill his earlier promises through Isaac. How he reconciled those facts is not clear in the text. Heb 11:17-19 suggests that Abraham believed God could restore Isaac to him through resurrection.</p>
