<A NAME="2235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1261><b>sn</b> The saying connected with these events has some ambiguity, which was probably intended. The Niphal verb could be translated (1) &#8220;in the mountain of the Lord it will be seen/provided&#8221; or (2) &#8220;in the mountain the Lord will appear.&#8221; If the temple later stood here (see the note on &#8220;Moriah&#8221; in Gen 22:2), the latter interpretation might find support, for the people went to the temple to appear before the Lord, who &#8220;appeared&#8221; to them by providing for them his power and blessings. See S. R. Driver, <i>Genesis</i>, 219.</p>
