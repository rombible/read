<A NAME="2825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1696><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac.&#8221; The Hebrew word for &#8220;father&#8221; can typically be used in a broader sense than the English word, in this case referring to Abraham (who was Jacob&#8217;s grandfather). For stylistic reasons and for clarity, the words &#8220;your father&#8221; are supplied with &#8220;Isaac&#8221; in the translation.</p>
