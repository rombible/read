<A NAME="2820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1691><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he put [it at] the place of his head.&#8221; The text does not actually say the stone was placed under his head to serve as a pillow, although most interpreters and translators assume this. It is possible the stone served some other purpose. Jacob does not seem to have been a committed monotheist yet (see v. 20-21) so he may have believed it contained some spiritual power. Note that later in the story he anticipates the stone becoming the residence of God (see v. 22). Many cultures throughout the world view certain types of stones as magical and/or sacred. See J. G. Fraser, <i>Folklore in the Old Testament</i>, 231-37.</p>
