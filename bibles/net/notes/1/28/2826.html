<A NAME="2826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1697><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">erets</font>) can mean &#8220;[the] earth,&#8221; &#8220;land,&#8221; &#8220;region,&#8221; &#8220;piece of ground,&#8221; or &#8220;ground&#8221; depending on the context. Here the term specifically refers to the plot of ground on which Jacob was lying, but at the same time this stands by metonymy for the entire land of Canaan.</p>
