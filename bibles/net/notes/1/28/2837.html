Such a stone could be used as a boundary marker, a burial stone, or as a shrine. Here the stone is intended to be a reminder of the stairway that was &#8220;erected&#8221; and on which the <sc>Lord &#8220;stood.&#8221; (In Hebrew the word translated &#8220;sacred stone&#8221; is derived from the verb translated &#8220;erected&#8221; in v. 12 and &#8220;stood&#8221; in v. 13. Since the top of the stairway reached the heavens where the <sc>Lord stood, Jacob poured oil on the top of the stone. See C. F. Graesser, &#8220;Standing Stones in Ancient Palestine,&#8221; <i>BA</i> 35 (1972): 34-63; and E. Stockton, &#8220;Sacred Pillars in the Bible,&#8221; <i>ABR</i> 20 (1972): 16-32.</p>
