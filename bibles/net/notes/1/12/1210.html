<A NAME="1210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=636><b>tn</b> In this part of God&#8217;s statement there are two significant changes that often go unnoticed. First, the parallel and contrasting participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1511;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1500;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿqallelkha</font>) is now singular and not plural. All the versions and a few Masoretic <sc>mss read the plural. But if it had been plural, there would be no reason to change it to the singular and alter the parallelism. On the other hand, if it was indeed singular, it is easy to see why the versions would change it to match the first participle. The MT preserves the original reading: &#8220;the one who treats you lightly.&#8221; The point would be a contrast with the lavish way that God desires to bless many. The second change is in the vocabulary. The English usually says, &#8220;I will curse those who curse you.&#8221; But there are two different words for curse here. The first is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qalal</font>), which means &#8220;to be light&#8221; in the Qal<i>,</i> and in the Piel &#8220;to treat lightly, to treat with contempt, to curse.&#8221; The second verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arar</font>), which means &#8220;to banish, to remove from the blessing.&#8221; The point is simple: Whoever treats Abram and the covenant with contempt as worthless God will banish from the blessing. It is important also to note that the verb is not a cohortative, but a simple imperfect. Since God is binding himself to Abram, this would then be an obligatory imperfect: &#8220;but the one who treats you with contempt <i>I must curse</i>.&#8221;</p>
