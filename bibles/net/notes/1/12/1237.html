<A NAME="1237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=663><b>sn</b> <i>Tell them you are my sister</i>. Abram&#8217;s motives may not be as selfish as they appear. He is aware of the danger to the family. His method of dealing with it is deception with a half truth, for Sarai really was his sister &#8211; but the Egyptians would not know that. Abram presumably thought that there would be negotiations for a marriage by anyone interested (as Laban does later for his sister Rebekah), giving him time to react. But the plan backfires because Pharaoh does not take the time to negotiate. There is a good deal of literature on the wife-sister issue. See (among others) E. A. Speiser, &#8220;The Wife-Sister Motif in the Patriarchal Narratives,&#8221; <i>Oriental and Biblical Studies</i>, 62-81; C. J. Mullo-Weir, &#8220;The Alleged Hurrian Wife-Sister Motif in Genesis,&#8221; <i>GOT </i>22 (1967-1970): 14-25.</p>
