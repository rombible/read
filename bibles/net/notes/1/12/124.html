<A NAME="124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=630><b>sn</b> <i>To the land that I will show you</i>. The call of Abram illustrates the leading of the <sc>Lord. The command is to leave. The <sc>Lord&#8217;s word is very specific about what Abram is to leave (the three prepositional phrases narrow to his father&#8217;s household), but is not specific at all about where he is to go. God required faith, a point that Heb 11:8 notes.</p>
