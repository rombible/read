<A NAME="128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=634><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and be a blessing.&#8221; The verb form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hÿyeh</font>) is the Qal imperative of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hayah</font>). The <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) with the imperative after the cohortatives indicates purpose or consequence. What does it mean for Abram to &#8220;be a blessing&#8221;? Will he be a channel or source of blessing for others, or a prime example of divine blessing? A similar statement occurs in Zech 8:13, where God assures his people, &#8220;You will be a blessing,&#8221; in contrast to the past when they &#8220;were a curse.&#8221; Certainly &#8220;curse&#8221; here does not refer to Israel being a source of a curse, but rather to the fact that they became a curse-word or byword among the nations, who regarded them as the epitome of an accursed people (see 2 Kgs 22:19; Jer 42:18; 44:8, 12, 22). Therefore the statement &#8220;be a blessing&#8221; seems to refer to Israel being transformed into a prime example of a blessed people, whose name will be used in blessing formulae, rather than in curses. If the statement &#8220;be a blessing&#8221; is understood in the same way in Gen 12:2, then it means that God would so bless Abram that other nations would hear of his fame and hold him up as a paradigm of divine blessing in their blessing formulae.</p>
