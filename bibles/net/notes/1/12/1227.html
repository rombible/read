<A NAME="1227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=653><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nasa</font>&#8217;) means &#8220;to journey&#8221;; more specifically it means to pull up the tent and move to another place. The construction here uses the preterite of this verb with its infinitive absolute to stress the activity of traveling. But it also adds the infinitive absolute of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">halakh</font>) to stress that the traveling was continually going on. Thus &#8220;Abram journeyed, going and journeying&#8221; becomes &#8220;Abram continually journeyed by stages.&#8221;</p>
