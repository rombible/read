<A NAME="1229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=655><b>sn</b> <i>Abram went down to Egypt</i>. The Abrahamic narrative foreshadows some of the events in the life of the nation of Israel. This sojourn in Egypt is typological of Israel&#8217;s bondage there. In both stories there is a famine that forces the family to Egypt, death is a danger to the males while the females are preserved alive, great plagues bring about their departure, there is a summons to stand before Pharaoh, and there is a return to the land of Canaan with great wealth.</p>
