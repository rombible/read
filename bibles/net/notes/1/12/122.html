<A NAME="122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=628><b>tn</b> The call of Abram begins with an imperative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;&#1470;&#1500;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lekh-lÿkha</font>, &#8220;go out&#8221;) followed by three cohortatives (v. 2a) indicating purpose or consequence (&#8220;that I may&#8221; or &#8220;then I will&#8221;). If Abram leaves, then God will do these three things. The second imperative (v. 2b, literally &#8220;and be a blessing&#8221;) is subordinated to the preceding cohortatives and indicates God&#8217;s ultimate purpose in calling and blessing Abram. On the syntactical structure of vv. 1-2 see R. B. Chisholm, &#8220;Evidence from Genesis,&#8221; <i>A Case for Premillennialism</i>, 37. For a similar sequence of volitive forms see Gen 45:18.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> It would be hard to overestimate the value of this call and this divine plan for the theology of the Bible. Here begins God&#8217;s plan to bring redemption to the world. The promises to Abram will be turned into a covenant in Gen 15 and 22 (here it is a call with conditional promises) and will then lead through the Bible to the work of the Messiah.</p>
