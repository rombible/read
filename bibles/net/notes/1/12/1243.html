<A NAME="1243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=669><b>sn</b> <i>He did treat Abram well</i>. The construction of the parenthetical disjunctive clause, beginning with the conjunction on the prepositional phrase, draws attention to the irony of the story. Abram wanted Sarai to lie &#8220;so that it would go well&#8221; with him. Though he lost Sarai to Pharaoh, it did go well for him &#8211; he received a lavish bride price. See also G. W. Coats, &#8220;Despoiling the Egyptians,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 18 (1968): 450-57.</p>
