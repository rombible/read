Joyce Baldwin notes, &#8220;Here, with YHWH as the subject, the verb stresses God&#8217;s sovereign rule over events for the accomplishment of his purpose (as in 4:6-8, where the verb recurs in each verse). The &#8216;great fish&#8217; is in exactly the right place at the right time by God&#8217;s command, in order to swallow Jonah and enclose him safely&#8221; (Joyce Baldwin, &#8220;Jonah,&#8221; <i>The Minor Prophets</i>, 2:566).</p>
<A NAME="23"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=78><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;great.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="24"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=79><b>sn</b> The eight verses of Jonah&#8217;s prayer in Hebrew contain twenty-seven first-person pronominal references to himself. There are fifteen second- or third-person references to the <sc>Lord.</p>
<A NAME="25"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=80><b>tn</b> <i>Tg</i>. Jonah 2:2 renders this interpretively: &#8220;and he heard my prayer.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The first verse of the prayer summarizes the whole &#8211; &#8220;I was in trouble; I called to the <sc>Lord for help; he rescued me; I will give him thanks&#8221; &#8211; before elaborating on the nature and extent of the trouble (vv. 3-7a), mentioning the cry for help and the subsequent rescue (6b-7), and promising to give thanks (8-9). These elements, as well as much vocabulary and imagery found in Jonah&#8217;s prayer, appear also in other Hebrew psalms. With Jonah 2:1 compare, for example, Pss 18:6; 22:24; 81:7; 116:1-4; 120:1; 130:1-2; Lam 3:55-56. These references and others indicate that Jonah was familiar with prayers used in worship at the temple in Jerusalem; he knew &#8220;all the right words.&#8221; Consider also Ps 107 with Jonah as a whole.</p>
<A NAME="26"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=81><b>sn</b> <i>Sheol</i> was a name for the place of residence of the dead, the underworld (see Job 7:9-10; Isa 38:17-18). Jonah pictures himself in the belly of Sheol, its very center &#8211; in other words he is as good as dead.</p>
<A NAME="27"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=82><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;voice&#8221; (so KJV, NAB, NASB, NRSV); NIV &#8220;my cry.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qol</font>, &#8220;voice&#8221;) functions as a metonymy for the content of what is uttered: cry for help in prayer.</p>
<A NAME="28"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=83><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;You had thrown me.&#8221; Verse 3 begins the detailed description of Jonah&#8217;s plight, which resulted from being thrown into the sea.</p>

<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=86><b>tc</b> The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest deleting either <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿtsulah</font>, &#8220;into the deep&#8221;) or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1489; &#1497;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bilvav</font> <font face="Scholar">yammim</font>, &#8220;into the heart of the sea&#8221;). They propose that one or the other is a scribal gloss on the remaining term. However, the use of an appositional phrase within a poetic colon is not unprecedented in Hebrew poetry. The MT is therefore best retained.</p>
<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=87><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the stream&#8221;; KJV, ASV, NRSV &#8220;the flood.&#8221; The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nahar</font>) is used in parallel with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yam</font>, &#8220;sea&#8221;) in Ps 24:2 (both are plural) to describe the oceans of the world and in Ps 66:6 to speak of the sea crossed by Israel in the exodus from Egypt.</p>
<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=88><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;surrounded&#8221; (so NRSV); NAB &#8220;enveloped.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=89><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;your breakers and your waves.&#8221; This phrase is a nominal hendiadys; the first noun functions as an attributive adjective modifying the second noun: &#8220;your breaking waves.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=90><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;your&#8230; your&#8230;&#8221; The 2nd person masculine singular suffixes on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1462;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464; &#1493;&#1456;&#1490;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mishbarekha vÿgallekha</font>, &#8220;your breakers and your waves&#8221;) function as genitives of source. Just as God had hurled a violent wind upon the sea (1:4) and had sovereignly sent the large fish to swallow him (1:17 [2:1 HT]), Jonah viewed God as sovereignly responsible for afflicting him with sea waves that were crashing upon his head, threatening to drown him. <i>Tg</i>. Jonah 2:3 alters the 2nd person masculine singular suffixes to 3rd person masculine singular suffixes to make them refer to the sea and not to God, for the sake of smoothness: &#8220;all the gales of the sea and its billows.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=91><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;crossed&#8221;; KJV, NAB, NASB, NRSV &#8220;passed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=92><b>sn</b> Verses 3 and 5 multiply terms describing Jonah&#8217;s watery plight. The images used in v. 3 appear also in 2 Sam 22:5-6; Pss 42:7; 51:11; 69:1-2, 14-15; 88:6-7; 102:10.</p>
<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=93><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;And I said.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amar</font>, &#8220;to say&#8221;) is sometimes used to depict inner speech and thoughts of a character (<i>HALOT</i> 66 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;</font> 4; BDB 56 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;</font> 2; e.g., Gen 17:17; Ruth 4:4; 1 Sam 20:26; Esth 6:6). While many English versions render this &#8220;I said&#8221; (KJV, NKJV, NAB, ASV, NASB, NIV, NLT), several nuance it &#8220;I thought&#8221; (JPS, NJPS, NEB, REB, NJB, TEV, CEV).</p>
<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=94><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I have been expelled from your attention&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from in front of your eyes.&#8221; See also Ps 31:22; Lam 3:54-56.</p>
<A NAME="220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=95><b>tc</b> Or &#8220;Yet I will look again to your holy temple&#8221; or &#8220;Surely I will look again to your holy temple.&#8221; The MT and the vast majority of ancient textual witnesses vocalize consonantal <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1498;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">kh</font>) as the adverb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akh</font>) which functions as an emphatic asseverative &#8220;surely&#8221; (BDB 36 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> 1) or an adversative &#8220;yet, nevertheless&#8221; (BDB 36 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> 2; so <i>Tg</i>. Jonah 2:4: &#8220;However, I shall look again upon your holy temple&#8221;). These options understand the line as an expression of hopeful piety. As a positive statement, Jonah expresses hope that he will live to return to worship in Jerusalem. It may be a way of saying, &#8220;I will pray for help, even though I have been banished&#8221; (see v. 8; cf. Dan 6:10). The sole dissenter is the Greek recension of Theodotion which reads the interrogative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#8182;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pws</font>, &#8220;how?&#8221;) which reflects an alternate vocalization tradition of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ekh</font>) &#8211; a defectively written form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ekh</font>, &#8220;how?&#8221;; BDB 32 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1498;&#1456;</font> 1). This would be translated, &#8220;How shall I again look at your holy temple?&#8221; (cf. NRSV). Jonah laments that he will not be able to worship at the temple in Jerusalem again &#8211; this is a metonymical statement (effect for cause) that he feels certain that he is about to die. It continues the expression of Jonah&#8217;s distress and separation from the <sc>Lord, begun in v. 2 and continued without relief in vv. 3-7a. The external evidence favors the MT; however, internal evidence seems to favor the alternate vocalization tradition reflected in Theodotion for four reasons. First, the form of the psalm is a declarative praise in which Jonah begins with a summary praise (v. 2), continues by recounting his past plight <br>(vv. 3-6a) and the <sc>Lord&#8217;s intervention (vv. 6b-7), and concludes with a lesson (v. 8) and vow to praise (v. 9). So the statement with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456;</font> in v. 4 falls within the plight &#8211; not within a declaration of confidence. Second, while the poetic parallelism of v. 4 could be antithetical (&#8220;I have been banished from your sight, <i>yet</i> I will again look to your holy temple&#8221;), <br>synonymous parallelism fits the context of the lament better (&#8220;I have been banished from your sight; Will I ever again see your holy temple?&#8221;). Third, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456;</font> is the more difficult vocalization because it is a defectively written form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (&#8220;how?&#8221;) and therefore easily confused with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (&#8220;surely&#8221; or &#8220;yet, nevertheless&#8221;). Fourth, nothing in the first half of the psalm reflects any inkling of confidence on the part of Jonah that he would be delivered from imminent death. In fact, Jonah states in v. 7 that he did not turn to God in prayer until some time later when he was on the very brink of death.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Both options for the start of the line (&#8220;how?&#8221; and &#8220;yet&#8221; or &#8220;surely&#8221;) fit the ironic portrayal of Jonah in the prayer (see also vv.8-9). Jonah, who had been trying to escape the <sc>Lord&#8217;s attention, here appears remarkably fond of worshiping him. Is there perhaps also a hint of motivation for the <sc>Lord to rescue this eager worshiper? Confession of disobedience, on the other hand, is absent. Compare Ps 31:22, where the first half (describing the plight) is very similar to the first half of Jonah 2:3, and the second half starts with &#8220;nevertheless&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1499;&#1461;&#1503;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">akhen</font>) and is a positive contrast, a report that God heard, using four words that appear in Jonah 2:2 (cf. Job 32:7-8; Ps 82:6-7; Isa 49:4; Zeph 3:7).</p>
<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=96><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;Will I ever see your holy temple again?&#8221; The rhetorical question expresses denial: Jonah despaired of ever seeing the temple again.</p>
<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=97><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;as far as the throat.&#8221; The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>) refers sometimes to the throat or neck (Pss 69:1[2]; 105:18; 124:4, 5; Isa 5:14; <i>HALOT</i> 712 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> 2). The water was up to Jonah&#8217;s neck (and beyond), so that his life was in great danger (cf. Ps 69:1).</p>
<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=98><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the deep; the abyss&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tÿhom</font>). The simple &#8220;ocean&#8221; is perhaps too prosaic, since this Hebrew word has primeval connections (Gen 1:2; 7:11; 8:2; Prov 8:27-28) and speaks of the sea at its vastest (Job 38:16-18; Ps 36:6; 104:5-9).</p>
<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=99><b>tc</b> The consonantal form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1493;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">svf</font>) is vocalized by the MT as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">suf</font>, &#8220;reed&#8221;) but the LXX&#8217;s <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#963;&#967;&#940;&#964;&#951;</font> (<font face="Greektl">escath</font>, &#8220;end&#8221;) reflects a vocalization of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1493;&#1465;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sof</font>, &#8220;end&#8221;). The reading in <i>Tg</i>. Jonah 2:5 interpreted this as a reference to the Reed Sea (also known as the Red Sea). In fact, the Jewish Midrash known as <i>Pirqe Rabbi Eliezer</i> 10 states that God showed Jonah the way by which the Israelites had passed through the Red Sea. The MT vocalization tradition is preferred.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">suf</font>) normally refers to &#8220;reeds&#8221; &#8211; freshwater plants that grow in Egyptian rivers and marshes (Exod 2:3,5; Isa 10:19) &#8211; but here it refers to &#8220;seaweed&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 747 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;</font> 1). Though the same freshwater plants do not grow in the Mediterranean, the name may be seen to fit similarly long plants growing in seawater.</p>
<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=100><b>tn</b> Jonah began going &#8220;down&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yarad</font>) in chap. 1 (vv. 3, 5; see also 1:15; 2:2-3).</p>
<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=101><b>tc</b> The MT <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1489;&#1461;&#1497; &#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿqitsve harim</font>, &#8220;to the extremities [i.e., very bottoms] of the mountains&#8221;) is a bit unusual, appearing only here in the Hebrew Bible. Therefore, the <i>BHS</i> editors suggest a conjectural emendation of the MT&#8217;s <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1489;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (&#8220;to the extremities&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1511;&#1463;&#1510;&#1456;&#1493;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿqatswey</font>, &#8220;to the ends [of the mountains])&#8221; based on orthographic confusion between <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) and <font face="Scholar">bet</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;</font>). However, the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1510;&#1489;&#1497; &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;</font> does appear in the OT Apocrypha in Sir 16:19; therefore, it is not without precedent. Since Jonah emphasizes that he descended, as it were, to the very gates of the netherworld in the second half of this verse, it would be appropriate for Jonah to say that he went down &#8220;to the extremities [i.e., very bottoms] of the mountains&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1489;&#1461;&#1497; &#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>). Therefore, the MT may be retained with confidence.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1462;&#1510;&#1462;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qetseb</font>) is used only three times in the Hebrew Bible, and this is the only usage in which it means &#8220;extremity; bottom&#8221; (BDB 891 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1462;&#1510;&#1462;&#1489;</font> 2). The exact phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1510;&#1489;&#1497; &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8220;the extremities [bottoms] of the mountains&#8221;) is used in the OT Apocrypha once in Sir 16:19.</p>
<A NAME="227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=102><b>tn</b> Some English versions (e.g., NEB, NRSV) have connected the &#8220;bottoms of the mountains&#8221; with the preceding &#8211; &#8220;weeds were wrapped around my head at the bottoms of the mountains&#8221; &#8211; and connect &#8220;I went down&#8221; with &#8220;the earth.&#8221; Such a connection between &#8220;I went down&#8221; and &#8220;the earth&#8221; is difficult to accept. It would be more normal in Hebrew to express &#8220;I went down to the earth&#8221; with a directive ending (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">artsah</font>) or with a Hebrew preposition before &#8220;earth&#8221; or without the definite article. The Masoretic accents, in addition, connect &#8220;ends of the mountains&#8221; with the verb &#8220;I went down&#8221; and call for a break between the verb and &#8220;earth.&#8221;</p>

This construction is used to emphasize the subject, in this case, the &#8220;bars of the netherworld.&#8221; The word translated &#8220;bars&#8221; appears elsewhere to speak of bars used in constructing the sides of the tabernacle and often of crossbars (made of wood or metal) associated with the gates of fortified cities (cf. Exod 36:31-34; Judg 16:3; 1 Kgs 4:13; Neh 3:3; Pss 107:16; 147:13; Isa 45:1-2).</p>

This is parallel to the related Akkadian term <font face="Scholar">irsitu</font> used in the phrase &#8220;the land of no return,&#8221; that is, the netherworld. This refers to the place of the dead (along with &#8220;belly of Sheol,&#8221; v. 2, and &#8220;the grave,&#8221; v. 6), which is sometimes described as having &#8220;gates&#8221; (Job 38:17; Ps 107:18).</p>

Jonah pictures himself as closed in and so unable to escape death. Having described how far he had come (totally under water and &#8220;to the ends of mountains&#8221;), Jonah describes the way back as permanently closed against him. Just as it was impossible for a lone individual to walk through the barred gates of a walled city, so Jonah expected it was impossible for him to escape death.</p>

The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hevel</font>, &#8220;vapor, breath&#8221;) is often used figuratively to describe what is insubstantial, empty, and futile (31 times in Eccl; see also, e.g., Pss 39:4-6, 11; 144:4; Prov 13:11; 21:6; Isa 30:7; 49:4).

<A NAME="240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=115><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;abandon their mercy/loyalty.&#8221; The meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1505;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501; &#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1494;&#1465;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khasdam ya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">azovu</font>, &#8220;forsake their mercy/loyalty&#8221;) is greatly debated. There are two exegetical issues that are mutually related. First, does the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khesed</font>) here mean (1) &#8220;mercy, kindness&#8221; that man receives from God, or (2) &#8220;loyalty, faithfulness&#8221; that man must give to God (see BDB 338-39 s.v <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1491;</font>; <i>HALOT</i> 336-37 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1491;</font>)? Second, the third masculine plural suffix on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1505;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (&#8220;their loyalty/mercy&#8221;) has been taken as (1) subjective genitive, referring to the loyal allegiance they ought to display to the true God: &#8220;they abandon the loyalty they should show.&#8221; Examples of subjective genitives are: &#8220;This is <i>your kindness</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1505;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khasdek</font>) which you must do for me: every place to which we come, say of me, &#8216;He is my brother&#8217;&#8221; (Gen 20:13; also cf. Gen 40:14; 1 Sam 20:14-15). Several English versions take this approach: &#8220;forsake their faithfulness&#8221; (NASB), &#8220;abandon their faithful love&#8221; (NJB), &#8220;abandon their loyalty&#8221; (NEB, REB), &#8220;forsake their true loyalty&#8221; (RSV, NRSV), &#8220;turn their backs on all God&#8217;s mercies&#8221; (NLT), &#8220;have abandoned their loyalty to you&#8221; (TEV). (2) This has also been taken as objective genitive, referring to the mercy they might have received from God: &#8220;they forfeit the mercy that could be theirs.&#8221; The ancient versions interpret <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1505;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> in this sense: &#8220;they do not know the source of their welfare&#8221; (<i>Tg</i>. Jonah 2:8), &#8220;forsake the source of their welfare&#8221; (Vulgate), and &#8220;abandon their own mercy&#8221; (LXX). Several English versions follow this approach: &#8220;forsake their source of mercy&#8221; (NAB); &#8220;forfeit the grace that could be theirs&#8221; (NIV), &#8220;forsake their own welfare&#8221; (JPS, NJPS), &#8220;forsake their own mercy&#8221; (KJV, ASV), &#8220;forsake their own Mercy&#8221; (NKJV), &#8220;turn from the God who offers them mercy&#8221; (CEV). This is a difficult lexical/syntactical problem. On the one hand, the next line contrasts their failure with Jonah&#8217;s boast of loyalty to the true God &#8211; demonstrating that he, unlike pagan idolaters, deserves to be delivered. On the other hand, the only other use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1491;</font> in the book refers to &#8220;mercy&#8221; God bestows (4:2) &#8211; something that Jonah did not believe that the (repentant) pagan idolaters had a right to receive.
