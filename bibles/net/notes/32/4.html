<A NAME="41"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=150><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;It was evil to Jonah, a great evil.&#8221; The cognate accusative construction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;&#1506;...&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyera</font>&#8217;&#8230;<font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>) emphasizes the great magnitude of his displeasure (e.g., Neh 2:10 for the identical construction; see <i>IBHS</i> 167 §10.2.1g). The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">a</font>&#8217;) means &#8220;to be displeasing&#8221; (BDB 949 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1506;</font> 1; e.g., Gen 21:11, 12; 48:17; Num 11:16; 22:34; Josh 24:15; 1 Sam 8:6; 2 Sam 11:25; Neh 2:10; 13:8; Prov 24:18; Jer 40:4). The use of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (&#8220;to be evil, bad&#8221;) and the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8220;evil, bad, calamity&#8221;) here in 4:1 creates a wordplay with the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> in 3:8-10. When God saw that the Ninevites repented from their moral evil (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font>), he relented from the calamity (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font>) that he had threatened &#8211; and this development greatly displeased (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font>) Jonah.</p>
<A NAME="42"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=151><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;it burned to him.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kharah</font>, &#8220;to burn&#8221;) functions figuratively here (hypocatastasis) referring to anger (BDB 354 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font>). It is related to the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kharon</font>, &#8220;heat/burning&#8221;) in the phrase &#8220;the heat of his anger&#8221; in 3:9. The repetition of the root highlights the contrast in attitudes between Jonah and God: God&#8217;s burning anger &#8220;cooled off&#8221; when the Ninevites repented, but Jonah&#8217;s anger was &#8220;kindled&#8221; when God did not destroy Nineveh.</p>
<A NAME="43"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=152><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;my saying?&#8221; The first common singular suffix on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dÿvari</font>, &#8220;my saying&#8221;) functions as a subjective genitive: &#8220;I said.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amar</font>, &#8220;to say&#8221;) here refers to the inner speech and thoughts of Jonah (see <i>HALOT</i> 66 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;</font> 4; BDB 56 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;</font> 2; e.g., Gen 17:17; Ruth 4:4; 1 Sam 20:26; Esth 6:6; Jonah 2:4). There is no hint anywhere else in the book that Jonah had argued with God when he was originally commissioned. While most English versions render it &#8220;I said&#8221; or &#8220;my saying,&#8221; a few take it as inner speech: &#8220;This is what I feared&#8221; (NEB), &#8220;It is just as I feared&#8221; (REB), &#8220;I knew from the very beginning&#8221; (CEV).</p>
<A NAME="44"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=153><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;would happen&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew text but is supplied in the translation for the sake of clarity and smoothness.</p>
<A NAME="45"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=154><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;Is this not my saying while I was in my own country?&#8221; The rhetorical question implies a positive answer (&#8220;Yes, this was the very thing that Jonah had anticipated would happen all along!&#8221;) so it is rendered as an emphatic declaration in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="46"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=155><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;This is why I originally fled to Tarshish.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qadam</font>) in the Piel stem has a broad range of meanings and here could mean: (1) &#8220;to go before, be in front of&#8221; (1 Sam 20:25; Ps 68:26); (2) &#8220;to do [something] beforehand,&#8221; (Ps 119:147); or (3) &#8220;to anticipate, to do [something] early, forestall [something]&#8221; (Ps 119:148). The lexicons nuance Jonah 4:2 as &#8220;to do [something] for the first time&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 1069 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1491;&#1501;</font> 4) or &#8220;to do [something] beforehand&#8221; (BDB 870 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1501;</font> 3). The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1502;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497; &#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1465;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qiddamti livroakh</font>, &#8220;I did the first time to flee&#8221;) is an idiom that probably means &#8220;I originally fled&#8221; or &#8220;I fled the first time.&#8221; The infinitive construct <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1465;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (&#8220;to flee&#8221;) functions as an object complement. This phrase is translated variously by English versions, depending on the category of meaning chosen for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1501;</font>: (1) &#8220;to do [something] for the first time, beforehand&#8221;: &#8220;That is why I fled beforehand&#8221; (JPS, NJPS), &#8220;I fled before&#8221; (KJV), &#8220;I fled previously&#8221; (NKJV), &#8220;I fled at the beginning&#8221; (NRSV), &#8220;I first tried to flee&#8221; (NJB), &#8220;I fled at first&#8221; (NAB); (2) &#8220;to do [something] early, to hasten to do [something]&#8221;: &#8220;That is why I was so quick to flee&#8221; (NIV), &#8220;I hastened to flee&#8221; (ASV), &#8220;I made haste to flee&#8221; (RSV), &#8220;I did my best to run away&#8221; (TEV); and (3) &#8220;to anticipate, forestall [something]&#8221;: &#8220;it was to forestall this that I tried to escape to Tarshish&#8221; (REB), &#8220;to forestall it I tried to escape to Tarshish&#8221; (NEB), &#8220;in order to forestall this I fled&#8221; (NASB). The ancient versions also handle it variously: (1) &#8220;to do [something] early, to hasten to do [something]&#8221;: &#8220;Therefore I made haste to flee&#8221; (LXX), &#8220;That is why I hastened to run away&#8221; (<i>Tg</i>. Jonah 4:2); and (2) &#8220;to go before, to be in front&#8221;: &#8220;Therefore I went before to flee to Tarshish&#8221; (Vulgate). The two most likely options are (1) &#8220;to do [something] the first time&#8221; = &#8220;This is why I originally fled to Tarshish&#8221; and (2) &#8220;to anticipate, forestall [something]&#8221; = &#8220;This is what I tried to forestall [= prevent] by fleeing to Tarshish.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="47"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=156><b>tn</b><i> </i>See note on the phrase &#8220;to Tarshish&#8221; in 1:3.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The narrator skillfully withheld Jonah&#8217;s motivations from the reader up to this point for rhetorical effect &#8211; to build suspense and to create a shocking, surprising effect. Now, for the first time, the narrator reveals why Jonah fled from the commission of God in 1:3 &#8211; he had not wanted to give God the opportunity to relent from judging Nineveh! Jonah knew that if he preached in Nineveh, the people might repent and as a result, God might more than likely relent from sending judgment. Hoping to seal their fate, Jonah had originally refused to preach so that the Ninevites would not have an opportunity to repent. Apparently Jonah hoped that God would have therefore judged them without advance warning. Or perhaps he was afraid he would betray his nationalistic self-interests by functioning as the instrument through which the <sc>Lord would spare Israel&#8217;s main enemy. Jonah probably wanted God to destroy Nineveh for three reasons: (1) as a loyal nationalist, he despised non-Israelites (cf. 1:9); (2) he believed that idolaters had forfeited any opportunity to be shown mercy (cf. 2:9-10); and (3) the prophets Amos and Hosea had recently announced that God would sovereignly use the Assyrians to judge unrepentant Israel (Hos 9:3; 11:5) and take them into exile (Amos 5:27). If God destroyed Nineveh, the Assyrians would not be able to destroy Israel. The better solution would have been for Jonah to work for the repentance of Nineveh <i>and</i> Israel.</p>

<A NAME="49"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=158><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;long of nostrils.&#8221; Because the nose often expresses anger through flared nostrils it became the source of this idiom meaning &#8220;slow to anger&#8221; (e.g., Exod 34:6; Num 14:18; Neh 9:17; Pss 86:15; 103:8; 145:8; Jer 15:15; Nah 1:3; BDB 74 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1512;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456;</font>).</p>

The classic statement of God&#8217;s willingness to relent from judgment when a sinful people repent is Jer 18:1-11.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Jonah is precisely correct in his listing of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s attributes. See Exod 34:6-7; Num 14:18-19; 2 Chr 30:9; Neh 9:17, 31-32; Pss 86:3-8, 15; 103:2-13; 116:5 (note the parallels to Jonah 2 in Ps 116:1-4); 145:8; Neh 9:17; Joel 2:13.</p>

This approach is adopted by many English versions: &#8220;Do you have any right to be angry?&#8221; (NIV); &#8220;Are you right to be angry?&#8221; (REB, NJB); &#8220;Is it right for you to be angry?&#8221; (NRSV, NLT); &#8220;Do you have good reason to be angry?&#8221; (NASB); &#8220;Do you do well to be angry?&#8221; (cf. KJV, NKJV, ASV, RSV); &#8220;What right do you have to be angry?&#8221; (cf. TEV, CEV). (2) It may be used as an adverb meaning &#8220;well, utterly, thoroughly&#8221; (BDB 405 s.v. 3; <i>HALOT</i> 408 s.v. 5; e.g., Deut 9:21; 13:15; 17:4; 19:18; 27:8; 1 Sam 16:17; 2 Kgs 11:18; Prov 15:2; Isa 23:16; Jer 1:12; Ezek 33:32; Mic 7:3). This view is adopted by other English versions: &#8220;Are you that deeply grieved?&#8221; (JPS, NJPS); &#8220;Are you so angry?&#8221; (NEB). This is also the approach of the <i>Tg</i>. Jonah 4:4: &#8220;Are you that greatly angered?&#8221; Whether or not Jonah had the right to be angry about the death of the plant is a trivial issue. Instead the dialogue focuses on the depth of Jonah&#8217;s anger: he would rather be dead than alive (vv. 3, 8) and he concludes by saying that he was as angry as he could possibly be (v. 9; see note on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;&#1470;&#1502;&#1464;&#1493;&#1462;&#1514;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ad-mavet</font>, &#8220;to death&#8221;] in v. 9). the <sc>Lord then uses an <font face="Scholar">a fortiori</font> argument (from lesser to greater): Jonah was very upset that the plant had died (v. 10), likewise God was very concerned about averting the destruction of Nineveh (v. 11).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The use of the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1496;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatab</font>, &#8220;rightly, good&#8221;) creates a wordplay with its antonym <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>, &#8220;evil, wrong&#8221;) which is used in 4:1 of Jonah&#8217;s bad attitude.</p>
<A NAME="415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=164><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Does it burn to you?&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kharah</font>, &#8220;to burn&#8221;) functions figuratively here (hypocatastasis) to refer to strong anger (BDB 354 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font>).

The construction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1462;&#1491;&#1462;&#1501;</font> + preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">min</font>, &#8220;from&#8221;) means &#8220;from the front&#8221; = &#8220;in front of&#8221; (Job 23:8; Ps 139:5; Isa 9:11) or &#8220;from the east&#8221; = &#8220;eastward, on the east side&#8221; (Gen 3:21; 12:8; Num 34:11; Josh 7:2; Ezek 11:23). Because the morning sunrise beat down upon Jonah (v. 8) and because the main city gate of Nineveh opened to the east, the term probably means &#8220;on the east side&#8221; of the city. But &#8220;in front of&#8221; the city would mean the same in this case.</p>

The MT vocalization is preferred for several reasons. First, it is the more difficult form with the assimilated <i>nun</i>. Second, the presence of the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsel</font>, &#8220;shadow&#8221;) just two words before helps to explain the origin of the LXX vocalization which was influenced by this noun in the immediate context. Third, God&#8217;s primary motivation in giving the plant to Jonah was not simply to provide shade for him because the next day the <sc>Lord killed the plant (v. 7). God&#8217;s primary motivation was to create a situation to &#8220;rescue&#8221; Jonah from his bad attitude. Nevertheless, the narrator&#8217;s choice of the somewhat ambiguous consonantal form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1492;&#1510;&#1497;&#1500;</font> might have been done to create a wordplay on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8220;to rescue, deliver&#8221;) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8220;to shade&#8221;). Jonah thought that God was providing him shade, but God was really working to deliver him from his evil attitude, as the ensuing dialogue indicates.</p>

It has a broad range of meanings: (1) &#8220;distress, misery, discomfort&#8221; (2) &#8220;misfortune, injury,&#8221; (3) &#8220;calamity, disaster,&#8221; (4) &#8220;moral evil,&#8221; and (5) &#8220;ill-disposed, evil attitude&#8221; (see BDB 949 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font>; <i>HALOT</i> 1262-63 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font>).

Here the narrator puns on the meaning &#8220;discomfort&#8221; created by the scorching desert heat, but God&#8217;s primary motivation is to &#8220;deliver&#8221; Jonah &#8211; not from something as trivial as physical discomfort from heat &#8211; but from his sinful attitude about God's willingness to spare Nineveh. This gives the term an especially ironic twist: Jonah is only concerned about being delivered from his physical &#8220;discomfort,&#8221; while God wants to deliver him from his &#8220;evil attitude.&#8221;</p>

The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1493;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (&#8220;death&#8221;) is often used as an absolute superlative with a negative sense, similar to the English expression &#8220;bored to death&#8221; (<i>IBHS</i> 267-69 §14.5). For example, &#8220;his soul was vexed to death&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">lamut</font>) means that he could no longer endure it (Judg 16:16), and &#8220;love is as strong as death&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1462;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kammavet</font>) means love is irresistible or exceedingly strong (Song 8:6). Here the expression &#8220;I am angry unto death&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;&#1470;&#1502;&#1464;&#1493;&#1462;&#1514;</font>) means that Jonah could not be more angry. Unfortunately, this idiomatic expression has gone undetected by virtually every other major English version to date (KJV, NKJV, RSV, NRSV, ASV, NASB, NIV, NJB, JPS, NJPS). The only English version that comes close to representing the idiom correctly is BBE: &#8220;I have a right to be <i>truly </i>angry.&#8221;</p>

Clearly, here God is referring to Jonah&#8217;s remorse and anger when the plant died (vv. 7-9), so here it means &#8220;to be troubled about&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 298 s.v. 1.c) rather than &#8220;to pity&#8221; (BDB 299 s.v. c). Elsewhere <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;</font> describes emotional grief caused by the loss of property (Gen 45:20) and the death of family members (Deut 13:9 [ET 13:8]). The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;</font> is derived from a common Semitic root which has a basic meaning &#8220;to pour out; to flow&#8221; which is used in reference to emotion and tears in particular. This is seen in the Hebrew expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1464;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505; &#1506;&#1461;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">takhush </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">en</font>, &#8220;the eyes flow&#8221;) picturing tears of concern and grief (c.f., Gen 45:20; Deut 13:9 [ET 13:8]).

In v. 10 it refers to Jonah&#8217;s lament over the death of his plant, meaning &#8220;to be upset about&#8221; or &#8220;to be troubled about&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 298 s.v. 1.c). However, here in v. 11 it means &#8220;to show pity, spare&#8221; from judgment (BDB 298 s.v. b; <i>HALOT</i> 298 s.v. 1.a; e.g., 1 Sam 24:11; Jer 21:7; Ezek 24:14). It is often used in contexts which contemplate whether God will or will not spare a sinful people from judgment (Ezek 5:11; 7:4, 9; 8:19; 9:5, 10; 20:17). So this repetition of the same verb but in a different sense creates a polysemantic wordplay in vv. 10-11. However, the wordplay is obscured by the appropriate translation for each usage &#8211; &#8220;be upset about&#8221; in v. 10 and &#8220;to spare&#8221; in v. 11 &#8211; therefore, the translation above attempts to bring out the wordplay in English: &#8220;to be [even more] concerned about.&#8221; </p>
