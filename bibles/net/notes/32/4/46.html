<A NAME="46"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=155><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;This is why I originally fled to Tarshish.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qadam</font>) in the Piel stem has a broad range of meanings and here could mean: (1) &#8220;to go before, be in front of&#8221; (1 Sam 20:25; Ps 68:26); (2) &#8220;to do [something] beforehand,&#8221; (Ps 119:147); or (3) &#8220;to anticipate, to do [something] early, forestall [something]&#8221; (Ps 119:148). The lexicons nuance Jonah 4:2 as &#8220;to do [something] for the first time&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 1069 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1491;&#1501;</font> 4) or &#8220;to do [something] beforehand&#8221; (BDB 870 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1501;</font> 3). The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1502;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497; &#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1465;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qiddamti livroakh</font>, &#8220;I did the first time to flee&#8221;) is an idiom that probably means &#8220;I originally fled&#8221; or &#8220;I fled the first time.&#8221; The infinitive construct <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1465;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (&#8220;to flee&#8221;) functions as an object complement. This phrase is translated variously by English versions, depending on the category of meaning chosen for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1501;</font>: (1) &#8220;to do [something] for the first time, beforehand&#8221;: &#8220;That is why I fled beforehand&#8221; (JPS, NJPS), &#8220;I fled before&#8221; (KJV), &#8220;I fled previously&#8221; (NKJV), &#8220;I fled at the beginning&#8221; (NRSV), &#8220;I first tried to flee&#8221; (NJB), &#8220;I fled at first&#8221; (NAB); (2) &#8220;to do [something] early, to hasten to do [something]&#8221;: &#8220;That is why I was so quick to flee&#8221; (NIV), &#8220;I hastened to flee&#8221; (ASV), &#8220;I made haste to flee&#8221; (RSV), &#8220;I did my best to run away&#8221; (TEV); and (3) &#8220;to anticipate, forestall [something]&#8221;: &#8220;it was to forestall this that I tried to escape to Tarshish&#8221; (REB), &#8220;to forestall it I tried to escape to Tarshish&#8221; (NEB), &#8220;in order to forestall this I fled&#8221; (NASB). The ancient versions also handle it variously: (1) &#8220;to do [something] early, to hasten to do [something]&#8221;: &#8220;Therefore I made haste to flee&#8221; (LXX), &#8220;That is why I hastened to run away&#8221; (<i>Tg</i>. Jonah 4:2); and (2) &#8220;to go before, to be in front&#8221;: &#8220;Therefore I went before to flee to Tarshish&#8221; (Vulgate). The two most likely options are (1) &#8220;to do [something] the first time&#8221; = &#8220;This is why I originally fled to Tarshish&#8221; and (2) &#8220;to anticipate, forestall [something]&#8221; = &#8220;This is what I tried to forestall [= prevent] by fleeing to Tarshish.&#8221;</p>
