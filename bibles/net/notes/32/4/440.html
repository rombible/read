<A NAME="440"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=189><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;their right from their left.&#8221; Interpreters wonder exactly what deficiency is meant by the phrase &#8220;do not know their right from their left.&#8221; The expression does not appear elsewhere in biblical Hebrew. It probably does not mean, as sometimes suggested, that Nineveh had 120,000 small children (the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">adam</font>, &#8220;people,&#8221; does not seem to be used of children alone). In any case, it refers to a deficiency in discernment that Jonah and the initial readers of Jonah would no doubt have considered themselves free of. For partial parallels see 2 Sam 19:35; Eccl 10:2; Ezek 22:26; 44:23.</p>
