<A NAME="438"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=187><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Should I not spare?&#8221;; or &#8220;Should I not show compassion?&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khus</font>) has a basic three-fold range of meanings: (1) &#8220;to be troubled about,&#8221; (2) &#8220;to look with compassion upon,&#8221; and (3) &#8220;to show pity, to spare (someone from death/judgment)&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 298 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1493;&#1505;</font>; BDB 299 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;</font>). In v. 10 it refers to Jonah&#8217;s lament over the death of his plant, meaning &#8220;to be upset about&#8221; or &#8220;to be troubled about&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 298 s.v. 1.c). However, here in v. 11 it means &#8220;to show pity, spare&#8221; from judgment (BDB 298 s.v. b; <i>HALOT</i> 298 s.v. 1.a; e.g., 1 Sam 24:11; Jer 21:7; Ezek 24:14). It is often used in contexts which contemplate whether God will or will not spare a sinful people from judgment (Ezek 5:11; 7:4, 9; 8:19; 9:5, 10; 20:17). So this repetition of the same verb but in a different sense creates a polysemantic wordplay in vv. 10-11. However, the wordplay is obscured by the appropriate translation for each usage &#8211; &#8220;be upset about&#8221; in v. 10 and &#8220;to spare&#8221; in v. 11 &#8211; therefore, the translation above attempts to bring out the wordplay in English: &#8220;to be [even more] concerned about.&#8221; </p>
