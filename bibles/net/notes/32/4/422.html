<A NAME="422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=171><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;evil attitude.&#8221; The meaning of the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>) is intentionally ambiguous; the author puns on its broad range of meanings to create a polysemantic wordplay. It has a broad range of meanings: (1) &#8220;distress, misery, discomfort&#8221; (2) &#8220;misfortune, injury,&#8221; (3) &#8220;calamity, disaster,&#8221; (4) &#8220;moral evil,&#8221; and (5) &#8220;ill-disposed, evil attitude&#8221; (see BDB 949 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font>; <i>HALOT</i> 1262-63 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font>). The narrator has used several meanings of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> in 3:8-4:2, namely, &#8220;moral evil&#8221; (3:8, 10) and &#8220;calamity, disaster&#8221; (3:9, 10; 4:2), as well as the related verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">a</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to be displeasing&#8221;; see 4:1). Here the narrator puns on the meaning &#8220;discomfort&#8221; created by the scorching desert heat, but God&#8217;s primary motivation is to &#8220;deliver&#8221; Jonah &#8211; not from something as trivial as physical discomfort from heat &#8211; but from his sinful attitude about God's willingness to spare Nineveh. This gives the term an especially ironic twist: Jonah is only concerned about being delivered from his physical &#8220;discomfort,&#8221; while God wants to deliver him from his &#8220;evil attitude.&#8221;</p>
