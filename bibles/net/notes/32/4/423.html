<A NAME="423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=172><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he rejoiced with great joy.&#8221; The cognate accusative construction repeats the verb and noun of the consonantal root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">smkh</font>, &#8220;rejoice&#8221;) for emphasis; it means &#8220;he rejoiced with great joy&#8221; or &#8220;he was greatly delighted&#8221; (see <i>IBHS</i> 167 §10.2.1g). This cognate accusative construction ironically mirrors the identical syntax of v. 1, &#8220;he was angry with great anger.&#8221; The narrator repeated this construction to emphasize the contrast between Jonah&#8217;s anger that Nineveh was spared and his joy that his discomfort was relieved.</p>
