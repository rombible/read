<A NAME="414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=163><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Rightly does it burn to you?&#8221; Note this question occurs again in v. 9, there concerning the withered plant. &#8220;Does it so thoroughly burn to you?&#8221; or &#8220;Does it rightly burn to you?&#8221; or &#8220;Does it burn so thoroughly to you?&#8221; The Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1496;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatav</font>, &#8220;to do good&#8221;) here may have one of two meanings: (1) It may mean &#8220;to do [something] rightly&#8221; in terms of ethical right and wrong (BDB 406 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1496;&#1463;&#1489;</font> 5.b; <i>HALOT</i> 408 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1496;&#1489;</font> 3.c; e.g., Gen 4:7; Lev 5:4; Pss 36:4; 119:68; Isa 1:17; Jer 4:22; 13:23). This approach is adopted by many English versions: &#8220;Do you have any right to be angry?&#8221; (NIV); &#8220;Are you right to be angry?&#8221; (REB, NJB); &#8220;Is it right for you to be angry?&#8221; (NRSV, NLT); &#8220;Do you have good reason to be angry?&#8221; (NASB); &#8220;Do you do well to be angry?&#8221; (cf. KJV, NKJV, ASV, RSV); &#8220;What right do you have to be angry?&#8221; (cf. TEV, CEV). (2) It may be used as an adverb meaning &#8220;well, utterly, thoroughly&#8221; (BDB 405 s.v. 3; <i>HALOT</i> 408 s.v. 5; e.g., Deut 9:21; 13:15; 17:4; 19:18; 27:8; 1 Sam 16:17; 2 Kgs 11:18; Prov 15:2; Isa 23:16; Jer 1:12; Ezek 33:32; Mic 7:3). This view is adopted by other English versions: &#8220;Are you that deeply grieved?&#8221; (JPS, NJPS); &#8220;Are you so angry?&#8221; (NEB). This is also the approach of the <i>Tg</i>. Jonah 4:4: &#8220;Are you that greatly angered?&#8221; Whether or not Jonah had the right to be angry about the death of the plant is a trivial issue. Instead the dialogue focuses on the depth of Jonah&#8217;s anger: he would rather be dead than alive (vv. 3, 8) and he concludes by saying that he was as angry as he could possibly be (v. 9; see note on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;&#1470;&#1502;&#1464;&#1493;&#1462;&#1514;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ad-mavet</font>, &#8220;to death&#8221;] in v. 9). the <sc>Lord then uses an <font face="Scholar">a fortiori</font> argument (from lesser to greater): Jonah was very upset that the plant had died (v. 10), likewise God was very concerned about averting the destruction of Nineveh (v. 11).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The use of the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1496;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatab</font>, &#8220;rightly, good&#8221;) creates a wordplay with its antonym <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>, &#8220;evil, wrong&#8221;) which is used in 4:1 of Jonah&#8217;s bad attitude.</p>
