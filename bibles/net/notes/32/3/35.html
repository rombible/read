<A NAME="35"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=127><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;was a great city to God/gods.&#8221; The greatness of Nineveh has been mentioned already in 1:2 and 3:2. What is being added now? Does the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1461;&#1488;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">le</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">lohim</font>, &#8220;to God/gods&#8221;) (1) refer to the <sc>Lord&#8217;s personal estimate of the city, (2) does it speak of the city as &#8220;belonging to&#8221; God, (3) does it refer to Nineveh as a city with many shrines and gods, or (4) is it simply an idiomatic reinforcement of the city&#8217;s size? Interpreters do not agree on the answer. To introduce the idea either of God&#8217;s ownership or of dedication to idolatry (though not impossible) is unexpected here, being without parallel or follow-up elsewhere in the book. The alternatives &#8220;great/large/important in God&#8217;s estimation&#8221; (consider Ps 89:41b) or the merely idiomatic &#8220;exceptionally great/large/important&#8221; could both be amplified by focus on physical size in the following phrase and are both consistent with emphases elsewhere in the book (Jonah 4:11 again puts attention on size &#8211; of population). If &#8220;great&#8221; is best understood as a reference primarily to size here, in view of the following phrase and v. 4a (Jonah went &#8220;one day&#8217;s walk&#8221;), rather than to importance, this might weigh slightly in favor of an idiomatic &#8220;very great/large,&#8221; though no example with &#8220;God&#8221; used idiomatically to indicate superlative (Gen 23:6; 30:8; Exod 9:28; 1 Sam 14:15; Pss 36:6; 80:10) has exactly the same construction as the wording in Jonah 3:3.</p>
