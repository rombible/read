<A NAME="34"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=126><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qara</font>&#8217;, &#8220;proclaim&#8221;) is repeated from 1:2 but with a significant variation. The phrase in 1:2 was the adversative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488; &#1506;&#1464;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qÿra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>, &#8220;proclaim against&#8221;), which often designates an announcement of threatened judgment (1 Kgs 13:4, 32; Jer 49:29; Lam 1:15). However, here the phrase is the more positive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488; &#1488;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qÿra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>, &#8220;proclaim to&#8221;) which often designates an oracle of deliverance or a call to repentance, with an accompanying offer of deliverance that is either explicit or implied (Deut 20:10; Isa 40:2; Zech 1:4; <i>HALOT</i> 1129 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;</font> 8; BDB 895 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;</font> 3.a). This shift from the adversative preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8220;against&#8221;) to the more positive preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (&#8220;to&#8221;) might signal a shift in God&#8217;s intentions or perhaps it simply makes his original intention more clear. While God threatened to judge Nineveh, he was very willing to relent and forgive when the people repented from their sins (3:8-10). Jonah later complains that he knew that God was likely to relent from the threatened judgment all along (4:2).</p>
