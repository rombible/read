<A NAME="310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=132><b>sn</b> <i>The people of Nineveh believed in God&#8230;</i>. Verse 5 provides a summary of the response in Nineveh; the people of all ranks believed and gave evidence of contrition by fasting and wearing sackcloth (2 Sam 12:16, 19-23; 1 Kgs 21:27-29; Neh 9:1-2). Then vv. 6-9 provide specific details, focusing on the king&#8217;s reaction. The Ninevites&#8217; response parallels the response of the pagan sailors in 1:6 and 13-16. </p>
