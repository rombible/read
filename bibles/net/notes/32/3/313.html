<A NAME="313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=135><b>tn</b> Contrary to many modern English versions, the present translation understands the king&#8217;s proclamation to begin after the phrase &#8220;and he said&#8221; (rather than after &#8220;in Nineveh&#8221;), as do quotations in 1:14; 2:2, 4; 4:2, 8, 9. In Jonah where the quotation does not begin immediately after &#8220;said&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">amar</font>), it is only the speaker or addressee or both that come between &#8220;said&#8221; and the start of the quotation (1:6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12; 4:4, 9, 10; cf. 1:1; 3:1).</p>
