<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=90><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;your&#8230; your&#8230;&#8221; The 2nd person masculine singular suffixes on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1462;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464; &#1493;&#1456;&#1490;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mishbarekha vÿgallekha</font>, &#8220;your breakers and your waves&#8221;) function as genitives of source. Just as God had hurled a violent wind upon the sea (1:4) and had sovereignly sent the large fish to swallow him (1:17 [2:1 HT]), Jonah viewed God as sovereignly responsible for afflicting him with sea waves that were crashing upon his head, threatening to drown him. <i>Tg</i>. Jonah 2:3 alters the 2nd person masculine singular suffixes to 3rd person masculine singular suffixes to make them refer to the sea and not to God, for the sake of smoothness: &#8220;all the gales of the sea and its billows.&#8221;</p>
