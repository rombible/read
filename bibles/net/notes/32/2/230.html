<A NAME="230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=105><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;behind me.&#8221; The preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ad</font>) with a pronominal suffix and with the meaning &#8220;behind&#8221; is found also in Judg 3:23. Jonah pictures himself as closed in and so unable to escape death. Having described how far he had come (totally under water and &#8220;to the ends of mountains&#8221;), Jonah describes the way back as permanently closed against him. Just as it was impossible for a lone individual to walk through the barred gates of a walled city, so Jonah expected it was impossible for him to escape death.</p>
