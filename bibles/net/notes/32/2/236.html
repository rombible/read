<A NAME="236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=111><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;remembered.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zakhar</font>) usually means &#8220;to remember, to call to mind&#8221; but it can also mean &#8220;to call out&#8221; (e.g., Nah 2:6) as in the related Akkadian verb <font face="Scholar">zikaru</font>, &#8220;to name, to mention.&#8221; The idiom &#8220;to remember the <sc>Lord&#8221; here encompasses calling to mind his character and past actions and appealing to him for help (Deut 8:18-19; Ps 42:6-8; Isa 64:4-5; Zech 10:9). <i>Tg</i>. Jonah 2:7 glosses the verb as &#8220;I remembered the worship of the <sc>Lord<b>,</b>&#8221; which somewhat misses the point.</p>
