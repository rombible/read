<A NAME="227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=102><b>tn</b> Some English versions (e.g., NEB, NRSV) have connected the &#8220;bottoms of the mountains&#8221; with the preceding &#8211; &#8220;weeds were wrapped around my head at the bottoms of the mountains&#8221; &#8211; and connect &#8220;I went down&#8221; with &#8220;the earth.&#8221; Such a connection between &#8220;I went down&#8221; and &#8220;the earth&#8221; is difficult to accept. It would be more normal in Hebrew to express &#8220;I went down to the earth&#8221; with a directive ending (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">artsah</font>) or with a Hebrew preposition before &#8220;earth&#8221; or without the definite article. The Masoretic accents, in addition, connect &#8220;ends of the mountains&#8221; with the verb &#8220;I went down&#8221; and call for a break between the verb and &#8220;earth.&#8221;</p>
