<A NAME="25"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=80><b>tn</b> <i>Tg</i>. Jonah 2:2 renders this interpretively: &#8220;and he heard my prayer.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The first verse of the prayer summarizes the whole &#8211; &#8220;I was in trouble; I called to the <sc>Lord for help; he rescued me; I will give him thanks&#8221; &#8211; before elaborating on the nature and extent of the trouble (vv. 3-7a), mentioning the cry for help and the subsequent rescue (6b-7), and promising to give thanks (8-9). These elements, as well as much vocabulary and imagery found in Jonah&#8217;s prayer, appear also in other Hebrew psalms. With Jonah 2:1 compare, for example, Pss 18:6; 22:24; 81:7; 116:1-4; 120:1; 130:1-2; Lam 3:55-56. These references and others indicate that Jonah was familiar with prayers used in worship at the temple in Jerusalem; he knew &#8220;all the right words.&#8221; Consider also Ps 107 with Jonah as a whole.</p>
