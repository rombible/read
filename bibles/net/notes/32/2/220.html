<A NAME="220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=95><b>tc</b> Or &#8220;Yet I will look again to your holy temple&#8221; or &#8220;Surely I will look again to your holy temple.&#8221; The MT and the vast majority of ancient textual witnesses vocalize consonantal <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1498;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">kh</font>) as the adverb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akh</font>) which functions as an emphatic asseverative &#8220;surely&#8221; (BDB 36 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> 1) or an adversative &#8220;yet, nevertheless&#8221; (BDB 36 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> 2; so <i>Tg</i>. Jonah 2:4: &#8220;However, I shall look again upon your holy temple&#8221;). These options understand the line as an expression of hopeful piety. As a positive statement, Jonah expresses hope that he will live to return to worship in Jerusalem. It may be a way of saying, &#8220;I will pray for help, even though I have been banished&#8221; (see v. 8; cf. Dan 6:10). The sole dissenter is the Greek recension of Theodotion which reads the interrogative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#8182;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pws</font>, &#8220;how?&#8221;) which reflects an alternate vocalization tradition of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ekh</font>) &#8211; a defectively written form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ekh</font>, &#8220;how?&#8221;; BDB 32 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1498;&#1456;</font> 1). This would be translated, &#8220;How shall I again look at your holy temple?&#8221; (cf. NRSV). Jonah laments that he will not be able to worship at the temple in Jerusalem again &#8211; this is a metonymical statement (effect for cause) that he feels certain that he is about to die. It continues the expression of Jonah&#8217;s distress and separation from the <sc>Lord, begun in v. 2 and continued without relief in vv. 3-7a. The external evidence favors the MT; however, internal evidence seems to favor the alternate vocalization tradition reflected in Theodotion for four reasons. First, the form of the psalm is a declarative praise in which Jonah begins with a summary praise (v. 2), continues by recounting his past plight <br>(vv. 3-6a) and the <sc>Lord&#8217;s intervention (vv. 6b-7), and concludes with a lesson (v. 8) and vow to praise (v. 9). So the statement with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456;</font> in v. 4 falls within the plight &#8211; not within a declaration of confidence. Second, while the poetic parallelism of v. 4 could be antithetical (&#8220;I have been banished from your sight, <i>yet</i> I will again look to your holy temple&#8221;), <br>synonymous parallelism fits the context of the lament better (&#8220;I have been banished from your sight; Will I ever again see your holy temple?&#8221;). Third, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456;</font> is the more difficult vocalization because it is a defectively written form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (&#8220;how?&#8221;) and therefore easily confused with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (&#8220;surely&#8221; or &#8220;yet, nevertheless&#8221;). Fourth, nothing in the first half of the psalm reflects any inkling of confidence on the part of Jonah that he would be delivered from imminent death. In fact, Jonah states in v. 7 that he did not turn to God in prayer until some time later when he was on the very brink of death.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Both options for the start of the line (&#8220;how?&#8221; and &#8220;yet&#8221; or &#8220;surely&#8221;) fit the ironic portrayal of Jonah in the prayer (see also vv.8-9). Jonah, who had been trying to escape the <sc>Lord&#8217;s attention, here appears remarkably fond of worshiping him. Is there perhaps also a hint of motivation for the <sc>Lord to rescue this eager worshiper? Confession of disobedience, on the other hand, is absent. Compare Ps 31:22, where the first half (describing the plight) is very similar to the first half of Jonah 2:3, and the second half starts with &#8220;nevertheless&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1499;&#1461;&#1503;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">akhen</font>) and is a positive contrast, a report that God heard, using four words that appear in Jonah 2:2 (cf. Job 32:7-8; Ps 82:6-7; Isa 49:4; Zeph 3:7).</p>
