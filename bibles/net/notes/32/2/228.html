<A NAME="228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=103><b>tn</b><i> Heb </i>&#8220;As for the earth, its bars&#8230;&#8221; This phrase is a rhetorical nominative construction (also known as <i>casus pendens</i>) in which the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arets</font>, &#8220;the earth&#8221;) stands grammatically isolated and in an emphatic position prior to the third feminine singular suffix that picks up on it in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1495;&#1462;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿrikheha</font>, &#8220;its bars&#8221;; see <i>IBHS</i> 128-30 §8.3). This construction is used to emphasize the subject, in this case, the &#8220;bars of the netherworld.&#8221; The word translated &#8220;bars&#8221; appears elsewhere to speak of bars used in constructing the sides of the tabernacle and often of crossbars (made of wood or metal) associated with the gates of fortified cities (cf. Exod 36:31-34; Judg 16:3; 1 Kgs 4:13; Neh 3:3; Pss 107:16; 147:13; Isa 45:1-2).</p>
