<A NAME="240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=115><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;abandon their mercy/loyalty.&#8221; The meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1505;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501; &#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1494;&#1465;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khasdam ya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">azovu</font>, &#8220;forsake their mercy/loyalty&#8221;) is greatly debated. There are two exegetical issues that are mutually related. First, does the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khesed</font>) here mean (1) &#8220;mercy, kindness&#8221; that man receives from God, or (2) &#8220;loyalty, faithfulness&#8221; that man must give to God (see BDB 338-39 s.v <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1491;</font>; <i>HALOT</i> 336-37 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1491;</font>)? Second, the third masculine plural suffix on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1505;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (&#8220;their loyalty/mercy&#8221;) has been taken as (1) subjective genitive, referring to the loyal allegiance they ought to display to the true God: &#8220;they abandon the loyalty they should show.&#8221; Examples of subjective genitives are: &#8220;This is <i>your kindness</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1505;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khasdek</font>) which you must do for me: every place to which we come, say of me, &#8216;He is my brother&#8217;&#8221; (Gen 20:13; also cf. Gen 40:14; 1 Sam 20:14-15). Several English versions take this approach: &#8220;forsake their faithfulness&#8221; (NASB), &#8220;abandon their faithful love&#8221; (NJB), &#8220;abandon their loyalty&#8221; (NEB, REB), &#8220;forsake their true loyalty&#8221; (RSV, NRSV), &#8220;turn their backs on all God&#8217;s mercies&#8221; (NLT), &#8220;have abandoned their loyalty to you&#8221; (TEV). (2) This has also been taken as objective genitive, referring to the mercy they might have received from God: &#8220;they forfeit the mercy that could be theirs.&#8221; The ancient versions interpret <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1505;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> in this sense: &#8220;they do not know the source of their welfare&#8221; (<i>Tg</i>. Jonah 2:8), &#8220;forsake the source of their welfare&#8221; (Vulgate), and &#8220;abandon their own mercy&#8221; (LXX). Several English versions follow this approach: &#8220;forsake their source of mercy&#8221; (NAB); &#8220;forfeit the grace that could be theirs&#8221; (NIV), &#8220;forsake their own welfare&#8221; (JPS, NJPS), &#8220;forsake their own mercy&#8221; (KJV, ASV), &#8220;forsake their own Mercy&#8221; (NKJV), &#8220;turn from the God who offers them mercy&#8221; (CEV). This is a difficult lexical/syntactical problem. On the one hand, the next line contrasts their failure with Jonah&#8217;s boast of loyalty to the true God &#8211; demonstrating that he, unlike pagan idolaters, deserves to be delivered. On the other hand, the only other use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1491;</font> in the book refers to &#8220;mercy&#8221; God bestows (4:2) &#8211; something that Jonah did not believe that the (repentant) pagan idolaters had a right to receive. BDB 339 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1491;</font> II takes this approach &#8211; &#8220;He is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1505;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> <i>their goodness, favour</i> Jonah 2:9&#8221; &#8211; and cites other examples of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1491;</font> with suffixes referring to God: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1505;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khasdi</font>) &#8220;my kindness&#8221; = he shows kindness to me (Ps 144:2); and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1497; &#1495;&#1463;&#1505;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohe khasdi</font>) &#8220;the God of my kindness&#8221; = the God who shows kindness to me (Ps 59:18).</p>
