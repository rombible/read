<a name="132"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=32><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;gods&#8221; (CEV, NLT). The plural noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohim</font>) might be functioning either as a plural of number (&#8220;gods&#8221;) or a plural of majesty (&#8220;god&#8221;) &#8211; the form would allow for either. As members of a polytheistic culture, each sailor might appeal to several gods. However, individuals could also look to a particular god for help in trouble. <i>Tg</i>. Jonah 1:5 interpretively renders the line, &#8220;Each man prayed to his idols, but they saw that they were useless.&#8221;</p>
