The Phoenician sailors here cried out to their gods and cast lots in the hope that one of their gods might reveal the identity of the person with whom he was angry. CEV has well captured the sentiment of v.7b: &#8220;&#8216;Let&#8217;s ask our gods to show us who caused all this trouble.&#8217; It turned out to be Jonah.&#8221;</p>
