The reaction of the called person is normally expressed by the verbs&#8230;&#8216;answer&#8217; and&#8230;&#8216;hear&#8217;&#8221; (L. Jonker, <i>NIDOTTE</i> 3:971).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The imperatives &#8220;arise!&#8221; and &#8220;cry out!&#8221; are repeated from v. 2 for ironic effect. The captain&#8217;s words would have rung in Jonah&#8217;s ears as a stinging reminder that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> had uttered them once before.
