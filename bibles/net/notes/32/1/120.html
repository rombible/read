<a name="120"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=20><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;its fare.&#8221; The 3rd person feminine singular suffix on the noun probably functions as a genitive of worth or value: &#8220;the fare due it.&#8221; However, it is translated here simply as &#8220;the fare&#8221; for the sake of readability. On the other hand &#8220;bought a ticket&#8221; (CEV, NLT) is somewhat overtranslated, since the expression &#8220;paid the fare&#8221; is still understandable to most English readers.</p>
