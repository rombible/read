<a name="153"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=53><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;fear.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1512;&#1461;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yare</font>&#8217;) has a broad range of meanings, including &#8220;to fear, to worship, to revere, to respect&#8221; (BDB 431 s.v.). When God is the object, it normally means &#8220;to fear&#8221; (leading to obedience; BDB 431 s.v. 1) or &#8220;to worship&#8221; (= to stand in awe of; BDB 431 s.v. 2). Because the fear of God leads to wisdom and obedience, that is probably not the sense here. Instead Jonah professes to be a loyal Yahwist &#8211; in contrast to the pagan Phoenician sailors who worshiped false gods, he worshiped the one true God. Unfortunately his worship of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> lacked the necessary moral prerequisite.</p>
