<a name="134"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=34><b>tn</b> The plural word rendered &#8220;cargo&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kelim</font>) is variously translated &#8220;articles, vessels, objects, baggage, instruments&#8221; (see 1 Sam 17:22; 1 Kgs 10:21; 1 Chr 15:16; Isa 18:2; Jer 22:7). As a general term, it fits here to describe the sailors throwing overboard whatever they could. The English word &#8220;cargo&#8221; should be taken generally to include the ship&#8217;s payload and whatever else could be dispensed with.</p>
