<a name="117"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=17><b>sn</b> <i>Joppa</i> was a small harbor town on the Palestinian coast known as Yepu in the Amarna Letters (14<sup>th</sup> century <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span>) and Yapu in Neo-Assyrian inscriptions (9th-8th centuries <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span>). It was a port through which imported goods could flow into the Levant (Josh 19:46; 2 Chr 2:15 [16]; Ezra 3:7). It was never annexed by Israel until the Maccabean period (ca. 148 <span class="smallcaps">b.c.; </span>1 Macc 10:76). Jonah chose a port where the people he would meet and the ships he could take were not likely to be Israelite. Once in Joppa he was already partly &#8220;away from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221; as he conceived it.</p>
