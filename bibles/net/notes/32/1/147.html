In some cultures the procedure for &#8220;casting lots&#8221; is to &#8220;draw straws&#8221; so that the person who receives the short straw is chosen. In other situations a colored stone or a designated playing card might be picked at random. In Jonah&#8217;s case, small stones were probably used.</p>
