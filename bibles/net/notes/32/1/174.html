<a name="174"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=74><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they sacrificed sacrifices.&#8221; The root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1489;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zbkh</font>, &#8220;sacrifice&#8221;) is repeated in the verb and accusative noun, forming an emphatic effected accusative construction in which the verbal action produces the object (see <i>IBHS</i> 166-67 §10.2.1f). Their act of sacrificing would produce the sacrifices. It is likely that the two sets of effected accusative constructions here (&#8220;they vowed vows and sacrificed sacrifices&#8221;) form a hendiadys; the two phrases connote one idea: &#8220;they earnestly vowed to sacrifice lavishly.&#8221; It is unlikely that they offered animal sacrifices at this exact moment on the boat &#8211; they had already thrown their cargo overboard, presumably leaving no animals to sacrifice. Instead, they probably vowed that they would sacrifice to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> when &#8211; and if &#8211; they reached dry ground. <i>Tg</i>. Jonah 1:16 also takes this as a vow to sacrifice but for a different reason. According to Jewish tradition, the heathen are not allowed to make sacrifice to the God of Israel outside Jerusalem, so the Targum modified the text by making it a promise to sacrifice: &#8220;they promised to offer a sacrifice before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord </span>and they made vows&#8221; (see B. Levine, <i>The Aramaic Version of Jonah</i>, 70; K. Cathcart and R. Gordon, <i>The Targum of the Minor Prophets</i> [ArBib], 14:106, n. 29).</p>
