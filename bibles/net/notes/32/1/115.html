The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;</font> is used with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">barakh</font>, &#8220;to flee&#8221;) only here in biblical Hebrew so it is difficult to determine its exact meaning (<i>HALOT</i> 942 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1462;&#1492;</font> 4.h.ii; see E. Jenni, &#8220;&#8216;Fliehen&#8217; im akkadischen und im hebräischen Sprachgebrauch,&#8221; <i>Or </i>47 [1978]: 357). The most likely options are: (1) Jonah simply fled from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s presence manifested in the temple (for mention of the temple elsewhere in Jonah, see 2:5,8). This is reflected in Jerome&#8217;s rendering<i> fugeret in Tharsis a facie Domini</i> (&#8220;he fled to Tarshish away from the face/presence of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221;). The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;</font> is used in this sense with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatsa</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to go out&#8221;) to depict someone or something physically leaving the manifested presence of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> (Lev 9:24; Num 17:11, 24; cf. Gen 4:16). This is reflected in several English versions: &#8220;from the presence of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221; (KJV, NKJV, RSV, NRSV, ASV, NASB) and &#8220;out of the reach of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221; (REB). (2) Jonah was fleeing to a distant place outside the land of Israel (D. Stuart, <i>Hosea-Jonah</i> [WBC], 450). The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1508;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;</font> is used in various constructions with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> to describe locations outside the land of Israel where Yahweh was not worshiped (1 Sam 26:19-20; 2 Kgs 13:23; 17:20, 23; Jer 23:39). This would be the equivalent of a self-imposed exile. (3) The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;</font> can mean &#8220;out of sight&#8221; (Gen 23:4,8), so perhaps Jonah was trying to escape from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s active awareness &#8211; out of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s sight. The idea would either be an anthropomorphism (standing for a distance out of the sight of God) or it would reflect an inadequate theology of the limited omniscience and presence of God. This is reflected in some English versions: &#8220;ran away from the Lord&#8221; (NIV), &#8220;running away from Yahweh&#8221; (NJB), &#8220;to get away from the Lord&#8221; (NLT), &#8220;to escape from the Lord&#8221; (NEB) and &#8220;to escape&#8221; (CEV). (4) The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1508;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;</font> can mean &#8220;in front of someone in power&#8221; (Gen 43:33; <i>HALOT</i> 942 s.v. c.i) and &#8220;at the disposal of&#8221; a king (Gen 13:9; 24:51; 34:10; 2 Chr 14:6; Jer 40:4; <i>HALOT</i> 942 s.v. 4.f). The expression would be a metonymy: Jonah was trying to escape from his commission (effect) ordered by God (cause). This is reflected in several English versions: &#8220;to flee from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s service&#8221; (JPS, NJPS). Jonah confesses in 4:2-3 that he fled to avoid carrying out his commission &#8211; lest God relent from judging Nineveh if its populace might repent. But it is also clear in chs. 1-2 that Jonah could not escape from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> himself.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Three times in chap. 1 (in vv. 3 and 10) Jonah&#8217;s voyage is described as an attempt to escape <i>away from the </i><span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> &#8211; from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s presence (and therefore his active awareness; compare v. 2). On one level, Jonah was attempting to avoid a disagreeable task, but the narrator&#8217;s description personalizes Jonah&#8217;s rejection of the task. Jonah&#8217;s issue is with the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> himself, not just his commission. The narrator&#8217;s description is also highly ironic, as the rest of the book shows. Jonah tries to sail to Tarshish, in the opposite direction from Nineveh, as if by doing that he could escape from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, when the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is the one who knows all about Nineveh&#8217;s wickedness and is involved in all that happens to Jonah throughout the book. Compare Jonah&#8217;s explanation when talking with the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> (see 4:2).</p>
