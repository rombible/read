<a name="154"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=54><b>tn</b><i> Heb </i>&#8220;The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of heaven, I fear.&#8221; The Hebrew word order is unusual. Normally the verb appears first, but here the direct object &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of heaven&#8221; precedes the verb. Jonah emphasizes the object of his worship. In contrast to the Phoenician sailors who worship pagan polytheistic gods, Jonah took pride in his theological orthodoxy. Ironically, his &#8220;fear&#8221; of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> in this case was limited to this profession of theological orthodoxy because his actions betrayed his refusal to truly &#8220;fear&#8221; God by obeying him.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The word <i>fear</i> appears in v. 5, here in v. 9, and later in vv. 10 and 16. Except for this use in v. 9, every other use describes the sailors&#8217; response (emotional fear prompting physical actions) to the storm or to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. By contrast, Jonah claims to fear God but his attitude and actions do not reflect this. It is clear that Jonah does not &#8220;fear&#8221; in the same way that they do.</p>
