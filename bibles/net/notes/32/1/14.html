Occupying about 1800 acres, it was located on the east bank of the Tigris River across from the modern city of Mosul, Iraq. The site includes two tels, Nebi Yunus and Kouyunjik, which have been excavated on several occasions. See A. H. Layard, <i>Nineveh and Its Remains</i>; R. C. Thompson and R. W. Hutchinson, <i>A Century of Exploration at Nineveh</i>; G. Waterfield, <i>Layard of Nineveh</i>. Preliminary reports of limited excavations in 1987 and 1989 appear in <font face="Scholar">Mar Sóipri</font> 1:2 (1988): 1-2; 2:2 (1989): 1-2; 4:1 (1991): 1-3. Also see D. J. Wiseman, &#8220;Jonah&#8217;s Nineveh,&#8221; <i>TynBul</i> 30 (1979): 29-51.</p>
