<a name="112"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=12><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he arose to flee.&#8221; The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1501; &#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1465;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyaqam livroakh</font>, &#8220;he arose to flee&#8221;) is a wordplay on the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s command (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; &#1500;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">qum lekh</font>; &#8220;Arise! Go!&#8221;) in v. 2. By repeating the first verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</font> the narrator sets up the reader to expect that Jonah was intending to obey God. But Jonah did not &#8220;arise to go&#8221; to Nineveh; he &#8220;arose to flee&#8221; to Tarshish. Jonah looks as though he was about to obey, but he does not. This unexpected turn of events creates strong irony. The narrator does not reveal Jonah&#8217;s motivation to the reader at this point. He delays this revelation for rhetorical effect until 4:2-3.</p>
