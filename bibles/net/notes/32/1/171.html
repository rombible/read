<a name="171"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=71><b>tc</b> The editors of <i>BHS</i> suggest that the direct object <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et-yÿhvah</font>, &#8220;the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8221;) might be a scribal addition, and that the original text simply read, &#8220;The men became greatly afraid&#8230;&#8221; However, there is no shred of external evidence to support this conjectural emendation. Admittedly, the apparent &#8220;conversion&#8221; of these Phoenician sailors to Yahwism is a surprising development. But two literary features support the Hebrew text as it stands. First, it is not altogether clear whether or not the sailors actually converted to faith in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. They might have simply incorporated him into their polytheistic religion. Second, the narrator has taken pains to portray the pagan sailors as a literary foil to Jonah by contrasting Jonah&#8217;s hypocritical profession to fear the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> (v. 9) with the sailors&#8217; actions that reveal an authentic fear of God (v. 10, 14, 16).</p>
