<A NAME="201"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=708><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;a man of worthlessness.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="202"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=709><b>tn</b> The expression used here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿmini</font>) is a short form of the more common &#8220;Benjamin.&#8221; It appears elsewhere in 1 Sam 9:4 and Esth 2:5. Cf. 1 Sam 9:1.</p>
<A NAME="203"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=710><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the shophar&#8221; (the ram&#8217;s horn trumpet). So also v. 22.</p>
<A NAME="204"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=711><b>tc</b> The MT reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1465;&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ohalav</font>, &#8220;to his tents&#8221;). For a similar idiom, see 19:9. An ancient scribal tradition understands the reading to be <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">le</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">lohav</font>, &#8220;to his gods&#8221;). The word is a <font face="Scholar">tiqqun sopherim</font>, and the scribes indicate that they changed the word from &#8220;gods&#8221; to &#8220;tents&#8221; so as to soften its theological implications. In a consonantal Hebrew text the change involved only the metathesis of two letters. </p>
<A NAME="205"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=712><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;went up from after.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="206"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=713><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;River&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but has been supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="207"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=714><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="208"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=715><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;house.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="209"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=716><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and he placed them in a guarded house.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=717><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;he did not come to them&#8221;; NAB &#8220;has no further relations with them&#8221;; NIV &#8220;did not lie with them&#8221;; TEV &#8220;did not have intercourse with them&#8221;; NLT &#8220;would no longer sleep with them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2011"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=718><b>tn</b> The present translation follows the Masoretic accentuation, with the major mark of disjunction (i.e., the <font face="Scholar">atnach</font>) placed at the word &#8220;days.&#8221; However, some scholars have suggested moving the <font face="Scholar">atnach</font> to &#8220;Judah&#8221; a couple of words earlier. This would yield the following sense: &#8220;Three days, and you be present here with them.&#8221; The difference in meaning is slight, and the MT is acceptable as it stands.</p>
<A NAME="2012"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=719><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;find.&#8221; The perfect verbal form is unexpected with the preceding word &#8220;otherwise.&#8221; We should probably read instead the imperfect. Although it is possible to understand the perfect here as indicating that the feared result is thought of as already having taken place (cf. BDB 814 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;</font> 2), it is more likely that the perfect is simply the result of scribal error. In this context the imperfect would be more consistent with the following verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿhitsil</font>, &#8220;and he will get away&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="2013"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=720><b>sn</b> The significance of the statement <i>it fell out </i>here is unclear. If the dagger fell out of its sheath before Joab got to Amasa, how then did he kill him? Josephus, <i>Ant</i>.<i> </i>7.11.7 (7.284), suggested that as Joab approached Amasa he deliberately caused the dagger to fall to the ground at an opportune moment as though by accident. When he bent over and picked it up, he then stabbed Amasa with it. Others have tried to make a case for thinking that two swords are referred to &#8211; the one that fell out and another that Joab kept concealed until the last moment. But nothing in the text clearly supports this view. Perhaps Josephus&#8217; understanding is best, but it is by no means obvious in the text either.</p>
<A NAME="2014"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=721><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Joab) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2015"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=722><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;his&#8221;; the referent (Amasa) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=723><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and he did not repeat concerning him, and he died.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2017"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=724><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;takes delight in.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2018"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=725><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;him&#8221;; the referent (Amasa) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2019"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=726><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (the man who spoke up in v. 11) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2020"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=727><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Amasa.&#8221; For stylistic reasons the name has been replaced by the pronoun (&#8220;him&#8221;) in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="2021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=728><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;him&#8221;; the referent (Amasa) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2022"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=729><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Sheba) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=730><b>tc</b> In keeping with the form of the name in v. 15, the translation deletes the &#8220;and&#8221; found in the MT.</p>
<A NAME="2024"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=731><b>tc</b> The translation follows the <i>Qere</i>, many medieval Hebrew <sc>mss, and the ancient versions in reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1458;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyiqqahalu</font>, &#8220;and they were gathered together&#8221;) rather than the <i>Kethib</i> of the MT <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1500;&#1467;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyiqluhu</font>, &#8220;and they cursed him&#8221;). The <i>Kethib</i> is the result of metathesis.</p>
<A NAME="2025"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=732><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;they.&#8221; The following context makes it clear that this refers to Joab and his army.</p>
<A NAME="2026"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=733><b>tc</b> The LXX has here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;&#959;&#959;&#8166;&#963;&#945;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">enoousan</font>, &#8220;were devising&#8221;), which apparently presupposes the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1513;&#1464;&#1473;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">makhashavim</font>) rather than the MT <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mashkhitim</font>, &#8220;were destroying&#8221;). With a number of other scholars Driver thinks that the Greek variant may preserve the original reading, but this seems to be an unnecessary conclusion (but see S. R. Driver, <i>Notes on the Hebrew Text and the Topography of the Books of Samuel</i>, 346).</p>
<A NAME="2027"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=734><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;a city and a mother.&#8221; The expression is a hendiadys, meaning that this city was an important one in Israel and had smaller cities dependent on it.</p>
<A NAME="2028"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=735><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Far be it, far be it from me.&#8221; The expression is clearly emphatic, as may be seen in part by the repetition. P. K. McCarter, however, understands it to be coarser than the translation adopted here. He renders it as &#8220;I&#8217;ll be damned if&#8230;&#8221; (<i>II</i> <i>Samuel</i> [AB], 426, 429), which (while it is not a literal translation) may not be too far removed from the way a soldier might have expressed himself.</p>
<A NAME="2029"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=736><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;lifted his hand.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2030"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=737><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Look!&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2031"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=738><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Joab) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2032"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=739><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;they&#8221;; the referent (Joab&#8217;s men) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2033"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=740><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;his tents.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2034"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=741><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Adoram&#8221; (so KJV, NAB, NRSV, CEV), but see 1 Kgs 4:6; 5:14.</p>
<A NAME="2035"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=742><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;was over the forced labor.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2036"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=743><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;priest for David.&#8221; KJV (&#8220;a chief ruler about David&#8221;) and ASV (&#8220;chief minister unto David&#8221;) regarded this office as political.</p>
