<A NAME="2315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=926><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text is difficult here. The MT reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lachayyah</font>), which implies a rare use of the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">chayyah</font>). The word normally refers to an animal, but if the MT is accepted it would here have the sense of a troop or community of people. BDB 312 s.v. II. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, for example, understands the similar reference in v. 13 to be to &#8220;a group of allied families, making a raid together.&#8221; But this works better in v. 13 than it does in v. 11, where the context seems to suggest a particular staging location for a military operation. (See 1 Chr 11:15.) It therefore seems best to understand the word in v. 11 as a place name with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">he)</font> directive. In that case the Masoretes mistook the word for the common term for an animal and then tried to make sense of it in this context.</p>
