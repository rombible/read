<A NAME="417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=135><b>tn</b> The antecedent of the pronoun &#8220;them&#8221; (which is not present in the Hebrew text, but implied) is not entirely clear. Presumably it is the corpses that were hung and not merely the detached hands and feet; cf. NIV &#8220;hung the (their NRSV, NLT) bodies&#8221;; the alternative is represented by TEV &#8220;cut off their hands and feet, which they hung up.&#8221;</p>
