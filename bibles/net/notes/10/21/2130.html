<A NAME="2130"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=773><b>tn</b> This is the only occurrence of this Hebrew word in the OT. Its precise meaning is therefore somewhat uncertain. As early as the LXX the word was understood to refer to a &#8220;spear,&#8221; and this seems to be the most likely possibility. Some scholars have proposed emending the text of 2 Sam 21:16 to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;&#1463;&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khova</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">o</font>; &#8220;his helmet&#8221;), but in spite of the fact that the word &#8220;helmet&#8221; appears in 1 Sam 17:5, there is not much evidence for reading that word here.</p>
