<A NAME="2133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=776><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Jaare-Oregim,&#8221; but the second word, which means &#8220;weavers,&#8221; is probably accidentally included. It appears at the end of the verse. The term is omitted in the parallel account in 1 Chr 20:5, which has simply &#8220;Jair.&#8221;</p>
