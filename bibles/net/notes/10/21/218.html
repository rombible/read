<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=751><b>tn</b> The exact nature of this execution is not altogether clear. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yaqa</font>&#8217;) basically means &#8220;to dislocate&#8221; or &#8220;alienate.&#8221; In Gen 32:26 it is used of the dislocation of Jacob&#8217;s thigh. Figuratively it can refer to the removal of an individual from a group (e.g., Jer 6:8; Ezek 23:17) or to a type of punishment the specific identity of which is uncertain (e.g., here and Num 25:4); cf. NAB &#8220;dismember them&#8221;; NIV &#8220;to be killed and exposed.&#8221; </p>
