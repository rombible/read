<A NAME="1339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=459><b>tc</b> The translation follows 4QSam<sup>a</sup> in reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew" size="-2">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463; &#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar" size="-2">ruakh hammelekh</font>, &#8220;the spirit of the king&#8221;) rather than the MT <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew" size="-2">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1491; &#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar" size="-2">david hammelekh</font>, &#8220;David the king&#8221;). The understanding reflected in the translation above is that David, though alienated during this time from his son Absalom, still had an abiding love and concern for him. He longed for reconciliation with him. A rather different interpretation of the verse supposes that David&#8217;s interest in taking military action against Absalom grew slack with the passing of time, and this in turn enabled David&#8217;s advisers to encourage him toward reconciliation with Absalom. For the latter view, see P. K. McCarter, <i>II Samuel </i>(AB), 344, and cf. CEV.</p>
