<a name="116"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=16><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text here is grammatically very awkward (<i>Heb </i>&#8220;because all still my life in me&#8221;). Whether the broken construct phrase is due to the fact that the alleged speaker is in a confused state of mind as he is on the verge of dying, or whether the MT has sustained corruption in the transmission process, is not entirely clear. The former seems likely, although P. K. McCarter understands the MT to be the result of conflation of two shorter forms of text (P. K. McCarter, <i>II Samuel</i> [AB], 57, n. 9). Early translators also struggled with the verse, apparently choosing to leave part of the Hebrew text untranslated. For example, the Lucianic recension of the LXX lacks &#8220;all,&#8221; while other witnesses (namely, one medieval Hebrew <span class="smallcaps">ms</span>, codices A and B of the LXX, and the Syriac Peshitta) lack &#8220;still.&#8221;</p>
