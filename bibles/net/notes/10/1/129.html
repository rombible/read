Although the Syriac Peshitta understands the statement to pertain to Saul, the point here is not that <i>Saul</i> is not anointed. Rather, it is <i>the shield</i> of Saul that lies discarded and is no longer anointed. In ancient Near Eastern practice a warrior&#8217;s shield that was in normal use would have to be anointed regularly in order to ensure that the leather did not become dry and brittle. Like other warriors of his day Saul would have carefully maintained his tools of trade. But now that he is dead, the once-cared-for shield of the mighty warrior lies sadly discarded and woefully neglected, a silent but eloquent commentary on how different things are now compared to the way they were during Saul&#8217;s lifetime.</p>
