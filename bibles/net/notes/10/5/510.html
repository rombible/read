<A NAME="510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=148><b>tn</b> The meaning of the Hebrew term has been debated. For a survey of various views, see P. K. McCarter, <i>II Samuel</i> (AB), 139-40. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> If a <i>water tunnel</i> is in view here, it is probably the so-called Warren&#8217;s Shaft that extends up from Hezekiah&#8217;s tunnel. It would have provided a means for surprise attack against the occupants of the city of David. The LXX seems not to understand the reference here, translating &#8220;by the water shaft&#8221; as &#8220;with a small knife.&#8221;</p>
