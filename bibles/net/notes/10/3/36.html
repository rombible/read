<A NAME="36"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=71><b>tc</b> The Hebrew of the MT reads simply &#8220;and he said,&#8221; with no expressed subject for the verb. It is not likely that the text originally had no expressed subject for this verb, since the antecedent is not immediately clear from the context. We should probably restore to the Hebrew text the name &#8220;Ish-bosheth.&#8221; See a few medieval Hebrew <sc>mss, Aquila, Symmachus, Theodotion, and Vulgate. Perhaps the name was accidentally omitted by homoioarcton. Note that both the name Ishbosheth and the following preposition<font face="Hebrewtl"> </font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>) begin with the letter <font face="Scholar">alef</font>. </p>
