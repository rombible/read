<A NAME="343"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=108><b>tn</b> The expression used here is difficult. The translation &#8220;one who works at the spindle&#8221; follows a suggestion of S. R. Driver that the expression pejoratively describes an effeminate man who, rather than being a mighty warrior, is occupied with tasks that are normally fulfilled by women (S. R. Driver, <i>Notes on the Hebrew Text and the Topography of the Books of Samuel</i>, 250-51; cf. NAB &#8220;one unmanly&#8221;; TEV &#8220;fit only to do a woman&#8217;s work&#8221;; CEV &#8220;cowards&#8221;). But P. K. McCarter, following an alleged Phoenician usage of the noun to refer to &#8220;crutches,&#8221; adopts a different view. He translates the phrase &#8220;clings to a crutch,&#8221; seeing here a further description of physical lameness (<i>II Samuel</i> [AB], 118). Such an idea fits the present context well and is followed by NIV, NCV, and NLT, although the evidence for this meaning is questionable. According to <i>DNWSI</i> 2:915-16, the noun consistently refers to a spindle in Phoenician, as it does in Ugaritic (see <i>UT</i> 468).</p>
