<A NAME="326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=91><b>tc</b> The present translation follows the LXX, the Syriac Peshitta, and Vulgate in reading &#8220;I will save,&#8221; rather than the MT &#8220;he saved.&#8221; The context calls for the 1st person common singular imperfect of the verb rather than the 3rd person masculine singular perfect.</p>
