<A NAME="121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=373><b>tc</b> A few medieval Hebrew <sc>mss, the LXX, and the Syriac Peshitta add &#8220;the prophet.&#8221; The words are included in a few modern English version (e.g., TEV, CEV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=374><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;him&#8221;; the referent (David) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=375><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Nathan) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=376><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text repeats &#8220;to him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=377><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his sons.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=378><b>tn</b> The three Hebrew imperfect verbal forms in this sentence have a customary nuance; they describe past actions that were repeated or typical.</p>
<A NAME="127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=379><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;from his morsel.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=380><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and on his chest [or perhaps,<i> </i>&#8220;lap&#8221;] it would lay.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=381><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;came to the rich man.&#8221; In the translation &#8220;arrived at the rich man&#8217;s home&#8221; has been used for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="1210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=382><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and he refused to take from his flock and from his herd to prepare [a meal] for.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=383><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;who had come to him&#8221; (also a second time later in this verse). The word &#8220;visit&#8221; has been supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons and for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=384><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and prepared.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=385><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the man doing this [is] a son of death.&#8221; See 1 Sam 20:31 for another use of this expression, which must mean<i> </i>&#8220;he is as good as dead&#8221; or &#8220;he deserves to die,&#8221; as 1 Sam 20:32 makes clear.</p>
<A NAME="1214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=386><b>tc</b> With the exception of the Lucianic recension, the Old Greek translation has here &#8220;sevenfold&#8221; rather than &#8220;fourfold,&#8221; a reading that S. R. Driver thought probably to be the original reading (S. R. Driver, <i>Notes on the Hebrew Text and the Topography of the Books of Samuel</i>, 291). However, Exod 22:1 [21:37 HT] specifies fourfold repayment for a stolen sheep, which is consistent with 2 Sam 12:6. Some <sc>mss of the Targum and the Syriac Peshitta exaggerate the idea to &#8220;fortyfold.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the lamb he must repay fourfold because he did this thing and because he did not have compassion.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=387><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;anointed.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=389><b>tc</b> So the <i>Qere</i>; the<i> Kethib</i> has &#8220;his.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=390><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;to you for a wife.&#8221; This expression also occurs at the end of v. 10.</p>
<A NAME="1219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=391><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;raise up against you disaster.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=392><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;house&#8221; (so NAB, NRSV); NCV, TEV, CEV &#8220;family.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=394><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;will lie with&#8221; (so NIV, NRSV); TEV &#8220;will have intercourse with&#8221;; CEV, NLT &#8220;will go to bed with.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=395><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;in the eyes of this sun.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=396><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and before the sun.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=397><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;removed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=398><b>tc</b> The MT has here &#8220;because you have caused the enemies of the <sc>Lord to treat the <sc>Lord with such contempt.&#8221; This is one of the so-called <i>tiqqune sopherim</i>, or &#8220;emendations of the scribes.&#8221; According to this ancient tradition, the scribes changed the text in order to soften somewhat the negative light in which David was presented. If that is the case, the MT reflects the altered text. The present translation departs from the MT here. Elsewhere the Piel stem of this verb means &#8220;treat with contempt,&#8221; but never &#8220;cause someone to treat with contempt.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=399><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and the <sc>Lord struck the child&#8230;and he was ill.&#8221; It is necessary to repeat &#8220;the child&#8221; in the translation to make clear who became ill, since &#8220;the <sc>Lord struck the child that Uriah&#8217;s wife had borne to David, and he became very ill&#8221; could be understood to mean that David himself became ill.</p>
<A NAME="1228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=400><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;sought&#8221; or &#8220;searched for.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=401><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and David fasted.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=402><b>tn</b> The three Hebrew verbs that follow in this verse are perfects with prefixed <font face="Scholar">vav</font>. They may describe repeated past actions or actions which accompanied David&#8217;s praying and fasting.</p>
<A NAME="1231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=403><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;to our voice.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=404><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;he will do harm.&#8221; The object is not stated in the Hebrew text. The statement may be intentionally vague, meaning that he might harm himself or them!</p>
<A NAME="1233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=405><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;David.&#8221; The name has been replaced in the translation by the pronoun (&#8220;he&#8221;) for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="1234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=406><b>tc</b> For the MT <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avur</font>, &#8220;for the sake of&#8221;) we should probably read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">od</font>, &#8220;while&#8221;). See the Lucianic Greek recension, the Syriac Peshitta, and the Targum.</p>
<A NAME="1235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=407><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=408><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Who knows?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=409><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and he lay with her.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=410><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (David) has been specified in the translation for clarity. While some translations render the pronoun as third person plural (&#8220;they&#8221;), implying that both David and Bathsheba together named the child, it is likely that the name &#8220;Solomon,&#8221; which is related to the Hebrew word for &#8220;peace&#8221; (and may be derived from it) had special significance for David, who would have regarded the birth of a second child to Bathsheba as a confirming sign that God had forgiven his sin and was at peace with him.</p>
<A NAME="1239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=411><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;him,&#8221; referring to the child.</p>
<A NAME="1240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=412><b>sn</b> The name <i>Jedidiah</i> means<i> </i>&#8220;loved by the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=413><b>sn</b> Here the narrative resumes the battle story that began in 11:1 (see 11:25). The author has interrupted that story to give the related account of David&#8217;s sin with Bathsheba and the murder of Uriah. He now returns to the earlier story and brings it to a conclusion.</p>
<A NAME="1242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=414><b>sn</b> The expression translated <i>the water supply of the city </i>(<i>Heb </i>&#8220;the city of the waters&#8221;) apparently refers to that part of the fortified city that guarded the water supply of the entire city. Joab had already captured this part of the city, but he now defers to King David for the capture of the rest of the city. In this way the king will receive the credit for this achievement.</p>
<A NAME="1243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=415><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;people.&#8221; So also in vv. 29, 31.</p>
<A NAME="1244"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=416><b>tn</b> Part of the Greek tradition wrongly understands Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">malkam</font>, &#8220;their king&#8221;) as a proper name (&#8220;Milcom&#8221;). Some English versions follow the Greek here, rendering the phrase &#8220;the crown of Milcom&#8221; (so NRSV; cf. also NAB, CEV). TEV takes this as a reference not to the Ammonite king but to &#8220;the idol of the Ammonite god Molech.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=417><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and its weight [was] a talent of gold.&#8221; The weight of this ornamental crown was approximately 75 lbs (34 kg). See P. K. McCarter, <i>II Samuel </i>(AB), 313.</p>
<A NAME="1246"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=418><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;brought out.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1247"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=419><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and so he would do.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=420><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
