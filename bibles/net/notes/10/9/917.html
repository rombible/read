<A NAME="917"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=306><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my table.&#8221; But the first person reference to David is awkward here since the quotation of David&#8217;s words has already been concluded in v. 10; nor does the &#8220;my&#8221; refer to Ziba, since the latter part of v. 11 does not seem to be part of Ziba&#8217;s response to the king. The ancient versions are not unanimous in the way that they render the phrase. The LXX has &#8220;the table of David&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8134;&#962; &#964;&#961;&#945;&#960;&#941;&#950;&#951;&#962; &#916;&#945;&#965;&#953;&#948;</font>, <font face="Greektl">th&quot; trapezh&quot; Dauid</font>); the Syriac Peshitta has &#8220;the table of the king&#8221; (<font face="Scholar">patureh demalka</font>&#8217;); the Vulgate has &#8220;your table&#8221; (<i>mensam tuam</i>). The present translation follows the LXX.</p>
