<A NAME="2285"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">85</span><note=865><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the word of the <sc>Lord is purified.&#8221; The <sc>Lord&#8217;s &#8220;word&#8221; probably refers here to his oracle(s) of victory delivered to the psalmist before the battle(s) described in the following context. See also Pss 12:5-7 and 138:2-3. David frequently received such oracles before going into battle (see 1 Sam 23:2, 4-5, 10-12; 30:8; 2 Sam 5:19). The <sc>Lord&#8217;s word of promise is absolutely reliable; it is compared to metal that has been refined in fire and cleansed of impurities. See Ps 12:6. In the ancient Near East kings would typically seek and receive oracles from their god(s) prior to battle. For examples, see R. B. Chisholm, &#8220;An Exegetical and Theological Study of Psalm 18/2 Samuel 22&#8221; (Th.D. diss., Dallas Theological Seminary, 1983), 241-42.</p>
