<A NAME="2265"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=845><b>tn</b> The imperfect verbal forms in vv. 26-30 draw attention to God&#8217;s characteristic actions. Based on his experience, the psalmist generalizes about God&#8217;s just dealings with people (vv. 26-28) and about the way in which God typically empowers him on the battlefield (vv. 29-30). The Hitpael stem is used in vv. 26-27 in a reflexive resultative (or causative) sense. God makes himself loyal, etc. in the sense that he conducts or reveals himself as such. On this use of the Hitpael stem, see GKC 149-50 §54.<i>e</i>.</p>
