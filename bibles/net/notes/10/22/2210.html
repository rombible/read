<A NAME="2210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=790><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the horn of my salvation,&#8221; or &#8220;my saving horn.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Though some see &#8220;horn&#8221; as referring to a horn-shaped peak of a hill, or to the &#8220;horns&#8221; of an altar where one could find refuge, it is more likely that the horn of an ox underlies the metaphor (see Deut 33:17; 1 Kgs 22:11; Ps 92:10). The horn of the wild ox is frequently a metaphor for military strength; the idiom &#8220;exalt the horn&#8221; signifies military victory (see 1 Sam 2:10; Pss 89:17, 24; 92:10; Lam 2:17). In the ancient Near East powerful warrior-kings would sometimes compare themselves to a goring bull that uses its horns to kill its enemies. For examples, see P. Miller, &#8220;El the Warrior,&#8221; <i>HTR</i> 60 (1967): 422-25, and R. B. Chisholm, &#8220;An Exegetical and Theological Study of Psalm 18/2 Samuel 22&#8221; (Th.D. diss., Dallas Theological Seminary, 1983), 135-36. 2 Sam 22:3 uses the metaphor of the horn in a slightly different manner. Here the Lord himself is compared to a horn. He is to the psalmist what the horn is to the ox, a source of defense and victory.</p>
