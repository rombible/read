<A NAME="2255"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=835><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;according to my righteousness.&#8221; As vv. 22-25 make clear, David refers here to his unwavering obedience to God&#8217;s commands. He explains that the Lord was pleased with him and willing to deliver him because he had been loyal to God and obedient to his commandments. Ancient Near Eastern literature contains numerous parallels. A superior (a god or king) would typically reward a subject (a king or the servant of a king, respectively) for loyalty and obedience. See R. B. Chisholm, &#8220;An Exegetical and Theological Study of Psalm 18/2 Samuel 22&#8221; (Th.D. diss., Dallas Theological Seminary, 1983), 211-13.</p>
