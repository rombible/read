<A NAME="2297"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">97</span><note=877><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and a bow of bronze is bent by my arms.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1495;&#1461;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhet</font>) apparently means &#8220;to pull back; to bend&#8221; here (see <i>HALOT</i> 692 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1495;&#1514;</font>). The bronze bow referred to here was probably laminated with bronze strips, or a purely ceremonial or decorative bow made entirely from bronze. In the latter case the language is hyperbolic, for such a weapon would not be functional in battle.</p>
