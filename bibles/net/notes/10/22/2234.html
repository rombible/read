<A NAME="2234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=814><b>sn</b> <i>The wings of the wind.</i> Verse 10 may depict the <sc>Lord mounting a cherub, which is in turn propelled by the wind current. Another option is that two different vehicles (a cherub and the wind) are envisioned. A third option is that the wind is personified as a cherub. For a discussion of ancient Near Eastern parallels to the imagery in v. 10, see M. Weinfeld, &#8220;&#8216;Rider of the Clouds&#8217; and &#8216;Gatherer of the Clouds&#8217;,&#8221; <i>JANESCU</i> 5 (1973): 422-24.</p>
