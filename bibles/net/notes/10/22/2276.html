<A NAME="2276"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">76</span><note=856><b>tc</b> The Lucianic Greek recension and Vulgate understand this verb to be second person rather than third person as in the MT. But this is probably the result of reading the preceding word &#8220;<sc>Lord&#8221; as a vocative under the influence of the vocative in the first part of the verse.</p>
