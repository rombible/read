<A NAME="22108"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">108</span><note=888><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;they cry out&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text. This reference to the psalmists&#8217; enemies crying out for help to the <sc>Lord suggests that the psalmist refers here to enemies within the covenant community, rather than foreigners. However, the militaristic context suggests foreign enemies are in view. Ancient Near Eastern literature indicates that defeated enemies would sometimes cry out for mercy to the god(s) of their conqueror. See R. B. Chisholm, &#8220;An Exegetical and Theological Study of Psalm 18/2 Samuel 22&#8221; (Th.D. diss., Dallas Theological Seminary, 1983), 271. </p>
