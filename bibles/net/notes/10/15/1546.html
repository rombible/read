<A NAME="1546"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=548><b>tn</b> The Greek tradition understands the Hebrew word as an imperative (&#8220;see&#8221;). Most Greek <sc>mss have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7988;&#948;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font> (<font face="Scholar">idete</font>); the Lucianic recension has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#946;&#955;&#941;&#960;&#949;</font><font face="Scholar"> </font>(<font face="Scholar">blepe</font>). It could just as well be taken as a question: &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see what is happening?&#8221; The present translation takes the word as a question, with the implication that Zadok is a priest and not a prophet (i.e., &#8220;seer&#8221;) and therefore unable to know what the future holds.</p>
