<A NAME="1241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=413><b>sn</b> Here the narrative resumes the battle story that began in 11:1 (see 11:25). The author has interrupted that story to give the related account of David&#8217;s sin with Bathsheba and the murder of Uriah. He now returns to the earlier story and brings it to a conclusion.</p>
