<A NAME="1238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=410><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (David) has been specified in the translation for clarity. While some translations render the pronoun as third person plural (&#8220;they&#8221;), implying that both David and Bathsheba together named the child, it is likely that the name &#8220;Solomon,&#8221; which is related to the Hebrew word for &#8220;peace&#8221; (and may be derived from it) had special significance for David, who would have regarded the birth of a second child to Bathsheba as a confirming sign that God had forgiven his sin and was at peace with him.</p>
