<A NAME="1242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=414><b>sn</b> The expression translated <i>the water supply of the city </i>(<i>Heb </i>&#8220;the city of the waters&#8221;) apparently refers to that part of the fortified city that guarded the water supply of the entire city. Joab had already captured this part of the city, but he now defers to King David for the capture of the rest of the city. In this way the king will receive the credit for this achievement.</p>
