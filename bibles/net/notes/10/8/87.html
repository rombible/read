<A NAME="87"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=263><b>tn</b> The MT does not have the name &#8220;Euphrates&#8221; in the text. It is supplied in the margin (<i>Qere</i>) as one of ten places where the Masoretes believed that something was &#8220;to be read although it was not written&#8221; in the text as they had received it. The ancient versions (LXX, Syriac Peshitta, Vulgate) include the word. See also the parallel text in 1 Chr 18:3.</p>
