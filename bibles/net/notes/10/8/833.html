<A NAME="833"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=289><b>sn</b> That David&#8217;s sons could have been <i>priests</i>, in light of the fact that they were not of the priestly lineage, is strange. One must assume either (1) that the word &#8220;priest&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kohen</font>) during this period of time could be used in a broader sense of &#8220;chief ruler&#8221; (KJV); &#8220;chief minister&#8221; (ASV, NASB), or &#8220;royal adviser&#8221; (NIV), perhaps based on the parallel passage in 1 Chr 18:17 which has &#8220;the king&#8217;s leading officials&#8221;, or (2) that in David&#8217;s day members of the king&#8217;s family could function as a special category of &#8220;priests&#8221; (cf. NLT &#8220;priestly leaders&#8221;). The latter option seems to be the more straightforward way of understanding the word in 2 Sam 8:18.</p>
