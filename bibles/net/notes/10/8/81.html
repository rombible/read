<A NAME="81"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=257><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the bridle of one cubit.&#8221; Many English versions treat this as a place name because the parallel text in 1 Chr 18:1 reads &#8220;Gath&#8221; (which is used by NLT here). It is possible that &#8220;the bridle of one cubit&#8221; is to be understood as &#8220;the token of surrender,&#8221; referring to the Philistine&#8217;s defeat rather than a specific place (cf. TEV, CEV).</p>
