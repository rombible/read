<A NAME="828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=284><b>tc</b> The MT is repetitious here: &#8220;He placed in Edom garrisons; in all Edom he placed garrisons.&#8221; The Vulgate lacks &#8220;in all Edom&#8221;; most of the Greek tradition (with the exception of the Lucianic recension and the recension of Origen) and the Syriac Peshitta lack &#8220;he placed garrisons.&#8221; The MT reading appears here to be the result of a conflation of variant readings.</p>
