<A NAME="1923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=677><b>tn</b> Though this verb in the MT is 3rd person masculine singular, it should probably be read as 2nd person masculine singular. It is one of fifteen places where the Masoretes placed a dot over each of the letters of the word in question in order to call attention to their suspicion of the word. Their concern in this case apparently had to do with the fact that this verb and the two preceding verbs alternate from third person to second and back again to third. Words marked in this way in Hebrew manuscripts or printed editions are said to have <font face="Scholar">puncta extrordinaria</font>, or &#8220;extraordinary points.&#8221;</p>
