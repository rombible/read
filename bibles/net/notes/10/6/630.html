<A NAME="630"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=196><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word used here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">espar</font>) is found in the OT only here and in the parallel passage found in 1 Chr 16:3. Its exact meaning is uncertain, although the context indicates that it was a food of some sort (cf. KJV &#8220;a good piece of flesh&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;a portion of meat&#8221;). The translation adopted here (&#8220;date cake&#8221;) follows the lead of the Greek translations of the LXX, Aquila, and Symmachus (cf. NASB, NIV, NLT).</p>
