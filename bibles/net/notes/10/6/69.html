<A NAME="69"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=175><b>tc</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;were celebrating before the <sc>Lord with all woods of fir&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV, NASB). If the text is retained, the last expression must be elliptical, referring to musical instruments made from fir wood. But it is preferable to emend the text in light of 1 Chr 13:8, which reads<i> </i>&#8220;were celebrating before the <sc>Lord with all strength and with songs.&#8221;</p>
