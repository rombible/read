<A NAME="31"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=66><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map7-E2; Map8-E2; Map10-B4.</p>
<A NAME="32"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=67><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text does not have the word &#8220;son.&#8221; So also in vv. 3-5.</p>
<A NAME="33"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=68><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;wife.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="34"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=69><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text does not have &#8220;sons.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="35"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=70><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;was strengthening himself.&#8221; The statement may have a negative sense here, perhaps suggesting that Abner was overstepping the bounds of political propriety in a self-serving way.</p>
<A NAME="36"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=71><b>tc</b> The Hebrew of the MT reads simply &#8220;and he said,&#8221; with no expressed subject for the verb. It is not likely that the text originally had no expressed subject for this verb, since the antecedent is not immediately clear from the context. We should probably restore to the Hebrew text the name &#8220;Ish-bosheth.&#8221; See a few medieval Hebrew <sc>mss, Aquila, Symmachus, Theodotion, and Vulgate. Perhaps the name was accidentally omitted by homoioarcton. Note that both the name Ishbosheth and the following preposition<font face="Hebrewtl"> </font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>) begin with the letter <font face="Scholar">alef</font>. </p>
<A NAME="37"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=72><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;come to&#8221;; KJV, NRSV &#8220;gone in to&#8221;; NAB &#8220;been intimate with&#8221;; NIV &#8220;sleep with.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="38"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=73><b>sn</b> This accusation against Abner is a very serious one, since an act of sexual infringement on the king&#8217;s harem would probably have been understood as a blatant declaration of aspirations to kingship. As such it was not merely a matter of ethical impropriety but an act of grave political significance as well.</p>
<A NAME="39"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=74><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;I do.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=75><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;brothers.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=76><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and you have laid upon me the guilt of the woman today.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=77><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;So will God do to Abner and so he will add to him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=78><b>tc</b><i> Heb </i>&#8220;has sworn to David.&#8221; The LXX, with the exception of the recension of Origen, adds &#8220;in this day.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=79><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Ish-bosheth) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=80><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text adds here,<i> </i>&#8220;on his behalf.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=81><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;cut a covenant.&#8221; So also in vv. 13, 21.</p>
<A NAME="317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=82><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and behold, my hand is with you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=83><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;when you come to see my face,&#8221; though found in the Hebrew text, are somewhat redundant given the similar expression in the earlier part of the verse. The words are absent from the Syriac Peshitta.</p>
<A NAME="319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=84><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to Ish-bosheth son of Saul saying.&#8221; To avoid excessive sibilance (especially when read aloud) the translation renders &#8220;saying&#8221; as &#8220;with this demand.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=85><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;whom I betrothed to myself.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=86><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;sent and took her.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=87><b>tn</b> In 1 Sam 25:44 this name appears as &#8220;Palti.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=88><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Go, return.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=90><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;you were seeking David to be king over you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=91><b>tc</b> The present translation follows the LXX, the Syriac Peshitta, and Vulgate in reading &#8220;I will save,&#8221; rather than the MT &#8220;he saved.&#8221; The context calls for the 1st person common singular imperfect of the verb rather than the 3rd person masculine singular perfect.</p>
<A NAME="327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=92><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;from the hand of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=93><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;into the ears of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=94><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;also Abner went to speak into the ears of David in Hebron.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=95><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;all which was good in the eyes of Israel and in the eyes of all the house of Benjamin.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=96><b>tn</b> After the cohortatives, the prefixed verbal form with the prefixed conjunction indicates purpose or result.</p>
<A NAME="332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=97><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;And look, the servants of David.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=98><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (David) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=99><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Look, Abner.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=100><b>tc</b> The LXX adds &#8220;in peace.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=101><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;your going out and your coming in.&#8221; The expression is a merism. It specifically mentions the polar extremities of the actions but includes all activity in between the extremities as well, thus encompassing the entirety of one&#8217;s activities.</p>
<A NAME="337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=102><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and he struck him down there [in] the stomach.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="338"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=103><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and he [i.e., Abner] died on account of the blood of Asahel his [i.e., Joab&#8217;s] brother.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=104><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and may they whirl over.&#8221; In the Hebrew text the subject of the plural verb is unexpressed. The most likely subject is Abner&#8217;s<i> </i>&#8220;shed blood&#8221; (v. 28), which is a masculine plural form in Hebrew. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khul</font>, &#8220;whirl&#8221;) is used with the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) only here and in Jer 23:19; 30:23.</p>
<A NAME="340"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=105><b>tc</b> 4QSam<sup>a</sup> has &#8220;of Joab&#8221; rather than &#8220;of his father&#8221; read by the MT.</p>
<A NAME="341"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=106><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the house of Joab.&#8221; However, it is necessary to specify that David&#8217;s curse is aimed at Joab&#8217;s male descendants; otherwise it would not be clear that &#8220;one who works at the spindle&#8221; refers to a man doing woman&#8217;s work rather than a woman.</p>
<A NAME="342"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=107><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and may there not be cut off from the house of Joab.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="343"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=108><b>tn</b> The expression used here is difficult. The translation &#8220;one who works at the spindle&#8221; follows a suggestion of S. R. Driver that the expression pejoratively describes an effeminate man who, rather than being a mighty warrior, is occupied with tasks that are normally fulfilled by women (S. R. Driver, <i>Notes on the Hebrew Text and the Topography of the Books of Samuel</i>, 250-51; cf. NAB &#8220;one unmanly&#8221;; TEV &#8220;fit only to do a woman&#8217;s work&#8221;; CEV &#8220;cowards&#8221;). But P. K. McCarter, following an alleged Phoenician usage of the noun to refer to &#8220;crutches,&#8221; adopts a different view. He translates the phrase &#8220;clings to a crutch,&#8221; seeing here a further description of physical lameness (<i>II Samuel</i> [AB], 118). Such an idea fits the present context well and is followed by NIV, NCV, and NLT, although the evidence for this meaning is questionable. According to <i>DNWSI</i> 2:915-16, the noun consistently refers to a spindle in Phoenician, as it does in Ugaritic (see <i>UT</i> 468).</p>
<A NAME="344"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=109><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;was walking.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="345"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=110><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;lifted up his voice and wept.&#8221; The expression is a verbal hendiadys.</p>
<A NAME="346"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=111><b>tc</b> The translation follows many medieval Hebrew manuscripts and several ancient versions in reading &#8220;your hands,&#8221; rather than &#8220;your hand.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="347"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=112><b>tc</b> 4QSam<sup>a</sup> lacks the words &#8220;all the people.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="348"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=113><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Thus God will do to me and thus he will add.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="349"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=114><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;it was good in their eyes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="350"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=115><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;from the king.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="351"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=116><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a leader and a great one.&#8221; The expression is a hendiadys.</p>
<A NAME="352"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=117><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;are hard from me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="353"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=118><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;May the <sc>Lord repay the doer of the evil according to his evil&#8221; (NASB similar).</p>
