<A NAME="724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=227><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;before you.&#8221; A few medieval Hebrew <sc>mss read instead &#8220;before me,&#8221; which makes better sense contextually. (See also the LXX and the Syriac Peshitta.) The MT reading is probably the result of dittography (note the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;</font> [<font face="Scholar">kaf</font>] at the beginning of the next form), with the extra <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;</font> then being interpreted as a pronominal suffix.</p>
