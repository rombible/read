<A NAME="729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=232><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and this [is] the law of man&#8221;; KJV &#8220;is this the manner of man, O Lord God?&#8221;; NAB &#8220;this too you have shown to man&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;May this be instruction for the people, O Lord God!&#8221; This part of the verse is very enigmatic; no completely satisfying solution has yet been suggested. The present translation tries to make sense of the MT by understanding the phrase as a question that underscores the uniqueness of God&#8217;s dealings with David as described here. The parallel passage in 1 Chr 17:17 reads differently (see the note there). </p>
