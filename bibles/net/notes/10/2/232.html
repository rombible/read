<A NAME="232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=65><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and they went, all the Bitron.&#8221; The meaning of the Hebrew word<i> </i>&#8220;Bitron,&#8221; which is used only here in the OT, is disputed. The translation above follows BDB 144 s.v. <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> </i>in taking the word to be a proper name of an area east of the Jordan. A different understanding was advocated by W. R. Arnold, who took the word to refer to the forenoon or morning; a number of modern scholars and translations have adopted this view (cf. NAB, NASB, NRSV, CEV, NLT). See W. R. Arnold, &#8220;The Meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503;</font>,&#8221; <i>AJSL</i> 28 (1911-1912): 274-83. In this case one could translate<i> </i>&#8220;and they traveled all morning long.&#8221;</p>
