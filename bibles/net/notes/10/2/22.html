<A NAME="22"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=35><b>tc</b> The expression &#8220;the cities of Hebron&#8221; is odd; we would expect the noun to be in the singular, if used at all. Although the Syriac Peshitta has the expected reading &#8220;in Hebron,&#8221; the MT is clearly the more difficult reading and should probably be retained here.</p>
