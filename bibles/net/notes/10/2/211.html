<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=44><b>tc</b> The MT here reads &#8220;the Ashurite,&#8221; but this is problematic if it is taken to mean &#8220;the Assyrian.&#8221; Ish-bosheth&#8217;s kingdom obviously was not of such proportions as to extend to Assyria. The Syriac Peshitta renders the word as &#8220;the Geshurite,&#8221; while the Targum has &#8220;of the house of Ashur.&#8221; We should probably emend the Hebrew text to read &#8220;the Geshurite.&#8221; The Geshurites lived in the northeastern part of the land of Palestine.</p>
