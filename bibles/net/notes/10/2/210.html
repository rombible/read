<A NAME="210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=43><b>sn</b> The name <i>Ish-bosheth</i> means in Hebrew &#8220;man of shame.&#8221; It presupposes an earlier form such as Ish-baal (&#8220;man of the Lord&#8221;), with the word &#8220;baal&#8221; being used of Israel&#8217;s God. But because the Canaanite storm god was named &#8220;Baal,&#8221; that part of the name was later replaced with the word &#8220;shame.&#8221; </p>
