<A NAME="2013"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=720><b>sn</b> The significance of the statement <i>it fell out </i>here is unclear. If the dagger fell out of its sheath before Joab got to Amasa, how then did he kill him? Josephus, <i>Ant</i>.<i> </i>7.11.7 (7.284), suggested that as Joab approached Amasa he deliberately caused the dagger to fall to the ground at an opportune moment as though by accident. When he bent over and picked it up, he then stabbed Amasa with it. Others have tried to make a case for thinking that two swords are referred to &#8211; the one that fell out and another that Joab kept concealed until the last moment. But nothing in the text clearly supports this view. Perhaps Josephus&#8217; understanding is best, but it is by no means obvious in the text either.</p>
