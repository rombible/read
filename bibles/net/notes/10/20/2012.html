<A NAME="2012"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=719><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;find.&#8221; The perfect verbal form is unexpected with the preceding word &#8220;otherwise.&#8221; We should probably read instead the imperfect. Although it is possible to understand the perfect here as indicating that the feared result is thought of as already having taken place (cf. BDB 814 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;</font> 2), it is more likely that the perfect is simply the result of scribal error. In this context the imperfect would be more consistent with the following verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿhitsil</font>, &#8220;and he will get away&#8221;).</p>
