<A NAME="2011"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=718><b>tn</b> The present translation follows the Masoretic accentuation, with the major mark of disjunction (i.e., the <font face="Scholar">atnach</font>) placed at the word &#8220;days.&#8221; However, some scholars have suggested moving the <font face="Scholar">atnach</font> to &#8220;Judah&#8221; a couple of words earlier. This would yield the following sense: &#8220;Three days, and you be present here with them.&#8221; The difference in meaning is slight, and the MT is acceptable as it stands.</p>
