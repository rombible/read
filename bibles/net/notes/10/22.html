<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=781><b>sn</b> In this long song of thanks, David affirms that God is his faithful protector. He recalls in highly poetic fashion how God intervened in awesome power and delivered him from death. His experience demonstrates that God vindicates those who are blameless and remain loyal to him. True to his promises, God gives the king victory on the battlefield and enables him to subdue nations. A parallel version of the song appears in Ps 18.</p>

<A NAME="228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=788><b>tc</b> The translation (along with many English versions, e.g., NAB, NIV, NRSV, NLT) follows the LXX in reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohi</font>, &#8220;my God&#8221;) rather than MT&#8217;s <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohe</font>, &#8220;the God of&#8221;).

<A NAME="2210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=790><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the horn of my salvation,&#8221; or &#8220;my saving horn.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Though some see &#8220;horn&#8221; as referring to a horn-shaped peak of a hill, or to the &#8220;horns&#8221; of an altar where one could find refuge, it is more likely that the horn of an ox underlies the metaphor (see Deut 33:17; 1 Kgs 22:11; Ps 92:10). The horn of the wild ox is frequently a metaphor for military strength; the idiom &#8220;exalt the horn&#8221; signifies military victory (see 1 Sam 2:10; Pss 89:17, 24; 92:10; Lam 2:17). In the ancient Near East powerful warrior-kings would sometimes compare themselves to a goring bull that uses its horns to kill its enemies. For examples, see P. Miller, &#8220;El the Warrior,&#8221; <i>HTR</i> 60 (1967): 422-25, and R. B. Chisholm, &#8220;An Exegetical and Theological Study of Psalm 18/2 Samuel 22&#8221; (Th.D. diss., Dallas Theological Seminary, 1983), 135-36. 2 Sam 22:3 uses the metaphor of the horn in a slightly different manner. Here the Lord himself is compared to a horn. He is to the psalmist what the horn is to the ox, a source of defense and victory.</p>
<A NAME="2211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=791><b>tn</b> The parallel version of the song in Ps 18 does not include this last line.</p>
<A NAME="2212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=792><b>tn</b> In this song of thanksgiving, where David recalls how the Lord delivered him, the prefixed verbal form is best understood as a preterite indicating past tense (cf. CEV &#8220;I prayed&#8221;), not an imperfect (as in many English versions).</p>
<A NAME="2213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=793><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;worthy of praise, I cried out [to] the <sc>Lord.&#8221; Some take <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1492;&#1467;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿhullal</font>, &#8220;worthy of praise&#8221;) with what precedes and translate, &#8220;the praiseworthy one,&#8221; or &#8220;praiseworthy.&#8221; However, the various epithets in vv. 1-2 have the first person pronominal suffix, unlike <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1492;&#1467;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;</font>. If one follows the traditional verse division and takes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1492;&#1467;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;</font> with what follows, it is best understood as substantival and as appositional to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿhvah</font>, &#8220;Yahweh&#8221;), resulting in &#8220;[to the] praiseworthy one I cried out, [to the] <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=794><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhal</font>) usually refers to a river or stream, but in this context the plural form likely refers to the currents of the sea (see vv. 15-16).</p>
<A NAME="2215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=795><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿliyya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) is used here as an epithet for death. Elsewhere it is a common noun meaning &#8220;wickedness, uselessness&#8221; (see <i>HALOT</i> 133-34 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font>). It is often associated with rebellion against authority and other crimes that result in societal disorder and anarchy. The phrase &#8220;man/son of wickedness&#8221; refers to one who opposes God and the order he has established. The term becomes an appropriate title for death, which, through human forces, launches an attack against God&#8217;s chosen servant.</p>
<A NAME="2216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=796><b>tn</b> In this poetic narrative context the prefixed verbal form is best understood as a preterite indicating past tense, not an imperfect.

The earthquake motif is common in Old Testament theophanies of God as warrior and in ancient Near eastern literary descriptions of warring gods and kings. See R. B. Chisholm, &#8220;An Exegetical and Theological Study of Psalm 18/2 Samuel 22&#8221; (Th.D. diss., Dallas Theological Seminary, 1983), 160-62.</p>

See also v. 16, &#8220;the powerful breath of your nose.&#8221; </p>

For example, Gen 49:15 pictures Issachar as a donkey that &#8220;bends&#8221; its shoulder or back under a burden (cf. KJV, NASB, NRSV &#8220;He bowed the heavens&#8221;; NAB &#8220;He inclined the heavens&#8221;). Here the <sc>Lord causes the sky, pictured as a dome or vault, to bend or sink down as he descends in the storm.</p>

They are pictured as winged creatures (Exod 25:20; 37:9; 1 Kgs 6:24-27; Ezek 10:8, 19) and serve as the very throne of God when the ark of the covenant is in view (Pss 80:1; 99:1; see Num 7:89; 1 Sam 4:4; 2 Sam 6:2; 2 Kgs 19:15). The picture of the <sc>Lord seated on the cherubs suggests they might be used by him as a vehicle, a function they carry out in Ezek 1:22-28 (the &#8220;living creatures&#8221; mentioned here are identified as cherubs in Ezek 10:20). In Ps 18:10 the image of a cherub serves to personify the wind (see the next line).</p>

Another option is that two different vehicles (a cherub and the wind) are envisioned. A third option is that the wind is personified as a cherub. For a discussion of ancient Near Eastern parallels to the imagery in v. 10, see M.
