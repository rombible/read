<A NAME="173"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=587><b>tc</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;like the returning of all, the man whom you are seeking.&#8221; The LXX reads differently: &#8220;And I will return all the people to you the way a bride returns to her husband, except for the life of the one man whom you are seeking.&#8221; The other early versions also struggled with this verse. Modern translations are divided as well: the NAB, NRSV, REB, and NLT follow the LXX, while the NASB and NIV follow the Hebrew text.</p>
