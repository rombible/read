<A NAME="81"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=257><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the bridle of one cubit.&#8221; Many English versions treat this as a place name because the parallel text in 1 Chr 18:1 reads &#8220;Gath&#8221; (which is used by NLT here). It is possible that &#8220;the bridle of one cubit&#8221; is to be understood as &#8220;the token of surrender,&#8221; referring to the Philistine&#8217;s defeat rather than a specific place (cf. TEV, CEV).</p>
<A NAME="82"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=258><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;from the hand [i.e., control] of the Philistines.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="83"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=259><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and he measured [with] two [lengths] of rope to put to death and [with] the fullness of the rope to keep alive.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="84"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=260><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and the Moabites were servants of David, carriers of tribute.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="85"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=261><b>tc</b> The LXX has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8134;&#963;&#945;&#953;</font><i> </i>(<font face="Greektl">episthsai</font>, &#8220;cause to stand&#8221;). See the parallel text in 1 Chr 18:3.</p>
<A NAME="86"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=262><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;hand.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="87"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=263><b>tn</b> The MT does not have the name &#8220;Euphrates&#8221; in the text. It is supplied in the margin (<i>Qere</i>) as one of ten places where the Masoretes believed that something was &#8220;to be read although it was not written&#8221; in the text as they had received it. The ancient versions (LXX, Syriac Peshitta, Vulgate) include the word. See also the parallel text in 1 Chr 18:3.</p>
<A NAME="88"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=264><b>tc</b> The LXX has &#8220;one thousand chariots and seven thousand charioteers,&#8221; a reading adopted in the text of the NIV. See the parallel text in 1 Chr 18:4.</p>
<A NAME="89"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=265><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and David cut the hamstrings of all the chariot horses, and he left from them a hundred chariot horses.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=266><b>tn</b> Or<i> </i>&#8220;delivered.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=267><b>tn</b> Or<i> </i>&#8220;wherever he went.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=268><b>tc</b> The LXX includes seventeen words (in Greek) at the end of v. 7 that are not found in the MT. The LXX addition is as follows: &#8220;And Sousakim king of Egypt took them when he came up to Jerusalem in the days of Rehoboam the son of Solomon.&#8221; This Greek reading now finds Hebrew support in 4QSam<sup>a</sup>. For a reconstruction of this poorly preserved Qumran text see E. C. Ulrich, Jr., <i>The Qumran Text of Samuel and Josephus </i>(HSM), 45-48.</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=269><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Betah&#8221; (so KJV, NASB, NRSV), but the name should probably be corrected to<i> </i>&#8220;Tebah.&#8221; See the parallel text in 1 Chr 18:8. </p>
<A NAME="814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=270><b>tn</b> The name is spelled<i> </i>&#8220;Tou&#8221; in the parallel text in 1 Chr 18:9. NIV adopts the spelling &#8220;Tou&#8221; here.</p>
<A NAME="815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=271><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Toi.&#8221; The proper name has been replaced by the pronoun in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=272><b>tn</b> The name appears as<i> </i>&#8220;Hadoram&#8221; in the parallel text in 1 Chr 18:10.</p>
<A NAME="817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=273><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;to ask concerning him for peace.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=274><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and to bless him because he fought with Hadadezer and defeated him, for Hadadezer was a man of battles with Toi.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=275><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and in his hand were items of silver and items of gold and items of bronze.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=276><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;also them King David made holy to the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=277><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;with the silver and the gold that he had dedicated from.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=278><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;from.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=279><b>tc</b> The present translation follows the MT; a few Hebrew <sc>mss along with the LXX and Syriac read &#8220;Edom&#8221; (cf. 2 Sam 8:14 and 1 Chr 18:11). Many modern English versions read &#8220;Edom&#8221; here (e.g., NAB, NIV, NRSV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=280><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and from the plunder of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=281><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;made a name.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=282><b>tn</b> So NASB, NCV; NAB, NIV, NRSV, NLT &#8220;Edomites&#8221; (see the note on &#8220;Aram&#8221; in v. 12).</p>
<A NAME="827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=283><b>tn</b> The words<i> </i>&#8220;he defeated&#8221; are supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=284><b>tc</b> The MT is repetitious here: &#8220;He placed in Edom garrisons; in all Edom he placed garrisons.&#8221; The Vulgate lacks &#8220;in all Edom&#8221;; most of the Greek tradition (with the exception of the Lucianic recension and the recension of Origen) and the Syriac Peshitta lack &#8220;he placed garrisons.&#8221; The MT reading appears here to be the result of a conflation of variant readings.</p>
<A NAME="829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=285><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and David was doing what is just and fair for all his people.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=286><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;was over.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=287><b>tc</b> Here Ahimelech is called &#8220;the son of Abiathar,&#8221; but NCV, CEV, and REB reverse this to conform with 1 Sam 22:20. Most recent English versions (e.g., NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV, NLT) retain the order found in the MT.</p>
<A NAME="832"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=288><b>tc</b> The translation follows the Syriac Peshitta, Targum, and Vulgate in reading &#8220;over,&#8221; rather than the simple conjunction that appears in MT. See also the parallel passage in 1 Chr 18:17.</p>
<A NAME="833"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=289><b>sn</b> That David&#8217;s sons could have been <i>priests</i>, in light of the fact that they were not of the priestly lineage, is strange. One must assume either (1) that the word &#8220;priest&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kohen</font>) during this period of time could be used in a broader sense of &#8220;chief ruler&#8221; (KJV); &#8220;chief minister&#8221; (ASV, NASB), or &#8220;royal adviser&#8221; (NIV), perhaps based on the parallel passage in 1 Chr 18:17 which has &#8220;the king&#8217;s leading officials&#8221;, or (2) that in David&#8217;s day members of the king&#8217;s family could function as a special category of &#8220;priests&#8221; (cf. NLT &#8220;priestly leaders&#8221;). The latter option seems to be the more straightforward way of understanding the word in 2 Sam 8:18.</p>
