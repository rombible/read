<A NAME="241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=948><b>sn</b> The parallel text in 1 Chr 21:1 says, &#8220;An adversary opposed Israel, inciting David to count how many warriors Israel had.&#8221; The Samuel version gives an underlying theological perspective, while the Chronicler simply describes what happened from a human perspective. The adversary in 1 Chr 21:1 is likely a human enemy, probably a nearby nation whose hostility against Israel pressured David into numbering the people so he could assess his military strength. See the note at 1 Chr 21:1.</p>
