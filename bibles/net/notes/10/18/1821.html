<A NAME="1821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=633><b>tn</b> There is a play on the word &#8220;heart&#8221; here that is difficult to reproduce in English. Literally the Hebrew text says &#8220;he took three spears in his hand and thrust them into the <i>heart</i> of Absalom while he was still alive in the <i>heart </i>of the oak tree.&#8221; This figure of speech involves the use of the same word in different senses and is known as antanaclasis. It is illustrated in the familiar saying from the time of the American Revolution: &#8220;If we don&#8217;t <i>hang</i> together, we will all <i>hang </i>separately.&#8221; The present translation understands &#8220;heart&#8221; to be used somewhat figuratively for &#8220;chest&#8221; (cf. TEV, CEV), which explains why Joab&#8217;s armor bearers could still &#8220;kill&#8221; Absalom after he had been stabbed with three spears through the &#8220;heart.&#8221; Since trees do not have &#8220;chests&#8221; either, the translation uses &#8220;middle.&#8221;</p>
