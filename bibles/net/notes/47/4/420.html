<A NAME="420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=133><b>tn</b> The first clause of 2 Cor 4:10 is elliptical and apparently refers to the fact that Paul was constantly in danger of dying in the same way Jesus died (by violence at least). According to L&amp;N 23.99 it could be translated, &#8220;at all times we live in the constant threat of being killed as Jesus was.&#8221;</p>
