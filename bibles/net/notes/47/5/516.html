<A NAME="516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=164><b>sn</b> The<i> judgment seat </i>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#946;&#8134;&#956;&#945;</font>, <font face="Greektl">bhma</font>) was a raised platform mounted by steps and sometimes furnished with a seat, used by officials in addressing an assembly or making pronouncements, often on judicial matters. The judgment seat was a common item in Greco-Roman culture, often located in the <i>agora</i>, the public square or marketplace in the center of a city. Use of the term in reference to Christ&#8217;s judgment would be familiar to Paul&#8217;s 1st century readers.</p>
