<A NAME="55"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=153><b>tc</b> &#8225; Some <sc>mss read &#8220;taken off&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#948;&#965;&#963;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</font>, <font face="Greektl">ekdusamenoi</font>) instead of &#8220;put on&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;&#948;&#965;&#963;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</font>, <font face="Greektl">endusamenoi</font>). This alternative reading would change the emphasis of the verse from putting on &#8220;our heavenly house&#8221; to taking off &#8220;our earthly house&#8221; (see the following note regarding the specification of the referent). The difference between the two readings is one letter (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#957;</font> or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;</font>), either of which may be mistaken for the other especially when written in uncial script. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;&#948;&#965;&#963;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</font> enjoys strong support from the Alexandrian text (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B C 33 1739 1881), Byzantine witnesses, versions (lat sy co), and Clement of Alexandria. The Western text is the only texttype to differ: D*<sup>,c</sup> reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#948;&#965;&#963;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</font>, as does ar f<sup>c</sup> Mcion Tert Spec; F and G read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#954;&#955;</font> for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#954;&#948;</font> which indirectly aligns them with D (and was surely due to confusion of letters in uncial script). Thus &#8220;put on&#8221; has the oldest and best external attestation by far. Internal evidence also favors this reading. At first glance, it may seem that &#8220;after we have put on our heavenly house we will not be found naked&#8221; is an obvious statement; the scribe of D may have thought so and changed the participle. But v. 3 seems parenthetical (so A. Plummer, <i>Second Corinthians </i>[ICC], 147), and the idea that &#8220;we do not want to be unclothed but clothed&#8221; is repeated in v. 4 with an explanatory &#8220;for.&#8221; This concept also shows up in v. 2 with the phrase &#8220;we desire to put on.&#8221; So the context can be construed to argue for &#8220;put on&#8221; as the original reading. B. M. Metzger argues against the reading of NA<sup>27</sup>, stating that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#948;&#965;&#963;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</font><i> </i>is &#8220;an early alteration to avoid apparent tautology&#8221; (<i>TCGNT</i> 511; so also Plummer, 148). In addition, the reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;&#948;&#965;&#963;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</font> fits the Pauline pattern of equivalence between apodosis and protasis that is found often enough in his conditional clauses. Thus, &#8220;put on&#8221; has the mark of authenticity and should be considered original.</p>
