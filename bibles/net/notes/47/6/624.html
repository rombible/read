<A NAME="624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=212><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;live among them,&#8221; &#8220;live with them.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>I will live in them. </i>The OT text that lies behind this passage (Lev 26:11-12) speaks of God dwelling in the midst of his people. The Greek preposition <font face="Greektl">en</font> in the phrase <font face="Greektl">en autoi&quot;</font> (&#8220;in them&#8221;) can also have that meaning (&#8220;among&#8221; or &#8220;with&#8221;). However, Paul appears to be extending the imagery here to involve God (as the Spirit) dwelling <i>in</i> his people, since he calls believers &#8220;the temple of the living God&#8221; in the previous clause, imagery he uses elsewhere in his writings (1 Cor 3:16; Eph 2:21-22).</p>
