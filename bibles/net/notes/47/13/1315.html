<A NAME="1315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=472><b>sn</b> The versification of vv. 12 and 13 in the NET <sc>Bible (so also NRSV, NLT) is according to the versification in the NA<sup>27</sup> and UBS<sup>4</sup> editions of the Greek text. Some translations, however, break the material up into three verses, i.e., 12-14 (NKJV, NASB, NIV). The same material has been translated in each case; the only difference is the versification of that material.</p>
