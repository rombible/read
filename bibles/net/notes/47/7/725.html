<A NAME="725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=243><b>tc</b> A few important <sc>mss (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46c </sup>B D* it sa) lack <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#940;&#961;</font> (<font face="Greektl">gar</font>, &#8220;for&#8221;), while the majority of witnesses have it (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> C D<sup>1</sup> F G <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 0243 33 1739 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> sy bo). Even though <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46*</sup> omits <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#940;&#961;</font>, it has the same sense (viz., a subordinate clause) because it reads the participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#946;&#955;&#941;&#960;&#969;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">blepwn</font>, &#8220;seeing&#8221;; the Vulgate does the same). A decision is difficult because although the overwhelming external evidence is on the side of the conjunction, the lack of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#940;&#961;</font> is a significantly harder reading, for the whole clause is something of an anacoluthon. Without the conjunction, the sentence reads more harshly. This would fit with Paul&#8217;s &#8220;vehemence of spirit&#8221; (A. T. Robertson, <i>A Grammar of the Greek New Testament</i>, 435) that is found especially in 2 Corinthians and Galatians. However, the <sc>mss that omit the conjunction are prone to such tendencies at times. In this instance, the conjunction should probably stand.</p>
