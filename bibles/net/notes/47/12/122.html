<A NAME="122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=424><b>sn</b> In the NT, <i>paradise</i> is mentioned three times. In Luke 23:43 it refers to the abode of the righteous dead. In Rev 2:7 it refers to the restoration of Edenic paradise predicted in Isa 51:3 and Ezek 36:35. The reference here in 2 Cor 12:4 is probably to be translated as parallel to the mention of the &#8220;third heaven&#8221; in v. 2. Assuming that the &#8220;first heaven&#8221; would be atmospheric heaven (the sky) and &#8220;second heaven&#8221; the more distant stars and planets, &#8220;third heaven&#8221; would refer to the place where God dwells. This is much more likely than some variation on the seven heavens mentioned in the pseudepigraphic book <i>2 Enoch </i>and in other nonbiblical and rabbinic works.</p>
