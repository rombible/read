<A NAME="31"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=75><b>tn</b> The Greek construction anticipates a negative reply (&#8220;No, we do not&#8221;) which is indicated in the translation by the &#8216;tag&#8217; at the end, &#8220;do we?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="32"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=76><b>tn</b> That is, &#8220;letter of recommendation.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="33"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=77><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;making plain.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="34"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=78><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;cared for by us,&#8221; an expression that could refer either to the writing or the delivery of the letter (BDAG 229 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#941;&#969;</font> 1). Since the following phrase refers to the writing of the letter, and since the previous verse speaks of this &#8220;letter&#8221; being &#8220;written on our [Paul&#8217;s and his companions&#8217;] hearts&#8221; it is more probable that the phrase &#8220;cared for by us&#8221; refers to the delivery of the letter (in the person of Paul and his companions).</p>
<A NAME="35"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=79><b>sn</b> An allusion to Exod 24:12; 31:18; 34:1; Deut 9:10-11.</p>
<A NAME="36"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=80><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;competent.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="37"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=81><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;competence.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="38"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=82><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;competent.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="39"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=83><b>sn</b> This<i> new covenant</i> is promised in Jer 31:31-34; 32:40.</p>
<A NAME="310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=84><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;on stones&#8221;; but since this is clearly an allusion to the tablets of the Decalogue (see 2 Cor 3:3) the word &#8220;tablets&#8221; was supplied in the translation to make the connection clear. </p>
<A NAME="311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=85><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;so that the sons of Israel.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=86><b>sn</b> <i>The glory of his face.</i> When Moses came down from Mt. Sinai with the tablets of the Decalogue, the people were afraid to approach him because his face was so radiant (Exod 34:29-30).</p>
<A NAME="313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=87><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;a glory&#8221; are not in the Greek text, but the reference to &#8220;glory&#8221; has been repeated from the previous clause for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=88><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;which was transitory.&#8221; Traditionally this phrase is translated as &#8220;which was fading away.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#961;&#947;&#941;&#969;</font> in the <i>corpus Paulinum </i>uniformly has the meaning &#8220;to render inoperative, ineffective&#8221;; the same nuance is appropriate here. The glory of Moses&#8217; face was rendered ineffective by the veil Moses wore. For discussion of the meaning of this verb in this context, see S. J. Hafemann, <i>Paul, Moses, and the History of Israel</i> (WUNT 81), 301-13. A similar translation has been adopted in the two other occurrences of the verb in this paragraph in vv. 11 and 13.</p>
<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=89><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;how will not rather the ministry of the Spirit be with glory?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=90><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the ministry of condemnation&#8221;; translated as an objective genitive, &#8220;the ministry that produced condemnation.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=91><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the ministry of righteousness&#8221;; translated as an objective genitive, &#8220;the ministry that produces righteousness.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=92><b>tn</b> Traditionally, &#8220;abound.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=93><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;in this case.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=94><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;of what replaced it&#8221; are not in the Greek text, but have been supplied to clarify the meaning.</p>
<A NAME="321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=95><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;what was fading away.&#8221; See note on &#8220;which was made ineffective&#8221; in v. 7.</p>
<A NAME="322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=96><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;through&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#940;</font>, <font face="Greektl">dia</font>).</p>
<A NAME="323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=97><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;what is permanent.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=98><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;we employ great openness of speech.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=99><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the sons of Israel.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=100><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;from gazing intently.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=101><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;end.&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#941;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">telos</font>) can mean both &#8220;a point of time marking the end of a duration, <i>end, termination, cessation</i>&#8221; and &#8220;the goal toward which a movement is being directed, <i>end, goal, outcome</i>&#8221; (see BDAG 998-999 s.v.). The translation accepts the interpretation that Moses covered the glory of his face with the veil to prevent Israel from being judged by the glory of God (see S. J. Hafemann, <i>Paul, Moses, and the History of Israel </i>[WUNT 81], 347-62); in this case the latter meaning for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#941;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> is more appropriate.</p>
<A NAME="328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=102><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;was fading away&#8221;; <i>Grk</i> &#8220;on the result of what was made ineffective.&#8221; The referent (glory) has been specified in the translation for clarity. See note on &#8220;which was made ineffective&#8221; in v. 7.</p>
<A NAME="329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=103><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;their minds were hardened.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=104><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the same veil remains at the reading of the old covenant&#8221;; the phrase &#8220;they hear&#8221; has been introduced (&#8220;when they hear the old covenant read&#8221;) to make the link with the &#8220;Israelites&#8221; (v. 13) whose minds were closed (v. 14a) more obvious to the reader.</p>
<A NAME="331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=105><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;only in Christ is it eliminated.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=106><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;their heart.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=107><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;when(ever) he turns,&#8221; referring to Moses.</p>
<A NAME="334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=108><b>sn</b> An allusion to Exod 34:34. The entire verse may refer to Moses, viewing him as a type portraying the Jewish convert to Christianity in Paul&#8217;s day.</p>
<A NAME="335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=109><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;where the Spirit of the Lord is&#8221;; the word &#8220;present&#8221; is supplied to specify that the presence of the Lord&#8217;s Spirit is emphasized rather than the mere existence of the Lord&#8217;s Spirit.</p>
<A NAME="336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=110><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;we all with unveiled faces beholding the glory of the Lord as in a mirror.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=111><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;from glory to glory.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="338"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=112><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;just as from.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=113><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;from the Lord, the Spirit&#8221;; the genitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pneumato&quot;</font>) has been translated as a genitive of apposition.</p>
