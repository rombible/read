<A NAME="834"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=292><b>tn</b> &#8220;This&#8221; refers to sending the brother mentioned in 2 Cor 8:18 to Corinth along with Titus. The words &#8220;We did this&#8221; have no equivalent in the Greek text, but are necessary to maintain the thought flow in English. The Greek participle that begins v. 20 continues the sentence begun in v. 18 which concerns the sending of the other brother mentioned there.</p>
