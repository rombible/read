<A NAME="810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=268><b>tc</b> The reading &#8220;the love from us that is in you&#8221; is very difficult in this context, for Paul is here enumerating the <i>Corinthians&#8217;</i> attributes: How is it possible for them to excel &#8220;in the love <i>from us</i> that is in you&#8221;? Most likely, because of this difficulty, several early scribes, as well as most later ones (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> C D F G <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> [33] <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat), altered the text to read &#8220;your love for us&#8221; (so NIV; <i>Grk</i> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#958; &#8017;&#956;&#8182;&#957; &#7952;&#957; &#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957; &#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#8131;</font> [<font face="Greektl">ex Jumwn en Jhmin agaph</font>]). The reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#958; &#7969;&#956;&#8182;&#957; &#7952;&#957; &#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957; &#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#8131;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ex Jhmwn en Jumin agaph</font>) is found, however, in excellent and early witnesses (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup> B 0243 6 104 630 1175 1739 1881 co). As the harder reading it explains the rise of the other reading. What, then, is the force of &#8220;in the love from us that is in you&#8221;? Most likely, Paul is commending the Corinthians for excelling in deriving some inspiration from the apostles&#8217; love for them. </p>
