<A NAME="820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=278><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;the gift itself&#8221; are not in the Greek text but are implied. Translators often supply an English phrase like &#8220;it is&#8221; (NASB) but in the context, Paul is clearly referring to the collection Titus was to oversee (2 Cor 8:4-7). Therefore there is no reason not to specify the referent (the gift) more narrowly for clarity.</p>
