<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=56><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;comfort him, lest somehow such a person be swallowed up by excessive grief,&#8221; an idiom for a person being so overcome with grief as to despair or give up completely (L&amp;N 25.285). In this context of excessive grief or regret for past sins, &#8220;overwhelmed&#8221; is a good translation since contemporary English idiom speaks of someone &#8220;overwhelmed by grief.&#8221; Because of the length of the Greek sentence and the difficulty of expressing a negative purpose/result clause in English, a new sentence was started here in the translation.</p>
