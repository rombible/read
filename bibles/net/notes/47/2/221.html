<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=62><b>tn</b> This has been translated as a concessive participle (&#8220;even though&#8221;). The passive construction (&#8220;a door of opportunity had been opened for me by the Lord&#8221;) has been converted to an active one in the translation for clarity.</p>
