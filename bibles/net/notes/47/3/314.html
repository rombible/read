<A NAME="314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=88><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;which was transitory.&#8221; Traditionally this phrase is translated as &#8220;which was fading away.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#961;&#947;&#941;&#969;</font> in the <i>corpus Paulinum </i>uniformly has the meaning &#8220;to render inoperative, ineffective&#8221;; the same nuance is appropriate here. The glory of Moses&#8217; face was rendered ineffective by the veil Moses wore. For discussion of the meaning of this verb in this context, see S. J. Hafemann, <i>Paul, Moses, and the History of Israel</i> (WUNT 81), 301-13. A similar translation has been adopted in the two other occurrences of the verb in this paragraph in vv. 11 and 13.</p>
