<A NAME="327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=101><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;end.&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#941;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">telos</font>) can mean both &#8220;a point of time marking the end of a duration, <i>end, termination, cessation</i>&#8221; and &#8220;the goal toward which a movement is being directed, <i>end, goal, outcome</i>&#8221; (see BDAG 998-999 s.v.). The translation accepts the interpretation that Moses covered the glory of his face with the veil to prevent Israel from being judged by the glory of God (see S. J. Hafemann, <i>Paul, Moses, and the History of Israel </i>[WUNT 81], 347-62); in this case the latter meaning for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#941;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> is more appropriate.</p>
