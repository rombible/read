<A NAME="121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=423><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Boasting is necessary.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=424><b>sn</b> In the NT, <i>paradise</i> is mentioned three times. In Luke 23:43 it refers to the abode of the righteous dead. In Rev 2:7 it refers to the restoration of Edenic paradise predicted in Isa 51:3 and Ezek 36:35. The reference here in 2 Cor 12:4 is probably to be translated as parallel to the mention of the &#8220;third heaven&#8221; in v. 2. Assuming that the &#8220;first heaven&#8221; would be atmospheric heaven (the sky) and &#8220;second heaven&#8221; the more distant stars and planets, &#8220;third heaven&#8221; would refer to the place where God dwells. This is much more likely than some variation on the seven heavens mentioned in the pseudepigraphic book <i>2 Enoch </i>and in other nonbiblical and rabbinic works.</p>
<A NAME="123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=425><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;things that cannot be put into words.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=426><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;a man.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=427><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;speaking.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=428><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;may think of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=429><b>tc</b> Most <sc>mss (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup> D <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>) lack <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#972;</font> (<font face="Greektl">dio</font>, &#8220;Therefore&#8221;), but the widespread distribution and quality of <sc>mss which include it (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A B F G 0243 33 81 1175 1739 <i>pc</i>) argues for its authenticity. Internally, its case is equally strong in that its inclusion is grammatically rough (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#972;</font> is hardly necessary to convey purpose, especially since Paul uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> [<font face="Greektl">{ina</font>, &#8220;so that&#8221;] next).</p>
<A NAME="128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=430><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;to harass.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=431><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;so that I might not become arrogant&#8221; is repeated here because it occurs in the Greek text two times in the verse. Although redundant, it is repeated because of the emphatic nature of its affirmation.</p>
<A NAME="1210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=432><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;but&#8221; because of the contrast implicit in the context.</p>
<A NAME="1211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=433><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;is sufficient.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=434><b>tc</b> The majority of later <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> A<sup>c</sup> D<sup>1</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 0243 0278 33 1739 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>) as well as some versional witnesses include the pronoun &#8220;my&#8221; here, but the omission of the pronoun has excellent external support (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46vid</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* A* B D* F G latt). Scribes probably added the pronoun for clarity, making the obvious referent explicit. This would also make &#8220;power&#8221; more parallel with &#8220;my grace.&#8221; Though the original text probably did not include &#8220;my,&#8221; scribes who added the word were following the sense of Paul&#8217;s statement.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The pronoun &#8220;my&#8221; was supplied in the translation to clarify the sense of Paul&#8217;s expression.</p>
<A NAME="1213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=435><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;my power comes to full strength.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=436><b>tn</b> &#8220;Most gladly,&#8221; a comparative form used with superlative meaning and translated as such.</p>
<A NAME="1215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=437><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;may rest on.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=438><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I take delight in.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=439><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;calamities.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=440><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I am in no way inferior.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=441><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;patience,&#8221; &#8220;endurance.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=442><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;and miracles.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=443><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;For in what respect.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=444><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;children ought not,&#8221; but this might give the impression that children are not supposed to support sick or aging parents in need of help. That is not what Paul is saying. His point is that children should not have to pay their parent&#8217;s way.</p>
<A NAME="1223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=445><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;souls.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=446><b>tn</b> The Greek construction anticipates a negative answer, indicated by the &#8216;tag&#8217; question &#8220;have I?&#8221; at the end of the clause. The question is rhetorical.</p>
<A NAME="1225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=447><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;to visit you&#8221; are not in the Greek text but are implied. Direct objects were often omitted in Greek when clear from the context, and must be supplied for the modern reader.</p>
<A NAME="1226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=448><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=449><b>tn</b> The Greek construction anticipates a negative answer, indicated by the &#8216;tag&#8217; question &#8220;did he?&#8221; at the end of the clause.</p>
<A NAME="1228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=450><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;[Did we not walk] in the same tracks?&#8221; This is an idiom that means to imitate someone else or to behave as they do. Paul&#8217;s point is that he and Titus have conducted themselves in the same way toward the Corinthians. If Titus did not take advantage of the Corinthians, then neither did Paul.</p>
<A NAME="1229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=451><b>tc</b> The reading &#8220;all this time&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#940;&#955;&#945;&#953;</font>, <font face="Greektl">palai</font>) is found in several early and important Alexandrian and Western witnesses including <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* A B F G 0243 6 33 81 365 1175 1739 1881 lat; the reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#940;&#955;&#953;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">palin</font>, &#8220;again&#8221;) is read by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> D <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 0278 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> sy bo; the reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016; &#960;&#940;&#955;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ou palai</font>) is read by <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup>, making the question even more emphatic. The reading of <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup> could only have arisen from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#940;&#955;&#945;&#953;</font>. The reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#940;&#955;&#953;&#957;</font> is significantly easier (&#8220;are you once again thinking that we are defending ourselves?&#8221;), for it softens Paul&#8217;s tone considerably. It thus seems to be a motivated reading and cannot easily explain the rise of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#940;&#955;&#945;&#953;</font>. Further, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#940;&#955;&#945;&#953;</font> has considerable support in the Alexandrian and Western witnesses, rendering it virtually certain as the original wording here.</p>
<A NAME="1230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=452><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;for your strengthening&#8221;; <i>Grk</i> &#8220;for your edification.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=453><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;and I will be found by you.&#8221; The passive construction has been converted to an active one in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="1232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=454><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;I am afraid that&#8221; are not repeated in the Greek text, but are needed for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=455><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;intense anger, hostility.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=456><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;I am afraid that&#8221; are not repeated in the Greek text from v. 20, but are needed for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=457><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I will mourn over.&#8221;</p>
