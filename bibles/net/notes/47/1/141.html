In the NT the term is used only figuratively of the Holy Spirit as the <i>down payment</i> of the blessings promised by God (it occurs later in 2 Cor 5:5, and also in Eph 1:14). In the &#8220;already &#8211; not yet&#8221; scheme of the NT the possession of the Spirit now by believers (&#8220;already&#8221;) can be viewed as a guarantee that God will give them the balance of the promised blessings in the future (&#8220;not yet&#8221;).</p>
