<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>tn</b> There is no verb in the Greek text; either the optative (&#8220;be&#8221;) or the indicative (&#8220;is&#8221;) can be supplied. The meaning of the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8016;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#951;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">euloghtos</font>) and the author&#8217;s intention at this point in the epistle must both come into play to determine which is the preferred nuance. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8016;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#951;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> as an adjective can mean either that one is praised or that one is blessed, that is, in a place of favor and benefit. The meaning &#8220;blessed&#8221; would be more naturally paired with an indicative verb and would suggest that blessedness is an intrinsic part of God&#8217;s character. The meaning &#8220;praised&#8221; would be more naturally paired with an optative verb and would suggest that God ought to be praised. Pauline style in the epistles generally moves from statements to obligations, expressing the reality first and then the believer&#8217;s necessary response. When considered as a whole, although a decision is difficult, the general Pauline style of beginning with statements and moving to obligations argues for the indicative. Cf. also Eph 1:3; 1 Pet 1:3.</p>
