<A NAME="41"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=230><b>sn</b> In chap. 3, the first part of this extensive call, Yahweh promises to deliver his people. At the hesitancy of Moses, God guarantees his presence will be with him, and that assures the success of the mission. But with chap. 4, the second half of the call, the tone changes sharply. Now Moses protests his inadequacies in view of the nature of the task. In many ways, these verses address the question, &#8220;Who is sufficient for these things?&#8221; There are three basic movements in the passage. The first nine verses tell how God gave Moses signs in case Israel did not believe him (4:1-9). The second section records how God dealt with the speech problem of Moses (4:10-12). And finally, the last section records God&#8217;s provision of a helper, someone who could talk well (4:13-17). See also J. E. Hamlin, &#8220;The Liberator&#8217;s Ordeal: A Study of Exodus 4:1-9,&#8221; <i>Rhetorical Criticism</i> [PTMS],<i> </i>33-42.</p>

The Greek has &#8220;if not&#8221; but adds the clause &#8220;what shall I say to them?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="44"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=233><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;listen to my voice,&#8221; so as to respond positively.</p>
<A NAME="45"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=234><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;rod&#8221; (KJV, ASV); NCV, CEV &#8220;walking stick&#8221;; NLT &#8220;shepherd&#8217;s staff.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The staff appears here to be the shepherd&#8217;s staff that he was holding. It now will become the instrument with which Moses will do the mighty works, for it is the medium of the display of the divine power (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 27; also, L. Shalit, &#8220;How Moses Turned a Staff into a Snake and Back Again,&#8221; <i>BAR</i> 9 [1983]: 72-73).</p>
<A NAME="46"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=235><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (the <sc>Lord) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="47"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=236><b>sn</b> The details of the verse are designed to show that there was a staff that <i>became a snake</i>. The question is used to affirm that there truly was a staff, and then the report of Moses running from it shows it was a genuine snake. Using the serpent as a sign would have had an impact on the religious ideas of Egypt, for the sacred cobra was one of their symbols. </p>
<A NAME="48"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=237><b>sn</b> The signs authenticated Moses&#8217; ministry as the <sc>Lord&#8217;s emissary. This sign will show that the <sc>Lord had control over Egypt and its stability, over life and death. But first Moses has to be convinced that he can turn it into a dead stick again. </p>
<A NAME="49"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=238><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1461;&#1497;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kheq</font>), often rendered &#8220;bosom,&#8221; refers to the front of the chest and a fold in the garment there where an item could be placed for carrying (see Prov 6:27; 16:33; 21:14). So &#8220;into your robe&#8221; should be understood loosely here and in v. 7 as referring to the inside of the top front of Moses&#8217; garment. The inside chest pocket of a jacket is a rough modern equivalent.</p>
<A NAME="410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=239><b>tn</b> The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>) points out the startling or amazing sight as if the reader were catching first glimpse of it with Moses.</p>
<A NAME="411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=240><b>sn</b> This sudden skin disease indicated that God was able to bring such diseases on Egypt in the plagues and that only he could remove them. The whitening was the first stage of death for the diseased (Num 12:10; 2 Kgs 5:27). The Hebrew words traditionally rendered &#8220;leprous&#8221; or &#8220;leprosy,&#8221; as they are used in Lev 13 and 14, encompass a variety of conditions, not limited to the disease called leprosy and identified as Hansen&#8217;s disease in modern times.</p>
<A NAME="412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=241><b>tn</b> The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>) points out the startling or amazing sight as if the reader were catching first glimpse of it with Moses. </p>
<A NAME="413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=242><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;it returned.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=243><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;like his flesh.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=244><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and it will be if.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=245><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;listen to the voice of,&#8221; meaning listen so as to respond appropriately.</p>
<A NAME="417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=246><b>tn</b> The nuance of this perfect tense with a <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive will be equal to the imperfect of possibility &#8211; &#8220;they may believe.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=247><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;believe the voice of the latter sign,&#8221; so as to understand and accept the meaning of the event.</p>
<A NAME="419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=248><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and it will be if.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=249><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;listen to your voice.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=250><b>tn</b> The verb form is the perfect tense with the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive; it functions then as the equivalent of the imperfect tense &#8211; here as an imperfect of instruction. </p>
<A NAME="422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=251><b>sn</b> This is a powerful sign, for the Nile was always known as the source of life in Egypt, but now it will become the evidence of death. So the three signs were alike, each consisting of life and death. They would clearly anticipate the struggle with Egypt through the plagues. The point is clear that in the face of the possibility that people might not believe, the servants of God must offer clear proof of the power of God as they deliver the message of God. The rest is up to God. </p>
<A NAME="423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=252><b>sn</b> Now Moses took up another line of argumentation, the issue of his inability to speak fluently (vv. 10-17). The point here is that God&#8217;s servants must yield themselves as instruments to God, the Creator. It makes no difference what character traits they have or what weaknesses they think they have (Moses manages to speak very well) if God is present. If the sovereign God has chosen them, then they have everything that God intended them to have. </p>
<A NAME="424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=253><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bi</font>) is a particle of entreaty; it seeks permission to speak and is always followed by &#8220;my lord&#8221; or &#8220;my Lord.&#8221; Often rendered &#8220;please,&#8221; it is &#8220;employed in petitions, complaints and excuses&#8221; (W. H. C. Propp, <i>Exodus 1&#8211;18</i> [AB],<i> </i>213).</p>
<A NAME="425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=254><b>tn</b> The designation in Moses&#8217; address is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adonay</font>), a term of respect and deference such as &#8220;lord, master, sir&#8221; but pointed as it would be when it represents the tetragrammaton. B. Jacob says since this is the first time Moses spoke directly to Yahweh, he did so hesitatingly (<i>Exodus</i>,<i> </i>87).</p>
<A NAME="426"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=255><b>tn</b> When a noun clause is negated with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;), rather than <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">en</font>), there is a special emphasis, since the force of the negative falls on a specific word (GKC 479 §152.<i>d</i>). The expression &#8220;eloquent man&#8221; is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ish dÿvarim</font>, &#8220;a man of words&#8221;). The genitive may indicate a man characterized by words or a man who is able to command or control words. Moses apparently is resigned to the fact that he can do the signs, but he knows the signs have to be explained.</p>
<A NAME="427"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=256><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;also from yesterday also from three days ago&#8221; or &#8220;neither since yesterday nor since before that&#8221; is idiomatic for &#8220;previously&#8221; or &#8220;in the past.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="428"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=257><b>tn</b> The two expressions are <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1491;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khÿvad peh</font>, &#8220;heavy of mouth&#8221;), and then <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1491; &#1500;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khÿvad lashon</font>, &#8220;heavy of tongue&#8221;). Both use genitives of specification, the mouth and the tongue being what are heavy &#8211; slow. &#8220;Mouth&#8221; and &#8220;tongue&#8221; are metonymies of cause. Moses is saying that he has a problem speaking well. Perhaps he had been too long at the other side of the desert, or perhaps he was being a little dishonest. At any rate, he has still not captured the meaning of God&#8217;s presence. See among other works, J. H. Tigay, &#8220;&#8216;Heavy of Mouth&#8217; and &#8216;Heavy of Tongue&#8217;: On Moses&#8217; Speech Difficulty,&#8221; <i>BASOR</i> 231 (1978): 57-67. </p>
<A NAME="429"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=258><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sim</font>) means &#8220;to place, put, set&#8221;; the sentence here more precisely says, &#8220;Who put a mouth into a man?&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The argumentation by Moses is here met by Yahweh&#8217;s rhetorical questions. They are intended to be sharp &#8211; it is reproof for Moses. The message is twofold. First, Yahweh is fully able to overcome all of Moses&#8217; deficiencies. Second, Moses is exactly the way that God intended him to be. So the rhetorical questions are meant to prod Moses&#8217; faith. </p>
<A NAME="430"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=259><b>sn</b> The final question obviously demands a positive answer. But the clause is worded in such a way as to return to the theme of &#8220;I AM.&#8221; Isaiah 45:5-7 developed this same idea of God&#8217;s control over life. Moses protests that he is not an eloquent speaker, and the <sc>Lord replies with reminders about himself and promises, &#8220;I will be with your mouth,&#8221; an assertion that repeats the verb he used four times in 3:12 and 14 and in promises to Isaac and Jacob (Gen 26:3; 31:3).</p>
<A NAME="431"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=260><b>sn</b> The promise of divine presence always indicates intervention (for blessing or cursing). Here it means that God would be working through the organs of speech to help Moses speak. See Deut 18:18; Jer 1:9. </p>
<A NAME="432"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=261><b>sn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿhoretikha</font>), the Hiphil perfect with a <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive. The form carries the instructional meaning because it follows the imperative &#8220;go.&#8221; In fact, there is a sequence at work here: &#8220;go&#8230;and/that I may teach you.&#8221; It is from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yara</font>), the same root behind <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">torah</font>, &#8220;law&#8221;). This always referred to teaching either wisdom or revelation. Here Yahweh promises to teach Moses what to say. </p>
<A NAME="433"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=262><b>tn</b> The form is the imperfect tense. While it could be taken as a future (&#8220;what you will say&#8221;), an obligatory imperfect captures the significance better (&#8220;what you must say&#8221; or &#8220;what you are to say&#8221;). Not even the content of the message will be left up to Moses.</p>
<A NAME="434"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=263><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And he said&#8221;; the referent (Moses) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="435"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=264><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bi</font>) is a particle of entreaty; it seeks permission to speak and is always followed by &#8220;Lord&#8221; or &#8220;my Lord.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="436"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=265><b>tn</b> The text has simply <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;&#1470;&#1504;&#1464;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1497;&#1463;&#1491;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿlakh-na</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> bÿyad tishlakh</font>, &#8220;send by the hand you will send&#8221;). This is not Moses&#8217; resignation to doing God&#8217;s will &#8211; it is his final attempt to avoid the call. It carries the force of asking God to send someone else. This is an example of an independent relative clause governed by the genitive: &#8220;by the hand of &#8211; whomever you will send&#8221; (see GKC 488-89 §155.<i>n</i>).</p>
<A NAME="437"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=266><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the anger of Yahweh burned against.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Moses had not dared openly to say &#8220;except me&#8221; when he asked God to send whomever he wanted to send. But God knew that is what he meant. Moses should not have resisted the call or pleaded such excuses or hesitated with such weak faith. Now God abandoned the gentle answer and in anger brought in a form of retribution. Because Moses did not want to do this, he was punished by not having the honor of doing it alone. His reluctance and the result are like the refusal of Israel to enter the land and the result they experienced (see U. Cassuto, <i>Exodus</i>, 49-50).</p>
<A NAME="438"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=267><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Is not&#8221; or perhaps &#8220;Is [there] not.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="439"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=268><b>sn</b> S. R. Driver (<i>Exodus</i>, 29) suggests that the term &#8220;Levite&#8221; may refer to a profession rather than ancestry here, because both Moses and Aaron were from the tribe of Levi and there would be little point in noting that ancestry for Aaron. In thinking through the difficult problem of the identity of Levites, he cites McNeile as saying &#8220;the Levite&#8221; referred to one who had had official training as a priest (cf. Judg 17:7, where a member of the tribe of Judah was a Levite). If it was the duty of the priest to give &#8220;torah&#8221; &#8211; to teach &#8211; then some training in the power of language would have been in order. </p>
<A NAME="440"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=269><b>tn</b> The construction uses the Piel infinitive absolute and the Piel<i> </i>imperfect to express the idea that he spoke very well: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512; &#1497;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dabber yÿdabber</font>).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b><i> </i>Now Yahweh, in condescending to Moses, selects something that Moses (and God) did not really need for the work. It is as if he were saying: &#8220;If Moses feels speaking ability is so necessary (rather than the divine presence), then that is what he will have.&#8221; Of course, this golden-tongued Aaron had some smooth words about how the golden calf was forged! </p>
<A NAME="441"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=270><b>tn</b> The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>) with the participle points to the imminent future; it means &#8220;he is about to come&#8221; or &#8220;here he is coming.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="442"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=271><b>sn</b> It is unlikely that this simply means that as a brother he will be pleased to see Moses, for the narrative has no time for that kind of comment. It is interested in more significant things. The implication is that Aaron will rejoice because of the revelation of God to Moses and the plan to deliver Israel from bondage (see B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 93). </p>
<A NAME="443"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=272><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I will help you speak.&#8221; The independent pronoun puts emphasis (&#8220;as for me&#8221;) on the subject (&#8220;I&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="444"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=273><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;and will help him speak.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="445"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=274><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;both&#8221; is supplied to convey that this object (&#8220;you&#8221;) and the subject of the next verb (&#8220;you must do&#8221;) are plural in the Hebrew text, referring to Moses and Aaron. In 4:16 &#8220;you&#8221; returns to being singular in reference to Moses.</p>
<A NAME="446"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=275><b>tn</b> The imperfect tense carries the obligatory nuance here as well. The relative pronoun with this verb forms a noun clause functioning as the direct object of &#8220;I will teach.&#8221; </p>

The whole process had now been removed one step. Instead of God speaking to Moses and Moses telling the people, Aaron would be the speaker for a while. But God was still going to work through Moses. </p>
<A NAME="452"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=281><b>sn</b> Mention of the staff makes an appropriate ending to the section, for God&#8217;s power (represented by the staff) will work through Moses. The applicable point that this whole section is making could be worded this way: The servants of God who sense their inadequacy must demonstrate the power of God as their sufficiency. </p>
<A NAME="453"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=282><b>sn</b> This last section of the chapter reports Moses&#8217; compliance with the commission.

<A NAME="459"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=288><b>sn</b> The text clearly stated that Pharaoh sought to kill Moses; so this seems to be a reference to Pharaoh&#8217;s death shortly before Moses&#8217; return. Moses was forty years in Midian. In the 18th dynasty, only Pharaoh Thutmose III had a reign of the right length (1504-1450 <sc>b.c.) to fit this period of Moses&#8217; life. This would place Moses&#8217; returning to Egypt near 1450 <sc>b.c., in the beginning of the reign of Amenhotep II, whom most conservatives identify as the pharaoh of the exodus. Rameses II, of course, had a very long reign (1304-1236). But if he were the one from whom Moses fled, then he could not be the pharaoh of the exodus, but his son would be &#8211; and that puts the date of the exodus after 1236, a date too late for anyone. See E. H. Merrill, <i>Kingdom of Priests</i>, 62.</p>

<A NAME="465"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=294><b>tn</b> The two verb forms in this section are the imperative (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">rÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eh</font>) followed by the perfect with the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">va</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asitam</font>). The second could be coordinated and function as a second command: &#8220;see&#8230;and [then] do&#8221;; or it could be subordinated logically: &#8220;see&#8230;so that you do.&#8221; Some commentators who take the first option suggest that Moses was supposed to contemplate these wonders before doing them before Pharaoh.

<A NAME="468"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=297><b>sn</b> Here is the first mention of the hardening of the heart of Pharaoh. God first tells Moses he must do the miracles, but he also announces that he will harden Pharaoh&#8217;s heart, as if working against Moses. It will help Moses to know that God is bringing about the resistance in order to bring a greater victory with greater glory. There is a great deal of literature on this, but see among the resources F. W. Danker, &#8220;Hardness of Heart: A Study in Biblical Thematic,&#8221; <i>CTM</i> 44 (1973): 89-100; R. R.

<A NAME="471"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=300><b>tn</b> The instantaneous use of the perfect tense fits well with the prophetic announcement of what Yahweh said or says. It shows that the words given to the prophet are still binding.</p>
<A NAME="472"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=301><b>sn</b> The metaphor uses the word &#8220;son&#8221; in its connotation of a political dependent, as it was used in ancient documents to describe what was intended to be a loyal relationship with well-known privileges and responsibilities, like that between a good father and son. The word can mean a literal son, a descendant, a chosen king (and so, the Messiah), a disciple (in Proverbs), and here, a nation subject to God. If the people of Israel were God&#8217;s &#8220;son,&#8221; then they should serve him and not Pharaoh. Malachi reminds people that the Law said &#8220;a son honors his father,&#8221; and so God asked, &#8220;If I am a father, where is my honor?&#8221; (Mal 1:6).</p>

<A NAME="474"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=303><b>tn</b> The Piel infinitive serves as the direct object of the verb, answering the question of what Pharaoh would refuse to do.

<A NAME="475"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">75</span><note=304><b>tn</b> The construction is very emphatic. The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>) gives it an immediacy and a vividness, as if God is already beginning to act. The participle with this particle has the nuance of an imminent future act, as if God is saying, &#8220;I am about to kill.&#8221; These words are not repeated until the last plague.</p>
<A NAME="476"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">76</span><note=305><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;at a lodging place&#8221; or &#8220;at an inn.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="477"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=306><b>sn</b> The next section (vv. 24-26) records a rather strange story. God had said that if Pharaoh would not comply he would kill his son &#8211; but now God was ready to kill Moses, the representative of Israel, God&#8217;s own son. Apparently, one would reconstruct that on the journey Moses fell seriously ill, but his wife, learning the cause of the illness, saved his life by circumcising her son and casting the foreskin at Moses&#8217; feet (indicating that it was symbolically Moses&#8217; foreskin). The point is that this son of Abraham had not complied with the sign of the Abrahamic covenant. No one, according to Exod 12:40-51, would take part in the Passover-exodus who had not complied. So how could the one who was going to lead God&#8217;s people not comply? The bold anthropomorphisms and the location at the border invite comparisons with Gen 32, the Angel wrestling with Jacob. In both cases there is a brush with death that could not be forgotten. See also, W. Dumbrell, &#8220;Exodus 4:24-25: A Textual Re-examination,&#8221; <i>HTR</i> 65 (1972): 285-90; T. C.

The LXX has &#8220;and she fell at his feet&#8221; and then &#8220;the blood of the circumcision of my son stood.&#8221; But it is clear that she caused the foreskin to touch Moses&#8217; feet, as if the one were a substitution for the other, taking the place of the other (see U. Cassuto, <i>Exodus</i>, 60).</p>
<A NAME="479"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">79</span><note=308><b>sn</b> U. Cassuto explains that she was saying, &#8220;I have delivered you from death, and your return to life makes you my bridegroom a second time, this time my blood bridegroom, a bridegroom acquired through blood&#8221; (<i>Exodus</i>, 60-61).</p>

<A NAME="481"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">81</span><note=310><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Therefore.&#8221; The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1494;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">az</font>) here is not introducing the next item in a series of events. It points back to the past (&#8220;at that time,&#8221; see Gen 4:26) or to a logical connection (&#8220;therefore, consequently&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="482"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">82</span><note=311><b>tn</b> The Hebrew simply has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lammulot</font>, &#8220;to the circumcision[s]&#8221;). The phrase explains that the saying was in reference to the act of circumcision. Some scholars speculate that there was a ritual prior to marriage from which this event and its meaning derived. But it appears rather that if there was some ancient ritual, it would have had to come from this event. The difficulty is that the son is circumcised, not Moses, making the comparative mythological view untenable. Moses had apparently not circumcised Eliezer. Since Moses was taking his family with him, God had to make sure the sign of the covenant was kept. It may be that here Moses sent them all back to Jethro (18:2) because of the difficulties that lay ahead.</p>

<A NAME="490"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">90</span><note=319><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;intervened for.&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">paqad</font>) has traditionally been translated &#8220;visited,&#8221; which is open to many interpretations. It means that God intervened in the life of the Israelites to bless them with the fulfillment of the promises. It says more than that he took notice of them, took pity on them, or remembered them. He had not yet fulfilled the promises, but he had begun to act by calling Moses and Aaron. The translation &#8220;attended to&#8221; attempts to capture that much. </p>

The implication is certainly that they prayed, or praised, and performed some other aspect of worship, but the text may just be describing it from their posture of worship. With this response, all the fears of Moses are swept aside &#8211; they believed and they were thankful to God. </p>
