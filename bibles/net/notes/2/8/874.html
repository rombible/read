<A NAME="874"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=567><b>tn</b> This form, a perfect tense with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive, is equivalent to the imperfect tense that precedes it. However, it must be subordinate to the preceding verb to express the purpose. He is not saying &#8220;I will release&#8230;and you will sacrifice,&#8221; but rather &#8220;I will release&#8230;that you may sacrifice&#8221; or even &#8220;to sacrifice.&#8221;</p>
