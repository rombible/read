<A NAME="839"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=532><b>tn</b> The noun is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kinnim</font>). The insect has been variously identified as lice, gnats, ticks, flies, fleas, or mosquitoes. &#8220;Lice&#8221; follows the reading in the Peshitta and Targum (and so Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 2.14.3 [2.300]). Greek and Latin had &#8220;gnats.&#8221; By &#8220;gnats&#8221; many commentators mean &#8220;mosquitoes,&#8221; which in and around the water of Egypt were abundant (and the translators of the Greek text were familiar with Egypt). Whatever they were they came from the dust and were troublesome to people and animals. </p>
