<A NAME="820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=513><b>tn</b> The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1512; &#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hitpa</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">er </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alay</font>) is problematic. The verb would be simply translated &#8220;honor yourself&#8221; or &#8220;deck yourself with honor.&#8221; It can be used in the bad sense of self-exaltation. But here it seems to mean &#8220;have the honor or advantage over me&#8221; in choosing when to remove the frogs. The LXX has &#8220;appoint for me.&#8221; Moses is doing more than extending a courtesy to Pharaoh; he is giving him the upper hand in choosing the time. But it is also a test, for if Pharaoh picked the time it would appear less likely that Moses was manipulating things. As U. Cassuto puts it, Moses is saying &#8220;my trust in God is so strong you may have the honor of choosing the time&#8221; (<i>Exodus</i>, 103).</p>
