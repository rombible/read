<A NAME="85"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=498><b>tn</b> The construction here uses the deictic particle and the participle to convey the imminent future: &#8220;I am going to plague/about to plague.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nagaf</font>) means &#8220;to strike, to smite,&#8221; and its related noun means &#8220;a blow, a plague, pestilence&#8221; or the like. For Yahweh to say &#8220;I am about to plague you&#8221; could just as easily mean &#8220;I am about to strike you.&#8221; That is why these &#8220;plagues&#8221; can be described as &#8220;blows&#8221; received from God. </p>
