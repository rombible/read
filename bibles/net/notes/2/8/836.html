<A NAME="836"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=529><b>sn</b> The end of the plague revealed clearly God&#8217;s absolute control over Egypt&#8217;s life and deities &#8211; all at the power of the man who prayed to God. Yahweh had made life unpleasant for the people by sending the plague, but he was also the one who could remove it. The only recourse anyone has in such trouble is to pray to the sovereign Lord God. Everyone should know that there is no one like Yahweh.</p>
