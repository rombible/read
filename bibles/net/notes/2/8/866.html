<A NAME="866"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=559><b>sn</b> U. Cassuto (<i>Exodus</i>, 109) says there are two ways to understand &#8220;the abomination of the Egyptians.&#8221; One is that the sacrifice of the sacred animals would appear an abominable thing in the eyes of the Egyptians, and the other is that the word &#8220;abomination&#8221; could be a derogatory term for idols &#8211; we sacrifice what is an Egyptian idol. So that is why he says if they did this the Egyptians would stone them. </p>
