<A NAME="850"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=543><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1465;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arov</font>) means &#8220;a mix&#8221; or &#8220;swarm.&#8221; It seems that some irritating kind of flying insect is involved. Ps 78:45 says that the Egyptians were eaten or devoured by them. Various suggestions have been made over the years: (1) it could refer to beasts or reptiles; (2) the Greek took it as the dog-fly, a vicious blood-sucking gadfly, more common in the spring than in the fall; (3) the ordinary house fly, which is a symbol of Egypt in Isa 7:18 (Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font>, <font face="Scholar">zÿvuv</font>); and (4) the beetle, which gnaws and bites plants, animals, and materials. The fly probably fits the details of this passage best; the plague would have greatly intensified a problem with flies that already existed.</p>
