<A NAME="844"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=537><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;finger&#8221; is a bold anthropomorphism (a figure of speech in which God is described using human characteristics). </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The point of the magicians&#8217; words is clear enough. They knew they were beaten and by whom. The reason for their choice of the word &#8220;finger&#8221; has occasioned many theories, none of which is entirely satisfying. At the least their statement highlights that the plague was accomplished by God with majestic ease and effortlessness. Perhaps the reason that they could not do this was that it involved producing life &#8211; from the dust of the ground, as in Genesis 2:7. The creative power of God confounded the magic of the Egyptians and brought on them a loathsome plague. </p>
