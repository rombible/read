<A NAME="853"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=546><b>tn</b> The relative clause modifies the land of Goshen as the place &#8220;in which my people are dwelling.&#8221; But the normal word for &#8220;dwelling&#8221; is not used here. Instead, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1465;&#1502;&#1461;&#1491;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">omed</font>) is used, which literally means &#8220;standing.&#8221; The land on which Israel stood was spared the flies and the hail.</p>
