<A NAME="121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=760><b>sn</b> Chapter 12 details the culmination of the ten plagues on Egypt and the beginning of the actual deliverance from bondage. Moreover, the celebration of this festival of Passover was to become a central part of the holy calendar of Israel. The contents of this chapter have significance for NT studies as well, since the Passover was a type of the death of Jesus. The structure of this section before the crossing of the sea is as follows: the institution of the Passover (12:1-28), the night of farewell and departure (12:29-42), slaves and strangers (12:43-51), and the laws of the firstborn (13:1-16). In this immediate section there is the institution of the Passover itself (12:1-13), then the Unleavened Bread (12:14-20), and then the report of the response of the people (12:21-28). </p>

<A NAME="124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=763><b>sn</b> B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 294-95) shows that the intent of the passage was not to make this month in the spring the New Year &#8211; that was in the autumn. Rather, when counting months this was supposed to be remembered first, for it was the great festival of freedom from Egypt. He observes how some scholars have unnecessarily tried to date one New Year earlier than the other.</p>
<A NAME="125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=764><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they will take for them a man a lamb.&#8221; This is clearly a distributive, or individualizing, use of &#8220;man.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=768><b>sn</b> Later Judaism ruled that &#8220;too small&#8221; meant fewer than ten (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 88).</p>
<A NAME="1210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=769><b>tn</b> The clause uses the comparative <i>min</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font>) construction: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1496; &#1492;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1514; &#1502;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1465;&#1514; &#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yim</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">at habbayit mihyot miseh</font>, &#8220;the house is small from being from a lamb,&#8221; or &#8220;too small for a lamb&#8221;). It clearly means that if there were not enough people in the household to have a lamb by themselves, they should join with another family. For the use of the comparative, see GKC 430 §133.<i>c</i>.</p>
<A NAME="1211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=770><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he and his neighbor&#8221;; the referent (the man) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=771><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;who is near to his house.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=772><b>tn</b> The construction uses a perfect tense with a <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive after a conditional clause: &#8220;if the household is too small&#8230;then he and his neighbor will take.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=773><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[every] man according to his eating.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The reference is normally taken to mean whatever each person could eat. B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 299) suggests, however, that the reference may not be to each individual person&#8217;s appetite, but to each family. Each man who is the head of a household was to determine how much his family could eat, and this in turn would determine how many families shared the lamb.</p>
<A NAME="1215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=774><b>tn</b> The construction has: &#8220;[The] lamb&#8230;will be to you.&#8221; This may be interpreted as a possessive use of the <i>lamed</i>, meaning, &#8220;[the] lamb&#8230;you have&#8221; (your lamb) for the Passover. In the context instructing the people to take an animal for this festival, the idea is that the one they select, their animal, must meet these qualifications.</p>
<A NAME="1216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=775><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tamim</font>) means &#8220;perfect&#8221; or &#8220;whole&#8221; or &#8220;complete&#8221; in the sense of not having blemishes and diseases &#8211; no physical defects. The rules for sacrificial animals applied here (see Lev 22:19-21; Deut 17:1).</p>
<A NAME="1217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=776><b>tn</b> The idiom says &#8220;a son of a year&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ben shanah</font>), meaning a &#8220;yearling&#8221; or &#8220;one year old&#8221; (see GKC 418 §128.<i>v</i>).</p>
<A NAME="1218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=777><b>tn</b> Because a choice is being given in this last clause, the imperfect tense nuance of permission should be used. They must have a perfect animal, but it may be a sheep or a goat. The verb&#8217;s object &#8220;it&#8221; is supplied from the context.</p>
<A NAME="1219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=778><b>tn</b> The text has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492; &#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1462;&#1501; &#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿhaya lakem lÿmishmeret</font>, &#8220;and it will be for you for a keeping&#8221;). This noun stresses the activity of watching over or caring for something, probably to keep it in its proper condition for its designated use (see 16:23, 32-34).</p>
<A NAME="1220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=779><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;all the assembly of the community.&#8221; This expression is a pleonasm. The verse means that everyone will kill the lamb, i.e., each family unit among the Israelites will kill its animal.</p>
<A NAME="1221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=780><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;between the two evenings&#8221; or &#8220;between the two settings&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1503; &#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ben ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arbayim</font>). This expression has had a good deal of discussion. (1) <i>Tg. Onq.</i> says &#8220;between the two suns,&#8221; which the Talmud explains as the time between the sunset and the time the stars become visible. More technically, the first &#8220;evening&#8221; would be the time between sunset and the appearance of the crescent moon, and the second &#8220;evening&#8221; the next hour, or from the appearance of the crescent moon to full darkness (see Deut 16:6 &#8211; &#8220;at the going down of the sun&#8221;). (2) Saadia, Rashi, and Kimchi say the first evening is when the sun begins to decline in the west and cast its shadows, and the second evening is the beginning of night. (3) The view adopted by the Pharisees and the Talmudists (<i>b. Pesahim </i>61a) is that the first evening is when the heat of the sun begins to decrease, and the second evening begins at sunset, or, roughly from 3-5 <sc>p.m. The Mishnah (<i>m. Pesahim </i>5:1) indicates the lamb was killed about 2:30 <sc>p.m. &#8211; anything before noon was not valid. S. R. Driver concludes from this survey that the first view is probably the best, although the last view was the traditionally accepted one (<i>Exodus</i>, 89-90). Late afternoon or early evening seems to be intended, the time of twilight perhaps.</p>
<A NAME="1222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=781><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;this night.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=782><b>sn</b> Bread made without yeast could be baked quickly, not requiring time for the use of a leavening ingredient to make the dough rise. In Deut 16:3 the unleavened cakes are called &#8220;the bread of affliction,&#8221; which alludes to the alarm and haste of the Israelites. In later Judaism and in the writings of Paul, leaven came to be a symbol of evil or corruption, and so &#8220;unleavened bread&#8221; &#8211; bread made without yeast &#8211; was interpreted to be a picture of purity or freedom from corruption or defilement (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 90-91).</p>
<A NAME="1224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=783><b>sn</b> This ruling was to prevent their eating it just softened by the fire or partially roasted as differing customs might prescribe or allow.</p>
<A NAME="1225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=784><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your loins girded.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=785><b>tn</b> The meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1505;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pesakh</font>) is debated. (1) Some have tried to connect it to the Hebrew verb with the same radicals that means &#8220;to halt, leap, limp, stumble.&#8221; See 1 Kgs 18:26 where the word describes the priests of Baal hopping around the altar; also the crippled child in 2 Sam 4:4. (2) Others connect it to the Akkadian <i>passahu</i>, which means &#8220;to appease, make soft, placate&#8221;; or (3) an Egyptian word to commemorate the harvest (see J. B. Segal, <i>The Hebrew Passover</i>, 95-100). The verb occurs in Isa 31:5 with the connotation of &#8220;to protect&#8221;; B. S. Childs suggests that this was already influenced by the exodus tradition (<i>Exodus</i> [OTL],<i> </i>183, n. 11). Whatever links there may or may not have been that show an etymology, in Exod 12 it is describing Yahweh&#8217;s passing over or through.</p>
<A NAME="1227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=786><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avarti</font>) is a Qal perfect with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive, announcing the future action of God in bringing judgment on the land. The word means &#8220;pass over, across, through.&#8221; This verb provides a contextual motive for the name &#8220;Passover.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=787><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;this night.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=788><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhah</font>) means &#8220;to strike, smite, attack&#8221;; it does not always mean &#8220;to kill,&#8221; but that is obviously its outcome in this context. This is also its use in 2:12, describing how Moses killed the Egyptian and buried him in the sand.</p>
<A NAME="1230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=789><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from man and to beast.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=790><b>tn</b> The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1506;&#1457;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1464;&#1496;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">e</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eseh shÿfatim</font>) is &#8220;I will do judgments.&#8221; The statement clearly includes what had begun in Exod 6:1. But the statement that God would judge the gods of Egypt is appropriately introduced here (see also Num 33:4) because with the judgment on Pharaoh and the deliverance from bondage, Yahweh would truly show himself to be the one true God. Thus, &#8220;I am Yahweh&#8221; is fitting here (see B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 312).</p>
<A NAME="1232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=791><b>tn</b> Both of the verbs for seeing and passing over are perfect tenses with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutives: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font>&#8230;<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">iti...ufasakhti</font>); the first of these parallel verb forms is subordinated to the second as a temporal clause. See Gesenius&#8217;s description of perfect consecutives in the protasis and apodosis (GKC 494 §159.<i>g</i>).</p>
<A NAME="1233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=792><b>tn</b> The meaning of the verb is supplied in part from the near context of seeing the sign and omitting to destroy, as well as the verb at the start of verse 12 &#8220;pass through, by, over.&#8221; Isa 31:5 says, &#8220;Just as birds hover over a nest, so the <sc>Lord who commands armies will protect Jerusalem. He will protect and deliver it; as he <i>passes over</i> he will rescue it.&#8221; The word does not occur enough times to enable one to delineate a clear meaning. It is probably not the same word as &#8220;to limp&#8221; found in 1 Kgs 18:21, 26, unless there is a highly developed category of meaning there.</p>
<A NAME="1234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=793><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;plague&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1490;&#1462;&#1507;</font>, <font face="Scholar">negef</font>) is literally &#8220;a blow&#8221; or &#8220;a striking.&#8221; It usually describes a calamity or affliction given to those who have aroused God&#8217;s anger, as in Exod 30:12; Num 8:19; 16:46, 47; Josh 22:17 (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 92-93).</p>
<A NAME="1235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=794><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for destruction.&#8221; The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mashkhit</font>) is the Hiphil participle of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shakhat</font>). The word itself is a harsh term; it was used to describe Yahweh&#8217;s destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen 13:10).</p>
<A NAME="1236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=795><b>tn</b> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿhakkoti</font>) is the Hiphil infinitive construct from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhah</font>), with a preposition prefixed and a pronominal suffix added to serve as the subjective genitive &#8211; the subject of this temporal clause. It is also used in 12:12.</p>

The reference is to the fifteenth day of the month, the beginning of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 315) notes that it refers to the death blow on Egypt, but as a remembrance had to be held on the next day, not during the night. He also notes that this was the origin of &#8220;the Day of the <sc>Lord&#8221; (&#8220;the Day of Yahweh&#8221;), which the prophets predicted as the day of the divine battle. On it the enemy would be wiped out. For further information, see B. S. Childs, <i>Memory and Tradition in Israel</i> (SBT). The point of the word &#8220;remember&#8221; in Hebrew is not simply a recollection of an event, but a reliving of it, a reactivating of its significance. In covenant rituals &#8220;remembrance&#8221; or &#8220;memorial&#8221; is designed to prompt God and worshiper alike to act in accordance with the covenant. Jesus brought the motif forward to the new covenant with &#8220;this do in remembrance of me.&#8221;</p>

Here, in sequence to the idea that someone might eat bread made with yeast, the result would be that &#8220;that soul [the verb is feminine] will be cut off.&#8221; The verb is the equivalent of the imperfect tense due to the consecutive; a translation with a nuance of the imperfect of possibility (&#8220;may be cut off&#8221;) fits better perhaps than a specific future. There is the real danger of being cut off, for while the punishment might include excommunication from the community, the greater danger was in the possibility of divine intervention to root out the evildoer (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 94). Gesenius lists this as the use of a perfect with a <i>vav</i> consecutive after a participle (a <i>casus pendens</i>)<i> </i>to introduce the apodosis (GKC 337 §112.<i>mm</i>).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In Lev 20:3, 5-6, God speaks of himself as cutting off a person from among the Israelites.

Estimates of two million people are very large, especially since the Bible says there were seven nations in the land of Canaan mightier than Israel. It is probably not two million people (note, the Bible never said it was &#8211; this is calculated by scholars). But attempts to reduce the number by redefining the word &#8220;thousand&#8221; to mean clan or tribe or family unit have not been convincing, primarily because of all the tabulations of the tribes in the different books of the Bible that have to be likewise reduced. B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 347) rejects the many arguments and calculations as the work of eighteenth century deists and rationalists, arguing that the numbers were taken seriously in the text. Some writers interpret the numbers as inflated due to a rhetorical use of numbers, arriving at a number of 60,000 or so for the men here listed (reducing it by a factor of ten), and insisting this is a literal interpretation of the text as opposed to a spiritual or allegorical approach (see R.

Exodus 6 has Levi &#8211; Kohath &#8211; Amram &#8211; Moses. This would require a period of about 100 years, and that is unusual. There is evidence, however, that the list is selective.

Elishama, a leader of the Ephraimites (Num 10:22), was in the ninth generation from Jacob (1 Chr 7:22-26). Joshua, Moses&#8217; assistant, was the eleventh from Jacob (1 Chr 7:27). So the &#8220;four generations&#8221; leading up to Moses are not necessarily complete. With regard to Exod 6, K. A. Kitchen has argued that the four names do not indicate successive generations, but tribe (Levi), clan (Kohath), family (Amram), and individual (Moses; K. A. Kitchen, <i>Ancient Orient and Old Testament</i>,<i> </i>54-55). For a detailed discussion of the length of the sojourn, see E. H. Merrill, <i>A Kingdom of Priests</i>, 75-79.</p>
<A NAME="12100"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">100</span><note=859><b>sn</b> This military term is used elsewhere in Exodus (e.g., 6:26; 7:4; 12:17, 50), but here the Israelites are called &#8220;the regiments of the Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="12101"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">101</span><note=860><b>tn</b> There is some ambiguity in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1461;&#1497;&#1500; &#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1467;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1500;&#1463;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<i>lel shimmurim hu&#8217; la&#8217;adonay</i> [<i>layhveh</i>]). It is likely that this first clause means that Yahweh was on watch for Israel to bring them out, as the next clause says. He was protecting his people (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 102). Then, the night of vigil will be transferred to Israel, who now must keep it &#8220;to&#8221; him.</p>
<A NAME="12102"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">102</span><note=861><b>tn</b> &#8220;and so&#8221; has been supplied.</p>

<A NAME="12104"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">104</span><note=863><b>sn</b> The section that concludes the chapter contains regulations pertaining to the Passover. The section begins at v. 43, but vv. 40-42 form a good setting for it. In this unit vv. 43-45 belong together because they stress that a stranger and foreigner cannot eat. Verse 46 stands by itself, ruling that the meal must be eaten at home. Verse 47 instructs that the whole nation was to eat it. Verses 48-49 make provision for foreigners who may wish to participate. And vv. 50-51 record the obedience of Israel.</p>
<A NAME="12105"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">105</span><note=864><b>tn</b> This taken in the modal nuance of permission, reading that no foreigner is permitted to share in it (apart from being a member of the household as a circumcised slave [v. 44] or obeying v. 48, if a free individual).</p>
<A NAME="12106"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">106</span><note=865><b>tn</b> This is the partitive use of the <font face="Scholar">bet</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;</font>) preposition, expressing that the action extends to something and includes the idea of participation in it (GKC 380 §119.<i>m</i>).</p>
<A NAME="12107"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">107</span><note=866><b>tn</b> Both the participle &#8220;foreigner&#8221; and the verb &#8220;lives&#8221; are from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (<i>gur</i>), which means &#8220;to sojourn, to dwell as an alien.&#8221; This reference is to a foreigner who settles in the land. He is the protected foreigner; when he comes to another area where he does not have his clan to protect him, he must come under the protection of the Law, or the people. If the &#8220;resident alien&#8221; is circumcised, he may participate in the Passover (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 104).</p>
<A NAME="12108"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">108</span><note=867><b>tn</b> The infinitive absolute functions as the finite verb here, and &#8220;every male&#8221; could be either the object or the subject (see GKC 347 §113.<i>gg</i> and 387 §121.<i>a</i>).</p>
