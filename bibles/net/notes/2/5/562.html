<A NAME="562"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=382><b>sn</b> Now the verb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1461;&#1512;&#1463;&#1506;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hera</font>&#8217;) has a different subject &#8211; Pharaoh. The ultimate cause of the trouble was God, but the immediate cause was Pharaoh and the way he increased the work. Meanwhile, the Israelite foremen have pinned most of the blame on Moses and Aaron. Moses knows all about the sovereignty of God, and as he speaks in God&#8217;s name, he sees the effect it has on pagans like Pharaoh. So the rhetorical questions are designed to prod God to act differently. </p>
