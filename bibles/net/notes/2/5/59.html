<A NAME="59"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=329><b>sn</b> This absolute statement of Pharaoh is part of a motif that will develop throughout the conflict. For Pharaoh, the <sc>Lord (Yahweh) did not exist. So he said &#8220;I do not know the <sc>Lord [i.e., Yahweh].&#8221; The point of the plagues and the exodus will be &#8220;that he might know.&#8221; Pharaoh will come to know this Yahweh, but not in any pleasant way.</p>
