<A NAME="518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=338><b>sn</b> In vv. 6-14 the second section of the chapter describes the severe measures by the king to increase the labor by decreasing the material. The emphasis in this section must be on the harsh treatment of the people and Pharaoh&#8217;s reason for it &#8211; he accuses them of idleness because they want to go and worship. The real reason, of course, is that he wants to discredit Moses (v. 9) and keep the people as slaves. </p>
