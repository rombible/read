<A NAME="557"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=377><b>sn</b> In view of the apparent failure of the mission, Moses seeks Yahweh for assurance. The answer from Yahweh not only assures him that all is well, but that there will be a great deliverance. The passage can be divided into three parts: the complaint of Moses (5:22-23), the promise of Yahweh (6:1-9), and the instructions for Moses (6:10-13). Moses complains because God has not delivered his people as he had said he would, and God answers that he will because he is the sovereign covenant God who keeps his word. Therefore, Moses must keep his commission to speak God&#8217;s word. See further, E. A. Martens, &#8220;Tackling Old Testament Theology,&#8221; <i>JETS</i> 20 (1977): 123-32. The message is very similar to that found in the NT, &#8220;Where is the promise of his coming?&#8221; (2 Pet 3:4). The complaint of Moses (5:22-23) can be worded with Peter&#8217;s &#8220;Where is the promise of his coming?&#8221; theme; the assurance from Yahweh (6:1-9) can be worded with Peter&#8217;s &#8220;The Lord is not slack in keeping his promises&#8221; (2 Pet 3:9); and the third part, the instructions for Moses (6:10-13) can be worded with Peter&#8217;s &#8220;Prepare for the day of God and speed its coming&#8221; (2 Pet 3:12). The people who speak for God must do so in the sure confidence of the coming deliverance &#8211; Moses with the deliverance from the bondage of Egypt, and Christians with the deliverance from this sinful world.</p>
