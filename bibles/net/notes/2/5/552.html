<A NAME="552"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=372><b>tn</b> The foremen vented their anger on Moses and Aaron. The two jussives express their desire that the evil these two have caused be dealt with. &#8220;May Yahweh look on you and may he judge&#8221; could mean only that God should decide if Moses and Aaron are at fault, but given the rest of the comments it is clear the foremen want more. The second jussive could be subordinated to the first &#8211; &#8220;so that he may judge [you].&#8221;</p>
