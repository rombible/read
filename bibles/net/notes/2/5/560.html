<A NAME="560"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=380><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1458;&#1512;&#1461;&#1506;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hare</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">otah</font>), the Hiphil perfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">a</font>&#8217;). The word itself means &#8220;to do evil,&#8221; and in this stem &#8220;to cause evil&#8221; &#8211; but evil in the sense of pain, calamity, trouble, or affliction, and not always in the sense of sin. Certainly not here. That God had allowed Pharaoh to oppose them had brought greater pain to the Israelites.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Moses&#8217; question is rhetorical; the point is more of a complaint or accusation to God, although there is in it the desire to know why. B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 139) comments that such frank words were a sign of the man&#8217;s closeness to God. God never has objected to such bold complaints by the devout. He then notes how God was angered by his defenders in the book of Job rather than by Job&#8217;s heated accusations.</p>
