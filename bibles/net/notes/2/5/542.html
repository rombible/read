<A NAME="542"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=362><b>tn</b> The word rendered &#8220;fault&#8221; is the basic OT verb for &#8220;sin&#8221; &#8211; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1496;&#1464;&#1488;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿkhata</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">t</font>). The problem is that it is pointed as a perfect tense, feminine singular verb. Some other form of the verb would be expected, or a noun. But the basic word-group means &#8220;to err, sin, miss the mark, way, goal.&#8221; The word in this context seems to indicate that the people of Pharaoh &#8211; the slave masters &#8211; have failed to provide the straw. Hence: &#8220;fault&#8221; or &#8220;they failed.&#8221; But, as indicated, the line has difficult grammar, for it would literally translate: &#8220;and you [fem.] sin your people.&#8221; Many commentators (so GKC 206 §74.<i>g</i>) wish to emend the text to read with the Greek and the Syriac, thus: &#8220;you sin against your own people&#8221; (meaning the Israelites are his loyal subjects).</p>
