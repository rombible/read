<A NAME="528"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=348><b>sn</b> The words of Moses are here called &#8220;lying words&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1511;&#1462;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">divre-shaqer</font>).
