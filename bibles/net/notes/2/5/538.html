<A NAME="538"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=358><b>sn</b> The last section of this event tells the effect of the oppression on Israel, first on the people (15-19) and then on Moses and Aaron (20-21). The immediate reaction of Israel was to cry to Pharaoh &#8211; something they would learn should be directed to God.
