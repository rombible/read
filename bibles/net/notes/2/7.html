<A NAME="71"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=434><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;like&#8221; is added for clarity, making explicit the implied comparison in the statement &#8220;I have made you God to Pharaoh.&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohim</font>) is used a few times in the Bible for humans (e.g., Pss 45:6; 82:1), and always clearly in the sense of a subordinate to GOD &#8211; they are his representatives on earth. The explanation here goes back to 4:16. If Moses is like God in that Aaron is his prophet, then Moses is certainly like God to Pharaoh. Only Moses, then, is able to speak to Pharaoh with such authority, giving him commands. </p>
<A NAME="72"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=435><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;&#1462;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nÿvi</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ekha</font>, &#8220;your prophet&#8221;) recalls 4:16. Moses was to be like God to Aaron, and Aaron was to speak for him. This indicates that the idea of a &#8220;prophet&#8221; was of one who spoke for God, an idea with which Moses and Aaron and the readers of Exodus are assumed to be familiar.</p>
<A NAME="73"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=436><b>tn</b> The imperfect tense here should have the nuance of instruction or injunction: &#8220;you are to speak.&#8221; The subject is singular (Moses) and made emphatic by the presence of the personal pronoun &#8220;<i>you</i>.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="74"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=437><b>tn</b> The phrase translated &#8220;everything I command you&#8221; is a noun clause serving as the direct object of the verb &#8220;speak.&#8221; The verb in the clause (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1510;&#1463;&#1493;&#1468;&#1462;&#1498;&#1464;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">atsavvekha</font>) is the Piel imperfect. It could be classified as a future: &#8220;everything that I will command you.&#8221; A nuance of progressive imperfect also fits well: &#8220;everything that I am commanding you.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The distinct emphasis is important. Aaron will speak to the people and Pharaoh what Moses tells him, and Moses will speak to Aaron what God commands him. The use of &#8220;command&#8221; keeps everything in perspective for Moses&#8217; position. </p>
<A NAME="75"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=438><b>tn</b> The form is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿshillakh</font>), a Piel perfect with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive. Following the imperfects of injunction or instruction, this verb continues the sequence. It could be taken as equal to an imperfect expressing future (&#8220;and he will release&#8221;) or subordinate to express purpose (&#8220;to release&#8221; = &#8220;in order that he may release&#8221;). </p>
<A NAME="76"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=439><b>tn</b> The clause begins with the emphatic use of the pronoun and a disjunctive <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) expressing the contrast &#8220;But as for me, I will harden.&#8221; They will speak, but God will harden.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The imperfect tense of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qasha</font>) is found only here in these &#8220;hardening passages.&#8221; The verb (here the Hiphil for &#8220;I will harden&#8221;) summarizes Pharaoh&#8217;s resistance to what God would be doing through Moses &#8211; he would stubbornly resist and refuse to submit; he would be resolved in his opposition. See R. R. Wilson, &#8220;The Hardening of Pharaoh&#8217;s Heart,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 41 (1979): 18-36.</p>
<A NAME="77"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=440><b>tn</b> The form beginning the second half of the verse is the perfect tense with <font face="Scholar">vav </font>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hirbeti</font>). It could be translated as a simple future in sequence after the imperfect preceding it, but the logical connection is not obvious. Since it carries the force of an imperfect due to the sequence, it may be subordinated as a temporal clause to the next clause that begins in v. 4. That maintains the flow of the argument.</p>
<A NAME="78"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=441><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Pharaoh will not listen.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="79"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=442><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;put my hand into.&#8221; The expression is a strong anthropomorphism to depict God&#8217;s severest judgment on Egypt. The point is that neither the speeches of Moses and Aaron nor the signs that God would do will be effective. Consequently, God would deliver the blow that would destroy. </p>
<A NAME="710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=443><b>tn</b> See the note on this term in 6:26.</p>
<A NAME="711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=444><b>tn</b> The emphasis on sequence is clear because the form is the perfect tense with the <i>vav</i> consecutive.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The use of the verb &#8220;to know&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yada</font>&#8217;) underscores what was said with regard to 6:3. By the time the actual exodus took place, the Egyptians would have &#8220;known&#8221; the name Yahweh, probably hearing it more than they wished. But they will know &#8211; experience the truth of it &#8211; when Yahweh defeats them.</p>
<A NAME="712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=445><b>sn</b> This is another anthropomorphism, parallel to the preceding. If God were to &#8220;put&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">natan</font>), &#8220;extend&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nata</font>), or &#8220;reach out&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shalakh</font>) his hand against them, they would be destroyed. Contrast Exod 24:11. </p>

<A NAME="715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=448><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tÿnu</font>), literally &#8220;give.&#8221; The imperative is followed by an ethical dative that strengthens the subject of the imperative: &#8220;<i>you</i> give a miracle.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=449><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and throw it.&#8221; The direct object, &#8220;it,&#8221; is implied.</p>
<A NAME="717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=450><b>tn</b> The form is the jussive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;</font> ( <font face="Scholar">yÿhi</font>). Gesenius notes that frequently in a conditional clause, a sentence with a protasis and apodosis, the jussive will be used. Here it is in the apodosis (GKC 323 §109.<i>h</i>). </p>
<A NAME="718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=451><b>tn</b> The clause begins with the preterite and the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive; it is here subordinated to the next clause as a temporal clause.</p>
<A NAME="719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=452><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Aaron threw.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=453><b>tn</b> The noun used here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tannin</font>), and not the word for &#8220;serpent&#8221; or &#8220;snake&#8221; used in chap. 4. This noun refers to a large reptile, in some texts large river or sea creatures (Gen 1:21; Ps 74:13) or land creatures (Deut 32:33). This wonder paralleled Moses&#8217; miracle in 4:3 when he cast his staff down. But this is Aaron&#8217;s staff, and a different miracle. The noun could still be rendered &#8220;snake&#8221; here since the term could be broad enough to include it.</p>
<A NAME="721"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=454><b>sn</b> For information on this Egyptian material, see D. B. Redford, <i>A Study of the Biblical Story of Joseph</i> (VTSup), 203-4. </p>

<A NAME="723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=456><b>tn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1496;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿlahatehem</font>) means &#8220;by their secret arts&#8221;; it is from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;</font> (<i>lut</i>, &#8220;to enwrap&#8221;). The Greek renders the word &#8220;by their magic&#8221;; <i>Tg. Onq.</i> uses &#8220;murmurings&#8221; and &#8220;whispers,&#8221; and other Jewish sources &#8220;dazzling display&#8221; or &#8220;demons&#8221; (see further B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 253-54). They may have done this by clever tricks, manipulation of the animals, or demonic power. Many have suggested that Aaron and the magicians were familiar with an old trick in which they could temporarily paralyze a serpent and then revive it. But here Aaron&#8217;s snake swallows up their snakes. </p>
<A NAME="724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=457><b>tn</b> The verb is plural, but the subject is singular, &#8220;a man &#8211; his staff.&#8221; This noun can be given a distributive sense: &#8220;each man threw down his staff.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=458><b>tn</b> This phrase translates the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khazaq</font>); see S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 53.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> For more on this subject, see B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 241-49. S. R. Driver (<i>Exodus</i>, 53) notes that when this word (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1511;</font>) is used it indicates a will or attitude that is unyielding and firm, but when <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1461;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kaved</font>) is used, it stresses the will as being slow to move, unimpressionable, slow to be affected. </p>
<A NAME="726"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=459><b>sn</b> With the first plague, or blow on Pharaoh, a new section of the book unfolds. Until now the dominant focus has been on preparing the deliverer for the exodus. From here the account will focus on preparing Pharaoh for it. The theological emphasis for exposition of the entire series of plagues may be: The sovereign Lord is fully able to deliver his people from the oppression of the world so that they may worship and serve him alone. The distinct idea of each plague then will contribute to this main idea. It is clear from the outset that God could have delivered his people simply and suddenly. But he chose to draw out the process with the series of plagues. There appear to be several reasons: First, the plagues are designed to judge Egypt. It is justice for slavery. Second, the plagues are designed to inform Israel and Egypt of the ability of Yahweh. Everyone must know that it is Yahweh doing all these things. The Egyptians must know this before they are destroyed. Third, the plagues are designed to deliver Israel. The first plague is the plague of blood: God has absolute power over the sources of life. Here Yahweh strikes the heart of Egyptian life with death and corruption. The lesson is that God can turn the source of life into the prospect of death. Moreover, the Nile was venerated; so by turning it into death Moses was showing the superiority of Yahweh. </p>

<A NAME="728"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=461><b>tn</b> The Piel infinitive construct <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿshallakh</font>) serves as the direct object of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">me</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">en</font>), telling what Pharaoh refuses (characteristic perfect) to do. The whole clause is an explanation (like a metonymy of effect) of the first clause that states that Pharaoh&#8217;s heart is hard. </p>
<A NAME="729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=462><b>tn</b> The clause begins with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>); here it provides the circumstances for the instruction for Moses &#8211; he is going out to the water so go meet him. A temporal clause translation captures the connection between the clauses.</p>
<A NAME="730"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=463><b>tn</b> The instruction to Moses continues with this perfect tense with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive following the imperative. The verb means &#8220;to take a stand, station oneself.&#8221; It seems that Pharaoh&#8217;s going out to the water was a regular feature of his day and that Moses could be there waiting to meet him.</p>
<A NAME="731"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=464><b>sn</b> The Nile, the source of fertility for the country, was deified by the Egyptians. There were religious festivals held to the god of the Nile, especially when the Nile was flooding. The Talmud suggests that Pharaoh in this passage went out to the Nile to make observations as a magician about its level. Others suggest he went out simply to bathe or to check the water level &#8211; but that would not change the view of the Nile that was prevalent in the land. </p>
<A NAME="732"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=465><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tiqqakh</font>), the Qal imperfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">laqakh</font>), functions here as the imperfect of instruction, or injunction perhaps, given the word order of the clause.</p>
<A NAME="733"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=466><b>tn</b> The final clause begins with the noun and <i>vav</i> disjunctive, which singles this instruction out for special attention &#8211; &#8220;now the staff&#8230;you are to take.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="734"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=467><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1461;&#1488;&#1502;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">le</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">mor</font>) is the Qal infinitive construct with the <i>lamed</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font>) preposition. It is used so often epexegetically that it has achieved idiomatic status &#8211; &#8220;saying&#8221; (if translated at all). But here it would make better sense to take it as a purpose infinitive. God sent him to say these words.</p>
<A NAME="735"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=468><b>tn</b> The imperfect tense with the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1491;&#1467;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">vÿya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avduni</font>) following the imperative is in volitive sequence, showing the purpose &#8211; &#8220;that they may serve me.&#8221; The word &#8220;serve&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1491;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">avad</font>) is a general term to include religious observance and obedience. </p>

It has the idea of responding to, hearkening, and in some places obeying; here &#8220;you have not complied&#8221; might catch the point of what Moses is saying, while &#8220;listen&#8221; helps to maintain the connection with other uses of the verb.</p>

<A NAME="739"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=472><b>sn</b> W. C. Kaiser summarizes a view that has been adopted by many scholars, including a good number of conservatives, that the plagues overlap with natural phenomena in Egypt. Accordingly, the &#8220;blood&#8221; would not be literal blood, but a reddish contamination in the water. If there was an unusually high inundation of the Nile, the water flowed sluggishly through swamps and was joined with the water from the mountains that washed out the reddish soil. If the flood were high, the water would have a deeper red color. In addition to this discoloration, there is said to be a type of algae which produce a stench and a deadly fluctuation of the oxygen level of the river that is fatal to fish (see W. C. Kaiser, Jr., &#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:350; he cites Greta Hort, &#8220;The Plagues of Egypt,&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 69 [1957]: 84-103; same title, <i>ZAW</i> 70 [1958]: 48-59). While most scholars would agree that the water did not actually become blood (any more than the moon will be turned to literal blood [Joel 2:31]), many are not satisfied with this kind of explanation. If the event was a fairly common feature of the Nile, it would not have been any kind of sign to Pharaoh &#8211; and it should still be observable. The features that would have to be safeguarded are that it was understood to be done by the staff of God, that it was unexpected and not a mere coincidence, and that the magnitude of the contamination, color, stench, and death, was unparalleled. God does use natural features in miracles, but to be miraculous signs they cannot simply coincide with natural phenomena.</p>

This construction provides a greater emphasis than an accusative. </p>
<A NAME="749"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=482><b>tn</b> The text could be rendered &#8220;in the sight of,&#8221; or simply &#8220;before,&#8221; but the literal idea of &#8220;before the eyes of&#8221; may stress how obvious the event was and how personally they were witnesses of it.</p>
<A NAME="750"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=483><b>sn</b> U. Cassuto (<i>Exodus</i>, 98) notes that the striking of the water was not a magical act. It signified two things: (1) the beginning of the sign, which was in accordance with God&#8217;s will, as Moses had previously announced, and (2) to symbolize actual &#8220;striking,&#8221; wherewith the Lord strikes Egypt and its gods (see v. 25).</p>
<A NAME="751"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=484><b>sn</b> There have been various attempts to explain the details of this plague or blow. One possible suggestion is that the plague turned the Nile into &#8220;blood,&#8221; but that it gradually turned back to its normal color and substance. However, the effects of the &#8220;blood&#8221; polluted the water so that dead fish and other contamination left it undrinkable. This would explain how the magicians could also do it &#8211; they would not have tried if all water was already turned to blood. It also explains why Pharaoh did not ask for the water to be turned back. This view was put forward by B. Schor; it is summarized by B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>,<i> </i>258), who prefers the view of Rashi that the blow affected only water in use.</p>
<A NAME="752"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=485><b>tn</b> The first clause in this verse begins with a <i>vav</i> disjunctive, introducing a circumstantial clause to the statement that the water stank. The <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive on the next verb shows that the smell was the result of the dead fish in the contaminated water. The result is then expressed with the <i>vav</i> beginning the clause that states that they could not drink it.</p>
<A NAME="753"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=486><b>tn</b> The preterite could be given a simple definite past translation, but an ingressive past would be more likely, as the smell would get worse and worse with the dead fish.</p>

<A NAME="756"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=489><b>tn</b> The <i>vav</i> consecutive on the preterite introduces the outcome or result of the matter &#8211; Pharaoh was hardened.</p>
<A NAME="757"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=490><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the heart of Pharaoh became hard.&#8221; This phrase translates the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khazaq</font>; see S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 53). In context this represents the continuation of a prior condition.</p>
<A NAME="758"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=491><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to them&#8221;; the referents (Moses and Aaron) have been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="759"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=492><b>tn</b> The text has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1514; &#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465; &#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1501;&#1470;&#1500;&#1464;&#1494;&#1465;&#1488;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿlo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">-shat libbo gam-lazo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">t</font>), which literally says, &#8220;and he did not set his heart also to this.&#8221; To &#8220;set the heart&#8221; to something would mean &#8220;to consider it.&#8221; This Hebrew idiom means that he did not pay attention to it, or take it to heart (cf. 2 Sam 13:20; Ps 48:13; 62:10; Prov 22:17; 24:32). Since Pharaoh had not been affected by this, he did not consider it or its implications further. </p>
<A NAME="760"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=493><b>sn</b> The text stresses that the water in the Nile, and Nile water that had been diverted or collected for use, was polluted and undrinkable. Water underground also was from the Nile, but it had not been contaminated, certainly not with dead fish, and so would be drinkable. </p>
