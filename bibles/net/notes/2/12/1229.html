<A NAME="1229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=788><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhah</font>) means &#8220;to strike, smite, attack&#8221;; it does not always mean &#8220;to kill,&#8221; but that is obviously its outcome in this context. This is also its use in 2:12, describing how Moses killed the Egyptian and buried him in the sand.</p>
