<A NAME="1291"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">91</span><note=850><b>sn</b> The wilderness itinerary begins here. W. C. Kaiser records the identification of these two places as follows: The name <i>Rameses</i> probably refers to Qantir rather than Tanis, which is more remote, because Qantir was by the water; <i>Sukkoth</i> is identified as Tell el Maskhuta in the Wadi Tumilat near modern Ismailia &#8211; or the region around the city (&#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:379). Of the extensive bibliography, see G. W. Coats, &#8220;The Wilderness Itinerary,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 34 (1972): 135-52; G. I. Davies, &#8220;The Wilderness Itineraries: A Comparative Study,&#8221; <i>TynBul</i> 25 (1974): 46-81; and J. T. Walsh, &#8220;From Egypt to Moab. A Source Critical Analysis of the Wilderness Itinerary,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 39 (1977): 20-33.</p>
