<A NAME="1268"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=827><b>sn</b> This expression &#8220;the sacrifice of Yahweh&#8217;s Passover&#8221; occurs only here. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1462;&#1489;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zevakh</font>) means &#8220;slaughtering&#8221; and so a blood sacrifice. The fact that this word is used in Lev 3 for the peace offering has linked the Passover as a kind of peace offering, and both the Passover and the peace offerings were eaten as communal meals.</p>
