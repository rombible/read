<A NAME="1249"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=808><b><i>tn</i></b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all/every work will not be done.&#8221; The word refers primarily to the work of one&#8217;s occupation. B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 322) explains that since this comes prior to the fuller description of laws for Sabbaths and festivals, the passage simply restricts all work except for the preparation of food. Once the laws are added, this qualification is no longer needed. Gesenius translates this as &#8220;no manner of work shall be done&#8221; (GKC 478-79 §152.<i>b</i>).</p>
