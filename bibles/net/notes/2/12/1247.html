<A NAME="1247"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=806><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿnikhrÿtah</font>) is the Niphal perfect with the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive; it is a common formula in the Law for divine punishment. Here, in sequence to the idea that someone might eat bread made with yeast, the result would be that &#8220;that soul [the verb is feminine] will be cut off.&#8221; The verb is the equivalent of the imperfect tense due to the consecutive; a translation with a nuance of the imperfect of possibility (&#8220;may be cut off&#8221;) fits better perhaps than a specific future. There is the real danger of being cut off, for while the punishment might include excommunication from the community, the greater danger was in the possibility of divine intervention to root out the evildoer (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 94). Gesenius lists this as the use of a perfect with a <i>vav</i> consecutive after a participle (a <i>casus pendens</i>)<i> </i>to introduce the apodosis (GKC 337 §112.<i>mm</i>).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In Lev 20:3, 5-6, God speaks of himself as cutting off a person from among the Israelites. The rabbis mentioned premature death and childlessness as possible judgments in such cases, and N. M. Sarna comments that &#8220;one who deliberately excludes himself from the religious community of Israel cannot be a beneficiary of the covenantal blessings&#8221; (<i>Exodus </i>[JPSTC],<i> </i>58).</p>
