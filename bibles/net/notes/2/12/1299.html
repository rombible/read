<A NAME="1299"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">99</span><note=858><b>sn</b> Here as well some scholars work with the number 430 to try to reduce the stay in Egypt for the bondage. Some argue that if the number included the time in Canaan, that would reduce the bondage by half. S. R. Driver (<i>Exodus</i>, 102) notes that P thought Moses was the fourth generation from Jacob (6:16-27), if those genealogies are not selective. Exodus 6 has Levi &#8211; Kohath &#8211; Amram &#8211; Moses. This would require a period of about 100 years, and that is unusual. There is evidence, however, that the list is selective. In 1 Chr 2:3-20 the text has Bezalel (see Exod 31:2-5) a contemporary of Moses and yet the seventh from Judah. Elishama, a leader of the Ephraimites (Num 10:22), was in the ninth generation from Jacob (1 Chr 7:22-26). Joshua, Moses&#8217; assistant, was the eleventh from Jacob (1 Chr 7:27). So the &#8220;four generations&#8221; leading up to Moses are not necessarily complete. With regard to Exod 6, K. A. Kitchen has argued that the four names do not indicate successive generations, but tribe (Levi), clan (Kohath), family (Amram), and individual (Moses; K. A. Kitchen, <i>Ancient Orient and Old Testament</i>,<i> </i>54-55). For a detailed discussion of the length of the sojourn, see E. H. Merrill, <i>A Kingdom of Priests</i>, 75-79.</p>
