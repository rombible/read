<A NAME="1221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=780><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;between the two evenings&#8221; or &#8220;between the two settings&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1503; &#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ben ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arbayim</font>). This expression has had a good deal of discussion. (1) <i>Tg. Onq.</i> says &#8220;between the two suns,&#8221; which the Talmud explains as the time between the sunset and the time the stars become visible. More technically, the first &#8220;evening&#8221; would be the time between sunset and the appearance of the crescent moon, and the second &#8220;evening&#8221; the next hour, or from the appearance of the crescent moon to full darkness (see Deut 16:6 &#8211; &#8220;at the going down of the sun&#8221;). (2) Saadia, Rashi, and Kimchi say the first evening is when the sun begins to decline in the west and cast its shadows, and the second evening is the beginning of night. (3) The view adopted by the Pharisees and the Talmudists (<i>b. Pesahim </i>61a) is that the first evening is when the heat of the sun begins to decrease, and the second evening begins at sunset, or, roughly from 3-5 <sc>p.m. The Mishnah (<i>m. Pesahim </i>5:1) indicates the lamb was killed about 2:30 <sc>p.m. &#8211; anything before noon was not valid. S. R. Driver concludes from this survey that the first view is probably the best, although the last view was the traditionally accepted one (<i>Exodus</i>, 89-90). Late afternoon or early evening seems to be intended, the time of twilight perhaps.</p>
