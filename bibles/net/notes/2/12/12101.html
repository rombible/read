<A NAME="12101"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">101</span><note=860><b>tn</b> There is some ambiguity in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1461;&#1497;&#1500; &#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1467;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1500;&#1463;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<i>lel shimmurim hu&#8217; la&#8217;adonay</i> [<i>layhveh</i>]). It is likely that this first clause means that Yahweh was on watch for Israel to bring them out, as the next clause says. He was protecting his people (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 102). Then, the night of vigil will be transferred to Israel, who now must keep it &#8220;to&#8221; him.</p>
