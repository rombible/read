<A NAME="1239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=798><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;will be for a memorial&#8221; means &#8220;will become a memorial.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The instruction for the unleavened bread (vv. 14-20) begins with the introduction of the <font face="Scholar">memorial</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> [<font face="Scholar">zikkaron</font>] from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1512;</font> [<font face="Scholar">zakhar</font>]). The reference is to the fifteenth day of the month, the beginning of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 315) notes that it refers to the death blow on Egypt, but as a remembrance had to be held on the next day, not during the night. He also notes that this was the origin of &#8220;the Day of the <sc>Lord&#8221; (&#8220;the Day of Yahweh&#8221;), which the prophets predicted as the day of the divine battle. On it the enemy would be wiped out. For further information, see B. S. Childs, <i>Memory and Tradition in Israel</i> (SBT). The point of the word &#8220;remember&#8221; in Hebrew is not simply a recollection of an event, but a reliving of it, a reactivating of its significance. In covenant rituals &#8220;remembrance&#8221; or &#8220;memorial&#8221; is designed to prompt God and worshiper alike to act in accordance with the covenant. Jesus brought the motif forward to the new covenant with &#8220;this do in remembrance of me.&#8221;</p>
