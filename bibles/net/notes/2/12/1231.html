<A NAME="1231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=790><b>tn</b> The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1506;&#1457;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1464;&#1496;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">e</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eseh shÿfatim</font>) is &#8220;I will do judgments.&#8221; The statement clearly includes what had begun in Exod 6:1. But the statement that God would judge the gods of Egypt is appropriately introduced here (see also Num 33:4) because with the judgment on Pharaoh and the deliverance from bondage, Yahweh would truly show himself to be the one true God. Thus, &#8220;I am Yahweh&#8221; is fitting here (see B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 312).</p>
