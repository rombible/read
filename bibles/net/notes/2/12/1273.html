<A NAME="1273"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=832><b>tn</b> The verse begins with the temporal indicator <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayÿhi</font>), often translated &#8220;and it came to pass.&#8221; Here it could be left untranslated: &#8220;In the middle of the night Yahweh attacked.&#8221; The word order of the next and main clause furthers the emphasis by means of the <i>vav</i> disjunctive on the divine name preceding the verb. The combination of these initial and disjunctive elements helps to convey the suddenness of the attack, while its thoroughness is stressed by the repetition of &#8220;firstborn&#8221; in the rest of the verse, the merism (&#8220;from the firstborn of Pharaoh&#8230;to the firstborn of the captive&#8221;), and the mention of cattle.</p>
