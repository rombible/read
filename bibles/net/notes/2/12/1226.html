<A NAME="1226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=785><b>tn</b> The meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1505;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pesakh</font>) is debated. (1) Some have tried to connect it to the Hebrew verb with the same radicals that means &#8220;to halt, leap, limp, stumble.&#8221; See 1 Kgs 18:26 where the word describes the priests of Baal hopping around the altar; also the crippled child in 2 Sam 4:4. (2) Others connect it to the Akkadian <i>passahu</i>, which means &#8220;to appease, make soft, placate&#8221;; or (3) an Egyptian word to commemorate the harvest (see J. B. Segal, <i>The Hebrew Passover</i>, 95-100). The verb occurs in Isa 31:5 with the connotation of &#8220;to protect&#8221;; B. S. Childs suggests that this was already influenced by the exodus tradition (<i>Exodus</i> [OTL],<i> </i>183, n. 11). Whatever links there may or may not have been that show an etymology, in Exod 12 it is describing Yahweh&#8217;s passing over or through.</p>
