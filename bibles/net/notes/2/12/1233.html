<A NAME="1233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=792><b>tn</b> The meaning of the verb is supplied in part from the near context of seeing the sign and omitting to destroy, as well as the verb at the start of verse 12 &#8220;pass through, by, over.&#8221; Isa 31:5 says, &#8220;Just as birds hover over a nest, so the <sc>Lord who commands armies will protect Jerusalem. He will protect and deliver it; as he <i>passes over</i> he will rescue it.&#8221; The word does not occur enough times to enable one to delineate a clear meaning. It is probably not the same word as &#8220;to limp&#8221; found in 1 Kgs 18:21, 26, unless there is a highly developed category of meaning there.</p>
