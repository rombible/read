<A NAME="1288"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">88</span><note=847><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyash</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ilum</font>) is a Hiphil form that has the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>), used earlier in Qal with the meaning &#8220;requested&#8221; (12:35). The verb here is frequently translated &#8220;and they lent them,&#8221; but lending does not fit the point. What they gave the Israelites were farewell gifts sought by demanding or asking for them. This may exemplify a &#8220;permissive&#8221; use of the Hiphil stem, in which &#8220;the Hiphil designates an action that is agreeable to the object and allowed by the subject&#8221; (B. T. Arnold and J. H. Choi, <i>A Guide to Biblical Hebrew Syntax</i>,<i> </i>52).</p>
