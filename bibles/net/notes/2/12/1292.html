Estimates of two million people are very large, especially since the Bible says there were seven nations in the land of Canaan mightier than Israel. It is probably not two million people (note, the Bible never said it was &#8211; this is calculated by scholars). But attempts to reduce the number by redefining the word &#8220;thousand&#8221; to mean clan or tribe or family unit have not been convincing, primarily because of all the tabulations of the tribes in the different books of the Bible that have to be likewise reduced. B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 347) rejects the many arguments and calculations as the work of eighteenth century deists and rationalists, arguing that the numbers were taken seriously in the text. Some writers interpret the numbers as inflated due to a rhetorical use of numbers, arriving at a number of 60,000 or so for the men here listed (reducing it by a factor of ten), and insisting this is a literal interpretation of the text as opposed to a spiritual or allegorical approach (see R. Allen, &#8220;Numbers,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:686-96; see also G. Mendenhall, &#8220;The Census Lists of Numbers 1 and 26,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 77 [1958]: 52-66). This proposal removes the &#8220;embarrassingly&#8221; large number for the exodus, but like other suggestions, lacks completely compelling evidence. For a more extensive discussion of the large numbers used to describe the Israelites in their wilderness experience, see the note on &#8220;46,500&#8221; in Num 1:21.</p>
