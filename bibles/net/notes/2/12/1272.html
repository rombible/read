<A NAME="1272"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=831><b>sn</b> The next section records the deliverance of Israel from Egypt, and so becomes the turning point of the book. Verses 28 and 29 could be included in the exposition of the previous section as the culmination of that part. The message might highlight God&#8217;s requirement for deliverance from bondage through the application of the blood of the sacrifice, God&#8217;s instruction for the memorial of deliverance through the purging of corruption, and the compliance of those who believed the message.
