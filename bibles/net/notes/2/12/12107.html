<A NAME="12107"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">107</span><note=866><b>tn</b> Both the participle &#8220;foreigner&#8221; and the verb &#8220;lives&#8221; are from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (<i>gur</i>), which means &#8220;to sojourn, to dwell as an alien.&#8221; This reference is to a foreigner who settles in the land. He is the protected foreigner; when he comes to another area where he does not have his clan to protect him, he must come under the protection of the Law, or the people. If the &#8220;resident alien&#8221; is circumcised, he may participate in the Passover (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 104).</p>
