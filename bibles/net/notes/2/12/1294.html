<A NAME="1294"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">94</span><note=853><b>tn</b> The &#8220;mixed multitude&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489; &#1512;&#1463;&#1489;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">erev rav</font>) refers to a great &#8220;swarm&#8221; (see a possible cognate in 8:21[17]) of folk who joined the Israelites, people who were impressed by the defeat of Egypt, who came to faith, or who just wanted to escape Egypt (maybe slaves or descendants of the Hyksos). The expression prepares for later references to riffraff who came along.</p>
