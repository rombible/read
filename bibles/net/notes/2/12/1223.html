<A NAME="1223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=782><b>sn</b> Bread made without yeast could be baked quickly, not requiring time for the use of a leavening ingredient to make the dough rise. In Deut 16:3 the unleavened cakes are called &#8220;the bread of affliction,&#8221; which alludes to the alarm and haste of the Israelites. In later Judaism and in the writings of Paul, leaven came to be a symbol of evil or corruption, and so &#8220;unleavened bread&#8221; &#8211; bread made without yeast &#8211; was interpreted to be a picture of purity or freedom from corruption or defilement (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 90-91).</p>
