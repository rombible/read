<A NAME="301"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1985><b>sn</b> Why this section has been held until now is a mystery. One would have expected to find it with the instructions for the other furnishings. The widespread contemporary view that it was composed later does not answer the question, it merely moves the issue to the work of an editor rather than the author. N. M. Sarna notes concerning the items in chapter 30 that &#8220;all the materials for these final items were anticipated in the list of invited donations in 25:3-6&#8221; and that they were not needed for installing Aaron and his sons (<i>Exodus</i> [JPSTC],<i> </i>193). Verses 1-10 can be divided into three sections: the instructions for building the incense altar (1-5), its placement (6), and its proper use (7-10).</p>
<A NAME="302"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1986><b>tn</b> The expression is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1494;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1495;&#1463; &#1502;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1496;&#1463;&#1512; &#1511;&#1456;&#1496;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mizbeakh miqtar qÿtoret</font>), either &#8220;an altar, namely an altar of incense,&#8221; or &#8220;an altar, [for] burning incense.&#8221; The second noun is &#8220;altar of incense,&#8221; although some suggest it is an active noun meaning &#8220;burning.&#8221; If the former, then it is in apposition to the word for &#8220;altar&#8221; (which is not in construct). The last noun is &#8220;incense&#8221; or &#8220;sweet smoke.&#8221; It either qualifies the &#8220;altar of incense&#8221; or serves as the object of the active noun. B. Jacob says that in order to designate that this altar be used only for incense, the Torah prepared the second word for this passage alone. It specifies the kind of altar this is (<i>Exodus</i>, 828).</p>

<A NAME="3011"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1995><b>sn</b> Since it was a small altar, it needed only two rings, one on either side, in order to be carried. The second clause clarifies that the rings should be on the sides, the right and the left, as you approach the altar.</p>
<A NAME="3012"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1996><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And it&#8221;; this refers to the rings collectively in their placement on the box, and so the word &#8220;rings&#8221; has been used to clarify the referent for the modern reader.</p>

<A NAME="3014"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1998><b>tn</b> The text uses a cognate accusative (&#8220;incense&#8221;) with the verb &#8220;to burn&#8221; or &#8220;to make into incense/sweet smoke.&#8221; Then, the noun &#8220;sweet spices&#8221; is added in apposition to clarify the incense as sweet.</p>
<A NAME="3015"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1999><b>tn</b> The Hebrew is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1461;&#1497;&#1496;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿhetivo</font>), a Hiphil infinitive construct serving in a temporal clause. The Hebrew verb means &#8220;to make good&#8221; and so in this context &#8220;to fix&#8221; or &#8220;to dress.&#8221; This refers to cleansing and trimming the lamps. </p>
<A NAME="3016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2000><b>sn</b> The point of the little golden altar of incense is normally for intercessory prayer, and then at the Day of Atonement for blood applied atonement. The instructions for making it show that God wanted his people to make a place for prayer. The instructions for its use show that God expects that the requests of his people will be pleasing to him. </p>
<A NAME="3017"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2001><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;atonements&#8221; (plural in Hebrew) is a genitive showing the result or product of the sacrifice made. </p>
<A NAME="3018"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2002><b>sn</b> This ruling presupposes that the instruction for the Day of Atonement has been given, or at the very least, is to be given shortly. That is the one day of the year that all sin and all ritual impurity would be removed. </p>
<A NAME="3019"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2003><b>sn</b> The phrase &#8220;most holy to the <sc>Lord&#8221; means that the altar cannot be used for any other purpose than what is stated here. </p>
<A NAME="3020"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2004><b>sn</b> This brief section has been interpreted a number of ways by biblical scholars (for a good survey and discussion, see B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 829-35). In this context the danger of erecting and caring for a sanctuary may have been in view. A census would be taken to count the losses and to cover the danger of coming into such proximity with the holy place; payment was made to ransom the lives of the people numbered so that they would not die. The money collected would then be used for the care of the sanctuary. The principle was fairly straightforward: Those numbered among the redeemed of the <sc>Lord were to support the work of the <sc>Lord to maintain their fellowship with the covenant. The passage is fairly easy to outline: I. Every covenant member must give a ransom for his life to avoid death (11-12); II. The ransom is the same for all, whether rich or poor (13-15); and III. The ransom money supports the sanctuary as a memorial for the ransomed (16).</p>
<A NAME="3021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2005><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying.&#8221; This full means for introducing a quotation from the Lord is used again in 30:17, 22; 31:1; and 40:1. It appears first in 6:10. Cynthia L. Miller discusses its use in detail (<i>The Representation of Speech in Biblical Hebrew Narrative</i>,<i> </i>373-86).</p>
<A NAME="3022"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2006><b>tn</b> The expression is &#8220;when you take [lift up] the sum [head] of the Israelites.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="3023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2007><b>tn</b> The form is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1511;&#1467;&#1491;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lifqudehem</font>, &#8220;according to those that are numbered of/by them&#8221;) from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">paqad</font>, &#8220;to visit&#8221;). But the idea of this word seems more to be that of changing or determining the destiny, and so &#8220;appoint&#8221; and &#8220;number&#8221; become clear categories of meaning for the word. Here it simply refers to the census, but when this word is used for a census it often involves mustering an army for a military purpose. Here there is no indication of a war, but it may be laying down the principle that when they should do this, here is the price. B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 835) uses Num 31 as a good illustration, showing that the warrior was essentially a murderer, if he killed anyone in battle. For this reason his blood was forfeit; if he survived he must pay a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1508;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kofer</font>) because every human life possesses value and must be atoned for. The payment during the census represented a &#8220;presumptive ransom&#8221; so that they could not be faulted for what they might do in war. </p>
<A NAME="3024"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2008><b>tn</b> The &#8220;ransom&#8221; is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1508;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kofer</font>), a word related to words translated &#8220;atone&#8221; and &#8220;atonement.&#8221; Here the noun refers to what is paid for the life. The idea is that of delivering or redeeming by a substitute &#8211; here the substitute is the money. If they paid the amount, their lives would be safe (W. C. Kaiser, Jr., &#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:473).</p>
<A NAME="3025"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2009><b>tn</b> The temporal clause uses a preposition, an infinitive construct, and then an accusative. The subject is supplied: &#8220;in numbering them&#8221; means &#8220;when [you] number them.&#8221; The verb could also be rendered &#8220;when you muster them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3026"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2010><b>sn</b> Each man was to pass in front of the counting officer and join those already counted on the other side. </p>
<A NAME="3027"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2011><b>sn</b> The half shekel weight of silver would be about one-fifth of an ounce (6 grams). </p>
<A NAME="3028"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2012><b>sn</b> It appears that some standard is in view for the amount of a shekel weight. The sanctuary shekel is sometimes considered to be twice the value of the ordinary shekel. The &#8220;gerah,&#8221; also of uncertain meaning, was mentioned as a reference point for the ancient reader to understand the value of the required payment. It may also be that the expression meant &#8220;a sacred shekel&#8221; and looked at the purpose more &#8211; a shekel for sanctuary dues. This would mean that the standard of the shekel weight was set because it was the traditional amount of sacred dues (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 333). &#8220;Though there is no certainty, the shekel is said to weigh about 11,5 grams&#8230;Whether an official standard is meant [by &#8216;sanctuary shekel&#8217;] or whether the sanctuary shekel had a different weight than the &#8216;ordinary&#8217; shekel is not known&#8221; (C. Houtman, <i>Exodus</i>,<i> </i>3:181).</p>
<A NAME="3029"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2013><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;contribution&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tÿrumah</font>). </p>

The infinitive here is explaining the preceding verbs. They are not to increase or diminish the amount &#8220;in paying the offering.&#8221; The construction approximates a temporal clause.</p>
<A NAME="3032"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2016><b>tn</b> This infinitive construct (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">lÿkhapper</font>) provides the purpose of the giving the offering &#8211; to atone. </p>

<A NAME="3034"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2018><b>sn</b> The idea of &#8220;service&#8221; is maintenance and care of the sanctuary and its service, meaning the morning and evening sacrifices and the other elements to be used. </p>
<A NAME="3035"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2019><b>sn</b> S. R. Driver says this is &#8220;to keep Jehovah in continual remembrance of the ransom which had been paid for their lives&#8221; (<i>Exodus</i>, 334). </p>
<A NAME="3036"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2020><b>tn</b> The infinitive could be taken in a couple of ways here. It could be an epexegetical infinitive: &#8220;making atonement.&#8221; Or it could be the infinitive expressing result: &#8220;so that atonement will be made for your lives.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="3037"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2021><b>sn</b> Another piece of furniture is now introduced, the laver, or washing basin. It was a round (the root means to be round) basin for holding water, but it had to be up on a pedestal or base to let water run out (through taps of some kind) for the priests to wash &#8211; they could not simply dip dirty hands into the basin. This was for the priests primarily to wash their hands and feet before entering the tent. It stood in the courtyard between the altar and the tent. No dimensions are given. The passage can be divided into three sections: the instructions (17-18), the rules for washing (19-20), and the reminder that this is a perpetual statute.</p>
<A NAME="3038"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2022><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="3043"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2027><b>tn</b> The form is an infinitive construct with the temporal preposition <font face="Scholar">bet</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;</font>), and a suffixed subjective genitive: &#8220;in their going in,&#8221; or, whenever they enter.</p>
<A NAME="3044"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=2028><b>tn</b> &#8220;Water&#8221; is an adverbial accusative of means, and so is translated &#8220;with water.&#8221; Gesenius classifies this with verbs of &#8220;covering <i>with</i> something.&#8221; But he prefers to emend the text with a preposition (see GKC 369 §117.<i>y</i>, n. 1).</p>
<A NAME="3045"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=2029><b>tn</b> The verb is a Qal imperfect with a nuance of final imperfect. The purpose/result clause here is indicated only with the conjunction: &#8220;and they do not die.&#8221; But clearly from the context this is the intended result of their washing &#8211; it is in order that they not die.</p>
<A NAME="3046"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=2030><b>tn</b> Here, too, the infinitive is used in a temporal clause construction. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nagash</font>) is the common verb used for drawing near to the altar to make offerings &#8211; the official duties of the priest.</p>
<A NAME="3047"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=2031><b>tn</b> The text uses two infinitives construct: &#8220;to minister to burn incense&#8221;; the first is the general term and expresses the purpose of the drawing near, and the second infinitive is epexegetical, explaining the first infinitive.</p>
<A NAME="3048"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=2032><b>tn</b> The translation &#8220;as an offering made by fire&#8221; is a standard rendering of the one word in the text that appears to refer to &#8220;fire.&#8221; Milgrom and others contend that it simply means a &#8220;gift&#8221; (<i>Leviticus 1-16</i>, 161).</p>

This was a practical matter of cleaning hands and feet, but it was also symbolic of purification before Yahweh. It was an outward sign of inner spiritual cleansing, or forgiveness. Jesus washed the disciples feet (Jn 13) to show this same teaching; he asked the disciples if they knew what he had done (so it was more than washing feet). In this passage the theological points for the outline would be these: I. God provides the means of cleansing; II. Cleansing is a prerequisite for participating in the worship, and III. (Believers) priests must regularly appropriate God&#8217;s provision of cleansing.</p>
<A NAME="3053"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=2037><b>sn</b> The chapter ends with these two sections. The oil (22-33) is the mark of consecration, and the incense (34-38) is a mark of pleasing service, especially in prayer. So the essence of the message of the chapter is that the servants of God must be set apart by the Spirit for ministry and must be pleasing to God in the ministry. </p>
