<A NAME="321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2091><b>sn</b> This narrative is an unhappy interlude in the flow of the argument of the book. After the giving of the Law and the instructions for the tabernacle, the people get into idolatry. So this section tells what the people were doing when Moses was on the mountain. Here is an instant violation of the covenant that they had just agreed to uphold. But through it all Moses shines as the great intercessor for the people. So the subject matter is the sin of idolatry, its effects and its remedy. Because of the similarities to Jeroboam&#8217;s setting up the calves in Dan and Bethel, modern critics have often said this passage was written at that time. U. Cassuto shows how the language of this chapter would not fit an Iron Age setting in Dan. Rather, he argues, this story was well enough known for Jeroboam to imitate the practice (<i>Exodus</i>, 407-10). This chapter can be divided into four parts for an easier exposition: idolatry (32:1-6), intercession (32:7-14), judgment (32:15-29), intercession again (32:30-33:6). Of course, these sections are far more complex than this, but this gives an overview. Four summary statements for expository points might be: I. Impatience often leads to foolish violations of the faith, II. Violations of the covenant require intercession to escape condemnation, III. Those spared of divine wrath must purge evil from their midst, and IV. Those who purge evil from their midst will find reinstatement through intercession. Several important studies are available for this. See, among others, D. R. Davis, &#8220;Rebellion, Presence, and Covenant: A Study in Exodus 32-34,&#8221; <i>WTJ</i> 44 (1982): 71-87; M. Greenberg, &#8220;Moses&#8217; Intercessory Prayer,&#8221; <i>Ecumenical Institute for Advanced Theological Studies </i>(1978): 21-35; R. A. Hamer, &#8220;The New Covenant of Moses,&#8221; <i>Judaism</i> 27 (1978): 345-50; R. L. Honeycutt, Jr., &#8220;Aaron, the Priesthood, and the Golden Calf,&#8221; <i>RevExp</i> 74 (1977): 523-35; J. N. Oswalt, &#8220;The Golden Calves and the Egyptian Concept of Deity,&#8221; <i>EvQ</i> 45 (1973): 13-20.</p>
<A NAME="322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2092><b>tn</b> The meaning of this verb is properly &#8220;caused shame,&#8221; meaning cause disappointment because he was not coming back (see also Judg 5:28 for the delay of Sisera&#8217;s chariots [S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 349]).</p>
<A NAME="323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2093><b>tn</b> The infinitive construct with the <font face="Scholar">lamed</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font>) preposition is used here epexegetically, explaining the delay of Moses.</p>
<A NAME="324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2094><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the people.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2095><b>tn</b> The imperative means &#8220;arise.&#8221; It could be serving here as an interjection, getting Aaron&#8217;s attention. But it might also have the force of prompting him to get busy.</p>
<A NAME="326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2096><b>tn</b> The plural translation is required here (although the form itself could be singular in meaning) because the verb that follows in the relative clause is a plural verb &#8211; that they go before us).</p>
<A NAME="327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2097><b>tn</b> The text has &#8220;this Moses.&#8221; But this instance may find the demonstrative used in an earlier deictic sense, especially since there is no article with it.</p>
<A NAME="328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2098><b>tn</b> The interrogative is used in an indirect question (see GKC 443-44 §137.<i>c</i>).</p>
<A NAME="329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2099><b>sn</b> B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 937-38) argues that Aaron simply did not have the resolution that Moses did, and wanting to keep peace he gave in to the crowd. He also tries to explain that Aaron was wanting to show their folly through the deed. U. Cassuto also says that Aaron&#8217;s request for the gold was a form of procrastination, but that the people quickly did it and so he had no alternative but to go through with it (<i>Exodus</i>, 412). These may be right, since Aaron fully understood what was wrong with this, and what the program was all about. The text gives no strong indication to support these ideas, but there are enough hints from the way Aaron does things to warrant such a conclusion. </p>
<A NAME="3210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2100><b>tn</b> This &#8220;all&#8221; is a natural hyperbole in the narrative, for it means the large majority of the people.</p>
<A NAME="3211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2101><b>tn</b> Here &#8220;the gold&#8221; has been supplied.</p>
<A NAME="3212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2102><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from their hand.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2103><b>tn</b> The verb looks similar to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatsar</font>), &#8220;to form, fashion&#8221; by a plan or a design. That is the verb used in Gen 2:7 for Yahweh God forming the man from the dust of the ground. If it is here, it is the reverse, a human &#8211; the dust of the ground &#8211; trying to form a god or gods. The active participle of this verb in Hebrew is &#8220;the potter.&#8221; A related noun is the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1461;&#1510;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<i>yetser</i>), &#8220;evil inclination,&#8221; the wicked designs or intent of the human heart (Gen 6:5). But see the discussion by B. S. Childs (<i>Exodus </i>[OTL], 555-56) on a different reading, one that links the root to a hollow verb meaning &#8220;to cast out of metal&#8221; (as in 1 Kgs 7:15).</p>
<A NAME="3214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2104><b>sn</b> The word means a &#8220;young bull&#8221; and need not be translated as &#8220;calf&#8221; (although &#8220;calf&#8221; has become the traditional rendering in English). The word could describe an animal three years old. Aaron probably made an inner structure of wood and then, after melting down the gold, plated it. The verb &#8220;molten&#8221; does not need to imply that the image was solid gold; the word is used in Isa 30:22 for gold plating. So it was a young bull calf that was overlaid with gold, and the gold was fashioned with the stylus.</p>
<A NAME="3215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2105><b>tn</b> The word could be singular here and earlier; here it would then be &#8220;this is your god, O Israel.&#8221; However, the use of &#8220;these&#8221; indicates more than one god was meant by the image. But their statement and their statue, although they do not use the holy name, violate the first two commandments. </p>
<A NAME="3216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2106><b>tn</b> The preterite with the <font face="Scholar">vav </font>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>)<font face="Scholar"> </font>consecutive is subordinated as a temporal clause to the next preterite.</p>
<A NAME="3217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2107><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;this&#8221; has been supplied.</p>
<A NAME="3218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2108><b>tn</b> &#8220;Before it&#8221; means before the deity in the form of the calf. Aaron tried to redirect their worship to Yahweh, but the people had already broken down the barrier and were beyond control (U. Cassuto, <i>Exodus</i>, 413).</p>
<A NAME="3219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2109><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;called.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2110><b>sn</b> The word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1490;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khag</font>), the pilgrim&#8217;s festival. This was the word used by Moses for their pilgrimage into the wilderness. Aaron seems here to be trying to do what Moses had intended they do, make a feast to Yahweh at Sinai, but his efforts will not compete with the idol. As B. Jacob says, Aaron saw all this happening and tried to rescue the true belief (<i>Exodus</i>, 941). </p>
<A NAME="3221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2111><b>tn</b> The second infinitive is an infinitive absolute. The first is an infinitive construct with a <font face="Scholar">lamed</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font>) preposition, expressing the purpose of their sitting down. The infinitive absolute that follows cannot take the preposition, but with the conjunction follows the force of the form before it (see GKC 340 §113.<i>e</i>).</p>
<A NAME="3222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2112><b>tn</b> The form is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1510;&#1463;&#1495;&#1461;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿtsakheq</font>), a Piel infinitive construct, giving the purpose of their rising up after the festal meal. On the surface it would seem that with the festival there would be singing and dancing, so that the people were celebrating even though they did not know the reason. W. C. Kaiser says the word means &#8220;drunken immoral orgies and sexual play&#8221; (&#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:478). That is quite an assumption for this word, but is reflected in some recent English versions (e.g., NCV &#8220;got up and sinned sexually&#8221;; TEV &#8220;an orgy of drinking and sex&#8221;). The word means &#8220;to play, trifle.&#8221; It can have other meanings, depending on its contexts. It is used of Lot when he warned his sons-in-law and appeared as one who &#8220;mocked&#8221; them; it is also used of Ishmael &#8220;playing&#8221; with Isaac, which Paul interprets as mocking; it is used of Isaac &#8220;playing&#8221; with his wife in a manner that revealed to Abimelech that they were not brother and sister, and it is used by Potiphar&#8217;s wife to say that her husband brought this slave Joseph in to &#8220;mock&#8221; them. The most that can be gathered from these is that it is playful teasing, serious mocking, or playful caresses. It might fit with wild orgies, but there is no indication of that in this passage, and the word does not mean it. The fact that they were festive and playing before an idol was sufficient.</p>
<A NAME="3223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2113><b>tn</b> The two imperatives could also express one idea: &#8220;get down there.&#8221; In other words, &#8220;Make haste to get down.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2114><b>sn</b> By giving the people to Moses in this way, God is saying that they have no longer any right to claim him as their God, since they have shared his honor with another. This is God&#8217;s talionic response to their &#8220;These are your gods who brought you up.&#8221; The use of these pronoun changes also would form an appeal to Moses to respond, since Moses knew that God had brought them up from Egypt. </p>
<A NAME="3225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2115><b>tn</b> The verb is a perfect tense, reflecting the present perfect nuance: &#8220;they have turned aside&#8221; and are still disobedient. But the verb is modified with the adverb &#8220;quickly&#8221; (actually a Piel infinitive absolute). It has been only a matter of weeks since they heard the voice of God prohibiting this. </p>
<A NAME="3226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2116><b>sn</b> This is a bold anthropomorphism; it is as if God has now had a chance to get to know these people and has discovered how rebellious they are. The point of the figure is that there has been discernible evidence of their nature. </p>
<A NAME="3227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2117><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and behold&#8221; or &#8220;and look.&#8221; The expression directs attention in order to persuade the hearer.</p>
<A NAME="3228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2118><b>sn</b> B. Jacob says the image is that of the people walking before God, and when he called to them the directions, they would not bend their neck to listen; they were resolute in doing what they intended to do (<i>Exodus</i>, 943). The figure describes them as refusing to submit, but resisting in pride. </p>
<A NAME="3229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2119><b>tn</b> The imperative, from the word &#8220;to rest&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nuakh</font>), has the sense of &#8220;leave me alone, let me be.&#8221; It is a directive for Moses not to intercede for the people. B. S. Childs (<i>Exodus </i>[OTL],<i> </i>567) reflects the Jewish interpretation that there is a profound paradox in God&#8217;s words. He vows the severest punishment but then suddenly conditions it on Moses&#8217; agreement. &#8220;Let me alone that I may consume them&#8221; is the statement, but the effect is that he has left the door open for intercession. He allows himself to be persuaded &#8211; that is what a mediator is for. God could have slammed the door (as when Moses wanted to go into the promised land). Moreover, by alluding to the promise to Abraham God gave Moses the strongest reason to intercede.</p>
<A NAME="3230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2120><b>tn</b> S. R. Driver (<i>Exodus</i>, 351) draws on Arabic to show that the meaning of this verb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khalah</font>) was properly &#8220;make sweet the face&#8221; or &#8220;stroke the face&#8221;; so here &#8220;to entreat, seek to conciliate.&#8221; In this prayer, Driver adds, Moses urges four motives for mercy: 1) Israel is Yahweh&#8217;s people, 2) Israel&#8217;s deliverance has demanded great power, 3) the Egyptians would mock if the people now perished, and 4) the oath God made to the fathers.</p>
<A NAME="3231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2121><b>tn</b> The question is rhetorical; it really forms an affirmation that is used here as a reason for the request (see GKC 474 §150.<i>e</i>).</p>
<A NAME="3232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2122><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;speak, saying.&#8221; This is redundant in English and has been simplified in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="3233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2123><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;evil&#8221; means any kind of life-threatening or fatal calamity. &#8220;Evil&#8221; is that which hinders life, interrupts life, causes pain to life, or destroys it. The Egyptians would conclude that such a God would have no good intent in taking his people to the desert if now he destroyed them. </p>
<A NAME="3234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2124><b>tn</b> The form is a Piel infinitive construct from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kalah</font>, &#8220;to complete, finish&#8221;) but in this stem, &#8220;bring to an end, destroy.&#8221; As a purpose infinitive this expresses what the Egyptians would have thought of God&#8217;s motive.</p>
<A NAME="3235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2125><b>tn</b> The verb &#8220;repent, relent&#8221; when used of God is certainly an anthropomorphism. It expresses the deep pain that one would have over a situation. Earlier God repented that he had made humans (Gen 6:6). Here Moses is asking God to repent/relent over the judgment he was about to bring, meaning that he should be moved by such compassion that there would be no judgment like that. J. P. Hyatt observes that the Bible uses so many anthropomorphisms because the Israelites conceived of God as a dynamic and living person in a vital relationship with people, responding to their needs and attitudes and actions (<i>Exodus </i>[NCBC], 307). See H. V. D. Parunak, &#8220;A Semantic Survey of <i>NHM</i>,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 56 (1975): 512-32.</p>

<A NAME="3254"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=2144><b>tn</b> The word is difficult to interpret. There does not seem to be enough evidence to justify the KJV&#8217;s translation &#8220;naked.&#8221; It appears to mean something like &#8220;let loose&#8221; or &#8220;lack restraint&#8221; (Prov 29:18). The idea seems to be that the people had broken loose, were undisciplined, and were completely given over to their desires. </p>
<A NAME="3255"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=2145><b>tn</b> The last two words of the verse read literally &#8220;for a whispering among those who rose up against them.&#8221; The foes would have mocked and derided them when they heard that they had abandoned the God who had led them out of Egypt (S.

<A NAME="3259"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=2149><b>tn</b> The two imperatives form a verbal hendiadys: &#8220;pass over and return,&#8221; meaning, &#8220;go back and forth&#8221; throughout the camp.</p>
<A NAME="3260"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=2150><b>tn</b> The phrases have &#8220;and kill a man his brother, and a man his companion, and a man his neighbor.&#8221; The instructions were probably intended to mean that they should kill leaders they knew to be guilty because they had been seen or because they failed the water test &#8211; whoever they were. </p>

<A NAME="3263"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=2153><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Your hand was filled.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;fill your hands&#8221; is a familiar expression having to do with commissioning and devotion to a task that is earlier used in 28:41; 29:9, 29, 33, 35. This has usually been explained as a Qal imperative. S. R. Driver explains it &#8220;Fill your hand today,&#8221; meaning, take a sacrifice to God and be installed in the priesthood (<i>Exodus</i>, 355). But it probably is a Piel perfect, meaning &#8220;they have filled your hands today,&#8221; or, &#8220;your hand was filled today.&#8221; This was an expression meant to say that they had been faithful to God even though it turned them against family and friends &#8211; but God would give them a blessing.</p>
<A NAME="3264"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=2154><b>tn</b> The text simply has &#8220;and to give on you today a blessing.&#8221; Gesenius notes that the infinitive construct seems to be attached with a <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>; like the infinitive absolute) as the continuation of a previous finite verb. He reads the verb &#8220;fill&#8221; as an imperative: &#8220;fill your hand today&#8230;and that to bring a blessing on you, i.e., that you may be blessed&#8221; (see GKC 351 §114.<i>p</i>). If the preceding verb is taken as perfect tense, however, then this would also be perfect &#8211; &#8220;he has blessed you today.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3265"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=2155><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and it was on the morrow and Moses said to the people.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3266"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=2156><b>tn</b> The text uses a cognate accusative: &#8220;you have sinned a great sin.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3267"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=2157><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1499;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akhappÿrah</font>) is a Piel cohortative/imperfect. Here with only a possibility of being successful, a potential imperfect nuance works best.</p>
<A NAME="3268"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=2158><b>tn</b> As before, the cognate accusative is used; it would literally be &#8220;this people has sinned a great sin.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3269"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=2159><b>tn</b> The apodosis is not expressed; it would be understood as &#8220;good.&#8221; It is not stated because of the intensity of the expression (the figure is aposiopesis, a sudden silence). It is also possible to take this first clause as a desire and not a conditional clause, rendering it &#8220;Oh that you would forgive!&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3270"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=2160><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;wipe&#8221; is a figure of speech indicating &#8220;remove me&#8221; (meaning he wants to die). The translation &#8220;blot&#8221; is traditional, but not very satisfactory, since it does not convey complete removal. </p>
<A NAME="3271"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=2161><b>sn</b> The book that is referred to here should not be interpreted as the NT &#8220;book of life&#8221; which is portrayed (figuratively) as a register of all the names of the saints who are redeemed and will inherit eternal life. Here it refers to the names of those who are living and serving in this life, whose names, it was imagined, were on the roster in the heavenly courts as belonging to the chosen. Moses would rather die than live if these people are not forgiven (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 356). </p>
<A NAME="3272"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=2162><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;behold, look.&#8221; Moses should take this fact into consideration.</p>
<A NAME="3273"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=2163><b>sn</b> The Law said that God would not clear the guilty. But here the punishment is postponed to some future date when he would revisit this matter. Others have taken the line to mean that whenever a reckoning was considered necessary, then this sin would be included (see B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 957). The repetition of the verb traditionally rendered &#8220;visit&#8221; in both clauses puts emphasis on the certainty &#8211; so &#8220;indeed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3274"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=2164><b>tn</b> The verse is difficult because of the double reference to the making of the calf. The NJPS&#8217;s translation tries to reconcile the two by reading &#8220;for what they did with the calf that Aaron had made.&#8221; B. S. Childs (<i>Exodus </i>[OTL],<i> </i>557) explains in some detail why this is not a good translation based on syntactical grounds; he opts for the conclusion that the last three words are a clumsy secondary addition. It seems preferable to take the view that both are true, Aaron is singled out for his obvious lead in the sin, but the people sinned by instigating the whole thing. </p>
<A NAME="3275"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">75</span><note=2165><b>sn</b> Most commentators have difficulty with this verse. W. C. Kaiser says the strict chronology is not always kept, and so the plague here may very well refer to the killing of the three thousand (&#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:481). </p>
