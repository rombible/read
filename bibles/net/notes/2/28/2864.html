<A NAME="2864"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=1902><b>sn</b> The instructions in this verse anticipate chap. 29, as well as the ordination ceremony described in Lev 8 and 9. The anointing of Aaron is specifically required in the Law, for he is to be the High Priest. The expression &#8220;ordain them&#8221; might also be translated as &#8220;install them&#8221; or &#8220;consecrate them&#8221;; it literally reads &#8220;and fill their hands,&#8221; an expression for the consecration offering for priesthood in Lev 8:33. The final instruction to sanctify them will involve the ritual of the atoning sacrifices to make the priests acceptable in the sanctuary. </p>
