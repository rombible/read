<A NAME="2871"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=1909><b>tn</b> The text has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1488;&#1465;&#1470;&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; &#1506;&#1464;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503; &#1493;&#1464;&#1502;&#1461;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿlo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">-yis</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">u </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avon vametu</font>). The imperfect tense here introduces a final clause, yielding a purpose or result translation (&#8220;in order that&#8221; or &#8220;so that&#8221;). The last verb is the perfect tense with the <i>vav</i> consecutive, and so it too is equal to a final imperfect &#8211; but it would show the result of bearing the iniquity. The idea is that if they approached the holy things with a lack of modesty, perhaps like the pagans who have nakedness and sexuality as part of the religious ritual, they would pollute the holy things, and it would be reckoned to them for iniquity and they would die.</p>
