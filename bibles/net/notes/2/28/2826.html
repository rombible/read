<A NAME="2826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1864><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a breastpiece of decision&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1503; &#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1496;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khoshen mishpat</font>; so NAB). The first word, rendered &#8220;breastpiece,&#8221; is of uncertain etymology. This item was made of material similar to the ephod. It had four rows of three gems on it, bearing the names of the tribes. In it were the urim and thummim. J. P. Hyatt refers to a similar object found in the Egyptian reliefs, including even the twisted gold chains used to hang it from the priest (<i>Exodus </i>[NCBC], 282).</p>
