<A NAME="2859"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=1897><b>tn</b> The construction &#8220;the iniquity of the holy things&#8221; is difficult. &#8220;Holy things&#8221; is explained in the passage by all the gifts the people bring and consecrate to Yahweh. But there will inevitably be iniquity involved. U. Cassuto explains that Aaron &#8220;will atone for all the transgressions committed in connection with the order of the service, the purity of the consecrated things, or the use of the holy gifts, for the declaration engraved on the plate will prove that everything was intended to be <i>holy to the Lord</i>, and if aught was done irregularly, the intention at least was good&#8221; (<i>Exodus</i>, 385).</p>
