<A NAME="2817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1855><b>tn</b> This is the rendering of the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kheshev</font>), cognate to the word translated &#8220;designer&#8221; in v. 6. Since the entire ephod was of the same material, and this was of the same piece, it is unclear why this is singled out as &#8220;artistically woven.&#8221; Perhaps the word is from another root that just describes the item as a &#8220;band.&#8221; Whatever the connection, this band was to be of the same material, and the same piece, as the ephod, but perhaps a different pattern (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 301). It is this sash that attaches the ephod to the priest&#8217;s body, that is, at the upper border of the ephod and clasped together at the back.</p>
