<A NAME="2854"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1892><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsits</font>) seems to mean &#8220;a shining thing&#8221; and so here a plate of metal. It originally meant &#8220;flower,&#8221; but they could not write on a flower. So it must have the sense of something worn openly, visible, and shining. The Rabbinic tradition says it was two fingers wide and stretched from ear to ear, but this is an attempt to give details that the Law does not give (see B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 818). </p>
