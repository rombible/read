<A NAME="287"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1845><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;wise of heart.&#8221; The word for &#8220;wise&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1499;&#1456;&#1502;&#1461;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khakhme</font>, the plural construct form) is from the word group that is usually translated &#8220;wisdom, wise, be wise,&#8221; but it has as its basic meaning &#8220;skill&#8221; or &#8220;skillful.&#8221; This is the way it is used in 31:3, 6 and 35:10 etc. God gave these people &#8220;wisdom&#8221; so that they would know how to make these things. The &#8220;heart&#8221; for the Hebrews is the locus of understanding, the mind and the will. To be &#8220;wise of heart&#8221; or &#8220;wise in heart&#8221; means that they had the understanding to do skillful work, they were talented artisans and artists.</p>
