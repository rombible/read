<A NAME="2812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1850><b>sn</b> The word &#8220;ephod&#8221; is taken over directly from Hebrew, because no one knows how to translate it, nor is there agreement about its design. It refers here to a garment worn by the priests, but the word can also refer to some kind of image for a god (Judg 8:27). </p>
