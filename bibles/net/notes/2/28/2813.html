<A NAME="2813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1851><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tashbets</font>), which describes the tunic and which appears only in this verse, is related to a verb (also rare) of the same root in 28:39 that describes making the tunic. Their meaning is uncertain (see the extended discussion in C. Houtman, <i>Exodus</i>,<i> </i>3:473-75). A related noun describes gold fasteners and the &#8220;settings,&#8221; or &#8220;mountings,&#8221; for precious stones (28:11, 13, 14, 20, 25; 36:18; 39:6, 13, 16, 18; cf. Ps 45:14). The word &#8220;fitted&#8221; in 28:4 reflects the possibility that &#8220;the tunic is to be shaped by sewing, &#8230; so that it will fit tightly around the body&#8221; (C. Houtman, <i>Exodus</i>,<i> </i>3:475).</p>
