<A NAME="285"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1843><b>tn</b> The expression is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491; &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1488;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿkhavod ulÿtif</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aret</font>, &#8220;for glory and for beauty&#8221;). W. C. Kaiser (&#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:465), quoting the NIV&#8217;s &#8220;to give him dignity and honor,&#8221; says that these clothes were to exalt the office of the high priest as well as beautify the worship of God (which explains more of what the text has than the NIV rendering). The meaning of the word &#8220;glory&#8221; has much to do with the importance of the office, to be sure, but in Exodus the word has been used also for the brilliance of the presence of Yahweh, and so the magnificence of these garments might indeed strike the worshiper with the sense of the exaltation of the service. </p>
