<A NAME="2810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1848><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;to sanctify him&#8221; (ASV) or &#8220;to consecrate him&#8221; (KJV, NASB, NRSV). It is the garments that will set Aaron apart, or sanctify him, not the workers. The expression could be taken to mean &#8220;for his consecration&#8221; (NIV) since the investiture is part of his being set apart for service.</p>
