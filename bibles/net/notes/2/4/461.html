<A NAME="461"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=290><b>sn</b> Only Gershom has been mentioned so far. The other son&#8217;s name will be explained in chapter 18. The explanation of Gershom&#8217;s name was important to Moses&#8217; sojourn in Midian. The explanation of the name Eliezer fits better in the later chapter (18:2-4). </p>
