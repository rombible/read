<A NAME="491"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">91</span><note=320><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1493;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyishtakhavu</font>) is usually rendered &#8220;worshiped.&#8221; More specifically, the verbal root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khava</font>) in the <i>hishtaphel </i>stem means &#8220;to cause oneself to be low to the ground.&#8221; While there is nothing wrong with giving it a general translation of &#8220;worship,&#8221; it may be better in a passage like this to take it in conjunction with the other verb (&#8220;bow&#8221;) as a verbal hendiadys, using it as an adverb to that verb. The implication is certainly that they prayed, or praised, and performed some other aspect of worship, but the text may just be describing it from their posture of worship. With this response, all the fears of Moses are swept aside &#8211; they believed and they were thankful to God. </p>
