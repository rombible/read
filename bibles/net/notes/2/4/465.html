<A NAME="465"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=294><b>tn</b> The two verb forms in this section are the imperative (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">rÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eh</font>) followed by the perfect with the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">va</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asitam</font>). The second could be coordinated and function as a second command: &#8220;see&#8230;and [then] do&#8221;; or it could be subordinated logically: &#8220;see&#8230;so that you do.&#8221; Some commentators who take the first option suggest that Moses was supposed to contemplate these wonders before doing them before Pharaoh. That does not seem as likely as the second interpretation reflected in the translation.</p>
