<A NAME="428"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=257><b>tn</b> The two expressions are <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1491;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khÿvad peh</font>, &#8220;heavy of mouth&#8221;), and then <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1491; &#1500;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khÿvad lashon</font>, &#8220;heavy of tongue&#8221;). Both use genitives of specification, the mouth and the tongue being what are heavy &#8211; slow. &#8220;Mouth&#8221; and &#8220;tongue&#8221; are metonymies of cause. Moses is saying that he has a problem speaking well. Perhaps he had been too long at the other side of the desert, or perhaps he was being a little dishonest. At any rate, he has still not captured the meaning of God&#8217;s presence. See among other works, J. H. Tigay, &#8220;&#8216;Heavy of Mouth&#8217; and &#8216;Heavy of Tongue&#8217;: On Moses&#8217; Speech Difficulty,&#8221; <i>BASOR</i> 231 (1978): 57-67. </p>
