<A NAME="475"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">75</span><note=304><b>tn</b> The construction is very emphatic. The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>) gives it an immediacy and a vividness, as if God is already beginning to act. The participle with this particle has the nuance of an imminent future act, as if God is saying, &#8220;I am about to kill.&#8221; These words are not repeated until the last plague.</p>
