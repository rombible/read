<A NAME="47"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=236><b>sn</b> The details of the verse are designed to show that there was a staff that <i>became a snake</i>. The question is used to affirm that there truly was a staff, and then the report of Moses running from it shows it was a genuine snake. Using the serpent as a sign would have had an impact on the religious ideas of Egypt, for the sacred cobra was one of their symbols. </p>
