<A NAME="490"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">90</span><note=319><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;intervened for.&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">paqad</font>) has traditionally been translated &#8220;visited,&#8221; which is open to many interpretations. It means that God intervened in the life of the Israelites to bless them with the fulfillment of the promises. It says more than that he took notice of them, took pity on them, or remembered them. He had not yet fulfilled the promises, but he had begun to act by calling Moses and Aaron. The translation &#8220;attended to&#8221; attempts to capture that much. </p>
