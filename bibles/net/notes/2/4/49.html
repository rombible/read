<A NAME="49"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=238><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1461;&#1497;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kheq</font>), often rendered &#8220;bosom,&#8221; refers to the front of the chest and a fold in the garment there where an item could be placed for carrying (see Prov 6:27; 16:33; 21:14). So &#8220;into your robe&#8221; should be understood loosely here and in v. 7 as referring to the inside of the top front of Moses&#8217; garment. The inside chest pocket of a jacket is a rough modern equivalent.</p>
