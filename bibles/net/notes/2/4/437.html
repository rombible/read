<A NAME="437"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=266><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the anger of Yahweh burned against.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Moses had not dared openly to say &#8220;except me&#8221; when he asked God to send whomever he wanted to send. But God knew that is what he meant. Moses should not have resisted the call or pleaded such excuses or hesitated with such weak faith. Now God abandoned the gentle answer and in anger brought in a form of retribution. Because Moses did not want to do this, he was punished by not having the honor of doing it alone. His reluctance and the result are like the refusal of Israel to enter the land and the result they experienced (see U. Cassuto, <i>Exodus</i>, 49-50).</p>
