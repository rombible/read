<A NAME="489"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">89</span><note=318><b>tc</b> The LXX (Greek OT) has &#8220;and they rejoiced,&#8221; probably reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1502;&#1456;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyismÿkhu</font>) instead of what the MT reading, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1502;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyismÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">u</font>, &#8220;and they heard&#8221;). To rejoice would have seemed a natural response of the people at the news, and the words sound similar in Hebrew.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The form is the preterite with the <i>vav</i> consecutive, &#8220;and they heard.&#8221; It clearly is a temporal clause subordinate to the following verbs that report how they bowed and worshiped. But it is also in sequence to the preceding: they believed, and then they bowed when they heard.</p>
