<A NAME="439"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=268><b>sn</b> S. R. Driver (<i>Exodus</i>, 29) suggests that the term &#8220;Levite&#8221; may refer to a profession rather than ancestry here, because both Moses and Aaron were from the tribe of Levi and there would be little point in noting that ancestry for Aaron. In thinking through the difficult problem of the identity of Levites, he cites McNeile as saying &#8220;the Levite&#8221; referred to one who had had official training as a priest (cf. Judg 17:7, where a member of the tribe of Judah was a Levite). If it was the duty of the priest to give &#8220;torah&#8221; &#8211; to teach &#8211; then some training in the power of language would have been in order. </p>
