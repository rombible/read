<A NAME="477"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=306><b>sn</b> The next section (vv. 24-26) records a rather strange story. God had said that if Pharaoh would not comply he would kill his son &#8211; but now God was ready to kill Moses, the representative of Israel, God&#8217;s own son. Apparently, one would reconstruct that on the journey Moses fell seriously ill, but his wife, learning the cause of the illness, saved his life by circumcising her son and casting the foreskin at Moses&#8217; feet (indicating that it was symbolically Moses&#8217; foreskin). The point is that this son of Abraham had not complied with the sign of the Abrahamic covenant. No one, according to Exod 12:40-51, would take part in the Passover-exodus who had not complied. So how could the one who was going to lead God&#8217;s people not comply? The bold anthropomorphisms and the location at the border invite comparisons with Gen 32, the Angel wrestling with Jacob. In both cases there is a brush with death that could not be forgotten. See also, W. Dumbrell, &#8220;Exodus 4:24-25: A Textual Re-examination,&#8221; <i>HTR</i> 65 (1972): 285-90; T. C. Butler, &#8220;An Anti-Moses Tradition,&#8221; <i>JSOT</i> 12 (1979): 9-15; and L. Kaplan, &#8220;And the <sc>Lord Sought to Kill Him,&#8221; <i>HAR </i>5 (1981): 65-74.</p>
