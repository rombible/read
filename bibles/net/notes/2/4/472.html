<A NAME="472"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=301><b>sn</b> The metaphor uses the word &#8220;son&#8221; in its connotation of a political dependent, as it was used in ancient documents to describe what was intended to be a loyal relationship with well-known privileges and responsibilities, like that between a good father and son. The word can mean a literal son, a descendant, a chosen king (and so, the Messiah), a disciple (in Proverbs), and here, a nation subject to God. If the people of Israel were God&#8217;s &#8220;son,&#8221; then they should serve him and not Pharaoh. Malachi reminds people that the Law said &#8220;a son honors his father,&#8221; and so God asked, &#8220;If I am a father, where is my honor?&#8221; (Mal 1:6).</p>
