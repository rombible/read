<A NAME="423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=252><b>sn</b> Now Moses took up another line of argumentation, the issue of his inability to speak fluently (vv. 10-17). The point here is that God&#8217;s servants must yield themselves as instruments to God, the Creator. It makes no difference what character traits they have or what weaknesses they think they have (Moses manages to speak very well) if God is present. If the sovereign God has chosen them, then they have everything that God intended them to have. </p>
