<A NAME="459"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=288><b>sn</b> The text clearly stated that Pharaoh sought to kill Moses; so this seems to be a reference to Pharaoh&#8217;s death shortly before Moses&#8217; return. Moses was forty years in Midian. In the 18th dynasty, only Pharaoh Thutmose III had a reign of the right length (1504-1450 <sc>b.c.) to fit this period of Moses&#8217; life. This would place Moses&#8217; returning to Egypt near 1450 <sc>b.c., in the beginning of the reign of Amenhotep II, whom most conservatives identify as the pharaoh of the exodus. Rameses II, of course, had a very long reign (1304-1236). But if he were the one from whom Moses fled, then he could not be the pharaoh of the exodus, but his son would be &#8211; and that puts the date of the exodus after 1236, a date too late for anyone.
