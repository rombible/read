<A NAME="468"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=297><b>sn</b> Here is the first mention of the hardening of the heart of Pharaoh. God first tells Moses he must do the miracles, but he also announces that he will harden Pharaoh&#8217;s heart, as if working against Moses. It will help Moses to know that God is bringing about the resistance in order to bring a greater victory with greater glory. There is a great deal of literature on this, but see among the resources F. W. Danker, &#8220;Hardness of Heart: A Study in Biblical Thematic,&#8221; <i>CTM</i> 44 (1973): 89-100; R. R. Wilson, &#8220;The Hardening of Pharaoh&#8217;s Heart,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 41 (1979): 18-36; and R. B. Chisholm Jr., &#8220;Divine Hardening in the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>BSac </i>153 (1996): 410-34.</p>
