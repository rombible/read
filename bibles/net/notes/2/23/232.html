<A NAME="232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1563><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;take up, lift, carry&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nasa</font>&#8217;). This verb was also used in the prohibition against taking &#8220;the name of Yahweh in vain.&#8221; Sometimes the object of this verb is physical, as in Jonah 1:12 and 15. Used in this prohibition involving speech, it covers both originating and repeating a lie.</p>
