<A NAME="2361"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=1622><b>tn</b> The word for &#8220;terror&#8221; is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1502;&#1464;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">emati</font>); the word has the thought of &#8220;panic&#8221; or &#8220;dread.&#8221; God would make the nations panic as they heard of the exploits and knew the Israelites were drawing near. U. Cassuto thinks the reference to &#8220;hornets&#8221; in v. 28 may be a reference to this fear, an unreasoning dread, rather than to another insect invasion (<i>Exodus</i>, 308). Others suggest it is symbolic of an invading army or a country like Egypt or literal insects (see E. Neufeld, &#8220;Insects as Warfare Agents in the Ancient Near East,&#8221; <i>Or</i> 49 [1980]: 30-57).</p>
