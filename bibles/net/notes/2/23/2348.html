<A NAME="2348"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1609><b>sn</b> The word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mal</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akh</font>, &#8220;messenger, angel&#8221;). This angel is to be treated with the same fear and respect as Yahweh, for Yahweh will be speaking in him. U. Cassuto (<i>Exodus</i>, 305-6) says that the words of the first clause do not imply a being distinct from God, for in the ancient world the line of demarcation between the sender and the sent is liable easily to be blurred. He then shows how the &#8220;Angel of Yahweh&#8221; in Genesis is Yahweh. He concludes that the words here mean &#8220;I will guide you.&#8221; Christian commentators tend to identify the Angel of Yahweh as the second person of the Trinity (W. C. Kaiser, Jr., &#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:446). However, in addition to being a preincarnate appearance, the word could refer to Yahweh &#8211; some manifestation of Yahweh himself.</p>
