<A NAME="2343"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1604><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1494;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tizbbakh</font>), an imperfect tense from the same root as the genitive that qualifies the accusative &#8220;blood&#8221;: &#8220;you will not sacrifice the blood of my sacrifice.&#8221; The verb means &#8220;to slaughter&#8221;; since one cannot slaughter blood, a more general translation is required here. But if the genitive is explained as &#8220;my blood-sacrifice&#8221; (a genitive of specification; like &#8220;the evil of your doings&#8221; in Isa 1:16), then a translation of sacrifice would work (U. Cassuto, <i>Exodus</i>, 304). </p>
