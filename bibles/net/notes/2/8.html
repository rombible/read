<A NAME="81"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=494><b>sn</b> An attempt to connect this plague with the natural phenomena of Egypt proposes that because of the polluted water due to the high Nile, the frogs abandoned their normal watery homes (seven days after the first plague) and sought cover from the sun in homes wherever there was moisture. Since they had already been exposed to the poisonous water, they died very suddenly. The miracle was in the announcement and the timing, i.e., that Moses would predict this blow, and in the magnitude of it all, which was not natural (Greta Hort, &#8220;The Plagues of Egypt,&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 69 [1957]: 95-98). It is also important to note that in parts of Egypt there was a fear of these creatures as embodying spirits capable of great evil. People developed the mentality of bowing to incredibly horrible idols to drive away the bad spirits. Evil spirits are represented in the book of Revelation in the forms of frogs (Rev 16:13). The frogs that the magicians produced could very well have been in the realm of evil spirits. Exactly how the Egyptians thought about this plague is hard to determine, but there is enough evidence to say that the plague would have made them spiritually as well as physically uncomfortable, and that the death of the frogs would have been a &#8220;sign&#8221; from God about their superstitions and related beliefs. The frog is associated with the god Hapi, and a frog-headed goddess named Heqet was supposed to assist women at childbirth. The plague would have been evidence that Yahweh was controlling their environment and upsetting their beliefs for his own purpose.</p>
<A NAME="82"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=495><b>tn</b> The text literally has &#8220;and seven days were filled.&#8221; Seven days gave Pharaoh enough time to repent and release Israel. When the week passed, God&#8217;s second blow came.</p>
<A NAME="83"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=496><b>tn</b> This is a temporal clause made up of the preposition, the Hiphil<i> </i>infinitive construct of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhah</font>), <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hakkot</font>), followed by the subjective genitive <i>YHWH.</i> Here the verb is applied to the true meaning of the plague: Moses struck the water, but the plague was a blow struck by God.</p>
<A NAME="84"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=497><b>sn</b> Beginning with 8:1, the verse numbers through 8:32 in English Bibles differ from the verse numbers in the Hebrew text (<i>BHS</i>), with 8:1 ET = 7:26 HT, 8:2 ET = 7:27 HT, 8:3 ET = 7:28 HT, 8:4 ET = 7:29 HT, 8:5 ET = 8:1 HT, etc., through 8:32 ET = 8:28 HT. Thus in English Bibles chapter 8 has 32 verses, while in the Hebrew Bible it has 28 verses, with the four extra verses attached to chapter 7.</p>
<A NAME="85"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=498><b>tn</b> The construction here uses the deictic particle and the participle to convey the imminent future: &#8220;I am going to plague/about to plague.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nagaf</font>) means &#8220;to strike, to smite,&#8221; and its related noun means &#8220;a blow, a plague, pestilence&#8221; or the like. For Yahweh to say &#8220;I am about to plague you&#8221; could just as easily mean &#8220;I am about to strike you.&#8221; That is why these &#8220;plagues&#8221; can be described as &#8220;blows&#8221; received from God. </p>
<A NAME="86"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=499><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;plague all your border with frogs.&#8221; The expression &#8220;all your border&#8221; is figurative for all the territory of Egypt and the people and things that are within the borders (also used in Exod 10:4, 14, 19; 13:7).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This word for frogs is mentioned in the OT only in conjunction with this plague (here and Pss 78:45, 105:30). R. A. Cole (<i>Exodus</i> [TOTC], 91) suggests that this word &#8220;frogs&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1456;&#1508;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tsÿfardÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>)<font face="Scholar"> </font>may be an onomatopoeic word, something like &#8220;croakers&#8221;; it is of Egyptian origin and could be a Hebrew attempt to write the Arabic <font face="Scholar">dofda</font>. </p>
<A NAME="87"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=500><b>sn</b> The choice of this verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sharats</font>) recalls its use in the creation account (Gen 1:20). The water would be swarming with frogs in abundance. There is a hint here of this being a creative work of God as well. </p>
<A NAME="88"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=501><b>sn</b> This verse lists places the frogs will go. The first three are for Pharaoh personally &#8211; they are going to touch his private life. Then the text mentions the servants and the people. Mention of the ovens and kneading bowls (or troughs) of the people indicates that food would be contaminated and that it would be impossible even to eat a meal in peace.</p>
<A NAME="89"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=502><b>tn</b> Here again is the generic use of the article, designating the class &#8211; frogs.</p>
<A NAME="810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=503><b>sn</b> The word order of the Hebrew text is important because it shows how the plague was pointedly directed at Pharaoh: &#8220;and against you, and against your people, and against all your servants frogs will go up.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=504><b>sn</b> After the instructions for Pharaoh (7:25-8:4), the plague now is brought on by the staff in Aaron&#8217;s hand (8:5-7). This will lead to the confrontation (vv. 8-11) and the hardening (vv. 12-15).</p>
<A NAME="812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=505><b>tn</b> The noun is singular, a collective. B. Jacob notes that this would be the more natural way to refer to the frogs (<i>Exodus</i>, 260). </p>
<A NAME="813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=506><b>tn</b> <font face="Scholar">Heb</font> &#8220;thus, so.&#8221;<i> </i></p>
<A NAME="814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=507><b>sn</b> In these first two plagues the fact that the Egyptians could and did duplicate them is ironic. By duplicating the experience, they added to the misery of Egypt. One wonders why they did not use their skills to rid the land of the pests instead, and the implication of course is that they could not.</p>
<A NAME="815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=508><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qara</font>&#8217;) followed by the <font face="Scholar">lamed </font>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font>)<font face="Scholar"> </font>preposition has the meaning &#8220;to summon<i>.</i>&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=509><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">tiru</font>) is the Hiphil<i> </i>imperative of the verb<font face="Scholar"> </font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">atar</font>). It means &#8220;to pray, supplicate,&#8221; or &#8220;make supplication&#8221; &#8211; always addressed to God. It is often translated &#8220;entreat&#8221; to reflect that it is a more urgent praying. </p>
<A NAME="817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=510><b>tn</b> This form is the jussive with a sequential <i>vav</i> that provides the purpose of the prayer: pray&#8230;that he may turn away the frogs.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This is the first time in the conflict that Pharaoh even acknowledged that Yahweh existed. Now he is asking for prayer to remove the frogs and is promising to release Israel. This result of the plague must have been an encouragement to Moses. </p>
<A NAME="818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=511><b>tn</b> The form is the Piel cohortative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">va</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ashallÿkhah</font>) with the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) continuing the sequence from the request and its purpose. The cohortative here stresses the resolve of the king: &#8220;and (then) I <i>will</i> release.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=512><b>tn</b> Here also the imperfect tense with the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) shows the purpose of the release: &#8220;that they may sacrifice.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=513><b>tn</b> The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1512; &#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hitpa</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">er </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alay</font>) is problematic. The verb would be simply translated &#8220;honor yourself&#8221; or &#8220;deck yourself with honor.&#8221; It can be used in the bad sense of self-exaltation. But here it seems to mean &#8220;have the honor or advantage over me&#8221; in choosing when to remove the frogs. The LXX has &#8220;appoint for me.&#8221; Moses is doing more than extending a courtesy to Pharaoh; he is giving him the upper hand in choosing the time. But it is also a test, for if Pharaoh picked the time it would appear less likely that Moses was manipulating things. As U. Cassuto puts it, Moses is saying &#8220;my trust in God is so strong you may have the honor of choosing the time&#8221; (<i>Exodus</i>, 103).</p>
<A NAME="821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=514><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;destroyed&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to cut off the frogs.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=516><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;survive, remain.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=517><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And he said&#8221;; the referent (Moses) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=518><b>tn</b> &#8220;It will be&#8221; has been supplied. </p>
<A NAME="826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=519><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;according to your word&#8221; (so NASB).</p>
<A NAME="827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=520><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsa</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aq</font>) is used for prayers in which people cry out of trouble or from danger. U. Cassuto observes that Moses would have been in real danger if God had not answered this prayer (<i>Exodus</i>, 103). </p>
<A NAME="828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=521><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;over the matter of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=522><b>tn</b> The verb is an unusual choice if it were just to mean &#8220;brought on.&#8221; It is the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sim</font>, &#8220;place, put&#8221;). S. R. Driver thinks the thought is &#8220;appointed for Pharaoh&#8221; as a sign (<i>Exodus</i>, 64). The idea of the sign might be too much, but certainly the frogs were positioned for the instruction of the stubborn king. </p>
<A NAME="830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=523><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;according to the word of Moses&#8221; (so KJV, NASB). Just as Moses had told Pharaoh &#8220;according to your word&#8221; (v. 10), now the <sc>Lord does &#8220;according to the word&#8221; of Moses.</p>
<A NAME="831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=524><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the frogs died.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="832"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=525><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they piled them.&#8221; For clarity the translation supplies the referent &#8220;the Egyptians&#8221; as the ones who were piling the frogs.</p>
<A NAME="833"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=526><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;heaps&#8221; is repeated: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1459;&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1501; &#1492;&#1459;&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khomarim khomarim</font>). The repetition serves to intensify the idea to the highest degree &#8211; &#8220;countless heaps&#8221; (see GKC 396 §123.<i>e</i>).</p>
<A NAME="834"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=527><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1456;&#1493;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rÿvakhah</font>) means &#8220;respite, relief.&#8221; BDB 926 relates it to the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1493;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<i>ravakh</i>, &#8220;to be wide, spacious&#8221;). There would be relief when there was freedom to move about.</p>
<A NAME="835"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=528><b>tn</b> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿhakhbed</font>) is a Hiphil infinitive absolute, functioning as a finite verb. The meaning of the word is &#8220;to make heavy,&#8221; and so stubborn, sluggish, indifferent. It summarizes his attitude and the outcome, that he refused to keep his promises.</p>
<A NAME="836"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=529><b>sn</b> The end of the plague revealed clearly God&#8217;s absolute control over Egypt&#8217;s life and deities &#8211; all at the power of the man who prayed to God. Yahweh had made life unpleasant for the people by sending the plague, but he was also the one who could remove it. The only recourse anyone has in such trouble is to pray to the sovereign Lord God. Everyone should know that there is no one like Yahweh.</p>
<A NAME="837"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=530><b>sn</b> The third plague is brief and unannounced. Moses and Aaron were simply to strike the dust so that it would become gnats. Not only was this plague unannounced, but also it was not duplicated by the Egyptians. </p>
<A NAME="838"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=531><b>tn</b> The verb is the perfect tense with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive, meaning &#8220;and it will be.&#8221; When <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hayah</font>) is followed by the <font face="Scholar">lamed</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font>) proposition, it means &#8220;become.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="839"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=532><b>tn</b> The noun is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kinnim</font>). The insect has been variously identified as lice, gnats, ticks, flies, fleas, or mosquitoes. &#8220;Lice&#8221; follows the reading in the Peshitta and Targum (and so Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 2.14.3 [2.300]). Greek and Latin had &#8220;gnats.&#8221; By &#8220;gnats&#8221; many commentators mean &#8220;mosquitoes,&#8221; which in and around the water of Egypt were abundant (and the translators of the Greek text were familiar with Egypt). Whatever they were they came from the dust and were troublesome to people and animals. </p>
<A NAME="840"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=533><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;man,&#8221; but in the generic sense of &#8220;humans&#8221; or &#8220;people&#8221; (also in v. 18).</p>
<A NAME="841"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=534><b>tn</b> The preterite with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive is here subordinated to the main clause as a temporal clause.</p>
<A NAME="842"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=535><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the magicians did so.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The report of what the magicians did (or as it turns out, tried to do) begins with the same words as the report about the actions of Moses and Aaron &#8211; &#8220;and they did so&#8221; (vv. 17 and 18). The magicians copy the actions of Moses and Aaron, leading readers to think momentarily that the magicians are again successful, but at the end of the verse comes the news that &#8220;they could not.&#8221; Compared with the first two plagues, this third plague has an important new feature, the failure of the magicians and their recognition of the source of the plague.</p>
<A NAME="843"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=536><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the magicians said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="844"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=537><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;finger&#8221; is a bold anthropomorphism (a figure of speech in which God is described using human characteristics). </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The point of the magicians&#8217; words is clear enough. They knew they were beaten and by whom. The reason for their choice of the word &#8220;finger&#8221; has occasioned many theories, none of which is entirely satisfying. At the least their statement highlights that the plague was accomplished by God with majestic ease and effortlessness. Perhaps the reason that they could not do this was that it involved producing life &#8211; from the dust of the ground, as in Genesis 2:7. The creative power of God confounded the magic of the Egyptians and brought on them a loathsome plague. </p>
<A NAME="845"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=538><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the heart of Pharaoh became hard.&#8221; This phrase translates the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khazaq</font>; see S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 53). In context this represents the continuation of a prior condition.</p>
<A NAME="846"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=539><b>sn</b> The announcement of the fourth plague parallels that of the first plague. Now there will be flies, likely dogflies. Egypt has always suffered from flies, more so in the summer than in the winter. But the flies the plague describes involve something greater than any normal season for flies. The main point that can be stressed in this plague comes by tracing the development of the plagues in their sequence. Now, with the flies, it becomes clear that God can inflict suffering on some people and preserve others &#8211; a preview of the coming judgment that will punish Egypt but set Israel free. God is fully able to keep the dog-fly in the land of the Egyptians and save his people from these judgments. </p>
<A NAME="847"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=540><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And Yahweh said.&#8221;</p>

The suffix becomes the subject of the clause. <i>Heb</i> &#8220;but if there is not you releasing.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="849"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=542><b>tn</b> Here again is the <i>futur instans</i> use of the participle, now Qal with the meaning &#8220;send&#8221;: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497; &#1502;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinni mashliakh</font>, &#8220;here I am sending&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="850"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=543><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1465;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arov</font>) means &#8220;a mix&#8221; or &#8220;swarm.&#8221; It seems that some irritating kind of flying insect is involved. Ps 78:45 says that the Egyptians were eaten or devoured by them. Various suggestions have been made over the years: (1) it could refer to beasts or reptiles; (2) the Greek took it as the dog-fly, a vicious blood-sucking gadfly, more common in the spring than in the fall; (3) the ordinary house fly, which is a symbol of Egypt in Isa 7:18 (Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font>, <font face="Scholar">zÿvuv</font>); and (4) the beetle, which gnaws and bites plants, animals, and materials. The fly probably fits the details of this passage best; the plague would have greatly intensified a problem with flies that already existed.</p>

The verb in Hiphil means &#8220;to set apart, make separate, make distinct.&#8221; God was going to keep the flies away from Goshen &#8211; he was setting that apart. The Greek text assumed that the word was from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1461;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pale</font>&#8217;), and translated it something like &#8220;I will marvelously glorify.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="853"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=546><b>tn</b> The relative clause modifies the land of Goshen as the place &#8220;in which my people are dwelling.&#8221; But the normal word for &#8220;dwelling&#8221; is not used here. Instead, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1465;&#1502;&#1461;&#1491;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">omed</font>) is used, which literally means &#8220;standing.&#8221; The land on which Israel stood was spared the flies and the hail.</p>

Driver (<i>Exodus</i>, 68) suggests reading with the LXX, Smr, and Peshitta; this would call for adding a conjunction before the last clause to make it read, &#8220;into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants&#8217; houses, and into all the land of Egypt; <b><i>and</i></b> the land was&#8230;&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;&#1461;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tishakhet</font>) is a strong word; it is the Niphal imperfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shakhat</font>) and is translated &#8220;ruined.&#8221; If the classification as imperfect stands, then it would have to be something like a progressive imperfect (the land was being ruined); otherwise, it may simply be a preterite without the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive. The verb describes utter devastation. This is the verb that is used in Gen 13:10 to describe how Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. Swarms of flies would disrupt life, contaminate everything, and bring disease.</p>
<A NAME="862"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=555><b>sn</b> After the plague is inflicted on the land, then Pharaoh makes an appeal. So there is the familiar confrontation (vv. 25-29). Pharaoh&#8217;s words to Moses are an advancement on his previous words. Now he uses imperatives: &#8220;Go, sacrifice to your God.&#8221; But he restricts it to &#8220;in the [this] land.&#8221; This is a subtle attempt to keep them as a subjugated people and prevent their absolute allegiance to their God. This offered compromise would destroy the point of the exodus &#8211; to leave Egypt and find a new allegiance under the <sc>Lord.</p>
<A NAME="863"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=556><b>tn</b> The clause is a little unusual in its formation. The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1499;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhon</font>) is the Niphal participle from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kun</font>), which usually means &#8220;firm, fixed, steadfast,&#8221; but here it has a rare meaning of &#8220;right, fitting, appropriate.&#8221; It functions in the sentence as the predicate adjective, because the infinitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">la</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asot</font>) is the subject &#8211; &#8220;to do so is not right.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="864"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=557><b>tn</b> This translation has been smoothed out to capture the sense. The text literally says, &#8220;for the abomination of Egypt we will sacrifice to Yahweh our God.&#8221; In other words, the animals that Israel would sacrifice were sacred to Egypt, and sacrificing them would have been abhorrent to the Egyptians. </p>
<A NAME="865"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=558><b>tn</b> An &#8220;abomination&#8221; is something that is off-limits, something that is tabu. It could be translated &#8220;detestable&#8221; or &#8220;loathsome.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="866"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=559><b>sn</b> U. Cassuto (<i>Exodus</i>, 109) says there are two ways to understand &#8220;the abomination of the Egyptians.&#8221; One is that the sacrifice of the sacred animals would appear an abominable thing in the eyes of the Egyptians, and the other is that the word &#8220;abomination&#8221; could be a derogatory term for idols &#8211; we sacrifice what is an Egyptian idol. So that is why he says if they did this the Egyptians would stone them. </p>
<A NAME="867"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=560><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;if we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians [or &#8220;of Egypt&#8221;] before their eyes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="868"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=561><b>tn</b> The interrogative clause has no particle to indicate it is a question, but it is connected with the conjunction to the preceding clause, and the meaning of these clauses indicate it is a question (GKC 473 §150.<i>a</i>).</p>
<A NAME="869"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=562><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1461;&#1500;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nelekh</font>) is a Qal imperfect of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">halakh</font>). Here it should be given the modal nuance of obligation: &#8220;we must go.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="870"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=563><b>tn</b> This clause is placed first in the sentence to stress the distance required. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">derekh</font>) is an adverbial accusative specifying how far they must go. It is in construct, so &#8220;three days&#8221; modifies it. It is a &#8220;journey of three days,&#8221; or, &#8220;a three day journey.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="871"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=564><b>tn</b> The form is the perfect tense with a <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive; it follows in the sequence: we must go&#8230;and then [must] sacrifice.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="872"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=565><b>tn</b> The form is the imperfect tense. It could be future: &#8220;as he will tell us,&#8221; but it also could be the progressive imperfect if this is now what God is telling them to do: &#8220;as he is telling us.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="873"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=566><b>sn</b> By changing from &#8220;the people&#8221; to &#8220;you&#8221; (plural) the speech of Pharaoh was becoming more personal.</p>
<A NAME="874"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=567><b>tn</b> This form, a perfect tense with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive, is equivalent to the imperfect tense that precedes it. However, it must be subordinate to the preceding verb to express the purpose. He is not saying &#8220;I will release&#8230;and you will sacrifice,&#8221; but rather &#8220;I will release&#8230;that you may sacrifice&#8221; or even &#8220;to sacrifice.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="875"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">75</span><note=568><b>tn</b> The construction is very emphatic. First, it uses a verbal hendiadys with a Hiphil imperfect and the Qal infinitive construct: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;&#1514;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1464;&#1500;&#1462;&#1499;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> tarkhiqu lalekhet</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>&#8220;you will not make far to go&#8221;), meaning &#8220;you will not go far.&#8221; But this prohibition is then emphasized with the additional infinitive absolute <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1495;&#1461;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">harkheq</font>) &#8211; &#8220;you will in no wise go too far.&#8221; The point is very strong to safeguard the concession.<i> </i></p>
<A NAME="876"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">76</span><note=569><b>tn</b> &#8220;Do&#8221; has been supplied here to convey that this somewhat unexpected command is tacked onto Pharaoh&#8217;s instructions as his ultimate concern, which Moses seems to understand as such, since he speaks about it immediately (v. 29).</p>
<A NAME="877"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=570><b>tn</b> The deictic particle with the participle usually indicates the <i>futur instans </i>nuance: &#8220;I am about to&#8230;,&#8221; or &#8220;I am going to&#8230;.&#8221; The clause could also be subordinated as a temporal clause.</p>
<A NAME="878"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=571><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">talal</font>) means &#8220;to mock, deceive, trifle with.&#8221; The construction in this verse forms a verbal hendiadys. The Hiphil jussive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1465;&#1505;&#1461;&#1507; </font>(&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al-yosef</font>, &#8220;let not [Pharaoh] add&#8221;) is joined with the Hiphil infinitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1514;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hatel</font>, &#8220;to deceive&#8221;). It means: &#8220;Let not Pharaoh deceive again.&#8221; Changing to the third person in this warning to Pharaoh is more decisive, more powerful. </p>
