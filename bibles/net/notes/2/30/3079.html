<A NAME="3079"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">79</span><note=2063><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1502;&#1467;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿmullakh</font>), a passive participle, is usually taken to mean &#8220;salted.&#8221; Since there is no meaning like that for the Pual form, the word probably should be taken as &#8220;mixed,&#8221; as in Rashi and <i>Tg. Onq.</i> Seasoning with salt would work if it were food, but since it is not food, if it means &#8220;salted&#8221; it would be a symbol of what was sound and whole for the covenant. Some have thought that it would have helped the incense burn quickly with more smoke.</p>
