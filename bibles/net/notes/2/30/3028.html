<A NAME="3028"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2012><b>sn</b> It appears that some standard is in view for the amount of a shekel weight. The sanctuary shekel is sometimes considered to be twice the value of the ordinary shekel. The &#8220;gerah,&#8221; also of uncertain meaning, was mentioned as a reference point for the ancient reader to understand the value of the required payment. It may also be that the expression meant &#8220;a sacred shekel&#8221; and looked at the purpose more &#8211; a shekel for sanctuary dues. This would mean that the standard of the shekel weight was set because it was the traditional amount of sacred dues (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 333). &#8220;Though there is no certainty, the shekel is said to weigh about 11,5 grams&#8230;Whether an official standard is meant [by &#8216;sanctuary shekel&#8217;] or whether the sanctuary shekel had a different weight than the &#8216;ordinary&#8217; shekel is not known&#8221; (C. Houtman, <i>Exodus</i>,<i> </i>3:181).</p>
