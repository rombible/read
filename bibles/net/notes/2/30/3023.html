<A NAME="3023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2007><b>tn</b> The form is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1511;&#1467;&#1491;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lifqudehem</font>, &#8220;according to those that are numbered of/by them&#8221;) from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">paqad</font>, &#8220;to visit&#8221;). But the idea of this word seems more to be that of changing or determining the destiny, and so &#8220;appoint&#8221; and &#8220;number&#8221; become clear categories of meaning for the word. Here it simply refers to the census, but when this word is used for a census it often involves mustering an army for a military purpose. Here there is no indication of a war, but it may be laying down the principle that when they should do this, here is the price. B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 835) uses Num 31 as a good illustration, showing that the warrior was essentially a murderer, if he killed anyone in battle. For this reason his blood was forfeit; if he survived he must pay a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1508;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kofer</font>) because every human life possesses value and must be atoned for. The payment during the census represented a &#8220;presumptive ransom&#8221; so that they could not be faulted for what they might do in war. </p>
