<A NAME="3053"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=2037><b>sn</b> The chapter ends with these two sections. The oil (22-33) is the mark of consecration, and the incense (34-38) is a mark of pleasing service, especially in prayer. So the essence of the message of the chapter is that the servants of God must be set apart by the Spirit for ministry and must be pleasing to God in the ministry. </p>
