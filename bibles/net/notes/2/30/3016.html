<A NAME="3016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2000><b>sn</b> The point of the little golden altar of incense is normally for intercessory prayer, and then at the Day of Atonement for blood applied atonement. The instructions for making it show that God wanted his people to make a place for prayer.
