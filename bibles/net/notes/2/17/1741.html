<A NAME="1741"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1236><b>tn</b> The construction uses the infinitive absolute and the imperfect tense to stress the resolution of Yahweh to destroy Amalek. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">makhah</font>) is often translated &#8220;blot out&#8221; &#8211; but that is not a very satisfactory image, since it would not remove completely what is the object. &#8220;Efface, erase, scrape off&#8221; (as in a palimpsest, a manuscript that is scraped clean so it can be reused) is a more accurate image.</p>
