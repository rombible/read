<A NAME="1744"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1239><b>tn</b> The line here is very difficult. The Hebrew text has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;&#1497;&#1464;&#1491; &#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1505; &#1497;&#1464;&#1492;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki yad </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al kes yah</font>, &#8220;for a hand on the throne of Yah&#8221;). If the word is &#8220;throne&#8221; (and it is not usually spelled like this), then it would mean Moses&#8217; hand was extended to the throne of God, showing either intercession or source of power. It could not be turned to mean that the hand of Yah was taking an oath to destroy the Amalekites. The LXX took the same letters, but apparently saw the last four (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1492;</font>) as a verbal form; it reads &#8220;with a secret hand.&#8221; Most scholars have simply assumed that the text is wrong, and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1505;</font> should be emended to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1461;&#1505;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nes</font>) to fit the name, for this is the pattern of naming in the OT with popular etymologies &#8211; some motif of the name must be found in the sentiment. This would then read, &#8220;My hand on the banner of Yah.&#8221; It would be an expression signifying that the banner, the staff of God, should ever be ready at hand when the Israelites fight the Amalekites again.</p>
