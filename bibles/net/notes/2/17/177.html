<A NAME="177"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1202><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyarev</font>) is from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">riv</font>); it forms the basis of the name &#8220;Meribah.&#8221; The word means &#8220;strive, quarrel, be in contention&#8221; and even &#8220;litigation.&#8221; A translation &#8220;quarrel&#8221; does not appear to capture the magnitude of what is being done here. The people have a legal dispute &#8211; they are contending with Moses as if bringing a lawsuit. </p>
