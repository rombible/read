<A NAME="1732"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1227><b>tn</b> The term used here is the adjective <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1461;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kÿvedim</font>). It means &#8220;heavy,&#8221; but in this context the idea is more that of being tired. This is the important word that was used in the plague stories: when the heart of Pharaoh was hard, then the Israelites did not gain their freedom or victory. Likewise here, when the staff was lowered because Moses&#8217; hands were &#8220;heavy,&#8221; Israel started to lose.</p>
