<A NAME="1745"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1240><b>sn</b> The message of this short narrative, then, concerns the power of God to protect his people. The account includes the difficulty, the victory, and the commemoration. The victory must be retained in memory by the commemoration. So the expositional idea could focus on that: The people of God must recognize (both for engaging in warfare and for praise afterward) that victory comes only with the power of God. In the NT the issue is even more urgent, because the warfare is spiritual &#8211; believers do not wrestle against flesh and blood. So only God&#8217;s power will bring victory.</p>
