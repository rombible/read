<A NAME="1723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1218><b>sn</b> The name Massah (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1505;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">massah</font>) means &#8220;Proving&#8221;; it is derived from the verb &#8220;test, prove, try.&#8221; And the name Meribah (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mÿrivah</font>) means &#8220;Strife&#8221;; it is related to the verb &#8220;to strive, quarrel, contend.&#8221; The choice of these names for the place would serve to remind Israel for all time of this failure with God. God wanted this and all subsequent generations to know how unbelief challenges God. And yet, he gave them water. So in spite of their failure, he remained faithful to his promises. The incident became proverbial, for it is the warning in Ps 95:7-8, which is quoted in Heb 3:15: &#8220;Oh, that today you would listen as he speaks!<b><i> </i></b>Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, in the day of testing in the wilderness<b>.</b> There your fathers tested me and tried me, and they saw my works for forty years.&#8221; The lesson is clear enough: to persist in this kind of unbelief could only result in the loss of divine blessing. Or, to put it another way, if they refused to believe in the power of God, they would wander powerless in the wilderness. They had every reason to believe, but they did not. (Note that this does not mean they are unbelievers, only that they would not take God at his word.)</p>
