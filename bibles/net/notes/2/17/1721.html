<A NAME="1721"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1216><b>tn</b> These two verbs are also perfect tenses with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive: &#8220;and [water] will go out&#8230;and [the people] will drink.&#8221; But the second verb is clearly the intent or the result of the water gushing from the rock, and so it may be subordinated.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The presence of Yahweh at this rock enabled Paul to develop a midrashic lesson, an analogical application: Christ was present with Israel to provide water for them in the wilderness. So this was a Christophany. But Paul takes it a step further to equate the rock with Christ, for just as it was struck to produce water, so Christ would be struck to produce rivers of living water. The provision of bread to eat and water to drink provided for Paul a ready analogy to the provisions of Christ in the gospel (1 Cor 10:4). </p>
