<A NAME="1743"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1238><b>sn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Yahweh-nissi&#8221; (so NAB), which means &#8220;Yahweh is my banner.&#8221; Note that when Israel murmured and failed God, the name commemorated the incident or the outcome of their failure. When they were blessed with success, the naming praised God. Here the holding up of the staff of God was preserved in the name for the altar &#8211; God gave them the victory. </p>
