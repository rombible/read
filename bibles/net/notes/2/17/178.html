<A NAME="178"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1203><b>tn</b> The imperfect tense with the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) follows the imperative, and so it carries the nuance of the logical sequence, showing purpose or result. This may be expressed in English as &#8220;give us water so that we may drink,&#8221; but more simply with the English infinitive, &#8220;give us water to drink.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> One wonders if the people thought that Moses and Aaron had water and were withholding it from the people, or whether Moses was able to get it on demand. The people should have come to Moses to ask him to pray to God for water, but their action led Moses to say that they had challenged God (B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 476). </p>
