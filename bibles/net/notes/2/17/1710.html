<A NAME="1710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1205><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1505;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nasah</font>) means &#8220;to test, tempt, try, prove.&#8221; It can be used of people simply trying to do something that they are not sure of (such as David trying on Saul&#8217;s armor), or of God testing people to see if they will obey (as in testing Abraham, Gen 22:1), or of people challenging others (as in the Queen of Sheba coming to test Solomon), and of the people in the desert in rebellion putting God to the test. By doubting that God was truly in their midst, and demanding that he demonstrate his presence, they tested him to see if he would act. There are times when &#8220;proving&#8221; God is correct and required, but that is done by faith (as with Gideon); when it is done out of unbelief, then it is an act of disloyalty. </p>
