<A NAME="1734"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1229><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;steady&#8221; is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">emuna</font>) from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aman</font>). The word usually means &#8220;faithfulness.&#8221; Here is a good illustration of the basic idea of the word &#8211; firm, steady, reliable, dependable. There may be a <i>double entendre</i> here; on the one hand it simply says that his hands were stayed so that Israel might win, but on the other hand it is portraying Moses as steady, firm, reliable, faithful. The point is that whatever God commissioned as the means or agency of power &#8211; to Moses a staff, to the Christians the Spirit &#8211; the people of God had to know that the victory came from God alone. </p>
