<A NAME="1028"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=684><b>tn</b> The question is literally &#8220;who and who are the ones going?&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497; &#1493;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497; &#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1465;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mi vami haholÿkhim</font>). Pharaoh&#8217;s answer to Moses includes this rude question, which was intended to say that Pharaoh would control who went. The participle in this clause, then, refers to the future journey.</p>
