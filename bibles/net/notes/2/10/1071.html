<A NAME="1071"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=727><b>tn</b> B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 287) shows that the intent of Moses in using <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gam</font>) is to make an emphatic rhetorical question. He cites other samples of the usage in Num 22:33; 1 Sam 17:36; 2 Sam 12:14, and others. The point is that if Pharaoh told them to go and serve Yahweh, they had to have animals to sacrifice. If Pharaoh was holding the animals back, he would have to make some provision.</p>
