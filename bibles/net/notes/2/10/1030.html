<A NAME="1030"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=686><b>sn</b> Pharaoh is by no means offering a blessing on them in the name of Yahweh. The meaning of his &#8220;wish&#8221; is connected to the next clause &#8211; as he is releasing them, may God help them. S. R. Driver says that in Pharaoh&#8217;s scornful challenge Yahweh is as likely to protect them as Pharaoh is likely to let them go &#8211; not at all (<i>Exodus</i>, 80). He is planning to keep the women and children as hostages to force the men to return. U. Cassuto (<i>Exodus</i>, 125) paraphrases it this way: &#8220;May the help of your God be as far from you as I am from giving you permission to go forth with your little ones.&#8221; The real irony, Cassuto observes, is that in the final analysis he will let them go, and Yahweh will be with them. </p>
