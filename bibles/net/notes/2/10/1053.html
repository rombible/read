<A NAME="1053"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=709><b>sn</b> The third part of the passage now begins, the confrontation that resulted from the onslaught of the plague. Pharaoh goes a step further here &#8211; he confesses he has sinned and adds a request for forgiveness. But his acknowledgment does not go far enough, for this is not genuine confession. Since his heart was not yet submissive, his confession was vain.</p>
