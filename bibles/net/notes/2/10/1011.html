<A NAME="1011"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=667><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1463;&#1504;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">me</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anta</font>), a Piel perfect. After &#8220;how long,&#8221; the form may be classified as present perfect (&#8220;how long have you refused), for it describes actions begun previously but with the effects continuing. (See GKC 311 §106.<i>g-h</i>). The use of a verb describing a state or condition may also call for a present translation (&#8220;how long do you refuse&#8221;) that includes past, present, and potentially future, in keeping with the question &#8220;how long.&#8221;</p>
