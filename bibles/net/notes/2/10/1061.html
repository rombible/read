<A NAME="1061"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=717><b>tn</b> The Hebrew name here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1501;&#1470;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">Yam Suf</font>), sometimes rendered &#8220;Reed Sea&#8221; or &#8220;Sea of Reeds.&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;</font> is a collective noun that may have derived from an Egyptian name for papyrus reeds. Many English versions have used &#8220;Red Sea,&#8221; which translates the name that ancient Greeks used: <font face="Greek">ejruqrav qalavssa</font> (<font face="Greektl">eruqra qalassa</font>). </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The name Red Sea is currently applied to the sea west of the Arabian Peninsula. The northern fingers of this body of water extend along the west and east sides of the Sinai Peninsula and are presently called the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Aqaba or the Gulf of Eilat. In ancient times the name applied to a much larger body of water, including the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf (C. Houtman, <i>Exodus</i>,<i> </i>1:109-10). See also Num 14:25; 21:4; Deut 1:40; 2:1; Judg 11:16; 1 Kgs 9:26; Jer 49:21. The sea was deep enough to drown the entire Egyptian army later (and thus no shallow swamp land). God drives the locusts to their death in the water. He will have the same power over Egyptian soldiers, for he raised up this powerful empire for a purpose and soon will drown them in the sea. The message for the Israelites is that God will humble all who refuse to submit.</p>
