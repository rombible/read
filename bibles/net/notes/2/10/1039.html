<A NAME="1039"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=695><b>tn</b> The verb is the Piel preterite, third person masculine singular, meaning &#8220;and he drove them out.&#8221; But &#8220;Pharaoh&#8221; cannot be the subject of the sentence, for &#8220;Pharaoh&#8221; is the object of the preposition. The subject is not specified, and so the verb can be treated as passive.</p>
