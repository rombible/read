<A NAME="1033"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=689><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;before your face.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The &#8220;trouble&#8221; or &#8220;evil&#8221; that is before them could refer to the evil that they are devising &#8211; the attempt to escape from Egypt. But that does not make much sense in the sentence &#8211; why would he tell them to take heed or look out about that? U. Cassuto (<i>Exodus</i>, 126) makes a better suggestion. He argues that Pharaoh is saying, &#8220;Don&#8217;t push me too far.&#8221; The evil, then, would be what Pharaoh was going to do if these men kept making demands on him. This fits the fact that he had them driven out of his court immediately. There could also be here an allusion to Pharaoh&#8217;s god <i>Re&#8217;</i>, the sun-deity and head of the pantheon; he would be saying that the power of his god would confront them. </p>
