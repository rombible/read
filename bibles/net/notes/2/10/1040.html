<A NAME="1040"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=696><b>tn</b> The preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet</font>) is unexpected here. BDB 91 s.v. (the note at the end of the entry) says that in this case it can only be read as &#8220;with the locusts,&#8221; meaning that the locusts were thought to be implicit in Moses&#8217; lifting up of his hand. However, BDB prefers to change the preposition to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lamed</font>).</p>
