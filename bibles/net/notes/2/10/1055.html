<A NAME="1055"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=711><b>sn</b> The severity of the plague prompted Pharaoh to confess his sin against Yahweh and them, now in much stronger terms than before. He also wants forgiveness &#8211; but in all probability what he wants is relief from the consequences of his sin. He pretended to convey to Moses that this was it, that he was through sinning, so he asked for forgiveness &#8220;only this time.&#8221; </p>
