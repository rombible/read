<A NAME="105"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=661><b>tn</b> The expression is unusual: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1505;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1494;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tÿsapper bÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ozne</font>, &#8220;[that] you may declare in the ears of&#8221;). The clause explains an additional reason for God&#8217;s hardening the heart of Pharaoh, namely, so that the Israelites can tell their children of God&#8217;s great wonders. The expression is highly poetic and intense &#8211; like Ps 44:1, which says, &#8220;we have heard with our ears.&#8221; The emphasis would be on the clear teaching, orally, from one generation to another.</p>
