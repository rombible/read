<A NAME="1012"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=668><b>tn</b> The clause is built on the use of the infinitive construct to express the direct object of the verb &#8211; it answers the question of what Pharaoh was refusing to do. The Niphal infinitive construct (note the elision of the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">hey</font>] prefix after the preposition [see GKC 139 §51.<i>l</i>]) is from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anah</font>). The verb in this stem would mean &#8220;humble oneself.&#8221; The question is somewhat rhetorical, since God was not yet through humbling Pharaoh, who would not humble himself. The issue between Yahweh and Pharaoh is deeper than simply whether or not Pharaoh will let the Israelites leave Egypt.</p>
