<A NAME="1025"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=681><b>sn</b> The question of Pharaoh&#8217;s servants echoes the question of Moses &#8211; &#8220;How long?&#8221; Now the servants of Pharaoh are demanding what Moses demanded &#8211; &#8220;Release the people.&#8221; They know that the land is destroyed, and they speak of it as Moses&#8217; doing. That way they avoid acknowledging Yahweh or blaming Pharaoh. </p>
