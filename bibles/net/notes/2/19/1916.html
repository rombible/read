<A NAME="1916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1324><b>tn</b> They are also to be &#8220;a holy nation.&#8221; They are to be a nation separate and distinct from the rest of the nations. Here is another aspect of their duty. It was one thing to be God&#8217;s special possession, but to be that they had to be priestly and holy. The duties of the covenant will specify what it would mean to be a holy nation. In short, they had to keep themselves free from everything that characterized pagan people (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 171). So it is a bilateral covenant: they received special privileges but they must provide special services by the special discipline. See also H. Kruse, &#8220;Exodus 19:5 and the Mission of Israel,&#8221; <i>North East Asian Journal of Theology</i> 24/25 (1980): 239-42.</p>
