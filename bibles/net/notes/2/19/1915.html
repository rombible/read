<A NAME="1915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1323><b>tn</b> The construction &#8220;a kingdom of priests&#8221; means that the kingdom is made up of priests. W. C. Kaiser (&#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:417) offers four possible renderings of the expression: 1) apposition, viz., &#8220;kings, that is, priests; 2) as a construct with a genitive of specification, &#8220;royal priesthood&#8221;; 3) as a construct with the genitive being the attribute, &#8220;priestly kingdom&#8221;; and 4) reading with an unexpressed &#8220;and&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;kings and priests.&#8221; He takes the latter view that they were to be kings and priests. (Other references are R. B. Y. Scott, &#8220;A Kingdom of Priests (Exodus xix. 6),&#8221; <i>OTS</i> 8 [1950]: 213-19; William L. Moran, &#8220;A Kingdom of Priests,&#8221; <i>The Bible in Current Catholic Thought</i>, 7-20). However, due to the parallelism of the next description which uses an adjective, this is probably a construct relationship. This kingdom of God will be composed of a priestly people. All the Israelites would be living wholly in God&#8217;s service and enjoying the right of access to him. And, as priests, they would have the duty of representing God to the nations, following what they perceived to be the duties of priests &#8211; proclaiming God&#8217;s word, interceding for people, and making provision for people to find God through atonement (see Deut 33:9,10).</p>
