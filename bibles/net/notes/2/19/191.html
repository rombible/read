<A NAME="191"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1309><b>sn</b> This chapter is essentially about mediation. The people are getting ready to meet with God, receive the Law from him, and enter into a covenant with him. All of this required mediation and preparation. Through it all, Israel will become God&#8217;s unique possession, a kingdom of priests on earth &#8211; if they comply with his Law. The chapter can be divided as follows: vv. 1-8 tell how God, Israel&#8217;s great deliverer promised to make them a kingdom of priests; this is followed by God&#8217;s declaration that Moses would be the mediator (v. 9); vv. 10-22 record instructions for Israel to prepare themselves to worship Yahweh and an account of the manifestation of Yahweh with all the phenomena; and the chapter closes with the mediation of Moses on behalf of the people (vv. 23-25). Having been redeemed from Egypt, the people will now be granted a covenant with God. See also R. E. Bee, &#8220;A Statistical Study of the Sinai Pericope,&#8221; <i>Journal of the Royal Statistical Society</i> 135 (1972): 406-21.</p>
