<A NAME="1937"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1345><b>tn</b> The text simply has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1511;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿqol</font>); it could mean &#8220;with a voice&#8221; or it could mean &#8220;in thunder&#8221; since &#8220;voice&#8221; was used in v. 16 for thunder. In this context it would be natural to say that the repeated thunderings were the voice of God &#8211; but how is that an answer? Deut 4:12 says that the people heard the sound of words. U. Cassuto (<i>Exodus</i>, 232-33) rightly comments, &#8220;He was answering him with a loud voice so that it was possible for Moses to hear His words clearly in the midst of the storm.&#8221; He then draws a parallel from Ugaritic where it tells that one of the gods was speaking in a loud voice.</p>
