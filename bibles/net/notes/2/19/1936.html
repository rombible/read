<A NAME="1936"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1344><b>tn</b> The two verbs here (&#8220;spoke&#8221; and &#8220;answered&#8221;) are imperfect tenses; they emphasize repeated action but in past time. The customary imperfect usually is translated &#8220;would&#8221; or &#8220;used to&#8221; do the action, but here continuous action in past time is meant. S. R. Driver translates it &#8220;kept speaking&#8221; and &#8220;kept answering&#8221; (<i>Exodus</i>, 172). </p>
