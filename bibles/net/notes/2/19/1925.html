<A NAME="1925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1333><b>sn</b> There is some ambiguity here. The clause either means that no man will touch the mountain, so that if there is someone who is to be put to death he must be stoned or shot since they could not go into the mountain region to get him, or, it may mean no one is to touch the culprit who went in to the region of the mountain. </p>
