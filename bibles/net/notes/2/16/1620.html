<A NAME="1620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1132><b>tn</b> &#8220;You will know this&#8221; has been added to make the line smooth. Because of the abruptness of the lines in the verse, and the repetition with v. 7, B. S. Childs (Exodus [OTL], 273) thinks that v. 8 is merely a repetition by scribal error &#8211; even though the versions render it as the MT has it. But B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 447) suggests that the contrast with vv. 6 and 7 is important for another reason &#8211; there Moses and Aaron speak, and it is smooth and effective, but here only Moses speaks, and it is labored and clumsy. &#8220;We should realize that Moses had properly claimed to be no public speaker.&#8221; </p>
