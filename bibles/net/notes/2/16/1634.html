<A NAME="1634"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1146><b>sn</b> These are migratory birds, said to come up in the spring from Arabia flying north and west, and in the fall returning. They fly with the wind, and so generally alight in the evening, covering the ground. If this is part of the explanation, the divine provision would have had to alter their flight paths to bring them to the Israelites, and bring them in vast numbers. </p>
