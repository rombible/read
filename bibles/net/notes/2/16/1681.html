<A NAME="1681"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">81</span><note=1193><b>sn</b> The &#8220;Testimony&#8221; is a reference to the Ark of the Covenant; so the pot of manna would be placed before Yahweh in the tabernacle. W. C. Kaiser says that this later instruction came from a time after the tabernacle had been built (see Exod 25:10-22; W. C. Kaiser, Jr., &#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:405). This is not a problem since the final part of this chapter had to have been included at the end of the forty years in the desert.</p>
