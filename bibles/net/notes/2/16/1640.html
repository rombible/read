<A NAME="1640"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1152><b>tn</b> The text has: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1503; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497; &#1500;&#1488;&#1465; &#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; &#1502;&#1463;&#1492;&#1470;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">man hu</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> ki lo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> yadÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">u mah hu</font>&#8217;). From this statement the name &#8220;manna&#8221; was given to the substance. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1503;</font> for &#8220;what&#8221; is not found in Hebrew, but appears in Syriac as a contraction of <i>ma den</i>, &#8220;what then?&#8221; In Aramaic and Arabic <font face="Scholar">man</font> is &#8220;what?&#8221; The word is used here apparently for the sake of etymology. B. S. Childs (<i>Exodus</i> [OTL], 274) follows the approach that any connections to words that actually meant &#8220;what?&#8221; are unnecessary, for it is a play on the name (whatever it may have been) and therefore related only by sound to the term being explained. This, however, presumes that a substance was known prior to this account &#8211; a point that Deuteronomy does not seem to allow. S. R. Driver says that it is not known how early the contraction came into use, but that this verse seems to reflect it (<i>Exodus</i>, 149). Probably one must simply accept that in the early Israelite period <i>man</i> meant &#8220;what?&#8221; There seems to be sufficient evidence to support this. See <i>EA</i> 286,5; <i>UT</i> 435; <i>DNWSI </i>1:157.</p>
