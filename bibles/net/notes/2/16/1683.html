<A NAME="1683"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">83</span><note=1195><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;omer&#8221; and &#8220;ephah&#8221; are transliterated Hebrew words. The omer is mentioned only in this passage. (It is different from a &#8220;homer&#8221; [cf. Ezek 45:11-14].) An ephah was a dry measure whose capacity is uncertain: &#8220;Quotations given for the ephah vary from ca. 45 to 20 liters&#8221; (C. Houtman, <i>Exodus</i>,<i> </i>2:340-41).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The point of this chapter, with all its instructions and reports included, is God&#8217;s miraculous provision of food for his people. This is a display of sovereign power that differs from the display of military power. Once again the story calls for faith, but here it is faith in Yahweh to provide for his people. The provision is also a test to see if they will obey the instructions of God. Deut 8 explains this. The point, then, is that God provides for the needs of his people that they may demonstrate their dependence on him by obeying him. The exposition of this passage must also correlate to John 6. God&#8217;s providing manna from heaven to meet the needs of his people takes on new significance in the application that Jesus makes of the subject to himself. There the requirement is the same &#8211; will they believe and obey? But at the end of the event John explains that they murmured about Jesus. </p>
