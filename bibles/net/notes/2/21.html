<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1418><b>sn</b> There follows now a series of rulings called &#8220;the decisions&#8221; or &#8220;the judgments&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1496;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hammishpatim</font>). A precept is stated, and then various cases in which the law is applicable are examined. These rulings are all in harmony with the Decalogue that has just been given and can be grouped into three categories: civil or criminal laws, religious or cultic laws, and moral or humanitarian laws. The civil and criminal laws make up most of chap. 21; the next two chapters mix the other kinds of laws. Among the many studies of this section of the book are F. C. Fensham, &#8220;The Role of the Lord in the Legal Sections of the Covenant Code,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 26 (1976): 262-74; S. Paul, &#8220;Unrecognized Biblical Legal Idioms in Light of Comparative Akkadian Expressions,&#8221; <i>RB </i>86 (1979): 231-39; M. Galston, &#8220;The Purpose of the Law According to Maimonides,&#8221; <i>JQR</i> 69 (1978): 27-51.</p>
<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1419><b>sn</b> See H. L. Elleson, &#8220;The Hebrew Slave: A Study in Early Israelite Society,&#8221; <i>EvQ</i> 45 (1973): 30-35; N. P. Lemche, &#8220;The Manumission of Slaves &#8211; The Fallow Year &#8211; The Sabbatical Year &#8211; The Jobel Year,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 26 (1976): 38-59, and &#8220;The &#8216;Hebrew Slave,&#8217; Comments on the Slave Law &#8211; Ex. 21:2-11,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 25 (1975): 129-44.</p>
<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1420><b>tn</b> The verbs in both the conditional clause and the following ruling are imperfect tense: &#8220;If you buy&#8230;then he will serve.&#8221; The second imperfect tense (the ruling) could be taken either as a specific future or an obligatory imperfect. Gesenius explains how the verb works in the conditional clauses here (see GKC 497 §159.<i>bb</i>). </p>
<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1421><b>sn</b> The interpretation of &#8220;Hebrew&#8221; in this verse is uncertain: (l) a gentilic ending, (2) a fellow Israelite, (3) or a class of mercenaries of the population (see W. C. Kaiser, Jr., &#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:431). It seems likely that the term describes someone born a Hebrew, as opposed to a foreigner (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 210). The literature on this includes: M. P. Gray, &#8220;The <i>Habiru</i>-Hebrew Problem,&#8221; <i>HUCA</i> 29 (1958): 135-202.</p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1422><b>sn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1508;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khofshi</font>) means &#8220;free.&#8221; It is possible that there is some connection between this word and a technical term used in other cultures for a social class of emancipated slaves who were freemen again (see I. Mendelsohn, &#8220;New Light on the <i>Hupsu</i>,&#8221; <i>BASOR</i> 139 [1955]: 9-11). </p>
<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1423><b>tn</b> The adverb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinnam</font>) means &#8220;gratis, free&#8221;; it is related to the verb &#8220;to be gracious, show favor&#8221; and the noun &#8220;grace.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1424><b>tn</b> The tense is imperfect, but in the conditional clause it clearly refers to action that is anterior to the action in the next clause. <i>Heb</i> &#8220;if he comes in single, he goes out single,&#8221; that is, &#8220;if he came in single, he will go out single.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1425><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;with his back&#8221; meaning &#8220;alone.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1426><b>tn</b> The phrase says, &#8220;if he was the possessor of a wife&#8221;; the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) can mean &#8220;possessor&#8221; or &#8220;husband.&#8221; If there was a wife, she shared his fortunes or his servitude; if he entered with her, she would accompany him when he left.</p>
<A NAME="2110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1427><b>sn</b> The slave would not have the right or the means to acquire a wife. Thus, the idea of the master&#8217;s &#8220;giving&#8221; him a wife is clear &#8211; the master would have to pay the bride price and make the provision. In this case, the wife and the children are actually the possession of the master unless the slave were to pay the bride price &#8211; but he is a slave because he got into debt. The law assumes that the master was better able to provide for this woman than the freed slave and that it was most important to keep the children with the mother. </p>
<A NAME="2111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1428><b>tn</b> The imperfect with the infinitive absolute means that the declaration is unambiguous, that the servant will clearly affirm that he wants to stay with the master. Gesenius says that in a case like this the infinitive emphasizes the importance of the condition on which some consequence depends (GKC 342-43 §113.<i>o</i>).</p>
<A NAME="2112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1429><b>tn</b> Or taken as a desiderative imperfect, it would say, &#8220;I do not want to go out free.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1430><b>tn</b> The word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohim</font>). S. R. Driver (<i>Exodus</i>, 211) says the phrase means &#8220;to God,&#8221; namely the nearest sanctuary in order that the oath and the ritual might be made solemn, although he does say that it would be done by human judges. That the reference is to Yahweh God is the view also of F. C. Fensham, &#8220;New Light on Exodus 21:7 and 22:7 from the Laws of Eshnunna,&#8221; <i>JBL </i>78 (1959): 160-61. Cf. also ASV, NAB, NASB, NCV, NRSV, NLT. Others have made a stronger case that it refers to judges who acted on behalf of God; see C. Gordon, &#8220;<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;</font> in its Reputed Meaning of Rulers, Judges,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 54 (1935): 134-44; and A. E. Draffkorn, &#8220;Ilani/Elohim,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 76 (1957): 216-24; cf. KJV, NIV. </p>
<A NAME="2114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1431><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;till his life&#8217;s end&#8221; (as in the idiom: &#8220;serve him for good&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="2115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1432><b>sn</b> This paragraph is troubling to modern readers, but given the way that marriages were contracted and the way people lived in the ancient world, it was a good provision for people who might want to find a better life for their daughter. On the subject in general for this chapter, see W. M. Swartley, <i>Slavery, Sabbath, War, and Women</i>, 31-64.</p>
<A NAME="2116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1433><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amah</font>) refers to a female servant who would eventually become a concubine or wife; the sale price included the amount for the service as well as the bride price (see B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 621). The arrangement recognized her honor as an Israelite woman, one who could be a wife, even though she entered the household in service. The marriage was not automatic, as the conditions show, but her treatment was safeguarded come what may. The law was a way, then, for a poor man to provide a better life for a daughter. </p>
<A NAME="2117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1434><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and if unpleasant (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>) in the eyes of her master.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1435><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ad</font>) does not mean &#8220;betroth, espouse&#8221; as some of the earlier translations had it, but &#8220;to designate.&#8221; When he bought the girl, he designated her for himself, giving her and her family certain expectations.</p>
<A NAME="2119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1436><b>tn</b> The verb is a Hiphil perfect with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">padah</font>, &#8220;to redeem&#8221;). Here in the apodosis the form is equivalent to an imperfect: &#8220;let someone redeem her&#8221; &#8211; perhaps her father if he can, or another. U. Cassuto says it can also mean she can redeem herself and dissolve the relationship (<i>Exodus</i>, 268). </p>
<A NAME="2120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1437><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he has no authority/power,&#8221; for the verb means &#8220;rule, have dominion.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1438><b>sn</b> The deceit is in not making her his wife or concubine as the arrangement had stipulated. </p>
<A NAME="2122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1439><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;after the manner of&#8221; (KJV, ASV); NRSV &#8220;shall deal with her as with a daughter.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1440><b>tn</b> &#8220;wife&#8221; has been supplied.</p>
<A NAME="2124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1441><b>tn</b> The translation of &#8220;food&#8221; does not quite do justice to the Hebrew word. It is &#8220;flesh.&#8221; The issue here is that the family she was to marry into is wealthy, they ate meat. She was not just to be given the basic food the ordinary people ate, but the fine foods that this family ate.</p>
<A NAME="2125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1442><b>sn</b> See S. Paul, &#8220;Exodus 21:10, A Threefold Maintenance Clause,&#8221; <i>JNES</i> 28 (1969): 48-53. Paul suggests that the third element listed is not marital rights but ointments since Sumerian and Akkadian texts list food, clothing, and oil as the necessities of life. The translation of &#8220;marital rights&#8221; is far from certain, since the word occurs only here. The point is that the woman was to be cared for with all that was required for a woman in that situation. </p>
<A NAME="2126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1443><b>sn</b> The lessons of slavery and service are designed to bring justice to existing customs in antiquity. The message is: Those in slavery for one reason or another should have the hope of freedom and the choice of service (vv. 2-6). For the rulings on the daughter, the message could be: Women, who were often at the mercy of their husbands or masters, must not be trapped in an unfortunate situation, but be treated well by their masters or husbands (vv. 7-11). God is preventing people who have power over others from abusing it.</p>
<A NAME="2127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1444><b>sn</b> The underlying point of this section remains vital today: The people of God must treat all human life as sacred. </p>
<A NAME="2128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1445><b>tn</b> The construction uses a Hiphil<i> </i>participle in construct with the noun for &#8220;man&#8221; (or person as is understood in a law for the nation): &#8220;the one striking [of] a man.&#8221; This is a <i>casus pendens</i> (independent nominative absolute); it indicates the condition or action that involves further consequence (GKC 361 §116.<i>w</i>).</p>
<A NAME="2129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1446><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1464;&#1502;&#1461;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vamet</font>) is a Qal perfect with <i>vav</i> consecutive; it means &#8220;and he dies&#8221; and not &#8220;and killed him&#8221; (which require another stem). Gesenius notes that this form after a participle is the equivalent of a sentence representing a contingent action (GKC 333 §112.<i>n</i>). The word shows the result of the action in the opening participle. It is therefore a case of murder or manslaughter. </p>
<A NAME="2130"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1447><b>sn</b> See A. Phillips, &#8220;Another Look at Murder,&#8221; <i>JJS</i> 28 (1977): 105-26.</p>
<A NAME="2131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1448><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;if he does not lie in wait&#8221; (NASB similar).</p>
<A NAME="2132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1449><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and God brought into his hand.&#8221; The death is unintended, its circumstances outside human control.</p>
<A NAME="2133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1450><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ormah</font>) is problematic. It could mean with prior intent, which would be connected with the word in Prov 8:5, 12 which means &#8220;understanding&#8221; (or &#8220;prudence&#8221; &#8211; fully aware of the way things are). It could be connected also to an Arabic word for &#8220;enemy&#8221; which would indicate this was done with malice or evil intentions (U. Cassuto, <i>Exodus</i>, 270). The use here seems parallel to the one in Josh 9:4, an instance involving intentionality and clever deception.</p>
<A NAME="2134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1451><b>sn</b> This is the same construction that was used in v. 12, but here there is no mention of the parents&#8217; death. This attack, then, does not lead to their death &#8211; if he killed one of them then v. 12 would be the law. S. R. Driver says that the severity of the penalty was in accord with the high view of parents (<i>Exodus</i>, 216).</p>
<A NAME="2135"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1452><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a stealer of a man,&#8221; thus &#8220;anyone stealing a man.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1453><b>sn</b> The implication is that it would be an Israelite citizen who was kidnapped and sold to a foreign tribe or country (like Joseph). There was always a market for slaves. The crime would be in forcibly taking the individual away from his home and religion and putting him into bondage or death. </p>
<A NAME="2137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1454><b>tn</b> Literally &#8220;and he is found in his hand&#8221; (KJV and ASV both similar), being not yet sold.</p>
<A NAME="2138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1455><b>tn</b> The form is a Piel participle from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qalal</font>), meaning in Qal &#8220;be light,&#8221; in Piel &#8220;treat lightly, curse, revile, declare contemptible, treat shamefully.&#8221; (See its use in Lev 19:14; Josh 24:9; Judg 9:26-28; 1 Sam 3:13; 17:43; 2 Sam 16:5-13; Prov 30:10-11; Eccl 7:21-22; 10:20.) It is opposite of &#8220;honor&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1461;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kaved</font>; Qal &#8220;be heavy&#8221;; Piel &#8220;honor,&#8221; as in 20:12) and of &#8220;bless.&#8221; This verse then could refer to any act contrary to the commandment to honor the parents. B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 640) cites parallels in Sumerian where people were severely punished for publicly disowning their parents. &#8220;21:15, 17 taken together evoke the picture of parents who, physically and verbally, are forcibly turned out of the house (cf. Prov. 19:26)&#8221; (C. Houtman, <i>Exodus</i>,<i> </i>3:148).</p>
<A NAME="2139"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1456><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;falls to bed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2140"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1457><b>tn</b> &#8220;and then&#8221; has been supplied.</p>
<A NAME="2141"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1458><b>tn</b> The verb is a Hitpael perfect with <i>vav </i>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive; it follows the sequence of the imperfect before it &#8211; &#8220;if he gets up and walks about.&#8221; This is proof of recovery. </p>
<A NAME="2142"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1459><b>tn</b> The imperfect tense carries a nuance of obligatory imperfect because this is binding on the one who hit him.</p>
<A NAME="2143"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1460><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his&#8221;; the referent (the injured person) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1461><b>tn</b> The word appears to be the infinitive from the verb &#8220;to sit&#8221; with a meaning of &#8220;his sitting down&#8221;; some suggest it is from the verb &#8220;to rest&#8221; with a meaning &#8220;cease.&#8221; In either case the point in the context must mean compensation is due for the time he was down.</p>

<A NAME="2150"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1467><b>tn</b> This last clause is a free paraphrase of the Hebrew, &#8220;for he is his money&#8221; (so KJV, ASV); NASB &#8220;his property.&#8221; It seems that if the slave survives a couple of days, it is probable that the master was punishing him and not intending to kill him. If he then dies, there is no penalty other than that the owner loses the slave who is his property &#8211; he suffers the loss.</p>
<A NAME="2151"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1468><b>tn</b> This line has occasioned a good deal of discussion. It may indicate that the child was killed, as in a miscarriage; or it may mean that there was a premature birth. The latter view is taken here because of the way the whole section is written: (1) &#8220;her children come out&#8221; reflects a birth and not the loss of children, (2) there is no serious damage, and (3) payment is to be set for any remuneration. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1505;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ason</font>) is translated &#8220;serious damage.&#8221; The word was taken in <i>Mekilta</i> to mean &#8220;death.&#8221; U. Cassuto says the point of the phrase is that neither the woman or the children that are born die (<i>Exodus</i>, 275). But see among the literature on this: M. G. Kline, &#8220;<i>Lex Talionis </i>and the Human Fetus,&#8221; <i>JETS</i> 20 (1977): 193-201; W. House, &#8220;Miscarriage or Premature Birth: Additional Thoughts on Exodus 21:22-25,&#8221; <i>WTJ</i> 41 (1978): 108-23; S. E. Loewenstamm, &#8220;Exodus XXI 22-25,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 27 (1977): 352-60.</p>

S. R. Driver mentions an alternative to this unusual reading presented by Budde, reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;</font> as &#8220;untimely birth&#8221; (<i>Exodus</i>, 219).
