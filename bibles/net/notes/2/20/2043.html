<A NAME="2043"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1394><b>tn</b> The verb &#8220;to see&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>) refers to seeing with all the senses, or perceiving. W. C. Kaiser suggests that this is an example of the figure of speech called zeugma because the verb &#8220;saw&#8221; yokes together two objects, one that suits the verb and the other that does not. So, the verb &#8220;heard&#8221; is inserted here to clarify (&#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:427).</p>
