<A NAME="2016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1367><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word for &#8220;generations&#8221; is not found in v. 5 or 6. The numbers are short for a longer expression, which is understood as part of the description of the children already mentioned (see Deut 7:9, where &#8220;generation&#8221; [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">dor</font>] is present and more necessary, since &#8220;children&#8221; have not been mentioned).</p>
