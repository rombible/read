<A NAME="202"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1353><b>sn</b> The Bible makes it clear that the Law was the revelation of God at Mount Sinai. And yet study has shown that the law code&#8217;s form follows the literary pattern of covenant codes in the Late Bronze Age, notably the Hittite codes. The point of such codes is that all the covenant stipulations are appropriate because of the wonderful things that the sovereign has done for the people. God, in using a well-known literary form, was both drawing on the people&#8217;s knowledge of such to impress their duties on them, as well as putting new wine into old wineskins. The whole nature of God&#8217;s code was on a much higher level. For this general structure, see M. G. Kline, <i>Treaty of the Great King</i>. For the Ten Commandments specifically, see J. J. Stamm and M. E. Andrew, <i>The Ten Commandments in Recent Research</i> (SBT). See also some of the general articles: M.
