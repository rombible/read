<A NAME="2060"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=1411><b>sn</b> The &#8220;burnt offering&#8221; is the offering prescribed in Lev 1. Everything of this animal went up in smoke as a sweet aroma to God. It signified complete surrender by the worshiper who brought the animal, and complete acceptance by God, thereby making atonement. The &#8220;peace offering&#8221; is legislated in Lev 3 and 7. This was a communal meal offering to celebrate being at peace with God. It was made usually for thanksgiving, for payment of vows, or as a freewill offering. </p>
