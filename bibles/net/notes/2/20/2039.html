<A NAME="2039"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1390><b>tn</b> The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1491; &#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1511;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ed shaqer</font>) means &#8220;a lying witness&#8221; (B. S. Childs, <i>Exodus</i> [OTL], 388). In this verse the noun is an adverbial accusative, &#8220;you will not answer as a lying witness.&#8221; The prohibition is against perjury. While the precise reference would be to legal proceedings, the law probably had a broader application to lying about other people in general (see Lev 5:1; Hos 4:2). </p>
