<A NAME="2013"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1364><b>tn</b> The combination of these two verbs customarily refers to the worship of pagan deities (e.g., Deut 17:3: 30:17; Jer 8:2; see J. J. Stamm and M. E. Andrew, <i>The Ten Commandments in Recent Research</i> [SBT], 86). The first verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1488;&#1465;&#1470;&#1514;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1493;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> tishtakhaveh</font>), now to be classified as a <font face="Scholar">hishtaphel</font> imperfect from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khavah</font>; BDB 1005 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1492;</font>), &#8220;to cause oneself to be low to the ground.&#8221; It is used of the true worship of God as well. The second verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1488; &#1514;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1456;&#1491;&#1461;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿlo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> to</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ovdem</font>). The two could be taken as a hendiadys: &#8220;you will not prostrate yourself to serve them.&#8221; In an interesting side comment U. Cassuto (<i>Exodus</i>, 242) offers an explanation of the spelling of the second verb: he suggests that it was spelled with the <i>qamets khatuf</i> vowel to show contempt for pagan worship, as if their conduct does not even warrant a correct spelling of the word &#8220;serve.&#8221; Gesenius says that the forms like this are anomalous, but he wonders if they were pointed as if the verb was a Hophal with the meaning &#8220;you shall not allow yourself to be brought to worship them&#8221; (GKC 161 §60.<i>b</i>). But this is unlikely.</p>
