<A NAME="2014"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1365><b>sn</b> The word &#8220;jealous&#8221; is the same word often translated &#8220;zeal&#8221; or &#8220;zealous.&#8221; The word describes a passionate intensity to protect or defend something that is jeopardized. The word can also have the sense of &#8220;envy,&#8221; but in that case the object is out of bounds. God&#8217;s zeal or jealousy is to protect his people or his institutions or his honor. Yahweh&#8217;s honor is bound up with the life of his people. </p>
