<A NAME="2024"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1375><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;Sabbath&#8221; is clearly connected to the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shavat</font>, &#8220;to cease, desist, rest&#8221;). There are all kinds of theories as to the origin of the day, most notably in the Babylonian world, but the differences are striking in so far as the pagan world had these days filled with magic. Nevertheless, the pagan world does bear witness to a tradition of a regular day set aside for special sacrifices. See, for example, H. W. Wolff, &#8220;The Day of Rest in the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>LTQ</i> 7 (1972): 65-76; H. Routtenberg, &#8220;The Laws of Sabbath: Biblical Sources,&#8221; <i>Dor le Dor</i> 6 (1977): 41-43, 99-101, 153-55, 204-6; G. Robinson, &#8220;The Idea of Rest in the OT and the Search for the Basic Character of Sabbath,&#8221; <i>ZAW </i>92 (1980): 32-42; and M. Tsevat, &#8220;The Basic Meaning of the Biblical Sabbath,&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 84 (1972): 447-59.</p>
