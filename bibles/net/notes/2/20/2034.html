<A NAME="2034"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1385><b>sn</b> The promise here is national rather than individual, although it is certainly true that the blessing of life was promised for anyone who was obedient to God&#8217;s commands (Deut 4:1, 8:1, etc.). But as W. C. Kaiser (&#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:424) summarizes, the land that was promised was the land of Canaan, and the duration of Israel in the land was to be based on morality and the fear of God as expressed in the home (Deut 4:26, 33, 40; 32:46-47). The captivity was in part caused by a breakdown in this area (Ezek 22:7, 15). Malachi would announce at the end of his book that Elijah would come at the end of the age to turn the hearts of the children and the parents toward each other again. </p>
