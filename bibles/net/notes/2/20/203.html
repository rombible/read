<A NAME="203"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1354><b>sn</b> The revelation of Yahweh here begins with the personal pronoun. &#8220;I&#8221; &#8211; a person, a living personality, not an object or a mere thought. This enabled him to address &#8220;you&#8221; &#8211; Israel, and all his people, making the binding stipulations for them to conform to his will (B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 544). </p>
