<A NAME="2030"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1381><b>sn</b> The wife is omitted in the list, not that she was considered unimportant, nor that she was excluded from the rest, but rather in reflecting her high status. She was not man&#8217;s servant, not lesser than the man, but included with the man as an equal before God. The &#8220;you&#8221; of the commandments is addressed to the Israelites individually, male and female, just as God in the Garden of Eden held both the man and the woman responsible for their individual sins (see B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 567-68). </p>
