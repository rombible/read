<A NAME="2062"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=1413><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zakhar</font>, &#8220;to remember&#8221;), but in the Hiphil especially it can mean more than remember or cause to remember (remind) &#8211; it has the sense of praise or honor. B. S. Childs says it has a denominative meaning, &#8220;to proclaim&#8221; (<i>Exodus</i> [OTL], 447). The point of the verse is that God will give Israel reason for praising and honoring him, and in every place that occurs he will make his presence known by blessing them.</p>
