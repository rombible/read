<A NAME="2023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1374><b>tn</b> The text uses the infinitive absolute <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1499;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zakhor</font>) for the commandment for the Sabbath day, which is the sign of the Sinaitic Covenant. The infinitive absolute functions in place of the emphatic imperative here (see GKC 346 §113.<i>bb</i>); the absolute stresses the basic verbal idea of the root &#8211; remembering. The verb includes the mental activity of recalling and pondering as well as the consequent actions for such remembering. </p>
