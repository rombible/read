<A NAME="208"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1359><b>tn</b> The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al-panay</font>) has several possible interpretations. S. R. Driver suggests &#8220;in front of me,&#8221; meaning obliging me to behold them, and also giving a prominence above me (<i>Exodus</i>, 193-94). W. F. Albright rendered it &#8220;You shall not prefer other gods to me&#8221; (<i>From the Stone Age to Christianity</i>, 297, n. 29). B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 546) illustrates it with marriage: the wife could belong to only one man while every other man was &#8220;another man.&#8221; They continued to exist but were not available to her. The point is clear from the Law, regardless of the specific way the prepositional phrase is rendered. God demands absolute allegiance, to the exclusion of all other deities. The preposition may imply some antagonism, for false gods would be opposed to Yahweh. U. Cassuto adds that God was in effect saying that anytime Israel turned to a false god they had to know that the Lord was there &#8211; it is always in his presence, or before him (<i>Exodus</i>, 241). </p>
