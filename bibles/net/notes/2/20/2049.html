<A NAME="2049"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1400><b>tn</b> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1463;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<i>nassot</i>) is the Piel infinitive construct; it forms the purpose of God&#8217;s coming with all the accompanying phenomena. The verb can mean &#8220;to try, test, prove.&#8221; The sense of &#8220;prove&#8221; fits this context best because the terrifying phenomena were intended to put the fear of God in their hearts so that they would obey. In other words, God was inspiring them to obey, not simply testing to see if they would.</p>
