<A NAME="2025"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1376><b>tn</b> The Piel infinitive construct provides the purpose of remembering the Sabbath day &#8211; to set it apart, to make it distinct from the other days. Verses 9 and 10 explain in part how this was to be done. To set this day apart as holy taught Israel the difference between the holy and the profane, that there was something higher than daily life. If an Israelite bent down to the ground laboring all week, the Sabbath called his attention to the heavens, to pattern life after the Creator (B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 569-70). </p>
