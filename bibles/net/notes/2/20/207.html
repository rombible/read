<A NAME="207"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1358><b>tn</b> The possession is expressed here by the use of the <i>lamed </i>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font>) preposition and the verb &#8220;to be&#8221;: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;&#1497;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1492; &#1500;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> yihyeh lÿkha</font>, &#8220;there will not be to you&#8221;). The negative with the imperfect expresses the emphatic prohibition; it is best reflected with &#8220;you will not&#8221; and has the strongest expectation of obedience (see GKC 317 §107.<i>o</i>). As an additional way of looking at this line, U. Cassuto suggests that the verb is in the singular in order to say that they could not have even one other god, and the word &#8220;gods&#8221; is plural to include any gods (<i>Exodus</i>, 241).</p>
