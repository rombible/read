<A NAME="2040"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1391><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khamad</font>) focuses not on an external act but on an internal mental activity behind the act, the motivation for it. The word can be used in a very good sense (Ps 19:10; 68:16), but it has a bad connotation in contexts where the object desired is off limits. This command is aimed at curtailing the greedy desire for something belonging to a neighbor, a desire that leads to the taking of it or the attempt to take it. It was used in the story of the Garden of Eden for the tree that was desired. </p>
