<A NAME="2264"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=1558><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohim</font>) is &#8220;gods&#8221; or &#8220;God.&#8221; If taken as the simple plural, it could refer to the human judges, as it has in the section of laws; this would match the parallelism in the verse. If it was taken to refer to God, then the idea of cursing God would be more along the line of blasphemy. B. Jacob says that the word refers to functioning judges, and that would indirectly mean God, for they represented the religious authority, and the prince the civil authority (<i>Exodus</i>, 708).</p>
