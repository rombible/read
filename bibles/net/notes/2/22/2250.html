<A NAME="2250"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1544><b>tn</b> The accusative here is the masculine singular pronoun, which leads S. R. Driver to conclude that this line is out of place, even though the masculine singular can be used in places like this (<i>Exodus</i>, 232). U.
