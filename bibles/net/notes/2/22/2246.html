<A NAME="2246"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1540><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kharam</font>) means &#8220;to be devoted&#8221; to God or &#8220;to be banned.&#8221; The idea is that it would be God&#8217;s to do with as he liked. What was put under the ban was for God alone, either for his service or for his judgment. But it was out of human control. Here the verb is saying that the person will be utterly destroyed.</p>
