<A NAME="2223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1517><b>tn</b> The line says &#8220;if he has not stretched out his hand.&#8221; This could be the oath formula, but the construction here would be unusual, or it could be taken as &#8220;whether&#8221; (see W. C. Kaiser, Jr., &#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:438). U. Cassuto (<i>Exodus</i>, 286) does not think the wording can possibly fit an oath; nevertheless, an oath would be involved before God (as he takes it instead of &#8220;judges&#8221;) &#8211; if the man swore, his word would be accepted, but if he would not swear, he would be guilty.</p>
