<A NAME="2242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1536><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mahar</font>) means &#8220;pay the marriage price,&#8221; and the related noun is the bride price. B. Jacob says this was a proposal gift and not a purchase price (<i>Exodus</i>, 700). This is the price paid to her parents, which allowed for provision should there be a divorce. The amount was usually agreed on by the two families, but the price was higher for a pure bride from a noble family. Here, the one who seduces her must pay it, regardless of whether he marries her or not.</p>
