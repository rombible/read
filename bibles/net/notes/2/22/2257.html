<A NAME="2257"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=1551><b>sn</b> In ancient times money was lent primarily for poverty and not for commercial ventures (H. Gamoran, &#8220;The Biblical Law against Loans on Interest,&#8221; <i>JNES</i> 30 [1971]: 127-34). The lending to the poor was essentially a charity, and so not to be an opportunity to make money from another person&#8217;s misfortune. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<i>neshekh</i>) may be derived from a verb that means &#8220;to bite,&#8221; and so the idea of usury or interest was that of putting out one&#8217;s money with a bite in it (See S. Stein, &#8220;The Laws on Interest in the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>JTS</i> 4 [1953]: 161-70; and E. Neufeld, &#8220;The Prohibition against Loans at Interest in the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>HUCA</i> 26 [1955]: 355-412).</p>
