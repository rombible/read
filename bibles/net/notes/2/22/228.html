<A NAME="228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1502><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;a thief&#8221; have been added for clarification. S. R. Driver (<i>Exodus</i>, 224) thinks that these lines are out of order, since some of them deal with killing the thief and then others with the thief making restitution, but rearranging the clauses is not a necessary way to bring clarity to the paragraph. The idea here would be that any thief caught alive would pay restitution. </p>
