<A NAME="632"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=416><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and [since] I am of uncircumcised lips.&#8221; The &#8220;lips&#8221; represent his speech (metonymy of cause). The term &#8220;uncircumcised&#8221; makes a comparison between his speech and that which Israel perceived as unacceptable, unprepared, foreign, and of no use to God. The heart is described this way when it is impervious to good impressions (Lev 26:41; Jer 9:26) and the ear when it hears imperfectly (Jer 6:10). Moses has here returned to his earlier claim &#8211; he does not speak well enough to be doing this.</p>
