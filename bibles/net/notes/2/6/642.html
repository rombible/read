<A NAME="642"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=426><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;by their hosts&#8221; or &#8220;by their armies.&#8221; Often translated &#8220;hosts&#8221; (ASV, NASB) or &#8220;armies&#8221; (KJV), <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsÿva</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ot</font>) is a military term that portrays the people of God in battle array. In contemporary English, &#8220;regiment&#8221; is perhaps more easily understood as a force for battle than &#8220;company&#8221; (cf. NAB, NRSV) or &#8220;division&#8221; (NIV, NCV, NLT), both of which can have commercial associations. The term also implies an orderly departure.</p>
