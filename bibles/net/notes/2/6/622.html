<A NAME="622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=406><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;which I raised my hand to give it.&#8221; The relative clause specifies which land is their goal. The bold anthropomorphism mentions part of an oath-taking ceremony to refer to the whole event and reminds the reader that God swore that he would give the land to them. The reference to taking an oath would have made the promise of God sure in the mind of the Israelite.</p>
