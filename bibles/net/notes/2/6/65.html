<A NAME="65"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=389><b>sn</b> The announcement &#8220;I am the <sc>Lord&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;Yahweh&#8221;) draws in the preceding revelation in Exod 3:15. In that place God called Moses to this task and explained the significance of the name &#8220;Yahweh&#8221; by the enigmatic expression &#8220;<sc>I am that <sc>I am.&#8221; &#8220;<sc>I am&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1492;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">ehyeh</font>) is not a name; &#8220;Yahweh&#8221; is. But the explanation of the name with this sentence indicates that Yahweh is the one who is always there, and that guarantees the future, for everything he does is consistent with his nature. He is eternal, never changing; he remains. Now, in Exodus 6, the meaning of the name &#8220;Yahweh&#8221; will be more fully unfolded.</p>
