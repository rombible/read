<A NAME="611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=395><b>tn</b> The statement refers to the making of the covenant with Abraham (Gen 15 and following) and confirming it with the other patriarchs. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1458;&#1511;&#1460;&#1502;&#1465;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">haqimoti</font>) means &#8220;set up, establish, give effect to, conclude&#8221; a covenant agreement. The covenant promised the patriarchs a great nation, a land &#8211; Canaan, and divine blessing. They lived with those promises, but now their descendants were in bondage in Egypt. God&#8217;s reference to the covenant here is meant to show the new revelation through redemption will start to fulfill the promises and show what the reality of the name Yahweh is to them. </p>
