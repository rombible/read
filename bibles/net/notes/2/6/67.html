<A NAME="67"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=391><b>tn</b> The traditional rendering of the title as &#8220;Almighty&#8221; is reflected in LXX and Jerome. But there is still little agreement on the etymology and exact meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el-shadday</font>). Suggestions have included the idea of &#8220;mountain God,&#8221; meaning the high God, as well as &#8220;the God with breasts.&#8221; But there is very little evidence supporting such conclusions and not much reason to question the ancient versions.</p>
