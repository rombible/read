<A NAME="630"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=414><b>sn</b> This analogy is an example of a <font face="Scholar">qal wahomer</font> comparison. It is an argument by inference from the light (<font face="Scholar">qal</font>) to the heavy (<font face="Scholar">homer</font>), from the simple to the more difficult. If the Israelites, who are Yahwists, would not listen to him, it is highly unlikely Pharaoh would. </p>
