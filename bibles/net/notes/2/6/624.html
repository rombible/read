<A NAME="624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=408><b>sn</b> The final part of this section focuses on instructions for Moses. The commission from God is the same &#8211; he is to speak to Pharaoh and he is to lead Israel out. It should have been clear to him that God would do this, for he had just been reminded how God was going to lead out, deliver, redeem, take the people as his people, and give them land. It was God&#8217;s work of love from beginning to end. Moses simply had his task to perform. </p>
