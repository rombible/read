<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1><b>sn</b> Chapter 1 introduces the theme of bondage in Egypt and shows the intensifying opposition to the fulfillment of promises given earlier to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The first seven verses announce the theme of Israel&#8217;s prosperity in Egypt. The second section (vv. 8-14) reports continued prosperity in the face of deliberate opposition. The third section (vv. 15-21) explains the prosperity as divine favor in spite of Pharaoh&#8217;s covert attempts at controlling the population. The final verse records a culmination in the developing tyranny and provides a transition to the next section &#8211; Pharaoh commands the open murder of the males. The power of God is revealed in the chapter as the people flourish under the forces of evil. However, by the turn of affairs at the end of the chapter, the reader is left with a question about the power of God &#8211; &#8220;What can God do?&#8221; This is good Hebrew narrative, moving the reader through tension after tension to reveal the sovereign power and majesty of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God, but calling for faith every step of the way. See also D. W. Wicke, &#8220;The Literary Structure of Exodus 1:2&#8211;2:10,&#8221; <i>JSOT</i> 24 (1982): 99-107.</p>

<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3><b>sn</b> The name of the book of Exodus in the Hebrew Bible is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿmot</font>), the word for &#8220;Names,&#8221; drawn from the beginning of the book. The inclusion of the names at this point forms a literary connection to the book of Genesis. It indicates that the Israelites living in bondage had retained a knowledge of their ancestry, and with it, a knowledge of God&#8217;s promise.</p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4><b>tn</b> The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497; &#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿne yisra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>, &#8220;sons of Israel&#8221;) in most places refers to the nation as a whole and can be translated &#8220;Israelites,&#8221; although traditionally it has been rendered &#8220;the children of Israel&#8221; or &#8220;the sons of Israel.&#8221; Here it refers primarily to the individual sons of the patriarch Israel, for they are named. But the expression is probably also intended to indicate that they are the Israelites (cf. Gen 29:1, &#8220;eastern people,&#8221; or &#8220;easterners,&#8221; lit., &#8220;sons of the east&#8221;).</p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a man and his house.&#8221; Since this serves to explain &#8220;the sons of Israel,&#8221; it has the distributive sense. So while the &#8220;sons of Israel&#8221; refers to the actual sons of the patriarch, the expression includes their families (cf. NIV, TEV, CEV, NLT).</p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=6><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>) is often translated &#8220;soul.&#8221; But the word refers to the whole person, the body with the soul, and so &#8220;life&#8221; or &#8220;person&#8221; is frequently a better translation.</p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=7><b>tn</b> The expression in apposition to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>) literally says &#8220;those who went out from the loins of Jacob.&#8221; This distinguishes the entire company as his direct descendants.</p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=8><b>sn</b> Gen 46 describes in more detail Jacob&#8217;s coming to Egypt with his family. The Greek text of Exod 1:5 and of Gen 46:27 and two Qumran manuscripts, have the number as seventy-five, counting the people a little differently. E. H. Merrill in conjunction with F. Delitzsch notes that the list in Gen 46 of those who entered Egypt includes Hezron and Hamul, who did so <i>in potentia</i>, since they were born after the family entered Egypt. Joseph&#8217;s sons are also included, though they too were born in Egypt. &#8220;The list must not be pressed too literally&#8221; (E. H. Merrill, <i>Kingdom of Priests</i>,<i> </i>49).</p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=9><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Joseph was in Egypt&#8221; (so ASV). The disjunctive word order in Hebrew draws attention to the fact that Joseph, in contrast to his brothers, did not come to Egypt at the same time as Jacob.</p>
<a name="110"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=10><b>tn</b> The text simply uses the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive with the preterite, &#8220;and Joseph died.&#8221; While this construction shows sequence with the preceding verse, it does not require that the death follow directly the report of that verse. In fact, readers know from the record in Genesis that the death of Joseph occurred after a good number of years. The statement assumes the passage of time in the natural course of events.</p>
<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>tn</b> The verse has a singular verb, &#8220;and Joseph died, and all his brothers, and all that generation.&#8221; Typical of Hebrew style the verb need only agree with the first of a compound subject. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Since the deaths of &#8220;Joseph and his brothers and all that generation&#8221; were common knowledge, their mention must serve some rhetorical purpose. In contrast to the flourishing of Israel, there is death. This theme will appear again: In spite of death in Egypt, the nation flourishes. </p>

<a name="114"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=14><b>tn</b> Using <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1488;&#1465;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">od</font>) twice intensifies the idea of their becoming strong (see GKC 431-32 §133.<i>k</i>).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The text is clearly going out of its way to say that the people of Israel flourished in Egypt. The verbs <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">parah</font>, &#8220;be fruitful&#8221;), <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sharats</font>, &#8220;swarm, teem&#8221;), <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ravah</font>, &#8220;multiply&#8221;), and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">atsam</font>, &#8220;be strong, mighty&#8221;) form a literary link to the creation account in Genesis. The text describes Israel&#8217;s prosperity in the terms of God&#8217;s original command to be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth, to show that their prosperity was by divine blessing and in compliance with the will of God. The commission for the creation to fill the earth and subdue it would now begin to materialize through the seed of Abraham.</p>
<a name="115"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=15><b>sn</b> It would be difficult to identify who this &#8220;new king&#8221; might be, since the chronology of ancient Israel and Egypt is continually debated. Scholars who take the numbers in the Bible more or less at face value would place the time of Jacob&#8217;s going down to Egypt in about 1876 <span class="smallcaps">b.c</span>. This would put Joseph&#8217;s experience in the period prior to the Hyksos control of Egypt (1720-1570&#8217;s), and everything in the narrative about Joseph points to a native Egyptian setting and not a Hyksos one. Joseph&#8217;s death, then, would have been around 1806 <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span>, just a few years prior to the end of the 12th Dynasty of Egypt. This marked the end of the mighty Middle Kingdom of Egypt. The relationship between the Hyksos (also Semites) and the Israelites may have been amicable, and the Hyksos then might very well be the enemies that the Egyptians feared in Exodus 1:10. It makes good sense to see the new king who did not know Joseph as either the founder (Amosis, 1570-1546) or an early king of the powerful 18th Dynasty (like Thutmose I). Egypt under this new leadership drove out the Hyksos and reestablished Egyptian sovereignty. The new rulers certainly would have been concerned about an increasing Semite population in their territory (see E. H. Merrill, <i>Kingdom of Priests</i>, 49-55).</p>
<a name="116"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=16><b>tn</b> The relative clause comes last in the verse in Hebrew. It simply clarifies that the new king had no knowledge about Joseph. It also introduces a major theme in the early portion of Exodus, as a later Pharaoh will claim not to know who Yahweh is. The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, however, will work to make sure that Pharaoh and all Egypt will know that he is the true God.</p>

<a name="119"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=19><b>tn</b> The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>) introduces the foundational clause for the exhortation to follow by drawing the listeners&#8217; attention to the Israelites. In other words, the exhortation that follows is based on this observation. The connection could be rendered &#8220;since, because,&#8221; or the like.</p>
<a name="120"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=20><b>tn</b> The verb is the Hitpael cohortative of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khakam</font>, &#8220;to be wise&#8221;). This verb has the idea of acting shrewdly, dealing wisely. The basic idea in the word group is that of skill. So a skillful decision is required to prevent the Israelites from multiplying any more.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Pharaoh&#8217;s speech invites evaluation. How wise did his plans prove to be?</p>
<a name="121"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=21><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pen</font>) expresses fear or precaution and can also be translated &#8220;lest&#8221; or &#8220;else&#8221; (R. J. Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 75-76, §461).</p>
<a name="122"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=22><b>tn</b> The verb can be translated simply &#8220;will multiply,&#8221; but since Pharaoh has already indicated that he is aware they were doing that, the nuance here must mean to multiply all the more, or to continue to multiply. Cf. NIV &#8220;will become even more numerous.&#8221;</p>
<a name="123"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=23><b>tn</b> The words <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿhayah ki</font>) introduce a conditional clause &#8211; &#8220;if&#8221; (see GKC 335 §112.<i>y</i>).</p>
<a name="124"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=24><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and [lest] he [Israel] also be joined to.&#8221;</p>

These are the fears of the Egyptians. This explains why a shrewd policy of population control was required. They wanted to keep Israel enslaved; they did not want them to become too numerous and escape.</p>

It appears again in 2:14 and 18:21 and 25. Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1505;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mas</font>) refers to a labor gang organized to provide unpaid labor, or corvée (Deut 20:11; Josh 17:13; 1 Kgs 9:15, 21). The entire phrase has been translated &#8220;foremen,&#8221; which combines the idea of oversight and labor. Cf. KJV, NAB, NASB, NRSV &#8220;taskmasters&#8221;; NIV &#8220;slave masters&#8221;; NLT &#8220;slave drivers.&#8221;</p>

The word has a wide range of meanings. Here it would include physical abuse, forced subjugation, and humiliation. This king was trying to crush the spirit of Israel by increasing their slave labor. Other terms in the passage that describe this intent include &#8220;bitter&#8221; and &#8220;crushing.&#8221; </p>

The sequence expressed in this context includes the idea of result.</p>
<a name="130"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=30><b>sn</b> Many scholars assume that because this city was named Rameses, the Pharaoh had to be Rameses II, and hence that a late date for the exodus (and a late time for the sojourn in Egypt) is proved. But if the details of the context are taken as seriously as the mention of this name, this cannot be the case. If one grants for the sake of discussion that Rameses II was on the throne and oppressing Israel, it is necessary to note that Moses is not born yet. It would take about twenty or more years to build the city, then eighty more years before Moses appears before Pharaoh (Rameses), and then a couple of years for the plagues &#8211; this man would have been Pharaoh for over a hundred years. That is clearly not the case for the historical Rameses II. But even more determining is the fact that whoever the Pharaoh was for whom the Israelites built the treasure cities, he died before Moses began the plagues. The Bible says that when Moses grew up and killed the Egyptian, he fled from Pharaoh (whoever that was) and remained in exile until he heard that that Pharaoh had died. So this verse cannot be used for a date of the exodus in the days of Rameses, unless many other details in the chapters are ignored. If it is argued that Rameses was the Pharaoh of the oppression, then his successor would have been the Pharaoh of the exodus. Rameses reigned from 1304 <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span> until 1236 and then was succeeded by Merneptah. That would put the exodus far too late in time, for the Merneptah stela refers to Israel as a settled nation in their land. One would have to say that the name Rameses in this chapter may either refer to an earlier king, or, more likely, reflect an updating in the narrative to name the city according to its later name (it was called something else when they built it, but later Rameses finished it and named it after himself [see B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 14]). For further discussion see G. L. Archer, &#8220;An 18th Dynasty Ramses,&#8221; <i>JETS</i> 17 (1974): 49-50; and C. F. Aling, &#8220;The Biblical City of Ramses,&#8221; <i>JETS</i> 25 (1982): 129-37. Furthermore, for vv. 11-14, see K. A.

So these were women who assisted in the childbirth process. It seems probable that given the number of the Israelites in the passage, these two women could not have been the only Hebrew midwives, but they may have been over the midwives (Rashi). Moreover, the LXX and Vulgate do not take &#8220;Hebrew&#8221; as an adjective, but as a genitive after the construct, yielding &#8220;midwives of/over the Hebrews.&#8221; This leaves open the possibility that these women were not Hebrews. This would solve the question of how the king ever expected Hebrew midwives to kill Hebrew children. And yet, the two women have Hebrew names.</p>

<a name="146"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=46><b>sn</b> The instructions must have been temporary or selective, otherwise the decree from the king would have ended the slave population of Hebrews. It is also possible that the king did not think through this, but simply took steps to limit the population growth. The narrative is not interested in supplying details, only in portraying the king as a wicked fool bent on destroying Israel.</p>

The Piel often indicates a factitive nuance with stative verbs, showing the cause of the action. Here it means &#8220;let live, cause to live.&#8221; The verb is the exact opposite of Pharaoh&#8217;s command for them to kill the boys.</p>
<a name="150"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=50><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qara</font>&#8217;) followed by the <font face="Scholar">lamed</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font>) preposition has here the nuance of &#8220;summon.&#8221; The same construction is used later when Pharaoh summons Moses.</p>

It may indicate a simple sequence: &#8220;Why have you done&#8230;and (so that you) let live?&#8221; It could also indicate that this is a second question, &#8220;Why have you done &#8230;[why] have you let live?&#8221; </p>

They simply followed a higher authority that prohibited killing. Fearing God is a basic part of the true faith that leads to an obedient course of action and is not terrified by worldly threats. There probably was enough truth in what they were saying to be believable, but they clearly had no intention of honoring the king by participating in murder, and they saw no reason to give him a straightforward answer. God honored their actions. </p>

In this stem the word means &#8220;to cause good, treat well, treat favorably.&#8221; The <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive shows that this favor from God was a result of their fearing and obeying him. </p>

Finally, with this decree, he throws off any subtlety and commands the open extermination of Hebrew males. The verse forms a transition to the next chapter, in which Moses is saved by Pharaoh&#8217;s own daughter. These chapters show that the king&#8217;s efforts to destroy the strength of Israel &#8211; so clearly a work of God &#8211; met with failure again and again. And that failure involved the efforts of women, whom Pharaoh did not consider a threat. </p>
