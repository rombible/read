<A NAME="330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=185><b>tn</b> This vibrant description of the promised land is a familiar one. Gesenius classifies &#8220;milk and honey&#8221; as epexegetical genitives because they provide more precise description following a verbal adjective in the construct state (GKC 418-19 §128.<i>x</i>). The land is modified by &#8220;flowing,&#8221; and &#8220;flowing&#8221; is explained by the genitives &#8220;milk and honey.&#8221; These two products will be in abundance in the land, and they therefore exemplify what a desirable land it is. The language is hyperbolic, as if the land were streaming with these products.</p>
