<A NAME="322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=177><b>tn</b> The causal clause includes within it a typical relative clause, which is made up of the relative pronoun, then the independent personal pronoun with the participle, and then the preposition with the resumptive pronoun. It would literally be &#8220;which you are standing on it,&#8221; but the relative pronoun and the resumptive pronoun are combined and rendered, &#8220;on which you are standing.&#8221;</p>
