<A NAME="341"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=196><b>sn</b> In view of Moses&#8217; hesitancy, a sign is necessary to support the promise. A sign is often an unusual or miraculous event that introduces, authenticates, or illustrates the message. One expects a direct connection between the sign and the message (for a helpful discussion, see S. Porúbcan, &#8220;The Word &#8217;OT in Isaia 7,14,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 22 [1960]: 144-49). In this passage the sign is a confirming one, i.e., when Israel worships at the mountain that will be the proof that God delivered them from Egypt. Thus, the purpose of the exodus that makes possible the worship will be to prove that it was God who brought it about. In the meantime, Moses will have to trust in Yahweh. </p>
