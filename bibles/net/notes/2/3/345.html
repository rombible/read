<A NAME="345"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=200><b>sn</b> There has been considerable debate about the name of Yahweh in the Pentateuch, primarily because of theories that have maintained that the name Yahweh was not known in antiquity (see also 6:3 and notes there). The argument of this whole section nullifies that view. The idea that God&#8217;s name was revealed only here raises the question of what he was called earlier. The word &#8220;God&#8221; is not a name. &#8220;El Shaddai&#8221; is used only a few times in Genesis. But Israel would not have had a nameless deity &#8211; especially since Genesis says that from the very beginning people were making proclamation of the name of Yahweh (Gen 4:26; 12:8). It is possible that they did not always need a name if they were convinced that only he existed and there was no other God. But probably what Moses was anticipating was the Israelites&#8217; wanting to be sure that Moses came with a message from their God, and that some sign could prove it. They would have known his name (Yahweh), and they would have known the ways that he had manifested himself. It would do no good for Moses to come with a new name for God, for that would be like introducing them to a new God. That would in no way authenticate to them Moses&#8217; call, only confuse; after all, they would not be expecting a new name &#8211; they had been praying to their covenant God all along. They would want to be sure that their covenant God actually had sent Moses. To satisfy the Israelites Moses would have had to have been familiar with the name Yahweh &#8211; as they were &#8211; and know that he appeared to individuals. They would also want to know if Yahweh had sent Moses, how this was going to work in their deliverance, because they had been crying to him for deliverance. As it turned out, the Israelites had less problem with this than Moses anticipated &#8211; they were delighted when he came. It is likely that much of this concern was Moses&#8217; own need for assurance that this was indeed the God of the fathers and that the promised deliverance was now to take place.</p>
