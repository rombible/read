<A NAME="372"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=227><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from the sojourner.&#8221; Both the &#8220;neighbor&#8221; and the &#8220;sojourner&#8221; (&#8220;one who happens to be staying in her house&#8221;) are feminine. The difference between them seems to be primarily that the second is temporary, &#8220;a lodger&#8221; perhaps or &#8220;visitor,&#8221; while the first has permanent residence.</p>
