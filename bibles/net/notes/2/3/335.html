<A NAME="335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=190><b>tn</b> The verse has a sequence of volitives. The first form is the imperative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿkha</font>, &#8220;go&#8221;). Then comes the cohortative/imperfect form with the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>), &#8220;and I will send you&#8221; or more likely &#8220;that I may send you&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1495;&#1458;&#1498;&#1464;</font>, <font face="Scholar">vÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eshlakhakha</font>), which is followed by the imperative with the <i>vav</i>, &#8220;and bring out&#8221; or &#8220;that you may bring out&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1510;&#1461;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">vÿhotse</font>&#8217;). The series of actions begins with Moses going. When he goes, it will be the <sc>Lord who sends him, and if the <sc>Lord sends him, it will be with the purpose of leading Israel out of Egypt.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> These instructions for Moses are based on the preceding revelation made to him. The deliverance of Israel was to be God&#8217;s work &#8211; hence, &#8220;I will send you.&#8221; When God commissioned people, often using the verb &#8220;to send,&#8221; it indicated that they went with his backing, his power, and his authority. Moses could not have brought Israel out without this. To name this incident a commissioning, then, means that the authority came from God to do the work (compare John 3:2).</p>
