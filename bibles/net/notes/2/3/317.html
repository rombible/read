<A NAME="317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=172><b>sn</b> The repetition of the name in God&#8217;s call is emphatic, making the appeal direct and immediate (see also Gen 22:11; 46:2). The use of the personal name shows how specifically God directed the call and that he knew this person. The repetition may have stressed even more that it was indeed he whom the <sc>Lord wanted. It would have been an encouragement to Moses that this was in fact the <sc>Lord who was meeting him. </p>
