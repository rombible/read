<A NAME="365"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=220><b><i>tn</i></b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and not with a mighty hand.&#8221; This expression (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1491; &#1495;&#1458;&#1494;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">vÿlo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> vÿyad khazaqa</font>) is unclear, since v. 20 says that God will stretch out his hand and do his wonders. Some have taken v. 19b to refer to God&#8217;s mighty hand also, meaning that the king would not let them go unless a mighty hand compels him (NIV). The expression &#8220;mighty hand&#8221; is used of God&#8217;s rescuing Israel elsewhere (Exod 6:1, 13:9, 32:11; but note also Num 20:20). This idea is a rather general interpretation of the words; it owes much to the LXX, which has &#8220;except by a mighty hand,&#8221; though &#8220;and not with&#8221; does not have the meaning of &#8220;except&#8221; or &#8220;unless&#8221; in other places. In view of these difficulties, others have suggested that v. 19b means &#8220;strong [threats]&#8221; from the Israelites (as in 4:24ff. and 5:3; see B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 81). This does not seem as convincing as the first view. Another possibility is that the phrase conveys Pharaoh&#8217;s point of view and intention; the Lord knows that Pharaoh plans to resist letting the Israelites go, regardless of the exercise of a strong hand against him (P. Addinall, &#8220;Exodus III 19B and the Interpretation of Biblical Narrative,&#8221; <i>VT </i>49 [1999]: 289-300; see also the construction &#8220;and not with&#8221; in Num 12:8; 1 Sam 20:15 and elsewhere). If that is the case, v. 20 provides an ironic and pointed contradiction to Pharaoh&#8217;s plans as the Lord announces the effect that his hand will have. At any rate, Pharaoh will have to be forced to let Israel go.</p>
