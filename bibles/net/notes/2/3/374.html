<A NAME="374"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=229><b>sn</b> It is clear that God intended the Israelites to plunder the Egyptians, as they might a defeated enemy in war. They will not go out &#8220;empty.&#8221; They will &#8220;plunder&#8221; Egypt. This verb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1501;</font> [<font face="Scholar">vÿnitsaltem</font>] from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1500;</font> [<font face="Scholar">natsal</font>]) usually means &#8220;rescue, deliver,&#8221; as if plucking out of danger. But in this stem it carries the idea of plunder. So when the text says that they will ask (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1458;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">vÿsha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alah</font>) their neighbors for things, it implies that they will be making many demands, and the Egyptians will respond like a defeated nation before victors. The spoils that Israel takes are to be regarded as back wages or compensation for the oppression (see also Deut 15:13). See further B. Jacob, &#8220;The Gifts of the Egyptians, a Critical Commentary,&#8221; <i>Journal of Reformed Judaism</i> 27 (1980): 59-69; and T. C. Vriezen, &#8220;A Reinterpretation of Exodus 3:21-22 and Related Texts,&#8221; <i>Ex Oriente Lux</i> 23 (1975): 389-401.</p>
