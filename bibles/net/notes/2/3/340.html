<A NAME="340"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=195><b>tn</b> The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) has the asseverative use here, &#8220;surely, indeed,&#8221; which is frequently found with oaths (R. J. Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 73, §449). The imperfect tense <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ehyeh</font>) could be rendered as the future tense, &#8220;I will be&#8221; or the present tense &#8220;I am&#8221; with you. The future makes the better sense in this case, since the subject matter is the future mission. But since it is a stative verb, the form will also lend itself nicely to explaining the divine name &#8211; he is the One who is eternally present &#8211; &#8220;I am with you always.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Here is the introduction of the main motif of the commission, which will be the explanation of the divine name. It will make little difference who the servant is or what that servant&#8217;s abilities might be, if God is present. The mention of God&#8217;s presence is not a simple catch-phrase; it represents abundant provisions to the believer (see below on v. 14).</p>
