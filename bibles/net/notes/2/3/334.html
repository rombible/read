<A NAME="334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=189><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.&#8221; The word for the oppression is now <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lakhats</font>), which has the idea of pressure with the oppression &#8211; squeezing, pressuring &#8211; which led to its later use in the Semitic languages for torture. The repetition in the Hebrew text of the root in the participle form after this noun serves to stress the idea. This emphasis has been represented in the translation by the expression &#8220;seen how severely the Egyptians oppress them.&#8221;</p>
