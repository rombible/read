<A NAME="37"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=162><b>sn</b> Fire frequently accompanies the revelation of Yahweh in Exodus as he delivers Israel, guides her, and purifies her. The description here is unique, calling attention to the manifestation as a flame of fire from within the bush. Philo was the first to interpret the bush as Israel, suffering under the persecution of Egypt but never consumed. The Bible leaves the interpretation open. However, in this revelation the fire is coming from within the bush, not from outside, and it represents the <sc>Lord who will deliver his people from persecution. See further E. Levine, &#8220;The Evolving Symbolism of the Burning Bush,&#8221; <i>Dor le Dor</i> 8 (1979): 185-93.</p>
