<A NAME="355"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=210><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">paqad</font>) has traditionally been rendered &#8220;to visit.&#8221; This only partially communicates the point of the word. When God &#8220;visited&#8221; someone, it meant that he intervened in their lives to change their circumstances or their destiny. When he visited the Amalekites, he destroyed them (1 Sam 15:2). When he visited Sarah, he provided the long awaited child (Gen 21:1). It refers to God&#8217;s active involvement in human affairs for blessing or for cursing. Here it would mean that God had begun to act to deliver the Israelites from bondage and give them the blessings of the covenant. The form is joined here with the infinitive absolute to underscore the certainty &#8211; &#8220;I have indeed visited you.&#8221; Some translate it &#8220;remember&#8221;; others say &#8220;watch over.&#8221; These do not capture the idea of intervention to bless, and often with the idea of vengeance or judgment on the oppressors. If God were to visit what the Egyptians did, he would stop the oppression and also bring retribution for it. The nuance of the perfect tense could be a perfect of resolve (&#8220;I have decided to visit&#8221;), or an instantaneous perfect ( &#8220;I hereby visit&#8221;), or a prophetic perfect (&#8220;I have visited&#8221; = &#8220;I will visit&#8221;). The infinitive absolute reinforces the statement (so &#8220;carefully&#8221;), the rendering &#8220;attended to&#8221; attempts to convey the ideas of personal presence, mental awareness, and action, as when a nurse or physician &#8220;attends&#8221; a patient.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The same word was used in the same kind of construction at the end of Genesis (50:24) when Joseph promised, &#8220;God will surely visit you&#8221; (but there the imperfect tense with the infinitive absolute). Here is another link to the patriarchal narratives. This work of Moses would be interpreted as a fulfillment of Joseph&#8217;s prophecy. </p>
