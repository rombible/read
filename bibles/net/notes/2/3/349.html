<A NAME="349"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=204><b>sn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Yahweh,&#8221; traditionally rendered &#8220;the <sc>Lord.&#8221; First the verb &#8220;I AM&#8221; was used (v. 14) in place of the name to indicate its meaning and to remind Moses of God&#8217;s promise to be with him (v. 12). Now in v. 15 the actual name is used for clear identification: &#8220;Yahweh&#8230;has sent me.&#8221; This is the name that the patriarchs invoked and proclaimed in the land of Canaan. </p>
