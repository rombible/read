<A NAME="34"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=159><b>sn</b> The designation &#8220;the angel of the <sc>Lord&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;the angel of Yahweh&#8221;) occurred in Genesis already (16:7-13; 21:17; 22:11-18). There is some ambiguity in the expression, but it seems often to be interchangeable with God&#8217;s name itself, indicating that it refers to the <sc>Lord. </p>
