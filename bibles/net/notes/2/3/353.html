<A NAME="353"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=208><b>sn</b> &#8220;The God of your fathers&#8221; is in simple apposition to the name &#8220;the <sc>Lord&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;Yahweh&#8221;) as a recognizable identification. If the holy name were a new one to the Israelites, an explanation would have been needed. Meanwhile, the title &#8220;God of my/your/our father(s)&#8221; was widely used in the ancient Near East and also in Genesis (26:24; 28:13; 31:5, 29; 46:1, 3; N. M. Sarna, <i>Exodus</i> [JPSTC],<i> </i>268).</p>
