<A NAME="342"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=197><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ta</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avdun</font>, &#8220;you will serve&#8221;) is one of the foremost words for worship in the Torah. Keeping the commandments and serving Yahweh usually sum up the life of faith; the true worshiper seeks to obey him. The highest title anyone can have in the OT is &#8220;the servant of Yahweh.&#8221; The verb here could be rendered interpretively as &#8220;worship,&#8221; but it is better to keep it to the basic idea of serving because that emphasizes an important aspect of worship, and it highlights the change from Israel&#8217;s serving Egypt, which has been prominent in the earlier chapters. The words &#8220;and they&#8221; are supplied to clarify for English readers that the subject of the verb is plural (Moses and the people), unlike the other second person forms in vv. 10 and 12, which are singular.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This sign is also a promise from God &#8211; &#8220;you will serve God on this mountain.&#8221; It is given to Moses here as a goal, but a goal already achieved because it was a sign from God. Leading Israel out of Egypt would not be completed until they came to this mountain and served God. God does not give Moses details of what will take place on the road to Sinai, but he does give him the goal and glimpses of the defeat of Pharaoh. The rest will require Moses and the people to trust in this God who had a plan and who had the power to carry it out. </p>
