<A NAME="350"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=205><b>sn</b> The words &#8220;name&#8221; and &#8220;memorial&#8221; are at the heart of the two parallel clauses that form a poetic pair. The Hebrew word &#8220;remembrance&#8221; is a poetical synonym for &#8220;name&#8221; (cf. Job 18:17; Ps 135:13; Prov 10:7; Isa 26:8) and conveys the idea that the nature or character of the person is to be remembered and praised (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 24). </p>
