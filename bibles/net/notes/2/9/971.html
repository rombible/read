<A NAME="971"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=645><b>tn</b> The adverb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">terem</font>, &#8220;before, not yet&#8221;) occurs with the imperfect tense to give the sense of the English present tense to the verb negated by it (GKC 314-15 §107.<i>c</i>). Moses is saying that he knew that Pharaoh did not really stand in awe of God, so as to grant Israel&#8217;s release, i.e., fear not in the religious sense but &#8220;be afraid of&#8221; God &#8211; fear &#8220;before&#8221; him (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 76). </p>
