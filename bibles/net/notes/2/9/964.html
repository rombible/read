<A NAME="964"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=638><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rasha</font>&#8217;) can mean &#8220;ungodly, wicked, guilty, criminal.&#8221; Pharaoh here is saying that Yahweh is right, and the Egyptians are not &#8211; so they are at fault, guilty. S. R. Driver says the words are used in their forensic sense (in the right or wrong standing legally) and not in the ethical sense of morally right and wrong (<i>Exodus</i>, 75).</p>
