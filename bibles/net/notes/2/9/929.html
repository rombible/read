<A NAME="929"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=603><b>tn</b> The verb is the Qal perfect <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shalakhti</font>), but a past tense, or completed action translation does not fit the context at all. Gesenius lists this reference as an example of the use of the perfect to express actions and facts, whose accomplishment is to be represented not as actual but only as possible. He offers this for Exod 9:15: &#8220;I had almost put forth&#8221; (GKC 313 §106.<i>p</i>). Also possible is &#8220;I should have stretched out my hand.&#8221; Others read the potential nuance instead, and render it as &#8220;I could have&#8230;&#8221; as in the present translation.</p>
