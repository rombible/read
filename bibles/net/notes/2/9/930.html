<A NAME="930"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=604><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kakhad</font>) means &#8220;to hide, efface,&#8221; and in the Niphal it has the idea of &#8220;be effaced, ruined, destroyed.&#8221; Here it will carry the nuance of the result of the preceding verbs: &#8220;I could have stretched out my hand&#8230;and struck you&#8230;and (as a result) you would have been destroyed.&#8221; </p>
