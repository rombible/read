<A NAME="932"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=606><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1462;&#1506;&#1457;&#1502;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">he</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">emadtikha</font>) is the Hiphil perfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amad</font>). It would normally mean &#8220;I caused you to stand.&#8221; But that seems to have one or two different connotations. S. R. Driver (<i>Exodus</i>, 73) says that it means &#8220;maintain you alive.&#8221; The causative of this verb means &#8220;continue,&#8221; according to him. The LXX has the same basic sense &#8211; &#8220;you were preserved.&#8221; But Paul bypasses the Greek and writes &#8220;he raised you up&#8221; to show God&#8217;s absolute sovereignty over Pharaoh. Both renderings show God&#8217;s sovereign control over Pharaoh.</p>
