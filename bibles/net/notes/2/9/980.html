<A NAME="980"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">80</span><note=654><b>tn</b> The construction is another verbal hendiadys: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1505;&#1462;&#1507; &#1500;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1496;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyosef lakhatto</font>&#8217;), literally rendered &#8220;and he added to sin.&#8221; The infinitive construct becomes the main verb, and the Hiphil preterite becomes adverbial. The text is clearly interpreting as sin the hardening of Pharaoh&#8217;s heart and his refusal to release Israel. At the least this means that the plagues are his fault, but the expression probably means more than this &#8211; he was disobeying Yahweh God.</p>
