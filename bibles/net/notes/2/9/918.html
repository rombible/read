<A NAME="918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=592><b>sn</b> This sixth plague, like the third, is unannounced. God instructs his servants to take handfuls of ashes from the Egyptians&#8217; furnaces and sprinkle them heavenward in the sight of Pharaoh. These ashes would become little particles of dust that would cause boils on the Egyptians and their animals. Greta Hort, &#8220;The Plagues of Egypt,&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 69 [1957]: 101-3, suggests it is skin anthrax (see W. C. Kaiser, Jr., &#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:359). The lesson of this plague is that Yahweh has absolute control over the physical health of the people. Physical suffering consequent to sin comes to all regardless of their position and status. The Egyptians are helpless in the face of this, as now God begins to touch human life; greater judgments on human wickedness lie ahead. </p>
