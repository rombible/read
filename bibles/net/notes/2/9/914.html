<A NAME="914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=588><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;all&#8221; clearly does not mean &#8220;all&#8221; in the exclusive sense, because subsequent plagues involve cattle. The word must denote such a large number that whatever was left was insignificant for the economy. It could also be taken to mean &#8220;all [kinds of] livestock died.&#8221;</p>
