<A NAME="71"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=434><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;like&#8221; is added for clarity, making explicit the implied comparison in the statement &#8220;I have made you God to Pharaoh.&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohim</font>) is used a few times in the Bible for humans (e.g., Pss 45:6; 82:1), and always clearly in the sense of a subordinate to GOD &#8211; they are his representatives on earth. The explanation here goes back to 4:16. If Moses is like God in that Aaron is his prophet, then Moses is certainly like God to Pharaoh. Only Moses, then, is able to speak to Pharaoh with such authority, giving him commands. </p>
