<A NAME="759"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=492><b>tn</b> The text has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1514; &#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465; &#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1501;&#1470;&#1500;&#1464;&#1494;&#1465;&#1488;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿlo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">-shat libbo gam-lazo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">t</font>), which literally says, &#8220;and he did not set his heart also to this.&#8221; To &#8220;set the heart&#8221; to something would mean &#8220;to consider it.&#8221; This Hebrew idiom means that he did not pay attention to it, or take it to heart (cf. 2 Sam 13:20; Ps 48:13; 62:10; Prov 22:17; 24:32). Since Pharaoh had not been affected by this, he did not consider it or its implications further. </p>
