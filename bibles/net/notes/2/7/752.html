<A NAME="752"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=485><b>tn</b> The first clause in this verse begins with a <i>vav</i> disjunctive, introducing a circumstantial clause to the statement that the water stank. The <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive on the next verb shows that the smell was the result of the dead fish in the contaminated water. The result is then expressed with the <i>vav</i> beginning the clause that states that they could not drink it.</p>
