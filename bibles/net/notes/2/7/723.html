<A NAME="723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=456><b>tn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1496;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿlahatehem</font>) means &#8220;by their secret arts&#8221;; it is from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;</font> (<i>lut</i>, &#8220;to enwrap&#8221;). The Greek renders the word &#8220;by their magic&#8221;; <i>Tg. Onq.</i> uses &#8220;murmurings&#8221; and &#8220;whispers,&#8221; and other Jewish sources &#8220;dazzling display&#8221; or &#8220;demons&#8221; (see further B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 253-54). They may have done this by clever tricks, manipulation of the animals, or demonic power. Many have suggested that Aaron and the magicians were familiar with an old trick in which they could temporarily paralyze a serpent and then revive it. But here Aaron&#8217;s snake swallows up their snakes. </p>
