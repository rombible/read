<A NAME="736"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=469><b>tn</b> The final <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ad-koh</font>, &#8220;until now&#8221;) narrows the use of the perfect tense to the present perfect: &#8220;you have not listened.&#8221; That verb, however, involves more than than mere audition. It has the idea of responding to, hearkening, and in some places obeying; here &#8220;you have not complied&#8221; might catch the point of what Moses is saying, while &#8220;listen&#8221; helps to maintain the connection with other uses of the verb.</p>
