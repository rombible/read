<A NAME="741"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=474><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">la</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">a</font>), here in the Niphal perfect with a <i>vav</i> consecutive, means &#8220;be weary, impatient.&#8221; The Niphal meaning is &#8220;make oneself weary&#8221; in doing something, or &#8220;weary (strenuously exert) oneself.&#8221; It seems always to indicate exhausted patience (see BDB 521 s.v.). The term seems to imply that the Egyptians were not able to drink the red, contaminated water, and so would expend all their energy looking for water to drink &#8211; in frustration of course. </p>
