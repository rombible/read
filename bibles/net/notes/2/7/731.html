<A NAME="731"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=464><b>sn</b> The Nile, the source of fertility for the country, was deified by the Egyptians. There were religious festivals held to the god of the Nile, especially when the Nile was flooding. The Talmud suggests that Pharaoh in this passage went out to the Nile to make observations as a magician about its level. Others suggest he went out simply to bathe or to check the water level &#8211; but that would not change the view of the Nile that was prevalent in the land. </p>
