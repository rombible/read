<A NAME="74"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=437><b>tn</b> The phrase translated &#8220;everything I command you&#8221; is a noun clause serving as the direct object of the verb &#8220;speak.&#8221; The verb in the clause (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1510;&#1463;&#1493;&#1468;&#1462;&#1498;&#1464;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">atsavvekha</font>) is the Piel imperfect. It could be classified as a future: &#8220;everything that I will command you.&#8221; A nuance of progressive imperfect also fits well: &#8220;everything that I am commanding you.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The distinct emphasis is important. Aaron will speak to the people and Pharaoh what Moses tells him, and Moses will speak to Aaron what God commands him. The use of &#8220;command&#8221; keeps everything in perspective for Moses&#8217; position. </p>
