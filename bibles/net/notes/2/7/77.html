<A NAME="77"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=440><b>tn</b> The form beginning the second half of the verse is the perfect tense with <font face="Scholar">vav </font>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hirbeti</font>). It could be translated as a simple future in sequence after the imperfect preceding it, but the logical connection is not obvious. Since it carries the force of an imperfect due to the sequence, it may be subordinated as a temporal clause to the next clause that begins in v. 4. That maintains the flow of the argument.</p>
