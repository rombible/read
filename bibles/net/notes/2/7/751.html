<A NAME="751"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=484><b>sn</b> There have been various attempts to explain the details of this plague or blow. One possible suggestion is that the plague turned the Nile into &#8220;blood,&#8221; but that it gradually turned back to its normal color and substance. However, the effects of the &#8220;blood&#8221; polluted the water so that dead fish and other contamination left it undrinkable. This would explain how the magicians could also do it &#8211; they would not have tried if all water was already turned to blood. It also explains why Pharaoh did not ask for the water to be turned back. This view was put forward by B. Schor; it is summarized by B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>,<i> </i>258), who prefers the view of Rashi that the blow affected only water in use.</p>
