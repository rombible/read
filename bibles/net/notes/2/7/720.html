<A NAME="720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=453><b>tn</b> The noun used here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tannin</font>), and not the word for &#8220;serpent&#8221; or &#8220;snake&#8221; used in chap. 4. This noun refers to a large reptile, in some texts large river or sea creatures (Gen 1:21; Ps 74:13) or land creatures (Deut 32:33). This wonder paralleled Moses&#8217; miracle in 4:3 when he cast his staff down. But this is Aaron&#8217;s staff, and a different miracle. The noun could still be rendered &#8220;snake&#8221; here since the term could be broad enough to include it.</p>
