<A NAME="2959"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=1970><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1496;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;&#1514;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿhitte</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ta</font>), a Piel perfect of the word usually translated &#8220;to sin.&#8221; Here it may be interpreted as a privative Piel (as in Ps 51:7 [9]), with the sense of &#8220;un-sin&#8221; or &#8220;remove sin.&#8221; It could also be interpreted as related to the word for &#8220;sin offering,&#8221; and so be a denominative verb. It means &#8220;to purify, cleanse.&#8221; The Hebrews understood that sin and contamination could corrupt and pollute even things, and so they had to be purged.</p>
