<A NAME="2963"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=1974><b>sn</b> This line states an unusual principle, meant to preserve the sanctity of the altar. S. R. Driver explains it this way (<i>Exodus</i>, 325): If anything comes in contact with the altar, it becomes holy and must remain in the sanctuary for Yahweh&#8217;s use. If a person touches the altar, he likewise becomes holy and cannot return to the profane regions. He will be given over to God to be dealt with as God pleases. Anyone who was not qualified to touch the altar did not dare approach it, for contact would have meant that he was no longer free to leave but was God&#8217;s holy possession &#8211; and might pay for it with his life (see Exod 30:29; Lev 6:18b, 27; and Ezek 46:20). </p>
