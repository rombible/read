<A NAME="2948"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1959><b>sn</b> The &#8220;holy place&#8221; must be in the courtyard of the sanctuary. Lev 8:31 says it is to be cooked at the entrance of the tent of meeting. Here it says it will be eaten there as well. This, then, becomes a communion sacrifice, a peace offering which was a shared meal. Eating a communal meal in a holy place was meant to signify that the worshipers and the priests were at peace with God. </p>
