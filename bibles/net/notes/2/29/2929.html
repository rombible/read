<A NAME="2929"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1940><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">isheh</font>) has traditionally been translated &#8220;an offering made with fire&#8221; or the like, because it appears so obviously connected with fire. But further evidence from Ugaritic suggests that it might only mean &#8220;a gift&#8221; (see Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i>, 161).</p>
