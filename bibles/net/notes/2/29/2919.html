<A NAME="2919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1930><b>sn</b> The details of these offerings have to be determined from a careful study of Leviticus. There is a good deal of debate over the meaning of laying hands on the animals. At the very least it identifies the animal formally as their sacrifice. But it may very well indicate that the animal is a substitute for them as well, given the nature and the effect of the sacrifices. </p>
