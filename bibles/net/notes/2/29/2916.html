<A NAME="2916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1927><b>tc</b> Hebrew has both the objective pronoun &#8220;them&#8221; and the names &#8220;Aaron and his sons.&#8221; Neither the LXX nor Leviticus 8:13 has &#8220;Aaron and his sons,&#8221; suggesting that this may have been a later gloss in the text.</p>
