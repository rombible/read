<A NAME="2945"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1956><b>tn</b> The text just has the relative pronoun and the imperfect tense. It could be translated &#8220;who comes/enters.&#8221; But the context seems to indicate that this would be when he first comes to the tent to begin his tenure as High Priest, and so a temporal clause makes this clear. &#8220;First&#8221; has been supplied.</p>
