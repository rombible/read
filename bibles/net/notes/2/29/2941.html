<A NAME="2941"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1952><b>sn</b> These are the two special priestly offerings: the wave offering (from the verb &#8220;to wave&#8221;) and the &#8220;presentation offering&#8221; (older English: heave offering; from a verb &#8220;to be high,&#8221; in Hiphil meaning &#8220;to lift up,&#8221; an item separated from the offering, a contribution). The two are then clarified with two corresponding relative clauses containing two Hophals: &#8220;which was waved and which was presented.&#8221; In making sacrifices, the breast and the thigh belong to the priests. </p>
