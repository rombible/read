<A NAME="2926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1937><b>sn</b> There were two kinds of &#8220;purification offering,&#8221; those made with confession for sin and those made without. The title needs to cover both of them, and if it is called in the traditional way &#8220;the sin offering,&#8221; that will convey that when people offered it for skin diseases, menstruation, or having babies, they had sinned. That was not the case. Moreover, it is usual to translate the names of the sacrifices by what they do more than what they cover &#8211; so peace offering, reparation offering, and purification offering. </p>
