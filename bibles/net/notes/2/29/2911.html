<A NAME="2911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1922><b>sn</b> This is the washing referred to in Lev 8:6. This is a complete washing, not just of the hands and feet that would follow in the course of service. It had to serve as a symbolic ritual cleansing or purifying as the initial stage in the consecration. The imagery of washing will be used in the NT for regeneration (Titus 3:5). </p>
