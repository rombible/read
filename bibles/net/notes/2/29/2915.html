The psalms indicate that no oil was spared in this ritual, for it ran down his beard and to the hem of his garment. Oil of anointing was used for all major offices (giving the label with the passive adjective &#8220;<font face="Scholar">mashiah</font>&#8221; (or &#8220;messiah&#8221;) to anyone anointed. In the further revelation of Scripture, the oil came to signify the enablement as well as the setting apart, and often the Holy Spirit came on the person at the anointing with oil. The olive oil was a symbol of the Spirit in the OT as well (Zech 4:4-6). And in the NT &#8220;anointing&#8221; signifies empowerment by the Holy Spirit for service. </p>
