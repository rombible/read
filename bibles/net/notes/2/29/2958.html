<A NAME="2958"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=1969><b>sn</b> It is difficult to understand how this verse is to be harmonized with the other passages. The ceremony in the earlier passages deals with atonement made for the priests, for people. But here it is the altar that is being sanctified. The &#8220;sin [purification] offering&#8221; seems to be for purification of the sanctuary and altar to receive people in their worship. </p>
