<A NAME="297"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1918><b>tn</b> The &#8220;fine flour&#8221; is here an adverbial accusative, explaining the material from which these items were made. The flour is to be finely sifted, and from the wheat, not the barley, which was often the material used by the poor. Fine flour, no leaven, and perfect animals, without blemishes, were to be gathered for this service. </p>
