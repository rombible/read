<A NAME="2411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1641><b>tn</b> The verb is the imperfect tense (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">na</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aseh</font>), although the form could be classified as a cohortative. If the latter, they would be saying that they are resolved to do what God said. If it is an imperfect, then the desiderative would make the most sense: &#8220;we are willing to do.&#8221; They are not presumptuously saying they are going to do all these things. </p>
