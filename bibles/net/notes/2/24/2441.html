<A NAME="2441"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1671><b>sn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyishkon</font>, &#8220;and dwelt, abode&#8221;). From this is derived the epithet &#8220;the Shekinah Glory,&#8221; the dwelling or abiding glory. The &#8220;glory of Yahweh&#8221; was a display visible at a distance, clearly in view of the Israelites. To them it was like a consuming fire in the midst of the cloud that covered the mountain. That fire indicated that Yahweh wished to accept their sacrifice, as if it were a pleasant aroma to him, as Leviticus would say. This &#8220;appearance&#8221; indicated that the phenomena represented a shimmer of the likeness of his glory (B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 749). The verb, according to U. Cassuto (<i>Exodus</i>, 316), also gives an inkling of the next section of the book, the building of the &#8220;tabernacle,&#8221; the dwelling place, the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mishkan</font>). The vision of the glory of Yahweh confirmed the authority of the revelation of the Law given to Israel. This chapter is the climax of God&#8217;s bringing people into covenant with himself, the completion of his revelation to them, a completion that is authenticated with the miraculous. It ends with the mediator going up in the clouds to be with God, and the people down below eagerly awaiting his return. The message of the whole chapter could be worded this way: Those whom God sanctifies by the blood of the covenant and instructs by the book of the covenant may enjoy fellowship with him and anticipate a far more glorious fellowship. So too in the NT the commandments and teachings of Jesus are confirmed by his miraculous deeds and by his glorious manifestation on the Mount of the Transfiguration, where a few who represented the disciples would see his glory and be able to teach others. The people of the new covenant have been brought into fellowship with God through the blood of the covenant; they wait eagerly for his return from heaven in the clouds. </p>
