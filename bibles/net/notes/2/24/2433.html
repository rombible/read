<A NAME="2433"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1663><b>sn</b> These are the stone tablets on which the Ten Commandments would be written. This is the first time they are mentioned. The commandments were apparently proclaimed by God first and then proclaimed to the people by Moses. Now that they have been formally agreed on and ratified, they will be written by God on stone for a perpetual covenant. </p>
