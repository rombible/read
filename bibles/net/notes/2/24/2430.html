<A NAME="2430"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1660><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1494;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khazah</font>); it can mean &#8220;to see, perceive&#8221; or &#8220;see a vision&#8221; as the prophets did. The LXX safeguarded this by saying, &#8220;appeared in the place of God.&#8221; B. Jacob says they beheld &#8211; prophetically, religiously (<i>Exodus</i>, 746) &#8211; but the meaning of that is unclear. The fact that God did not lay a hand on them &#8211; to kill them &#8211; shows that they saw something that they never expected to see and live. Some Christian interpreters have taken this to refer to a glorious appearance of the preincarnate Christ, the second person of the Trinity. They saw the brilliance of this manifestation &#8211; but not the detail. Later, Moses will still ask to see God&#8217;s glory &#8211; the real presence behind the phenomena.</p>
