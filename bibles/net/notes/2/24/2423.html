<A NAME="2423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1653><b>sn</b> The construct relationship &#8220;the blood of the covenant&#8221; means &#8220;the blood by which the covenant is ratified&#8221; (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 254). The parallel with the inauguration of the new covenant in the blood of Christ is striking (see, e.g., Matt 26:28, 1 Cor 11:25). When Jesus was inaugurating the new covenant, he was bringing to an end the old. </p>
