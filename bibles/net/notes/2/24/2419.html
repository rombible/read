<A NAME="2419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1649><b>tn</b> The noun &#8220;book&#8221; would be the scroll just written containing the laws of chaps. 20-23. On the basis of this scroll the covenant would be concluded here. The reading of this book would assure the people that it was the same that they had agreed to earlier. But now their statement of willingness to obey would be more binding, because their promise would be confirmed by a covenant of blood. </p>
