<A NAME="244"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1634><b>sn</b> These seventy-four people were to go up the mountain to a certain point. Then they were to prostrate themselves and worship Yahweh as Moses went further up into the presence of Yahweh. Moses occupies the lofty position of mediator (as Christ in the NT), for he alone ascends &#8220;to Yahweh&#8221; while everyone waits for his return. The emphasis of &#8220;bowing down&#8221; and that from &#8220;far off&#8221; stresses again the ominous presence that was on the mountain. This was the holy God &#8211; only the designated mediator could draw near to him. </p>
