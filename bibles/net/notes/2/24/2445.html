<A NAME="2445"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1675><b>sn</b> B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 750) offers this description of some of the mystery involved in Moses&#8217; ascending into the cloud: Moses ascended into the presence of God, but remained on earth. He did not rise to heaven &#8211; the ground remained firmly under his feet. But he clearly was brought into God&#8217;s presence; he was like a heavenly servant before God&#8217;s throne, like the angels, and he consumed neither bread nor water. The purpose of his being there was to become familiar with all God&#8217;s demands and purposes. He would receive the tablets of stone and all the instructions for the tabernacle that was to be built (beginning in chap. 25). He would not descend until the sin of the golden calf.</p>
