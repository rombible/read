<A NAME="241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1631><b>sn</b> Exod 24 is the high point of the book in many ways, but most importantly, here Yahweh makes a covenant with the people &#8211; the Sinaitic Covenant. The unit not only serves to record the event in Israel&#8217;s becoming a nation, but it provides a paradigm of the worship of God&#8217;s covenant people &#8211; entering into the presence of the glory of Yahweh. See additionally W. A. Maier, &#8220;The Analysis of Exodus 24 According to Modern Literary, Form, and Redaction Critical Methodology,&#8221; <i>Springfielder</i> 37 (1973): 35-52. The passage may be divided into four parts for exposition: vv. 1-2, the call for worship; vv. 3-8, the consecration of the worshipers; vv. 9-11, the confirmation of the covenant; and vv. 12-18, the communication with Yahweh. </p>
