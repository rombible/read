<A NAME="2412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1642><b>tn</b> The two preterites quite likely form a verbal hendiadys (the verb &#8220;to get up early&#8221; is frequently in such constructions). Literally it says, &#8220;and he got up early [in the morning] and he built&#8221;; this means &#8220;early [in the morning] he built.&#8221; The first verb becomes the adverb. </p>
