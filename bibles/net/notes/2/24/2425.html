<A NAME="2425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1655><b>sn</b> S. R. Driver (<i>Exodus</i>, 254) wishes to safeguard the traditional idea that God could not be seen by reading &#8220;they saw the place where the God of Israel stood&#8221; so as not to say they saw God. But according to U. Cassuto there is not a great deal of difference between &#8220;and they saw the God&#8221; and &#8220;the <sc>Lord God appeared&#8221; (<i>Exodus</i>, 314). He thinks that the word &#8220;God&#8221; is used instead of &#8220;Yahweh&#8221; to say that a divine phenomenon was seen. It is in the LXX that they add &#8220;the place where he stood.&#8221; In v. 11b the LXX has &#8220;and they appeared in the place of God.&#8221; See James Barr, &#8220;Theophany and Anthropomorphism in the Old Testament,&#8221; VTSup 7 (1959): 31-33. There is no detailed description here of what they saw (cf. Isa 6; Ezek 1). What is described amounts to what a person could see when prostrate.</p>
