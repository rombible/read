<A NAME="91"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=575><b>sn</b> This plague demonstrates that Yahweh has power over the livestock of Egypt. He is able to strike the animals with disease and death, thus delivering a blow to the economic as well as the religious life of the land. By the former plagues many of the Egyptian religious ceremonies would have been interrupted and objects of veneration defiled or destroyed. Now some of the important deities will be attacked. In Goshen, where the cattle are merely cattle, no disease hits, but in the rest of Egypt it is a different matter. Osiris, the savior, cannot even save the brute in which his own soul is supposed to reside. Apis and Mnevis, the ram of Ammon, the sheep of Sais, and the goat of Mendes, perish together. Hence, Moses reminds Israel afterward, &#8220;On their gods also Yahweh executed judgments&#8221; (Num 33:4). When Jethro heard of all these events, he said, &#8220;Now I know that Yahweh is greater than all the gods&#8221; (Exod 18:11). </p>

O. Lambdin, <i>Introduction to Biblical Hebrew</i>, 171-72, §137). Then, it is joined here with the Hiphil participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1494;&#1460;&#1497;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">makhaziq</font>) to form the sentence &#8220;you are still holding them.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="94"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=578><b>tn</b> The form used here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hoyah</font>), the Qal active participle, feminine singular, from the verb &#8220;to be.&#8221; This is the only place in the OT that this form occurs. Ogden shows that this form is appropriate with the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>) to stress impending divine action, and that it conforms to the pattern in these narratives where five times the participle is used in the threat to Pharaoh (7:17; 8:2; 9:3, 14; 10:4). See G. S. Ogden, &#8220;Notes on the Use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1497;&#1492;</font> in Exodus IX. 3,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 17 (1967): 483-84. </p>

It is used only here and in Ps 78:50 for animals.</p>
<A NAME="96"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=580><b>sn</b> The older view that camels were not domesticated at this time (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 70; W. F. Albright, <i>Archaeology and the Religion of Israel</i>,<i> </i>96; et. al.) has been corrected by more recently uncovered information (see K. A. Kitchen, <i>NBD<sup>3</sup></i> 160-61).</p>
<A NAME="97"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=581><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">palah</font>) in Hiphil means &#8220;to set apart, make separate, make distinct.&#8221; See also Exod 8:22 (18 HT); 11:7; 33:16.</p>
<A NAME="98"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=582><b>tn</b> There is a wordplay in this section.

It was perhaps for this reason that the verb was changed in v. 1 from &#8220;say&#8221; to &#8220;speak&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">dibber</font>). See U. Cassuto, <i>Exodus</i>, 111. </p>
<A NAME="99"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=583><b>tn</b> The <i>lamed</i> preposition indicates possession: &#8220;all that was to the Israelites&#8221; means &#8220;all that the Israelites had.&#8221; </p>

<A NAME="914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=588><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;all&#8221; clearly does not mean &#8220;all&#8221; in the exclusive sense, because subsequent plagues involve cattle. The word must denote such a large number that whatever was left was insignificant for the economy. It could also be taken to mean &#8220;all [kinds of] livestock died.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=589><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;of Egypt.&#8221; The place is put by metonymy for the inhabitants.</p>

<A NAME="917"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=591><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the heart of Pharaoh was hardened.&#8221; This phrase translates the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1461;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kaved</font>; see S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 53). In context this represents the continuation of a prior condition.</p>
<A NAME="918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=592><b>sn</b> This sixth plague, like the third, is unannounced. God instructs his servants to take handfuls of ashes from the Egyptians&#8217; furnaces and sprinkle them heavenward in the sight of Pharaoh. These ashes would become little particles of dust that would cause boils on the Egyptians and their animals. Greta Hort, &#8220;The Plagues of Egypt,&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 69 [1957]: 101-3, suggests it is skin anthrax (see W. C. Kaiser, Jr., &#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:359). The lesson of this plague is that Yahweh has absolute control over the physical health of the people. Physical suffering consequent to sin comes to all regardless of their position and status. The Egyptians are helpless in the face of this, as now God begins to touch human life; greater judgments on human wickedness lie ahead. </p>
<A NAME="919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=593><b>tn</b> This word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">piakh</font>) is a <i>hapax legomenon</i>, meaning &#8220;soot&#8221;; it seems to be derived from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">puakh</font>, &#8220;to breathe, blow&#8221;). The &#8220;furnace&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kivshan</font>) was a special kiln for making pottery or bricks.</p>
<A NAME="920"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=594><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zaraq</font>) means &#8220;to throw vigorously, to toss.&#8221; If Moses tosses the soot into the air, it will symbolize that the disease is falling from heaven.</p>
<A NAME="921"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=595><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;before the eyes of Pharaoh.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="922"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=596><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿkhin</font>) means &#8220;boils.&#8221; It may be connected to an Arabic cognate that means &#8220;to be hot.&#8221; The illness is associated with Job (Job 2:7-8) and Hezekiah (Isa 38:21); it has also been connected with other skin diseases described especially in the Law. The word connected with it is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1489;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1467;&#1506;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ava</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">bu</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ot</font>); this means &#8220;blisters, pustules&#8221; and is sometimes translated as &#8220;festering.&#8221; The etymology is debated, whether from a word meaning &#8220;to swell up&#8221; or &#8220;to overflow&#8221; (W. C. Kaiser, Jr., &#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:359).</p>
<A NAME="923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=597><b>tn</b> This phrase translates the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khazaq</font>); see S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 53.</p>
<A NAME="924"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=598><b>sn</b> With the seventh plague there is more explanation of what God is doing to Pharaoh. This plague begins with an extended lesson (vv. 13-21). Rain was almost unknown in Egypt, and hail and lightning were harmless. The Egyptians were fascinated by all these, though, and looked on them as portentous. Herodotus describes how they studied such things and wrote them down (1.2.c.38). If ordinary rainstorms were ominous, what must fire and hail have been? The Egyptians had denominated fire <i>Hephaistos</i>, considering it to be a mighty deity (cf. Diodorus, 1.1.c.1). Porphry says that at the opening of the temple of Serapis the Egyptians worshiped with water and fire. If these connections were clearly understood, then these elements in the plague were thought to be deities that came down on their own people with death and destruction. </p>
<A NAME="925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=599><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Yahweh said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=600><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;take your stand.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=601><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;all my plagues&#8221; points to the rest of the plagues and anticipates the proper outcome. Another view is to take the expression to mean the full brunt of the attack on the Egyptian people.</p>
<A NAME="928"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=602><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to your heart.&#8221; The expression is unusual, but it may be an allusion to the hard heartedness of Pharaoh &#8211; his stubbornness and blindness (B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 274). </p>
<A NAME="929"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=603><b>tn</b> The verb is the Qal perfect <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shalakhti</font>), but a past tense, or completed action translation does not fit the context at all. Gesenius lists this reference as an example of the use of the perfect to express actions and facts, whose accomplishment is to be represented not as actual but only as possible. He offers this for Exod 9:15: &#8220;I had almost put forth&#8221; (GKC 313 §106.<i>p</i>). Also possible is &#8220;I should have stretched out my hand.&#8221; Others read the potential nuance instead, and render it as &#8220;I could have&#8230;&#8221; as in the present translation.</p>
<A NAME="930"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=604><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kakhad</font>) means &#8220;to hide, efface,&#8221; and in the Niphal it has the idea of &#8220;be effaced, ruined, destroyed.&#8221; Here it will carry the nuance of the result of the preceding verbs: &#8220;I could have stretched out my hand&#8230;and struck you&#8230;and (as a result) you would have been destroyed.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="931"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=605><b>tn</b> The first word is a very strong adversative, which, in general, can be translated &#8220;but, howbeit&#8221;; BDB 19 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1464;&#1501;</font> suggests for this passage &#8220;but in very deed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="932"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=606><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1462;&#1506;&#1457;&#1502;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">he</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">emadtikha</font>) is the Hiphil perfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amad</font>). It would normally mean &#8220;I caused you to stand.&#8221; But that seems to have one or two different connotations. S. R. Driver (<i>Exodus</i>, 73) says that it means &#8220;maintain you alive.&#8221; The causative of this verb means &#8220;continue,&#8221; according to him. The LXX has the same basic sense &#8211; &#8220;you were preserved.&#8221; But Paul bypasses the Greek and writes &#8220;he raised you up&#8221; to show God&#8217;s absolute sovereignty over Pharaoh. Both renderings show God&#8217;s sovereign control over Pharaoh.</p>
<A NAME="933"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=607><b>tn</b> The Hiphil infinitive construct <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1465;&#1514;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">har</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">otÿkha</font>) is the purpose of God&#8217;s making Pharaoh come to power in the first place. To make Pharaoh see is to cause him to understand, to experience God&#8217;s power. </p>
<A NAME="934"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=608><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;in order to declare my name.&#8221; Since there is no expressed subject, this may be given a passive translation.</p>

C. Kaiser, Jr., &#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:363; U. Cassuto, <i>Exodus</i>, 116.</p>
<A NAME="936"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=610><b>tn</b> The infinitive construct with <i>lamed</i> here is epexegetical; it explains how Pharaoh has exalted himself &#8211; &#8220;by not releasing the people.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="938"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=612><b><i>tn</i></b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;which not was like it in Egypt.&#8221; The pronoun suffix serves as the resumptive pronoun for the relative particle: &#8220;which&#8230;like it&#8221; becomes &#8220;the like of which has not been.&#8221; The word &#8220;hail&#8221; is added in the translation to make clear the referent of the relative particle.</p>

This is a poetic expression for sending the thunder. Ps 29:3 talks about the &#8220;voice of Yahweh&#8221; &#8211; the God of glory thunders! </p>
<A NAME="956"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=630><b>sn</b> This clause has been variously interpreted.

<A NAME="957"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=631><b>tn</b> The verb is the common preterite <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayÿhi</font>), which is normally translated &#8220;and there was&#8221; if it is translated at all. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hayah</font>), however, can mean &#8220;be, become, befall, fall, fall out, happen.&#8221; Here it could be simply translated &#8220;there was hail,&#8221; but the active &#8220;hail fell&#8221; fits the point of the sequence better.</p>
<A NAME="958"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=632><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mitlaqqakhat</font>) is a Hitpael participle; the clause reads, &#8220;and fire taking hold of itself in the midst of the hail.&#8221; This probably refers to lightning flashing back and forth. See also Ezek 1:4. God created a great storm with flashing fire connected to it.</p>
<A NAME="959"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=633><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;very heavy&#8221; or &#8220;very severe.&#8221; The subject &#8220;the hail&#8221; is implied.</p>
<A NAME="960"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=634><b>tn</b> A literal reading of the clause would be &#8220;which there was not like it in all the land of Egypt.&#8221; The relative pronoun must be joined to the resumptive pronoun: &#8220;which like it (like which) there had not been.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="961"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=635><b>tn</b> The exact expression is &#8220;from man even to beast.&#8221; R. J. Williams lists this as an example of the inclusive use of the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">min</font>) to be rendered &#8220;both&#8230;and&#8221; (<i>Hebrew Syntax</i>,<i> </i>57, §327). </p>
<A NAME="962"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=636><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all the cultivated grain of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="963"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=637><b>sn</b> Pharaoh now is struck by the judgment and acknowledges that he is at fault. But the context shows that this penitence was short-lived. What exactly he meant by this confession is uncertain. On the surface his words seem to represent a recognition that he was in the wrong and Yahweh right.</p>
<A NAME="964"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=638><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rasha</font>&#8217;) can mean &#8220;ungodly, wicked, guilty, criminal.&#8221; Pharaoh here is saying that Yahweh is right, and the Egyptians are not &#8211; so they are at fault, guilty. S. R. Driver says the words are used in their forensic sense (in the right or wrong standing legally) and not in the ethical sense of morally right and wrong (<i>Exodus</i>, 75).</p>
<A NAME="965"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=639><b>sn</b> The text has <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the voices of God.&#8221; The divine epithet can be used to express the superlative (cf. Jonah 3:3). </p>
<A NAME="966"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=640><b>tn</b> The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1489; &#1502;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿrav mihyot</font>, &#8220;[the mighty thunder and hail] is much from being&#8221;) means essentially &#8220;more than enough.&#8221; This indicates that the storm was too much, or, as one might say, &#8220;It is enough.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="967"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=641><b>tn</b> The last clause uses a verbal hendiadys: &#8220;you will not add to stand,&#8221; meaning &#8220;you will no longer stay.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="968"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=642><b>tn</b> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1510;&#1461;&#1488;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kÿtse</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ti</font>) is the Qal infinitive construct of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatsa</font>&#8217;); it functions here as the temporal clause before the statement about prayer.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> There has been a good deal of speculation about why Moses would leave the city before praying. Rashi said he did not want to pray where there were so many idols. It may also be as the midrash in <i>Exodus Rabbah</i> 12:5 says that most of the devastation of this plague had been outside in the fields, and that was where Moses wished to go.</p>
<A NAME="969"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=643><b>sn</b> This clause provides the purpose/result of Moses&#8217; intention: he will pray to Yahweh and the storms will cease &#8220;that you might know&#8230;.&#8221; It was not enough to pray and have the plague stop. Pharaoh must &#8220;know&#8221; that Yahweh is the sovereign Lord over the earth. Here was that purpose of knowing through experience. This clause provides the key for the exposition of this plague: God demonstrated his power over the forces of nature to show his sovereignty &#8211; the earth is Yahweh&#8217;s. He can destroy it. He can preserve it. If people sin by ignoring his word and not fearing him, he can bring judgment on them. If any fear Yahweh and obey his instructions, they will be spared. A positive way to express the expositional point of the chapter is to say that those who fear Yahweh and obey his word will escape the powerful destruction he has prepared for those who sinfully disregard his word.</p>
<A NAME="970"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=644><b>tn</b> The verse begins with the disjunctive <i>vav</i> to mark a strong contrastive clause to what was said before this.</p>
<A NAME="971"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=645><b>tn</b> The adverb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">terem</font>, &#8220;before, not yet&#8221;) occurs with the imperfect tense to give the sense of the English present tense to the verb negated by it (GKC 314-15 §107.<i>c</i>). Moses is saying that he knew that Pharaoh did not really stand in awe of God, so as to grant Israel&#8217;s release, i.e., fear not in the religious sense but &#8220;be afraid of&#8221; God &#8211; fear &#8220;before&#8221; him (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 76). </p>
<A NAME="972"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=646><b>tn</b> A disjunctive <i>vav</i> introduces the two verses that provide parenthetical information to the reader. Gesenius notes that the boldness of such clauses is often indicated by the repetition of nouns at the beginning (see GKC 452 §141.<i>d</i>). Some have concluded that because they have been put here rather than back after v. 25 or 26, they form part of Moses&#8217; speech to Pharaoh, explaining that the crops that were necessary for humans were spared, but those for other things were destroyed. This would also mean that Moses was saying there is more that God can destroy (see B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 279).</p>
<A NAME="973"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=647><b>tn</b> The unusual forms <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1467;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nukkatah</font>) in v. 31 and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1467;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nukku</font>) in v. 32 are probably to be taken as old Qal passives. There are no attested Piel uses of the root.</p>
<A NAME="974"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=648><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;by the hail&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text, but are supplied from context.</p>

<A NAME="976"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">76</span><note=650><b>sn</b> Flax was used for making linen, and the area around Tanis was ideal for producing flax. Barley was used for bread for the poor people, as well as beer and animal feed.</p>
<A NAME="977"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=651><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1467;&#1505;&#1468;&#1462;&#1502;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kussemet</font>) is translated &#8220;spelt&#8221;; the word occurs only here and in Isa 28:25 and Ezek 4:9. Spelt is a grain closely allied to wheat. Other suggestions have been brought forward from the study of Egyptian crops (see a brief summary in W. C. Kaiser, Jr., &#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:363-64).</p>
<A NAME="978"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=652><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for they are late.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="979"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">79</span><note=653><b>tn</b> The clause beginning with the preterite and <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive is here subordinated to the next, and main clause &#8211; that he hardened his heart again.</p>
<A NAME="980"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">80</span><note=654><b>tn</b> The construction is another verbal hendiadys: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1505;&#1462;&#1507; &#1500;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1496;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyosef lakhatto</font>&#8217;), literally rendered &#8220;and he added to sin.&#8221; The infinitive construct becomes the main verb, and the Hiphil preterite becomes adverbial. The text is clearly interpreting as sin the hardening of Pharaoh&#8217;s heart and his refusal to release Israel. At the least this means that the plagues are his fault, but the expression probably means more than this &#8211; he was disobeying Yahweh God.</p>
<A NAME="981"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">81</span><note=655><b>tn</b> This phrase translates the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1461;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kaved</font>); see S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 53.</p>
<A NAME="982"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">82</span><note=656><b>tn</b> The verb about Pharaoh&#8217;s heart in v. 35 is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1462;&#1495;&#1457;&#1494;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyekhezaq</font>), a Qal preterite: &#8220;and it was hardened&#8221; or &#8220;strengthened to resist.&#8221; This forms the summary statement of this stage in the drama. The verb used in v. 34 to report Pharaoh&#8217;s response was <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1499;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyakhbed</font>), a Hiphil preterite: &#8220;and he hardened [his heart]&#8221; or made it stubborn. The use of two descriptions of Pharaoh&#8217;s heart in close succession, along with mention of his servants&#8217; heart condition, underscores the growing extent of the problem.</p>
