<A NAME="3821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2442><b>sn</b> There were 3000 shekels in a talent, and so the total weight here in shekels would be 87,730 shekels of gold. If the sanctuary shekel was 224 grs., then this was about 40,940 oz. troy. This is estimated to be a little over a ton (cf. NCV &#8220;over 2,000 pounds&#8221;; TEV &#8220;a thousand kilogrammes&#8221;; CEV &#8220;two thousand two hundred nine pounds&#8221;; NLT &#8220;about 2,200 pounds&#8221;), although other widely diverging estimates are also given.</p>
