<A NAME="383"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2424><b>sn</b> The word for &#8220;serve&#8221; is not the ordinary one. It means &#8220;to serve in a host,&#8221; especially in a war. It appears that women were organized into bands and served at the tent of meeting. S. R. Driver thinks that this meant &#8220;no doubt&#8221; washing, cleaning, or repairing (<i>Exodus</i>, 391). But there is no hint of that (see 1 Sam 2:22; and see Ps 68:11 [12 Hebrew text]). They seem to have had more to do than what Driver said.</p>
