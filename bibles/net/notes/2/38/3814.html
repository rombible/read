<A NAME="3814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2435><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pÿqude</font>), which in a slavishly literal way would be &#8220;visitations of&#8221; the tabernacle. But the word often has the idea of &#8220;numbering&#8221; or &#8220;appointing&#8221; as well. Here it is an accounting or enumeration of the materials that people brought, so the contemporary term &#8220;inventory&#8221; is a close approximation. By using this Hebrew word there is also the indication that whatever was given, i.e., appointed for the tabernacle, was changed forever in its use. This is consistent with this Hebrew root, which does have a sense of changing the destiny of someone (&#8220;God will surely visit you&#8221;). The list in this section will also be tied to the numbering of the people.</p>
