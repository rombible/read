<A NAME="31"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=156><b>sn</b> The <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) disjunctive with the name &#8220;Moses&#8221; introduces a new and important starting point. The <sc>Lord&#8217;s dealing with Moses will fill the next two chapters. </p>
<A NAME="32"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=157><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;west of the desert,&#8221; taking <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akhar</font>, &#8220;behind&#8221;) as the opposite of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al-pÿne</font>, &#8220;on the face of, east of&#8221;; cf. Gen 16:12; 25:18).</p>
<A NAME="33"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=158><b>sn</b> &#8220;Horeb&#8221; is another name for Mount Sinai. There is a good deal of foreshadowing in this verse, for later Moses would shepherd the people of Israel and lead them to Mount Sinai to receive the Law. See D. Skinner, &#8220;Some Major Themes of Exodus,&#8221; <i>Mid-America Theological Journal</i> 1 (1977): 31-42. </p>
<A NAME="34"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=159><b>sn</b> The designation &#8220;the angel of the <sc>Lord&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;the angel of Yahweh&#8221;) occurred in Genesis already (16:7-13; 21:17; 22:11-18). There is some ambiguity in the expression, but it seems often to be interchangeable with God&#8217;s name itself, indicating that it refers to the <sc>Lord. </p>
<A NAME="35"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=160><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyera</font>&#8217;) is the Niphal preterite of the verb &#8220;to see.&#8221; For similar examples of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>) in Niphal where the subject &#8220;appears,&#8221; that is, allows himself to be seen, or presents himself, see Gen 12:7; 35:9; 46:29; Exod 6:3; and 23:17. B. Jacob notes that God appears in this way only to individuals and never to masses of people; it is his glory that appears to the masses (<i>Exodus</i>, 49).</p>
<A NAME="36"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=161><b>tn</b> Gesenius rightly classifies this as a <i>bet </i>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;</font>) <i>essentiae</i><font face="Scholar"> </font>(GKC 379 §119.<i>i</i>); it would then indicate that Yahweh appeared to Moses &#8220;<i>as</i> a flame.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="37"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=162><b>sn</b> Fire frequently accompanies the revelation of Yahweh in Exodus as he delivers Israel, guides her, and purifies her. The description here is unique, calling attention to the manifestation as a flame of fire from within the bush. Philo was the first to interpret the bush as Israel, suffering under the persecution of Egypt but never consumed. The Bible leaves the interpretation open. However, in this revelation the fire is coming from within the bush, not from outside, and it represents the <sc>Lord who will deliver his people from persecution. See further E. Levine, &#8220;The Evolving Symbolism of the Burning Bush,&#8221; <i>Dor le Dor</i> 8 (1979): 185-93.</p>
<A NAME="38"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=163><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And he saw.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="39"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=164><b>tn</b> The text again uses the deictic particle with <font face="Scholar">vav</font>, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿhinneh</font>), traditionally rendered &#8220;and behold.&#8221; The particle goes with the intense gaze, the outstretched arm, the raised eyebrow &#8211; excitement and intense interest: &#8220;look, over there.&#8221; It draws the reader into the immediate experience of the subject.</p>
<A NAME="310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=165><b>tn</b> The construction uses the suffixed negative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1504;&#1462;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">enennu</font>) to convey the subject of the passive verb: &#8220;It was not&#8221; consumed. This was the amazing thing, for nothing would burn faster in the desert than a thornbush on fire.</p>
<A NAME="311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=166><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And Moses said.&#8221; The implication is that Moses said this to himself.</p>
<A NAME="312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=167><b>tn</b> The construction uses the cohortative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1505;&#1467;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;&#1470;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asura-nna</font>&#8217;) followed by an imperfect with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">vÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">er</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eh</font>) to express the purpose or result (logical sequence): &#8220;I will turn aside in order that I may see.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=168><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;great.&#8221; The word means something extraordinary here. In using this term Moses revealed his reaction to the strange sight and his anticipation that something special was about to happen. So he turned away from the flock to investigate.</p>
<A NAME="314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=169><b>tn</b> The verb is an imperfect. Here it has the progressive nuance &#8211; the bush is not burning up.</p>
<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=170><b>tn</b> The preterite with the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) is subordinated as a temporal clause to the main point of the verse, that God called to him. The language is anthropomorphic, as if God&#8217;s actions were based on his observing what Moses did.</p>
<A NAME="316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=171><b>tn</b> The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>, &#8220;that&#8221;) introduces the noun clause that functions as the direct object of the verb &#8220;saw&#8221; (R. J. Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 81, §490).</p>
<A NAME="317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=172><b>sn</b> The repetition of the name in God&#8217;s call is emphatic, making the appeal direct and immediate (see also Gen 22:11; 46:2). The use of the personal name shows how specifically God directed the call and that he knew this person. The repetition may have stressed even more that it was indeed he whom the <sc>Lord wanted. It would have been an encouragement to Moses that this was in fact the <sc>Lord who was meeting him. </p>
<A NAME="318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=173><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And he said&#8221;; the referent (Moses) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=174><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And he&#8221;; the referent (God) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=175><b>sn</b> Even though the <sc>Lord was drawing near to Moses, Moses could not casually approach him. There still was a barrier between God and human, and God had to remind Moses of this with instructions. The removal of sandals was, and still is in the East, a sign of humility and reverence in the presence of the Holy One. It was a way of excluding the dust and dirt of the world. But it also took away personal comfort and convenience and brought the person more closely in contact with the earth. </p>
<A NAME="321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=176><b>sn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1465;&#1491;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qodesh</font>, &#8220;holy&#8221;) indicates &#8220;set apart, distinct, unique.&#8221; What made a mountain or other place holy was the fact that God chose that place to reveal himself or to reside among his people. Because God was in this place, the ground was different &#8211; it was holy. </p>
<A NAME="322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=177><b>tn</b> The causal clause includes within it a typical relative clause, which is made up of the relative pronoun, then the independent personal pronoun with the participle, and then the preposition with the resumptive pronoun. It would literally be &#8220;which you are standing on it,&#8221; but the relative pronoun and the resumptive pronoun are combined and rendered, &#8220;on which you are standing.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=178><b>sn</b> This self-revelation by Yahweh prepares for the revelation of the holy name. While no verb is used here, the pronoun and the predicate nominative are a construction used throughout scripture to convey the &#8220;I <sc>am&#8221; disclosures &#8211; &#8220;I [am] the God of&#8230;.&#8221; But the significant point here is the naming of the patriarchs, for this God is the covenant God, who will fulfill his promises. </p>
<A NAME="324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=179><b>tn</b> The clause uses the Hiphil infinitive construct with a preposition after the perfect tense: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1512;&#1461;&#1488; &#1502;&#1461;&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yare</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> mehabbit</font>, &#8220;he was afraid from gazing&#8221;) meaning &#8220;he was afraid to gaze.&#8221; The preposition <i>min</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font>) is used before infinitives after verbs like the one to complete the verb (see BDB 583 s.v. 7b).</p>
<A NAME="325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=180><b>tn</b> The use of the infinitive absolute with the perfect tense intensifies the statement: I have surely seen &#8211; there is no doubt that I have seen and will do something about it.</p>
<A NAME="326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=181><b>sn</b> Two new words are introduced now to the report of suffering: &#8220;affliction&#8221; and &#8220;pain/suffering.&#8221; These add to the dimension of the oppression of God&#8217;s people. </p>
<A NAME="327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=182><b>sn</b> God&#8217;s coming down is a frequent anthropomorphism in Genesis and Exodus. It expresses his direct involvement, often in the exercise of judgment.</p>
<A NAME="328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=183><b>tn</b> The Hiphil<i> </i>infinitive with the suffix is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿhatsilo</font>, &#8220;to deliver them&#8221;). It expresses the purpose of God&#8217;s coming down. The verb itself is used for delivering or rescuing in the general sense, and snatching out of danger for the specific.</p>
<A NAME="329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=184><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to a land good and large&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;to a good and broad land.&#8221; In the translation the words &#8220;that is both&#8221; are supplied because in contemporary English &#8220;good and&#8221; combined with any additional descriptive term can be understood as elative (&#8220;good and large&#8221; = &#8220;very large&#8221;; &#8220;good and spacious&#8221; = &#8220;very spacious&#8221;; &#8220;good and ready&#8221; = &#8220;very ready&#8221;). The point made in the Hebrew text is that the land to which they are going is both good (in terms of quality) and large (in terms of size).</p>
<A NAME="330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=185><b>tn</b> This vibrant description of the promised land is a familiar one. Gesenius classifies &#8220;milk and honey&#8221; as epexegetical genitives because they provide more precise description following a verbal adjective in the construct state (GKC 418-19 §128.<i>x</i>). The land is modified by &#8220;flowing,&#8221; and &#8220;flowing&#8221; is explained by the genitives &#8220;milk and honey.&#8221; These two products will be in abundance in the land, and they therefore exemplify what a desirable land it is. The language is hyperbolic, as if the land were streaming with these products.</p>
<A NAME="331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=186><b>tn</b> Each people group is joined to the preceding by the <i>vav</i> conjunction, &#8220;and.&#8221; Each also has the definite article, as in other similar lists (3:17; 13:5; 34:11). To repeat the conjunction and article in the translation seems to put more weight on the list in English than is necessary to its function in identifying what land God was giving the Israelites.</p>
<A NAME="332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=187><b>tn</b> The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>) focuses attention on what is being said as grounds for what follows.</p>
<A NAME="333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=188><b>tn</b> The word is a technical term for the outcry one might make to a judge. God had seen the oppression and so knew that the complaints were accurate, and so he initiated the proceedings against the oppressors (B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 59).</p>
<A NAME="334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=189><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.&#8221; The word for the oppression is now <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lakhats</font>), which has the idea of pressure with the oppression &#8211; squeezing, pressuring &#8211; which led to its later use in the Semitic languages for torture. The repetition in the Hebrew text of the root in the participle form after this noun serves to stress the idea. This emphasis has been represented in the translation by the expression &#8220;seen how severely the Egyptians oppress them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=190><b>tn</b> The verse has a sequence of volitives. The first form is the imperative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿkha</font>, &#8220;go&#8221;). Then comes the cohortative/imperfect form with the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>), &#8220;and I will send you&#8221; or more likely &#8220;that I may send you&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1495;&#1458;&#1498;&#1464;</font>, <font face="Scholar">vÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eshlakhakha</font>), which is followed by the imperative with the <i>vav</i>, &#8220;and bring out&#8221; or &#8220;that you may bring out&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1510;&#1461;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">vÿhotse</font>&#8217;). The series of actions begins with Moses going. When he goes, it will be the <sc>Lord who sends him, and if the <sc>Lord sends him, it will be with the purpose of leading Israel out of Egypt.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> These instructions for Moses are based on the preceding revelation made to him. The deliverance of Israel was to be God&#8217;s work &#8211; hence, &#8220;I will send you.&#8221; When God commissioned people, often using the verb &#8220;to send,&#8221; it indicated that they went with his backing, his power, and his authority. Moses could not have brought Israel out without this. To name this incident a commissioning, then, means that the authority came from God to do the work (compare John 3:2).</p>
<A NAME="336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=191><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And Moses said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=192><b>sn</b> When he was younger, Moses was confident and impulsive, but now that he is older the greatness of the task makes him unsure. The remainder of this chapter and the next chapter record the four difficulties of Moses and how the <sc>Lord answers them (11-12, 13-22; then 4:1-9; and finally 4:10-17). </p>
<A NAME="338"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=193><b>tn</b> The imperfect tense <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elekh</font>) carries the modal nuance of obligatory imperfect, i.e., &#8220;that I should go.&#8221; Moses at this point is overwhelmed with the task of representing God, and with his personal insufficiency, and so in honest humility questions the choice.</p>
<A NAME="339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=194><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And he said&#8221;; the word &#8220;replied&#8221; clarifies for English readers that speaker is God.</p>
<A NAME="340"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=195><b>tn</b> The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) has the asseverative use here, &#8220;surely, indeed,&#8221; which is frequently found with oaths (R. J. Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 73, §449). The imperfect tense <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ehyeh</font>) could be rendered as the future tense, &#8220;I will be&#8221; or the present tense &#8220;I am&#8221; with you. The future makes the better sense in this case, since the subject matter is the future mission. But since it is a stative verb, the form will also lend itself nicely to explaining the divine name &#8211; he is the One who is eternally present &#8211; &#8220;I am with you always.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Here is the introduction of the main motif of the commission, which will be the explanation of the divine name. It will make little difference who the servant is or what that servant&#8217;s abilities might be, if God is present. The mention of God&#8217;s presence is not a simple catch-phrase; it represents abundant provisions to the believer (see below on v. 14).</p>
<A NAME="341"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=196><b>sn</b> In view of Moses&#8217; hesitancy, a sign is necessary to support the promise. A sign is often an unusual or miraculous event that introduces, authenticates, or illustrates the message. One expects a direct connection between the sign and the message (for a helpful discussion, see S. Porúbcan, &#8220;The Word &#8217;OT in Isaia 7,14,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 22 [1960]: 144-49). In this passage the sign is a confirming one, i.e., when Israel worships at the mountain that will be the proof that God delivered them from Egypt. Thus, the purpose of the exodus that makes possible the worship will be to prove that it was God who brought it about. In the meantime, Moses will have to trust in Yahweh. </p>
<A NAME="342"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=197><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ta</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avdun</font>, &#8220;you will serve&#8221;) is one of the foremost words for worship in the Torah. Keeping the commandments and serving Yahweh usually sum up the life of faith; the true worshiper seeks to obey him. The highest title anyone can have in the OT is &#8220;the servant of Yahweh.&#8221; The verb here could be rendered interpretively as &#8220;worship,&#8221; but it is better to keep it to the basic idea of serving because that emphasizes an important aspect of worship, and it highlights the change from Israel&#8217;s serving Egypt, which has been prominent in the earlier chapters. The words &#8220;and they&#8221; are supplied to clarify for English readers that the subject of the verb is plural (Moses and the people), unlike the other second person forms in vv. 10 and 12, which are singular.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This sign is also a promise from God &#8211; &#8220;you will serve God on this mountain.&#8221; It is given to Moses here as a goal, but a goal already achieved because it was a sign from God. Leading Israel out of Egypt would not be completed until they came to this mountain and served God. God does not give Moses details of what will take place on the road to Sinai, but he does give him the goal and glimpses of the defeat of Pharaoh. The rest will require Moses and the people to trust in this God who had a plan and who had the power to carry it out. </p>
<A NAME="343"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=198><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And Moses said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="344"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=199><b>tn</b> The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>) in this clause introduces the foundation for what comes later &#8211; the question. Moses is saying, &#8220;Suppose I do all this and they ask this question &#8211; what should I say?&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="345"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=200><b>sn</b> There has been considerable debate about the name of Yahweh in the Pentateuch, primarily because of theories that have maintained that the name Yahweh was not known in antiquity (see also 6:3 and notes there). The argument of this whole section nullifies that view. The idea that God&#8217;s name was revealed only here raises the question of what he was called earlier. The word &#8220;God&#8221; is not a name. &#8220;El Shaddai&#8221; is used only a few times in Genesis. But Israel would not have had a nameless deity &#8211; especially since Genesis says that from the very beginning people were making proclamation of the name of Yahweh (Gen 4:26; 12:8). It is possible that they did not always need a name if they were convinced that only he existed and there was no other God. But probably what Moses was anticipating was the Israelites&#8217; wanting to be sure that Moses came with a message from their God, and that some sign could prove it. They would have known his name (Yahweh), and they would have known the ways that he had manifested himself. It would do no good for Moses to come with a new name for God, for that would be like introducing them to a new God. That would in no way authenticate to them Moses&#8217; call, only confuse; after all, they would not be expecting a new name &#8211; they had been praying to their covenant God all along. They would want to be sure that their covenant God actually had sent Moses. To satisfy the Israelites Moses would have had to have been familiar with the name Yahweh &#8211; as they were &#8211; and know that he appeared to individuals. They would also want to know if Yahweh had sent Moses, how this was going to work in their deliverance, because they had been crying to him for deliverance. As it turned out, the Israelites had less problem with this than Moses anticipated &#8211; they were delighted when he came. It is likely that much of this concern was Moses&#8217; own need for assurance that this was indeed the God of the fathers and that the promised deliverance was now to take place.</p>
<A NAME="346"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=201><b>tn</b> The imperfect tense here has a deliberative nuance (&#8220;should&#8221;), for Moses is wondering what would be best to say when the Israelites want proof of the calling.</p>
<A NAME="347"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=202><b>tn</b> The verb form used here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ehyeh</font>), the Qal imperfect, first person common singular, of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">haya</font>, &#8220;to be&#8221;). It forms an excellent paronomasia with the name. So when God used the verb to express his name, he used this form saying, &#8220;<sc>I am.&#8221; When his people refer to him as Yahweh, which is the third person masculine singular form of the same verb, they say &#8220;he is.&#8221; Some commentators argue for a future tense translation, &#8220;I will be who I will be,&#8221; because the verb has an active quality about it, and the Israelites lived in the light of the promises for the future. They argue that &#8220;<sc>I am&#8221; would be of little help to the Israelites in bondage. But a translation of &#8220;I will be&#8221; does not effectively do much more except restrict it to the future. The idea of the verb would certainly indicate that God is not bound by time, and while he is present (&#8220;<sc>I am&#8221;) he will always be present, even in the future, and so &#8220;<sc>I am&#8221; would embrace that as well (see also Ruth 2:13; Ps 50:21; Hos 1:9). The Greek translation of the OT used a participle to capture the idea, and several times in the Gospels Jesus used the powerful &#8220;I am&#8221; with this significance (e.g., John 8:58). The point is that Yahweh is sovereignly independent of all creation and that his presence guarantees the fulfillment of the covenant (cf. Isa 41:4; 42:6, 8; 43:10-11; 44:6; 45:5-7). Others argue for a causative Hiphil translation of &#8220;I will cause to be,&#8221; but nowhere in the Bible does this verb appear in Hiphil or Piel<i>. </i>A good summary of the views can be found in G.

Job 18:17; Ps 135:13; Prov 10:7; Isa 26:8) and conveys the idea that the nature or character of the person is to be remembered and praised (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 24). </p>

If the holy name were a new one to the Israelites, an explanation would have been needed. Meanwhile, the title &#8220;God of my/your/our father(s)&#8221; was widely used in the ancient Near East and also in Genesis (26:24; 28:13; 31:5, 29; 46:1, 3; N. M.

When God &#8220;visited&#8221; someone, it meant that he intervened in their lives to change their circumstances or their destiny. When he visited the Amalekites, he destroyed them (1 Sam 15:2). When he visited Sarah, he provided the long awaited child (Gen 21:1). It refers to God&#8217;s active involvement in human affairs for blessing or for cursing. Here it would mean that God had begun to act to deliver the Israelites from bondage and give them the blessings of the covenant. The form is joined here with the infinitive absolute to underscore the certainty &#8211; &#8220;I have indeed visited you.&#8221; Some translate it &#8220;remember&#8221;; others say &#8220;watch over.&#8221; These do not capture the idea of intervention to bless, and often with the idea of vengeance or judgment on the oppressors. If God were to visit what the Egyptians did, he would stop the oppression and also bring retribution for it. The nuance of the perfect tense could be a perfect of resolve (&#8220;I have decided to visit&#8221;), or an instantaneous perfect ( &#8220;I hereby visit&#8221;), or a prophetic perfect (&#8220;I have visited&#8221; = &#8220;I will visit&#8221;). The infinitive absolute reinforces the statement (so &#8220;carefully&#8221;), the rendering &#8220;attended to&#8221; attempts to convey the ideas of personal presence, mental awareness, and action, as when a nurse or physician &#8220;attends&#8221; a patient.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The same word was used in the same kind of construction at the end of Genesis (50:24) when Joseph promised, &#8220;God will surely visit you&#8221; (but there the imperfect tense with the infinitive absolute).

Some have taken v. 19b to refer to God&#8217;s mighty hand also, meaning that the king would not let them go unless a mighty hand compels him (NIV). The expression &#8220;mighty hand&#8221; is used of God&#8217;s rescuing Israel elsewhere (Exod 6:1, 13:9, 32:11; but note also Num 20:20). This idea is a rather general interpretation of the words; it owes much to the LXX, which has &#8220;except by a mighty hand,&#8221; though &#8220;and not with&#8221; does not have the meaning of &#8220;except&#8221; or &#8220;unless&#8221; in other places. In view of these difficulties, others have suggested that v. 19b means &#8220;strong [threats]&#8221; from the Israelites (as in 4:24ff. and 5:3; see B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 81). This does not seem as convincing as the first view. Another possibility is that the phrase conveys Pharaoh&#8217;s point of view and intention; the Lord knows that Pharaoh plans to resist letting the Israelites go, regardless of the exercise of a strong hand against him (P. Addinall, &#8220;Exodus III 19B and the Interpretation of Biblical Narrative,&#8221; <i>VT </i>49 [1999]: 289-300; see also the construction &#8220;and not with&#8221; in Num 12:8; 1 Sam 20:15 and elsewhere). If that is the case, v. 20 provides an ironic and pointed contradiction to Pharaoh&#8217;s plans as the Lord announces the effect that his hand will have. At any rate, Pharaoh will have to be forced to let Israel go.</p>

As the text unfolds it will be clear that the plagues are intended. Signs and portents could refer to things people might do, but &#8220;wonders&#8221; only God could do.
