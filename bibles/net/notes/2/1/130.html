<a name="130"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=30><b>sn</b> Many scholars assume that because this city was named Rameses, the Pharaoh had to be Rameses II, and hence that a late date for the exodus (and a late time for the sojourn in Egypt) is proved. But if the details of the context are taken as seriously as the mention of this name, this cannot be the case. If one grants for the sake of discussion that Rameses II was on the throne and oppressing Israel, it is necessary to note that Moses is not born yet. It would take about twenty or more years to build the city, then eighty more years before Moses appears before Pharaoh (Rameses), and then a couple of years for the plagues &#8211; this man would have been Pharaoh for over a hundred years. That is clearly not the case for the historical Rameses II. But even more determining is the fact that whoever the Pharaoh was for whom the Israelites built the treasure cities, he died before Moses began the plagues. The Bible says that when Moses grew up and killed the Egyptian, he fled from Pharaoh (whoever that was) and remained in exile until he heard that that Pharaoh had died. So this verse cannot be used for a date of the exodus in the days of Rameses, unless many other details in the chapters are ignored. If it is argued that Rameses was the Pharaoh of the oppression, then his successor would have been the Pharaoh of the exodus. Rameses reigned from 1304 <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span> until 1236 and then was succeeded by Merneptah. That would put the exodus far too late in time, for the Merneptah stela refers to Israel as a settled nation in their land. One would have to say that the name Rameses in this chapter may either refer to an earlier king, or, more likely, reflect an updating in the narrative to name the city according to its later name (it was called something else when they built it, but later Rameses finished it and named it after himself [see B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 14]). For further discussion see G. L. Archer, &#8220;An 18th Dynasty Ramses,&#8221; <i>JETS</i> 17 (1974): 49-50; and C. F. Aling, &#8220;The Biblical City of Ramses,&#8221; <i>JETS</i> 25 (1982): 129-37. Furthermore, for vv. 11-14, see K. A. Kitchen, &#8220;From the Brick Fields of Egypt,&#8221; <i>TynBul</i> 27 (1976): 137-47. </p>
