<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1><b>sn</b> Chapter 1 introduces the theme of bondage in Egypt and shows the intensifying opposition to the fulfillment of promises given earlier to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The first seven verses announce the theme of Israel&#8217;s prosperity in Egypt. The second section (vv. 8-14) reports continued prosperity in the face of deliberate opposition. The third section (vv. 15-21) explains the prosperity as divine favor in spite of Pharaoh&#8217;s covert attempts at controlling the population. The final verse records a culmination in the developing tyranny and provides a transition to the next section &#8211; Pharaoh commands the open murder of the males. The power of God is revealed in the chapter as the people flourish under the forces of evil. However, by the turn of affairs at the end of the chapter, the reader is left with a question about the power of God &#8211; &#8220;What can God do?&#8221; This is good Hebrew narrative, moving the reader through tension after tension to reveal the sovereign power and majesty of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God, but calling for faith every step of the way.
