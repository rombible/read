<a name="110"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=10><b>tn</b> The text simply uses the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive with the preterite, &#8220;and Joseph died.&#8221; While this construction shows sequence with the preceding verse, it does not require that the death follow directly the report of that verse. In fact, readers know from the record in Genesis that the death of Joseph occurred after a good number of years. The statement assumes the passage of time in the natural course of events.</p>
