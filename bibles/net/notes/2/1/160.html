Pharaoh is simply allowing the girls to live.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Verse 22 forms a fitting climax to the chapter, in which the king continually seeks to destroy the Israelite strength. Finally, with this decree, he throws off any subtlety and commands the open extermination of Hebrew males. The verse forms a transition to the next chapter, in which Moses is saved by Pharaoh&#8217;s own daughter. These chapters show that the king&#8217;s efforts to destroy the strength of Israel &#8211; so clearly a work of God &#8211; met with failure again and again. And that failure involved the efforts of women, whom Pharaoh did not consider a threat. </p>
