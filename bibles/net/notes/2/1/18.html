The Greek text of Exod 1:5 and of Gen 46:27 and two Qumran manuscripts, have the number as seventy-five, counting the people a little differently. E. H. Merrill in conjunction with F. Delitzsch notes that the list in Gen 46 of those who entered Egypt includes Hezron and Hamul, who did so <i>in potentia</i>, since they were born after the family entered Egypt. Joseph&#8217;s sons are also included, though they too were born in Egypt. &#8220;The list must not be pressed too literally&#8221; (E. H. Merrill, <i>Kingdom of Priests</i>,<i> </i>49).</p>
