<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3><b>sn</b> The name of the book of Exodus in the Hebrew Bible is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿmot</font>), the word for &#8220;Names,&#8221; drawn from the beginning of the book. The inclusion of the names at this point forms a literary connection to the book of Genesis. It indicates that the Israelites living in bondage had retained a knowledge of their ancestry, and with it, a knowledge of God&#8217;s promise.</p>
