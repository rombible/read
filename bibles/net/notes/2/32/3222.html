<A NAME="3222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2112><b>tn</b> The form is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1510;&#1463;&#1495;&#1461;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿtsakheq</font>), a Piel infinitive construct, giving the purpose of their rising up after the festal meal. On the surface it would seem that with the festival there would be singing and dancing, so that the people were celebrating even though they did not know the reason. W. C. Kaiser says the word means &#8220;drunken immoral orgies and sexual play&#8221; (&#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:478). That is quite an assumption for this word, but is reflected in some recent English versions (e.g., NCV &#8220;got up and sinned sexually&#8221;; TEV &#8220;an orgy of drinking and sex&#8221;). The word means &#8220;to play, trifle.&#8221; It can have other meanings, depending on its contexts. It is used of Lot when he warned his sons-in-law and appeared as one who &#8220;mocked&#8221; them; it is also used of Ishmael &#8220;playing&#8221; with Isaac, which Paul interprets as mocking; it is used of Isaac &#8220;playing&#8221; with his wife in a manner that revealed to Abimelech that they were not brother and sister, and it is used by Potiphar&#8217;s wife to say that her husband brought this slave Joseph in to &#8220;mock&#8221; them. The most that can be gathered from these is that it is playful teasing, serious mocking, or playful caresses. It might fit with wild orgies, but there is no indication of that in this passage, and the word does not mean it. The fact that they were festive and playing before an idol was sufficient.</p>
