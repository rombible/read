<A NAME="329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2099><b>sn</b> B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 937-38) argues that Aaron simply did not have the resolution that Moses did, and wanting to keep peace he gave in to the crowd. He also tries to explain that Aaron was wanting to show their folly through the deed. U. Cassuto also says that Aaron&#8217;s request for the gold was a form of procrastination, but that the people quickly did it and so he had no alternative but to go through with it (<i>Exodus</i>, 412). These may be right, since Aaron fully understood what was wrong with this, and what the program was all about. The text gives no strong indication to support these ideas, but there are enough hints from the way Aaron does things to warrant such a conclusion. </p>
