<A NAME="3254"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=2144><b>tn</b> The word is difficult to interpret. There does not seem to be enough evidence to justify the KJV&#8217;s translation &#8220;naked.&#8221; It appears to mean something like &#8220;let loose&#8221; or &#8220;lack restraint&#8221; (Prov 29:18). The idea seems to be that the people had broken loose, were undisciplined, and were completely given over to their desires. </p>
