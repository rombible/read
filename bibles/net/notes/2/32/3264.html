<A NAME="3264"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=2154><b>tn</b> The text simply has &#8220;and to give on you today a blessing.&#8221; Gesenius notes that the infinitive construct seems to be attached with a <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>; like the infinitive absolute) as the continuation of a previous finite verb. He reads the verb &#8220;fill&#8221; as an imperative: &#8220;fill your hand today&#8230;and that to bring a blessing on you, i.e., that you may be blessed&#8221; (see GKC 351 §114.<i>p</i>). If the preceding verb is taken as perfect tense, however, then this would also be perfect &#8211; &#8220;he has blessed you today.&#8221;</p>
