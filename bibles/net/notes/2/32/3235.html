<A NAME="3235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2125><b>tn</b> The verb &#8220;repent, relent&#8221; when used of God is certainly an anthropomorphism. It expresses the deep pain that one would have over a situation. Earlier God repented that he had made humans (Gen 6:6). Here Moses is asking God to repent/relent over the judgment he was about to bring, meaning that he should be moved by such compassion that there would be no judgment like that. J. P. Hyatt observes that the Bible uses so many anthropomorphisms because the Israelites conceived of God as a dynamic and living person in a vital relationship with people, responding to their needs and attitudes and actions (<i>Exodus </i>[NCBC], 307). See H. V. D. Parunak, &#8220;A Semantic Survey of <i>NHM</i>,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 56 (1975): 512-32.</p>
