<A NAME="3220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2110><b>sn</b> The word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1490;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khag</font>), the pilgrim&#8217;s festival. This was the word used by Moses for their pilgrimage into the wilderness. Aaron seems here to be trying to do what Moses had intended they do, make a feast to Yahweh at Sinai, but his efforts will not compete with the idol. As B. Jacob says, Aaron saw all this happening and tried to rescue the true belief (<i>Exodus</i>, 941). </p>
