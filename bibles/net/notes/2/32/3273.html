<A NAME="3273"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=2163><b>sn</b> The Law said that God would not clear the guilty. But here the punishment is postponed to some future date when he would revisit this matter. Others have taken the line to mean that whenever a reckoning was considered necessary, then this sin would be included (see B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 957). The repetition of the verb traditionally rendered &#8220;visit&#8221; in both clauses puts emphasis on the certainty &#8211; so &#8220;indeed.&#8221;</p>
