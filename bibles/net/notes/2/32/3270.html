<A NAME="3270"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=2160><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;wipe&#8221; is a figure of speech indicating &#8220;remove me&#8221; (meaning he wants to die). The translation &#8220;blot&#8221; is traditional, but not very satisfactory, since it does not convey complete removal. </p>
