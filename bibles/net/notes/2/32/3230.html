<A NAME="3230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2120><b>tn</b> S. R. Driver (<i>Exodus</i>, 351) draws on Arabic to show that the meaning of this verb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khalah</font>) was properly &#8220;make sweet the face&#8221; or &#8220;stroke the face&#8221;; so here &#8220;to entreat, seek to conciliate.&#8221; In this prayer, Driver adds, Moses urges four motives for mercy: 1) Israel is Yahweh&#8217;s people, 2) Israel&#8217;s deliverance has demanded great power, 3) the Egyptians would mock if the people now perished, and 4) the oath God made to the fathers.</p>
