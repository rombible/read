<A NAME="3271"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=2161><b>sn</b> The book that is referred to here should not be interpreted as the NT &#8220;book of life&#8221; which is portrayed (figuratively) as a register of all the names of the saints who are redeemed and will inherit eternal life. Here it refers to the names of those who are living and serving in this life, whose names, it was imagined, were on the roster in the heavenly courts as belonging to the chosen. Moses would rather die than live if these people are not forgiven (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 356). </p>
