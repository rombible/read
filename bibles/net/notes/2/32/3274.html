<A NAME="3274"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=2164><b>tn</b> The verse is difficult because of the double reference to the making of the calf. The NJPS&#8217;s translation tries to reconcile the two by reading &#8220;for what they did with the calf that Aaron had made.&#8221; B. S. Childs (<i>Exodus </i>[OTL],<i> </i>557) explains in some detail why this is not a good translation based on syntactical grounds; he opts for the conclusion that the last three words are a clumsy secondary addition. It seems preferable to take the view that both are true, Aaron is singled out for his obvious lead in the sin, but the people sinned by instigating the whole thing. </p>
