<A NAME="3269"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=2159><b>tn</b> The apodosis is not expressed; it would be understood as &#8220;good.&#8221; It is not stated because of the intensity of the expression (the figure is aposiopesis, a sudden silence). It is also possible to take this first clause as a desire and not a conditional clause, rendering it &#8220;Oh that you would forgive!&#8221;</p>
