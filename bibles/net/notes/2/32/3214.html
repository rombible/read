<A NAME="3214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2104><b>sn</b> The word means a &#8220;young bull&#8221; and need not be translated as &#8220;calf&#8221; (although &#8220;calf&#8221; has become the traditional rendering in English). The word could describe an animal three years old. Aaron probably made an inner structure of wood and then, after melting down the gold, plated it. The verb &#8220;molten&#8221; does not need to imply that the image was solid gold; the word is used in Isa 30:22 for gold plating. So it was a young bull calf that was overlaid with gold, and the gold was fashioned with the stylus.</p>
