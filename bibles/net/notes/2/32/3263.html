<A NAME="3263"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=2153><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Your hand was filled.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;fill your hands&#8221; is a familiar expression having to do with commissioning and devotion to a task that is earlier used in 28:41; 29:9, 29, 33, 35. This has usually been explained as a Qal imperative. S. R. Driver explains it &#8220;Fill your hand today,&#8221; meaning, take a sacrifice to God and be installed in the priesthood (<i>Exodus</i>, 355). But it probably is a Piel perfect, meaning &#8220;they have filled your hands today,&#8221; or, &#8220;your hand was filled today.&#8221; This was an expression meant to say that they had been faithful to God even though it turned them against family and friends &#8211; but God would give them a blessing.</p>
