<A NAME="3213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2103><b>tn</b> The verb looks similar to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatsar</font>), &#8220;to form, fashion&#8221; by a plan or a design. That is the verb used in Gen 2:7 for Yahweh God forming the man from the dust of the ground. If it is here, it is the reverse, a human &#8211; the dust of the ground &#8211; trying to form a god or gods. The active participle of this verb in Hebrew is &#8220;the potter.&#8221; A related noun is the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1461;&#1510;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<i>yetser</i>), &#8220;evil inclination,&#8221; the wicked designs or intent of the human heart (Gen 6:5). But see the discussion by B. S. Childs (<i>Exodus </i>[OTL], 555-56) on a different reading, one that links the root to a hollow verb meaning &#8220;to cast out of metal&#8221; (as in 1 Kgs 7:15).</p>
