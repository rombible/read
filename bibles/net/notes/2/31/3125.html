<A NAME="3125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2089><b>sn</b> The word &#8220;rest&#8221; essentially means &#8220;to cease, stop.&#8221; So describing God as &#8220;resting&#8221; on the seventh day does not indicate that he was tired &#8211; he simply finished creation and then ceased or stopped. But in this verse is a very bold anthropomorphism in the form of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyinnafash</font>), a Niphal preterite from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nafash</font>), the word that is related to &#8220;life, soul&#8221; or more specifically &#8220;breath, throat.&#8221; The verb is usually translated here as &#8220;he was refreshed,&#8221; offering a very human picture. It could also be rendered &#8220;he took breath&#8221; (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 345). Elsewhere the verb is used of people and animals. The anthropomorphism is clearly intended to teach people to stop and refresh themselves physically, spiritually, and emotionally on this day of rest. </p>
