<A NAME="3126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2090><b>sn</b> The expression &#8220;the finger of God&#8221; has come up before in the book, in the plagues (Exod 8:15) to express that it was a demonstration of the power and authority of God. So here too the commandments given to Moses on stone tablets came from God. It too is a bold anthropomorphism; to attribute such a material action to Yahweh would have been thought provoking to say the least. But by using &#8220;God&#8221; and by stating it in an obviously figurative way, balance is maintained. Since no one writes with one finger, the expression simply says that the Law came directly from God.</p>
