<A NAME="3114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2078><b>sn</b> The instruction for the Sabbath at this point seems rather abrupt, but it follows logically the extended plans of building the sanctuary. B. Jacob, following some of the earlier treatments, suggests that these are specific rules given for the duration of the building of the sanctuary (<i>Exodus</i>, 844). The Sabbath day is a day of complete cessation; no labor or work could be done. The point here is that God&#8217;s covenant people must faithfully keep the sign of the covenant as a living commemoration of the finished work of Yahweh, and as an active part in their sanctification.
