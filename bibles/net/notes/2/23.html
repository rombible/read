<A NAME="231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1562><b>sn</b> People who claim to worship and serve the righteous judge of the universe must preserve equity and justice in their dealings with others. These verses teach that God&#8217;s people must be honest witnesses (1-3); God&#8217;s people must be righteous even with enemies (4-5); and God&#8217;s people must be fair in dispensing justice (6-9). </p>
<A NAME="232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1563><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;take up, lift, carry&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nasa</font>&#8217;). This verb was also used in the prohibition against taking &#8220;the name of Yahweh in vain.&#8221; Sometimes the object of this verb is physical, as in Jonah 1:12 and 15. Used in this prohibition involving speech, it covers both originating and repeating a lie.</p>
<A NAME="233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1564><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;a groundless report&#8221; (see Exod 20:7 for the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shav</font>&#8217;).</p>
<A NAME="234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1565><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;do not put your hand&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV); NASB &#8220;join your hand.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1566><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;wicked&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1506;</font>, <font face="Scholar">rasha</font>&#8217;) refers to the guilty criminal, the person who is doing something wrong. In the religious setting it describes the person who is not a member of the covenant and may be involved in all kinds of sin, even though there is the appearance of moral and spiritual stability.</p>
<A NAME="236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1567><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1505;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khamas</font>) often means &#8220;violence&#8221; in the sense of social injustices done to other people, usually the poor and needy. A &#8220;malicious&#8221; witness would do great harm to others. See J. W. McKay, &#8220;Exodus 23:1-43, 6-8: A Decalogue for Administration of Justice in the City Gate,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 21 (1971): 311-25.</p>
<A NAME="237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1568><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rabbim</font>), here rendered &#8220;crowd,&#8221; is also used infrequently to refer to the &#8220;mighty,&#8221; people of importance in society (Job 35:9; cf. Lev 19:15). </p>
<A NAME="238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1569><b>tn</b> For any individual to join a group that is bent on acting wickedly would be a violation of the Law and would incur personal responsibility.</p>
<A NAME="239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1570><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;you will not answer in a lawsuit to turn after the crowd to turn.&#8221; The form translated &#8220;agrees with&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;to turn after&#8221;) is a Qal infinitive construct from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">natah</font>); the same root is used at the end of the verse but as a Hiphil infinitive construct, &#8220;to pervert [justice].&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1571><b>tn</b> The point here is one of false sympathy and honor, the bad sense of the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hadar</font>; see S.

<A NAME="2311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1572><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;meet&#8221; (so KJV, ASV, NASB).</p>
<A NAME="2312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1573><b>tn</b> The construction uses the imperfect tense (taken here as an obligatory imperfect) and the infinitive absolute for emphasis.</p>
<A NAME="2313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1574><b>tn</b> The line reads &#8220;you will cease to forsake him&#8221; &#8211; refrain from leaving your enemy without help.</p>
<A NAME="2314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1575><b>tn</b> The law is emphatic here as well, using the infinitive absolute and the imperfect of instruction (or possibly obligation). There is also a wordplay here: two words <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">azav</font>) are used, one meaning &#8220;forsake&#8221; and the other possibly meaning &#8220;arrange&#8221; based on Arabic and Ugaritic evidence (see U. Cassuto, <i>Exodus</i>, 297-98).</p>

<A NAME="2318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1579><b>tn</b> The two clauses probably should be related: the getting involved in the false charge could lead to the death of an innocent person (so, e.g., Naboth in 1 Kgs 21:10-13).</p>
<A NAME="2319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1580><b>sn</b> God will not declare right the one who is in the wrong. Society should also be consistent, but it cannot see the intents and motives, as God can. </p>

<A NAME="2321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1582><b>tn</b> The verb means &#8220;to crush.&#8221; S. R. Driver notes that in this context this would probably mean with an unfair judgment in the courts (<i>Exodus</i>, 239).</p>

<A NAME="2323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1584><b>sn</b> This section concerns religious duties of the people of God as they worship by giving thanks to God for their blessings. The principles here are: God requires his people to allow the poor to share in their bounty (10-11); God requires his people to provide times of rest and refreshment for those who labor for them (12); God requires allegiance to himself (13); God requires his people to come before him in gratitude and share their bounty (14-17); God requires that his people safeguard proper worship forms (18-19). </p>
<A NAME="2324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1585><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and six years&#8221;; this is an adverbial accusative telling how long they can work their land. The following references to years and days in vv. 10-12 function similarly.</p>
<A NAME="2325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1586><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the seventh year&#8221;; an adverbial accusative with a disjunctive <font face="Scholar">vav </font>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>).</p>

The rendering &#8220;hired help&#8221; assumes that the foreigner is mentioned in this context because he is working for an Israelite and will benefit from the Sabbath rest, along with his employer.</p>
<A NAME="2328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1589><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1508;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿyyinnafesh</font>); it is related to the word usually translated &#8220;soul&#8221; or &#8220;life.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1590><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;to do&#8221; is added; in Hebrew word order the line says, &#8220;In all that I have said to you you will watch yourselves.&#8221; The verb for paying attention is a Niphal imperfect with an imperatival force.</p>

<A NAME="2331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1592><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;mouth.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> See also Ps 16:4, where David affirms his loyalty to God with this expression. </p>
<A NAME="2332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1593><b>tn</b> The expression rendered &#8220;three times&#8221; is really &#8220;three feet,&#8221; or &#8220;three foot-beats.&#8221; The expression occurs only a few times in the Law. The expressing is an adverbial accusative. </p>
<A NAME="2333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1594><b>tn</b> This is the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;&#1465;&#1490;</font> (<font face="Scholar">takhog</font>) from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1490;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khagag</font>); it describes a feast that was accompanied by a pilgrimage. It was first used by Moses in his appeal that Israel go three days into the desert to hold such a feast.</p>
<A NAME="2334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1595><b>tn</b> This is an adverbial accusative of time.</p>
<A NAME="2335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1596><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in it.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1597><b>tn</b> The verb is a Niphal<i> </i>imperfect; the nuance of permission works well here &#8211; no one is permitted to appear before God empty (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they will not appear before me empty&#8221;).</p>

<A NAME="2338"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1599><b>tn</b> An infinitive construct with a preposition and a pronominal suffix is used to make a temporal clause: &#8220;in the going in of the year.&#8221; The word &#8220;year&#8221; is the subjective genitive, the subject of the clause.</p>
<A NAME="2339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1600><b>tn</b> An infinitive construct with a preposition and a pronominal suffix is used to make a temporal clause: &#8220;in the ingathering of you.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2340"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1601><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;gathered in your labors.&#8221; This is a metonymy of cause put for the effect. &#8220;Labors&#8221; are not gathered in, but what the labors produced &#8211; the harvest.</p>
<A NAME="2341"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1602><b>tn</b> Adverbial accusative of time: &#8220;three times&#8221; becomes &#8220;at three times.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2342"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1603><b>tn</b> Here the divine Name reads in Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1465;&#1503; &#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adon yÿhvah</font>), which if rendered according to the traditional scheme of &#8220;<sc>Lord&#8221; for &#8220;Yahweh&#8221; would result in &#8220;Lord <sc>Lord.&#8221; A number of English versions therefore render this phrase &#8220;Lord <sc>God,&#8221; and that convention has been followed here.</p>
<A NAME="2343"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1604><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1494;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tizbbakh</font>), an imperfect tense from the same root as the genitive that qualifies the accusative &#8220;blood&#8221;: &#8220;you will not sacrifice the blood of my sacrifice.&#8221; The verb means &#8220;to slaughter&#8221;; since one cannot slaughter blood, a more general translation is required here. But if the genitive is explained as &#8220;my blood-sacrifice&#8221; (a genitive of specification; like &#8220;the evil of your doings&#8221; in Isa 1:16), then a translation of sacrifice would work (U. Cassuto, <i>Exodus</i>, 304). </p>
<A NAME="2344"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1605><b>sn</b> See N. Snaith, &#8220;Exodus 23:18 and 34:25,&#8221; <i>JTS</i> 20 (1969): 533-34; see also M. Haran, &#8220;The Passover Sacrifice,&#8221; <i>Studies in the Religion of Ancient Israel</i> (VTSup), 86-116.</p>
<A NAME="2345"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1606><b>sn</b> On this verse, see C. M. Carmichael, &#8220;On Separating Life and Death: An Explanation of Some Biblical Laws,&#8221; <i>HTR</i> 69 (1976): 1-7; J. Milgrom, &#8220;You Shall Not Boil a Kid in Its Mother&#8217;s Milk,&#8221; <i>BRev</i> 1 (1985): 48-55; R. J. Ratner and B. Zuckerman, &#8220;In Rereading the &#8216;Kid in Milk&#8217; Inscriptions,&#8221; <i>BRev</i> 1 (1985): 56-58; and M. Haran, &#8220;Seething a Kid in Its Mother&#8217;s Milk,&#8221; <i>JJS</i> 30 (1979): 23-35. Here and at 34:26, where this command is repeated, it ends a series of instructions about procedures for worship.</p>
<A NAME="2346"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1607><b>sn</b> This passage has some of the most interesting and perplexing expressions and constructions in the book. It is largely promise, but it is part of the Law and so demands compliance by faith. Its points are: God promises to send his angel to prepare the way before his obedient servants (20-23); God promises blessing for his loyal servants (24-33). So in the section one learns that God promises his protection (victory) and blessing (through his angel) for his obedient and loyal worshipers. </p>
<A NAME="2347"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1608><b>tn</b> The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>) with the active participle indicates imminent future, something God is about to do. </p>
<A NAME="2348"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1609><b>sn</b> The word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mal</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akh</font>, &#8220;messenger, angel&#8221;). This angel is to be treated with the same fear and respect as Yahweh, for Yahweh will be speaking in him. U. Cassuto (<i>Exodus</i>, 305-6) says that the words of the first clause do not imply a being distinct from God, for in the ancient world the line of demarcation between the sender and the sent is liable easily to be blurred. He then shows how the &#8220;Angel of Yahweh&#8221; in Genesis is Yahweh. He concludes that the words here mean &#8220;I will guide you.&#8221; Christian commentators tend to identify the Angel of Yahweh as the second person of the Trinity (W. C. Kaiser, Jr., &#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:446). However, in addition to being a preincarnate appearance, the word could refer to Yahweh &#8211; some manifestation of Yahweh himself.</p>
<A NAME="2349"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1610><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;protect you in the way.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2350"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1611><b>tn</b> The form is the Hiphil<i> </i>perfect of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kun</font>, &#8220;to establish, prepare&#8221;). </p>
<A NAME="2351"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1612><b>sn</b> This means &#8220;the manifestation of my being&#8221; is in him (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 247). Driver quotes McNeile as saying, &#8220;The &#8216;angel&#8217; is Jehovah Himself &#8216;in a temporary descent to visibility for a special purpose.&#8217;&#8221; Others take the &#8220;name&#8221; to represent Yahweh&#8217;s &#8220;power&#8221; (NCV) or &#8220;authority&#8221; (NAB, CEV).</p>
<A NAME="2352"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=1613><b>tn</b> The infinitive absolute here does not add as great an emphasis as normal, but emphasizes the condition that is being set forth (see GKC 342-43 §113.<i>o</i>).</p>
<A NAME="2353"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1614><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;will cut them off&#8221; (so KJV, ASV). </p>

They were usually set up near the altar or the high place. To destroy these would be to destroy the centers of Canaanite worship in the land. </p>
<A NAME="2355"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=1616><b>tn</b> Both verbs are joined with their infinitive absolutes to provide the strongest sense to these instructions. The images of the false gods in Canaan were to be completely and utterly destroyed. This could not be said any more strongly.</p>
<A NAME="2356"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=1617><b>tn</b> The perfect tense, masculine plural, with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive is in sequence with the preceding: do not bow down to them, but serve Yahweh. It is then the equivalent of an imperfect of instruction or injunction.</p>
<A NAME="2357"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=1618><b>tn</b> The LXX reads &#8220;and I will bless&#8221; to make the verb conform with the speaker, Yahweh.</p>
<A NAME="2358"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=1619><b>sn</b> On this unusual clause B. Jacob says that it is the reversal of the curse in Genesis, because the &#8220;bread and water&#8221; represent the field work and ground suitability for abundant blessing of provisions (<i>Exodus</i>, 734). </p>
<A NAME="2359"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=1620><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;abort&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;cast.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2360"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=1621><b>sn</b> No one will die prematurely; this applies to the individual or the nation. The plan of God to bless was extensive, if only the people would obey. </p>
<A NAME="2361"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=1622><b>tn</b> The word for &#8220;terror&#8221; is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1502;&#1464;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">emati</font>); the word has the thought of &#8220;panic&#8221; or &#8220;dread.&#8221; God would make the nations panic as they heard of the exploits and knew the Israelites were drawing near. U. Cassuto thinks the reference to &#8220;hornets&#8221; in v. 28 may be a reference to this fear, an unreasoning dread, rather than to another insect invasion (<i>Exodus</i>, 308). Others suggest it is symbolic of an invading army or a country like Egypt or literal insects (see E. Neufeld, &#8220;Insects as Warfare Agents in the Ancient Near East,&#8221; <i>Or</i> 49 [1980]: 30-57).</p>
