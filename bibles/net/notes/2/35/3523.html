<A NAME="3523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2331><b>tn</b> The expression in Hebrew is &#8220;men on/after the women,&#8221; meaning men with women, to ensure that it was clear that the preceding verse did not mean only men. B. Jacob takes it further, saying that the men came after the women because the latter had taken the initiative (<i>Exodus</i>, 1017).</p>
