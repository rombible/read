<A NAME="401"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2475><b>sn</b> All of Exod 39:32-40:38 could be taken as a unit. The first section (39:32-43) shows that the Israelites had carefully and accurately completed the preparation and brought everything they had made to Moses: The work of the <sc>Lord builds on the faithful obedience of the people. In the second section are the instruction and the implementation (40:1-33): The work of the <sc>Lord progresses through the unifying of the work. The last part (40:34-38) may take the most attention: When the work was completed, the glory filled the tabernacle: By his glorious presence, the <sc>Lord blesses and directs his people in their worship.</p>
