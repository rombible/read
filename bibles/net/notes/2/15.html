<A NAME="151"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1032><b>sn</b> This chapter is a song of praise sung by Moses and the people right after the deliverance from the Sea. The song itself is vv. 1b-18; it falls into three sections &#8211; praise to God (1b-3), the cause for the praise (4-13), and the conclusion (14-18). The point of the first section is that God&#8217;s saving acts inspire praise from his people; the second is that God&#8217;s powerful acts deliver his people from the forces of evil; and the third section is that God&#8217;s demonstrations of his sovereignty inspire confidence in him by his people. So the Victory Song is very much like the other declarative praise psalms &#8211; the resolve to praise, the power of God, the victory over the enemies, the incomparability of God in his redemption, and the fear of the people. See also C. Cohen, &#8220;Studies in Early Israelite Poetry I: An Unrecognized Case of Three Line Staircase Parallelism in the Song of the Sea,&#8221; <i>JANESCU</i> <i>7 </i>(1975): 13-17; D. N.

<A NAME="152"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1033><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yashir</font>), a normal imperfect tense form. But after the adverb &#8220;then&#8221; this form is to be treated as a preterite (see GKC 314-15 §107.<i>c</i>).</p>
<A NAME="153"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1034><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they said, saying.&#8221; This has been simplified in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="154"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1035><b>tn</b> The form is the singular cohortative, expressing the resolution of Moses to sing the song of praise (&#8220;I will&#8221; being stronger than &#8220;I shall&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="155"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1036><b>tn</b> This causal clause gives the reason for and summary of the praise. The Hebrew expression has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1465;&#1492; &#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki ga</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">oh ga</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>). The basic idea of the verb is &#8220;rise up loftily&#8221; or &#8220;proudly.&#8221; But derivatives of the root carry the nuance of majesty or pride (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 132). So the idea of the perfect tense with its infinitive absolute may mean &#8220;he is highly exalted&#8221; or &#8220;he has done majestically&#8221; or &#8220;he is gloriously glorious.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="156"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1037><b>sn</b> The common understanding is that Egypt did not have people riding horses at this time, and so the phrase <i>the horse and its rider</i> is either viewed as an anachronism or is interpreted to mean charioteers. The word &#8220;to ride&#8221; can mean on a horse or in a chariot. Some have suggested changing &#8220;rider&#8221; to &#8220;chariot&#8221; (re-vocalization) to read &#8220;the horse and its chariot.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="157"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1038><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Yah.&#8221; Moses&#8217; poem here uses a short form of the name Yahweh, traditionally rendered in English by &#8220;the LORD.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="158"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1039><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1494;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿzimrat</font>) is problematic. It probably had a suffix <font face="Scholar">yod</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font>) that was accidentally dropped because of the <i>yod</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font>) on the divine name following. Most scholars posit another meaning for the word. A meaning of &#8220;power&#8221; fits the line fairly well, forming a hendiadys with strength &#8211; &#8220;strength and power&#8221; becoming &#8220;strong power.&#8221; Similar lines are in Isa 12:2 and Ps 118:14. Others suggest &#8220;protection&#8221; or &#8220;glory.&#8221; However, there is nothing substantially wrong with &#8220;my song&#8221; in the line &#8211; only that it would be a nicer match if it had something to do with strength.</p>
<A NAME="159"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1040><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">navah</font>) occurs only here. It may mean &#8220;beautify, adorn&#8221; with praises (see BDB 627 s.v.). See also M. Dahood, &#8220;Exodus 15:2: <i>&#8216;anwehu</i> and Ugaritic <i>snwt</i>,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 59 (1979): 260-61; and M. Klein, &#8220;The Targumic Tosefta to Exodus 15:2,&#8221; <i>JJS</i> 26 (1975): 61-67; and S. B. Parker, &#8220;Exodus 15:2 Again,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 21 (1971): 373-79.</p>
<A NAME="1510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1041><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;man of war&#8221; (so KJV, ASV). &#8220;Warrior&#8221; is now the preferred translation since &#8220;man of war&#8221; is more commonly known today as a warship. The expression indicates that Yahweh is one who understands how to fight and defeat the enemy. The word &#8220;war&#8221; modifies &#8220;man&#8221; to reveal that Yahweh is a warrior. Other passages use similar descriptions: Isa 42:13 has &#8220;man of wars&#8221;; Ps 24:8 has &#8220;mighty man of battle.&#8221; See F. Cross, &#8220;The Divine Warrior in Israel&#8217;s Early Cult,&#8221; <i>Biblical Motifs</i>, 11-30.</p>
<A NAME="1511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1042><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Yahweh is his name.&#8221; As throughout, the name &#8220;Yahweh&#8221; is rendered as &#8220;the <sc>Lord&#8221; in the translation, as is typically done in English translations.</p>
<A NAME="1512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1043><b>tn</b> Gesenius notes that the sign of the accusative, often omitted in poetry, is not found in this entire song (GKC 363 §117.<i>b</i>).</p>
<A NAME="1513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1044><b>tn</b> The word is a substantive, &#8220;choice, selection&#8221;; it is here used in the construct state to convey an attribute before a partitive genitive &#8211; &#8220;the choice of his officers&#8221; means his &#8220;choice officers&#8221; (see GKC 417 §128.<i>r</i>).</p>
<A NAME="1514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1045><b>tn</b> The form is a Qal passive rather than a Pual, for there is not Piel form or meaning.</p>
<A NAME="1515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1046><b>tn</b> The verb form is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1499;&#1463;&#1505;&#1456;&#1497;&#1467;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿkhasyumu</font>) is the Piel preterite. Normally a <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive is used with the preterite, but in some ancient poems the form without the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> appears, as is the case frequently in this poem. That such an archaic form is used should come as no surprise, because the word also uses the <i>yod</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font>) of the root (GKC 214 §75.<i>dd</i>), and the archaic suffix form (GKC 258 §91<i>.l</i>). These all indicate the antiquity of the poem.</p>
<A NAME="1516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1047><b>tn</b> The parasynonyms here are <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1465;&#1502;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tÿhomot</font>, &#8220;deep, ocean depths, deep waters&#8221;) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1510;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿtsolot</font>, &#8220;the depths&#8221;); S. R. Driver says properly the &#8220;gurgling places&#8221; (<i>Exodus</i>, 134).</p>
<A NAME="1517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1048><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1488;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ne</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">dari</font>) may be an archaic infinitive with the old ending <i>i</i>, used in place of the verb and meaning &#8220;awesome.&#8221; Gesenius says that the vowel ending may be an old case ending, especially when a preposition is inserted between the word and its genitive (GKC 253 §90.<i>l</i>), but he suggests a reconstruction of the form.</p>
<A NAME="1518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1049><b>sn</b> This expression is cognate with words in v. 1. Here that same greatness or majesty is extolled as in abundance.</p>
<A NAME="1519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1050><b>tn</b> Here, and throughout the song, these verbs are the prefixed conjugation that may look like the imperfect but are actually historic preterites. This verb is to &#8220;overthrow&#8221; or &#8220;throw down&#8221; &#8211; like a wall, leaving it in shattered pieces.</p>
<A NAME="1520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1051><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1502;&#1462;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qamekha</font>) is the active participle with a pronominal suffix. The participle is accusative, the object of the verb, but the suffix is the genitive of nearer definition (see GKC 358 §116.<i>i</i>).</p>
<A NAME="1521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1052><b>sn</b> The verb is the Piel of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shalakh</font>), the same verb used throughout for the demand on Pharaoh to release Israel. Here, in some irony, God released his wrath on them.</p>
<A NAME="1522"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1053><b>sn</b> The word <i>wrath</i> is a metonymy of cause; the effect &#8211; the judgment &#8211; is what is meant.</p>
<A NAME="1523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1054><b>tn</b> The verb is the prefixed conjugation, the preterite, without the consecutive <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>).</p>
<A NAME="1524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1055><b>sn</b> The phrase &#8220;the blast of your nostrils&#8221; is a bold anthropomorphic expression for the wind that came in and dried up the water.</p>
<A NAME="1525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1056><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;heap&#8221; describes the walls of water. The waters, which are naturally fluid, stood up as though they were a heap, a mound of earth. Likewise, the flowing waters deep in the ocean solidified &#8211; as though they were turned to ice (U. Cassuto, <i>Exodus</i>, 175).</p>
<A NAME="1526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1057><b>sn</b> W. C. Kaiser observes the staccato phrases that almost imitate the heavy, breathless heaving of the Egyptians as, with what reserve of strength they have left, they vow, &#8220;I will&#8230;, I will&#8230;, I will&#8230;&#8221; (&#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:395).</p>
<A NAME="1527"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1058><b>tn</b> The form is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nafshi</font>, &#8220;my soul&#8221;). But this word refers to the whole person, the body and the soul, or better, a bundle of appetites in a body. It therefore can figuratively refer to the desires or appetites (Deut 12:15; 14:26; 23:24). Here, with the verb &#8220;to be full&#8221; means &#8220;to be satisfied&#8221;; the whole expression might indicate &#8220;I will be sated with them&#8221; or &#8220;I will gorge myself.&#8221; The greedy appetite was to destroy.</p>
<A NAME="1528"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1059><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">riq</font>) means &#8220;to be empty&#8221; in the Qal, and in the Hiphil &#8220;to empty.&#8221; Here the idea is to unsheathe a sword.</p>
<A NAME="1529"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1060><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yarash</font>), which in the Hiphil means &#8220;to dispossess&#8221; or &#8220;root out.&#8221; The meaning &#8220;destroy&#8221; is a general interpretation.</p>
<A NAME="1530"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1061><b>tn</b> &#8220;But&#8221; has been supplied here.</p>
<A NAME="1531"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1062><b>tn</b> Here &#8220;and&#8221; has been supplied.</p>
<A NAME="1532"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1063><b>tn</b> The verb may have the idea of sinking with a gurgling sound, like water going into a whirlpool (R. A. Cole, <i>Exodus</i> [TOTC], 124; S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 136). See F. M. Cross and D. N. Freedman, &#8220;The Song of Miriam,&#8221; <i>JNES</i> 14 (1955): 243-47.</p>
<A NAME="1533"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1064><b>tn</b> The question is of course rhetorical; it is a way of affirming that no one is comparable to God. See C. J. Labuschagne, <i>The Incomparability of Yahweh in the Old Testament</i>, 22, 66-67, and 94-97.</p>
<A NAME="1534"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1065><b>sn</b> Verses 11-17 will now focus on Yahweh as the incomparable one who was able to save Israel from their foes and afterward lead them to the promised land.</p>
<A NAME="1535"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1066><b>tn</b> S. R. Driver suggests &#8220;praiseworthy acts&#8221; as the translation (<i>Exodus</i>, 137).</p>
<A NAME="1536"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1067><b>tn</b> The verb is the prefixed conjugation, the preterite without the <i>vav</i> consecutive. The subject, the &#8220;earth,&#8221; must be inclusive of the sea, or it may indicate the grave or Sheol; the sea drowned them. Some scholars wish to see this as a reference to Dathan and Abiram, and therefore evidence of a later addition or compilation. It fits this passage well, however.</p>
<A NAME="1537"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1068><b>tn</b> The verbs in the next two verses are perfect tenses, but can be interpreted as a prophetic perfect, looking to the future.</p>
<A NAME="1538"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1069><b>tn</b> The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<i>zu</i>) is a relative pronoun, subordinating the next verb to the preceding.</p>
<A NAME="1539"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1070><b>tn</b> This verb seems to mean &#8220;to guide to a watering-place&#8221; (See Ps 23:2).</p>
<A NAME="1540"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1071><b>tn</b> This verb is a prophetic perfect, assuming that the text means what it said and this song was sung at the Sea. So all these countries were yet to hear of the victory.</p>
<A NAME="1541"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1072><b>tn</b> The word properly refers to &#8220;pangs&#8221; of childbirth. When the nations hear, they will be terrified.</p>
<A NAME="1542"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1073><b>tn</b> The verb is again a prophetic perfect.</p>
<A NAME="1543"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1074><b>tn</b> This is a prophetic perfect.</p>
<A NAME="1544"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1075><b>tn</b> This verb is imperfect tense.</p>
<A NAME="1545"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1076><b>tn</b> The two words can form a nominal hendiadys, &#8220;a dreadful fear,&#8221; though most English versions retain the two separate terms.</p>
<A NAME="1546"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1077><b>tn</b> The form is an imperfect.</p>
<A NAME="1547"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1078><b>tn</b> The adjective is in construct form and governs the noun &#8220;arm&#8221; (&#8220;arm&#8221; being the anthropomorphic expression for what God did). See GKC 428 §132.<i>c</i>.</p>
<A NAME="1548"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1079><b>sn</b> For a study of the words for fear, see N. Waldman, &#8220;A Comparative Note on Exodus 15:14-16,&#8221; <i>JQR</i> 66 (1976): 189-92.</p>
<A NAME="1549"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1080><b>tn</b> Clauses beginning with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ad</font>) express a limit that is not absolute, but only relative, beyond which the action continues (GKC 446-47 §138.<i>g</i>).</p>
<A NAME="1550"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1081><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qanah</font>) here is the verb &#8220;acquire, purchase,&#8221; and probably not the homonym &#8220;to create, make&#8221; (see Gen 4:1; Deut 32:6; and Prov 8:22).</p>
<A NAME="1551"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1082><b>tn</b> The verb is imperfect.</p>
<A NAME="1552"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=1083><b>sn</b> The &#8220;mountain&#8221; and the &#8220;place&#8221; would be wherever Yahweh met with his people. It here refers to Canaan, the land promised to the patriarchs.</p>
<A NAME="1553"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1084><b>tn</b> The verb is perfect tense, referring to Yahweh&#8217;s previous choice of the holy place.</p>
<A NAME="1554"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1085><b>sn</b> See J. N. Easton, &#8220;Dancing in the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>ExpTim</i> 86 (1975): 136-40.</p>
<A NAME="1555"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=1086><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ana</font>) normally means &#8220;to answer,&#8221; but it can be used more technically to describe antiphonal singing in Hebrew and in Ugaritic.</p>
<A NAME="1556"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=1087><b>sn</b> This song of the sea is, then, a great song of praise for Yahweh&#8217;s deliverance of Israel at the Sea, and his preparation to lead them to the promised land, much to the (anticipated) dread of the nations. The principle here, and elsewhere in Scripture, is that the people of God naturally respond to God in praise for his great acts of deliverance. Few will match the powerful acts that were exhibited in Egypt, but these nonetheless set the tone. The song is certainly typological of the song of the saints in heaven who praise God for delivering them from the bondage of this world by judging the world. The focus of the praise, though, still is on the person (attributes) and works of God.</p>
<A NAME="1557"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=1088><b>sn</b> The first event of the Israelites&#8217; desert experience is a failure, for they murmur against Yahweh and are given a stern warning &#8211; and the provision of sweet water. The event teaches that God is able to turn bitter water into sweet water for his people, and he promises to do such things if they obey. He can provide for them in the desert &#8211; he did not bring them into the desert to let them die. But there is a deeper level to this story &#8211; the healing of the water is incidental to the healing of the people, their lack of trust. The passage is arranged in a neat chiasm, starting with a journey (A), ending with the culmination of the journey (A'); developing to bitter water (B), resolving to sweet water (B'); complaints by the people (C), leading to to the instructions for the people (C'); and the central turning point is the wonder miracle (D).</p>
<A NAME="1558"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=1089><b>tn</b> The verb form is unusual; the normal expression is with the Qal, which expresses that they journeyed. But here the Hiphil is used to underscore that Moses caused them to journey &#8211; and he is following God. So the point is that God was leading Israel to the bitter water.</p>
<A NAME="1559"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=1090><b>sn</b> The mention that they travelled for three days into the desert is deliberately intended to recall Moses&#8217; demand that they go three days into the wilderness to worship. Here, three days in, they find bitter water and complain &#8211; not worship.</p>
<A NAME="1560"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=1091><b>sn</b> The Hebrew word &#8220;Marah&#8221; means &#8220;bitter.&#8221; This motif will be repeated four times in this passage to mark the central problem. Earlier in the book the word had been used for the &#8220;bitter herbs&#8221; in the Passover, recalling the bitter labor in bondage. So there may be a double reference here &#8211; to the bitter waters and to Egypt itself &#8211; God can deliver from either.</p>
<A NAME="1561"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=1092><b>tn</b> The infinitive construct here provides the direct object for the verb &#8220;to be able,&#8221; answering the question of what they were not able to do.</p>
<A NAME="1562"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=1093><b>tn</b> The causal clause here provides the reason for their being unable to drink the water, as well as a clear motivation for the name.</p>
<A NAME="1563"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=1094><b>sn</b> Many scholars have attempted to explain these things with natural phenomena. Here Marah is identified with Ain Hawarah. It is said that the waters of this well are notoriously salty and brackish; Robinson said it was six to eight feet in diameter and the water about two feet deep; the water is unpleasant, salty, and somewhat bitter. As a result the Arabs say it is the worst tasting water in the area (W. C. Kaiser, Jr., &#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:398). But that would not be a sufficient amount of water for the number of Israelites in the first place, and in the second, they could not drink it at all. But third, how did Moses change it?</p>
<A NAME="1564"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=1095><b>tn</b> The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al-ken</font>) formula in the Pentateuch serves to explain to the reader the reason for the way things were. It does not necessarily mean here that Israel named the place &#8211; but they certainly could have.</p>
<A NAME="1565"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=1096><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;one called its name,&#8221; the expression can be translated as a passive verb if the subject is not expressed.</p>

They were not merely complaining &#8211; they were questioning God&#8217;s abilities and motives. The action is something like a parliamentary vote of no confidence.</p>
<A NAME="1567"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=1098><b>tn</b> The imperfect tense here should be given a potential nuance: &#8220;What can we drink?&#8221; since the previous verse reports that they were not able to drink the water.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> It is likely that Moses used words very much like this when he prayed. The difference seems to lie in the prepositions &#8211; he cried &#8220;to&#8221; Yahweh, but the people murmured &#8220;against&#8221; Moses.</p>

Driver (<i>Exodus</i>, 143) follows some local legends in identifying this tree as one that is supposed to have &#8211; even to this day &#8211; the properties necessary for making bitter water sweet. B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 436) reports that no such tree has ever been found, but then he adds that this does not mean there was not such a bush in the earlier days. He believes that here God used a natural means (&#8220;showed, instructed&#8221;) to sweeten the water. He quotes Ben Sira as saying God had created these things with healing properties in them.</p>

<A NAME="1575"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">75</span><note=1106><b>tn</b> The construction uses the infinitive absolute and the imperfect tense of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shama</font>&#8217;). The meaning of the verb is idiomatic here because it is followed by &#8220;to the voice of Yahweh your God.&#8221; When this is present, the verb is translated &#8220;obey.&#8221; The construction is in a causal clause. It reads, &#8220;If you will diligently obey.&#8221; Gesenius points out that the infinitive absolute in a conditional clause also emphasizes the importance of the condition on which the consequence depends (GKC 342-43 §113.<i>o</i>).</p>

The lesson is clear: God uses adversity to test his people&#8217;s loyalty. The response to adversity must be prayer to God, for he can turn the bitter into the sweet, the bad into the good, and the prospect of death into life.</p>
