Here there is a mixture of God&#8217;s preparation of people to do the work and their willingness to give and to serve. It not only provides insight into this renewed community of believers, but it also provides a timeless message for the church. The point is clear enough: In response to God&#8217;s commission, and inspired by God&#8217;s Spirit, the faithful and willing people rally to support and participate in the <sc>Lord&#8217;s work. </p>
