<A NAME="1824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1264><b>sn</b> This is a simple summary of the function of Moses on this particular day. He did not necessarily do this every day, but it was time now to do it. The people would come to solve their difficulties or to hear instruction from Moses on decisions to be made. The tradition of &#8220;sitting in Moses&#8217; seat&#8221; is drawn from this passage. </p>
