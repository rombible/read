<A NAME="1848"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1288><b>sn</b> It is not clear how this structure would work in a judicial setting. The language of &#8220;captains of thousands,&#8221; etc., is used more for military ranks. There must have been more detailed instruction involved here, for each Israelite would have come under four leaders with this arrangement, and perhaps difficult cases would be sent to the next level. But since the task of these men would also involve instruction and guidance, the breakdown would be very useful. Deut 1:9, 13 suggest that the choice of these people was not simply Moses&#8217; alone. </p>
