<A NAME="1820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1260><b>tn</b> The verb is &#8220;and he took&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV, NASB). It must have the sense of getting the animals for the sacrifice. The Syriac, Targum, and Vulgate have &#8220;offered.&#8221; But Cody argues because of the precise wording in the text Jethro did not offer the sacrifices but received them (A. Cody, &#8220;Exodus 18,12: Jethro Accepts a Covenant with the Israelites,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 49 [1968]: 159-61).</p>
