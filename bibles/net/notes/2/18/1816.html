<A NAME="1816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1256><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khada</font>) is rare, occurring only in Job 3:6 and Ps 21:6, although it is common in Aramaic. The LXX translated it &#8220;he shuddered.&#8221; U. Cassuto suggests that that rendering was based on the midrashic interpretation in <i>b. Sanhedrin 94b</i>, &#8220;he felt cuts in his body&#8221; &#8211; a wordplay on the verb (<i>Exodus</i>, 215-16).</p>
