<A NAME="1821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1261><b>sn</b> Jethro brought offerings as if he were the one who had been delivered. The &#8220;burnt offering&#8221; is singular, to honor God first. The other sacrifices were intended for the invited guests to eat (a forerunner of the peace offering). See B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 498.</p>
