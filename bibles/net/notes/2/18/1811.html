<A NAME="1811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1251><b>sn</b> This verse may seem out of place, since the report has already been given that they came to the desert. It begins to provide details of the event that the previous verse summarizes. The announcement in verse 6 may have come in advance by means of a messenger or at the time of arrival, either of which would fit with the attention to formal greetings in verse 7. This would suit a meeting between two important men; the status of Moses has changed. The LXX solves the problem by taking the pronoun &#8220;I&#8221; as the particle &#8220;behold&#8221; and reads it this way: &#8220;one said to Moses, &#8216;Behold, your father-in-law has come&#8230;.&#8217;&#8221; </p>
