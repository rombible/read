<A NAME="181"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1241><b>sn</b> This chapter forms the transition to the Law. There has been the deliverance, the testing passages, the provision in the wilderness, and the warfare. Any God who can do all this for his people deserves their allegiance. In chap. 18 the Lawgiver is giving advice, using laws and rulings, but then he is given advice to organize the elders to assist. Thus, when the Law is fully revealed, a system will be in place to administer it. The point of the passage is that a great leader humbly accepts advice from other godly believers to delegate responsibility. He does not try to do it all himself; God does not want one individual to do it all. The chapter has three parts: vv. 1-12 tell how Jethro heard and came and worshiped and blessed; vv. 13-23 have the advice of Jethro, and then vv. 24-27 tell how Moses implemented the plan and Jethro went home. See further E. J. Runions, &#8220;Exodus Motifs in 1 Samuel 7 and 8,&#8221; <i>EvQ</i> 52 (1980): 130-31; and also see for another idea T. C. Butler, &#8220;An Anti-Moses Tradition,&#8221; <i>JSOT</i> 12 (1979): 9-15.</p>
