<A NAME="2541"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1716><b>sn</b> There is some debate as to the meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1505;&#1456;&#1490;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">misgeret</font>). This does not seem to be a natural part of the table and its legs. The drawing on the Arch of Titus shows two cross-stays in the space between the legs, about halfway up. It might have been nearer the top, but the drawing of the table of presence-bread from the arch shows it half-way up. This frame was then decorated with the molding as well. </p>
