<A NAME="259"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1684><b>sn</b> This color is made from the eggs and bodies of the worm <i>coccus ilicus</i>, which is found with the holly plant &#8211; so <i>Heb</i> &#8220;worm of brilliance.&#8221; The powder made from the dried maggots produces a bright red-yellow color (W. C. Kaiser, Jr., &#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:452). B. Jacob takes the view that these are not simply colors that are being introduced here, but fabrics dyed with these colors (<i>Exodus</i>, 765). At any rate, the sequence would then be metals, fabrics, and leathers (v. 5). </p>
