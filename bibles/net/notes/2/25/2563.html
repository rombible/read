<A NAME="2563"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=1738><b>tn</b> The translation &#8220;set up on&#8221; is from the Hebrew verb &#8220;bring up.&#8221; The construction is impersonal, &#8220;and he will bring up,&#8221; meaning &#8220;one will bring up.&#8221; It may mean that people were to fix the lamps on to the shaft and the branches, rather than cause the light to go up (see S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 277).</p>
