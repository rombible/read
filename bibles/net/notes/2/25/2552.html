<A NAME="2552"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=1727><b>sn</b> U. Cassuto (<i>Exodus</i>, 342-44) says that the description &#8220;the cups, knobs and flowers&#8221; is explained in vv. 32-36 as three decorations in the form of a cup, shaped like an almond blossom, to be made on one branch. Every cup will have two parts, (a) a knob, that is, the receptacle at the base of the blossom, and (b) a flower, which is called the corolla, so that each lamp rests on top of a flower. </p>
