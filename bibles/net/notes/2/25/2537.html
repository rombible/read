<A NAME="2537"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1712><b>sn</b> Here then is the main point of the ark of the covenant, and the main point of all worship &#8211; meeting with God through atonement. The text makes it clear that here God would meet with Moses (&#8220;you&#8221; is singular) and then he would speak to the people &#8211; he is the mediator of the covenant. S. R. Driver (<i>Exodus</i>, 272) makes the point that the verb here is not the word that means &#8220;to meet by chance&#8221; (as in Exod 3:18), but &#8220;to meet&#8221; by appointment for a purpose (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">vÿno</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adti</font>). The parallel in the NT is Jesus Christ and his work. The theology is that the Law condemns people as guilty of sin, but the sacrifice of Christ makes atonement. So he is the &#8220;place of propitiation (Rom 3:25) who gains communion with the Father for sinners. A major point that could be made from this section is this: At the center of worship must be the atoning work of Christ &#8211; a perpetual reminder of God&#8217;s righteous standard (the testimony in the ark) and God&#8217;s gracious provision (the atonement lid). </p>
