<A NAME="2518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1693><b>sn</b> The expression &#8220;the pattern of the tabernacle&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tavnit hammiskan</font>) has been the source of much inquiry. The word rendered &#8220;pattern&#8221; is related to the verb &#8220;to build&#8221;; it suggests a model. S. R. Driver notes that in ancient literature there is the account of Gudea receiving in a dream a complete model of a temple he was to erect (<i>Exodus</i>, 267). In this passage Moses is being shown something on the mountain that should be the pattern of the earthly sanctuary. The most plausible explanation of what he was shown comes from a correlation with comments in the Letter to the Hebrews and the book of Revelation, which describe the heavenly sanctuary as the true sanctuary, and the earthly as the copy or shadow. One could say that Moses was allowed to see what John saw on the island of Patmos, a vision of the heavenly sanctuary. That still might not explain what it was, but it would mean he saw a revelation of the true tent, and that would imply that he learned of the spiritual and eternal significance of all of it. The fact that Israel&#8217;s sanctuary resembled those of other cultures does not nullify this act of revelation; rather, it raises the question of where the other nations got their ideas if it was not made known early in human history. One can conclude that in the beginning there was much more revealed to the parents in the garden than Scripture tells about (Cain and Abel did know how to make sacrifices before Leviticus legislated it). Likewise, one cannot but guess at the influence of the fallen Satan and his angels in the world of pagan religion. Whatever the source, at Sinai God shows the true, and instructs that it all be done without the pagan corruptions and additions. U. Cassuto notes that the existence of these ancient parallels shows that the section on the tabernacle need not be dated in the second temple period, but fits the earlier period well (<i>Exodus</i>, 324). </p>
