<A NAME="2528"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1703><b>tn</b> The noun is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kapporet</font>), translated &#8220;atonement lid&#8221; or &#8220;atonement plate.&#8221; The traditional translation &#8220;mercy-seat&#8221; (so KJV, ASV, NASB, NRSV) came from Tyndale in 1530 and was also used by Luther in 1523. The noun is formed from the word &#8220;to make atonement.&#8221; The item that the Israelites should make would be more than just a lid for the ark. It would be the place where atonement was signified. The translation of &#8220;covering&#8221; is probably incorrect, for it derives from a rare use of the verb, if the same verb at all (the evidence shows &#8220;cover&#8221; is from another root with the same letters as this). The value of this place was that Yahweh sat enthroned above it, and so the ark essentially was the &#8220;footstool.&#8221; Blood was applied to the lid of the box, for that was the place of atonement (see S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 269-270).</p>
