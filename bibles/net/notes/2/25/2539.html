<A NAME="2539"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1714><b>sn</b> The Table of the Bread of the Presence (Tyndale&#8217;s translation, &#8220;Shewbread,&#8221; was used in KJV and influenced ASV, NAB) was to be a standing acknowledgment that Yahweh was the giver of daily bread. It was called the &#8220;presence-bread&#8221; because it was set out in his presence. The theology of this is that God provides, and the practice of this is that the people must provide for constant thanks. So if the ark speaks of communion through atonement, the table speaks of dedicatory gratitude. </p>
