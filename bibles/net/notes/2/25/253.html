<A NAME="253"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1678><b>tn</b> The &#8220;offering&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tÿrumah</font>) is perhaps better understood as a contribution since it was a freewill offering. There is some question about the etymology of the word. The traditional meaning of &#8220;heave-offering&#8221; derives from the idea of &#8220;elevation,&#8221; a root meaning &#8220;to be high&#8221; lying behind the word. B. Jacob says it is something sorted out of a mass of material and designated for a higher purpose (<i>Exodus</i>, 765). S. R. Driver (<i>Exodus</i>, 263) corrects the idea of &#8220;heave-offering&#8221; by relating the root to the Hiphil<i> </i>form of that root, <i>herim</i>, &#8220;to lift&#8221; or &#8220;take off.&#8221; He suggests the noun means &#8220;what is taken off&#8221; from a larger mass and so designated for sacred purposes. The LXX has &#8220;something taken off.&#8221; </p>
