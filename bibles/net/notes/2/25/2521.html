<A NAME="2521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1696><b>sn</b> This section begins with the ark, the most sacred and important object of Israel&#8217;s worship. Verses 10-15 provide the instructions for it, v. 16 has the placement of the Law in it, vv. 17-21 cover the mercy lid, and v. 22 the meeting above it. The point of this item in the tabernacle is to underscore the focus: the covenant people must always have God&#8217;s holy standard before them as they draw near to worship. A study of this would focus on God&#8217;s nature (he is a God of order, precision, and perfection), on the usefulness of this item for worship, and on the typology intended.</p>
