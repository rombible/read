<A NAME="2513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1688><b>tn</b> The meaning of the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tÿkhashim</font>) is debated. The Arabic <font face="Scholar">tuhas</font> or <font face="Scholar">duhas</font> is a dolphin, and so some think a sea animal is meant &#8211; something like a dolphin or porpoise (cf. NASB; ASV &#8220;sealskins&#8221;; NIV &#8220;hides of sea cows&#8221;). Porpoises are common in the Red Sea; their skins are used for clothing by the bedouin. The word has also been connected to an Egyptian word for &#8220;leather&#8221; (<font face="Scholar">ths</font>); see S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 265. Some variation of this is followed by NRSV (&#8220;fine leather&#8221;) and NLT (&#8220;fine goatskin leather&#8221;). Another suggestion connects this word to an Akkadian one that describes a precious stone that is yellow or ornge and also leather died with the color of this stone (N. M. Sarna, <i>Exodus</i> [JPSTC],<i> </i>157-58).</p>
