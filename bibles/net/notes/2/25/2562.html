<A NAME="2562"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=1737><b>tn</b> The word for &#8220;lamps&#8221; is from the same root as the lampstand, of course. The word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1461;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nerot</font>). This probably refers to the small saucer-like pottery lamps that are made very simply with the rim pinched over to form a place to lay the wick. The bowl is then filled with olive oil as fuel.</p>
