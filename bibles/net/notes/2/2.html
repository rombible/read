<A NAME="21"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=61><b>sn</b> The chapter records the exceptional survival of Moses under the decree of death by Pharaoh (vv. 1-10), the flight of Moses from Pharaoh after killing the Egyptian (vv. 11-15), the marriage of Moses (vv. 16-22), and finally a note about the <sc>Lord&#8217;s hearing the sighing of the people in bondage (vv. 23-25). The first part is the birth. The Bible has several stories about miraculous or special births and deliverances of those destined to lead Israel. Their impact is essentially to authenticate the individual&#8217;s ministry. If the person&#8217;s beginning was providentially provided and protected by the <sc>Lord, then the mission must be of divine origin too. In this chapter the plot works around the decree for the death of the children &#8211; a decree undone by the women. The second part of the chapter records Moses&#8217; flight and marriage. Having introduced the deliverer Moses in such an auspicious way, the chapter then records how this deliverer acted presumptuously and had to flee for his life. Any deliverance God desired had to be supernatural, as the chapter&#8217;s final note about answering prayer shows. </p>
<A NAME="22"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=62><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;house.&#8221; In other words, the tribe of Levi.</p>

<A NAME="24"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=64><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a daughter of Levi.&#8221; The word &#8220;daughter&#8221; is used in the sense of &#8220;descendant&#8221; and connects the new account with Pharaoh&#8217;s command in 1:22. The words &#8220;a woman who was&#8221; are added for clarity in English.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The first part of this section is the account of hiding the infant (vv. 1-4). The marriage, the birth, the hiding of the child, and the positioning of Miriam, are all faith operations that ignore the decree of Pharaoh or work around it to preserve the life of the child.</p>
<A NAME="25"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=65><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;conceived&#8221; (KJV, ASV, NAB, NASB, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="26"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=66><b>tn</b> A preterite form with the <i>vav</i> consecutive can be subordinated to a following clause. What she saw stands as a reason for what she did: &#8220;when she saw&#8230;she hid him three months.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="27"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=67><b>tn</b> After verbs of perceiving or seeing there are frequently two objects, the formal accusative (&#8220;she saw him&#8221;) and then a noun clause that explains what it was about the child that she perceived (&#8220;that he was healthy&#8221;). See GKC 365 §117.<i>h</i>. </p>
<A NAME="28"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=68><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;fine&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tov</font>). The construction is parallel to phrases in the creation narrative (&#8220;and God saw that it was good,&#8221; Gen 1:4, 10, 12, 17, 21, 25, 31). B. Jacob says, &#8220;She looked upon her child with a joy similar to that of God upon His creation (Gen 1.4ff.)&#8221; (<i>Exodus</i>, 25). </p>
<A NAME="29"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=69><b>sn</b> See on the meaning of this basket C. Cohen, &#8220;Hebrew <i>tbh</i>: Proposed Etymologies,&#8221; <i>JANESCU</i> 9 (1972): 36-51. This term is used elsewhere only to refer to the ark of Noah. It may be connected to the Egyptian word for &#8220;chest.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=70><b>sn</b> The circumstances of the saving of the child Moses have prompted several attempts by scholars to compare the material to the Sargon myth. See R. F. Johnson, <i>IDB</i> 3:440-50;<i> </i>for the text see<i> </i>L. W. King, <i>Chronicles concerning Early Babylonian Kings</i>,<i> </i>2:87-90. Those who see the narrative using the Sargon story&#8217;s pattern would be saying that the account presents Moses in imagery common to the ancient world&#8217;s expectations of extraordinary achievement and deliverance. In the Sargon story the infant&#8217;s mother set him adrift in a basket in a river; he was loved by the gods and destined for greatness. Saying Israel used this to invent the account in Exodus would undermine its reliability. But there are other difficulties with the Sargon comparison, not the least of which is the fact that the meaning and function of the Sargon story are unclear. Second, there is no outside threat to the child Sargon. The account simply shows how a child was exposed, rescued, nurtured, and became king (see B. S. Childs, <i>Exodus</i> [OTL],<i> </i>8-12). Third, other details do not fit: Moses&#8217; father is known, Sargon&#8217;s is not; Moses is never abandoned, since he is never out of the care of his parents, and the finder is a princess and not a goddess. Moreover, without knowing the precise function and meaning of the Sargon story, it is almost impossible to explain its use as a pattern for the biblical account. By itself, the idea of a mother putting a child by the river if she wants him to be found would have been fairly sensible, for that is where the women of the town would be washing their clothes or bathing. If someone wanted to be sure the infant was discovered by a sympathetic woman, there would be no better setting (see R. A. Cole, <i>Exodus</i> [TOTC], 57). While there need not be a special genre of storytelling here, it is possible that Exodus 2 might have drawn on some of the motifs and forms of the other account to describe the actual event in the sparing of Moses &#8211; if they knew of it. If so it would show that Moses was cast in the form of the greats of the past. </p>
<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=71><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;stood.&#8221; The verb is the Hitpael preterite of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatsav</font>), although the form is anomalous and perhaps should be spelled as in the Samaritan Pentateuch (see GKC 193 §71). The form yields the meaning of &#8220;take a stand, position or station oneself.&#8221; His sister found a good vantage point to wait and see what might become of the infant.</p>
<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=72><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to know&#8221;; many English versions have &#8220;to see.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=73><b>tn</b> The verb is a Niphal imperfect; it should be classified here as a historic future, future from the perspective of a point in a past time narrative.</p>
<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=74><b>sn</b> It is impossible, perhaps, to identify with certainty who this person was. For those who have taken a view that Rameses was the pharaoh, there were numerous daughters for Rameses. She is named Tharmuth in <i>Jub</i>. 47:5; Josephus spells it Thermouthis (<i>Ant.</i> 2.9.5 [2.224]), but Eusebius has Merris (<i>Praep. Ev.</i> ix. 27). E. H. Merrill (<i>Kingdom of Priests</i>, 60) makes a reasonable case for her identification as the famous Hatshepsut, daughter of Thutmose I. She would have been there about the time of Moses&#8217; birth, and the general picture of her from history shows her to be the kind of princess with enough courage to countermand a decree of her father. </p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=75><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;bathe.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=76><b>sn</b> A disjunctive <i>vav</i> initiates here a circumstantial clause. The picture is one of a royal entourage coming down to the edge of a tributary of the river, and while the princess was bathing, her female attendants were walking along the edge of the water out of the way of the princess. They may not have witnessed the discovery or the discussion. </p>
<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=77><b>tn</b> The word here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amah</font>), which means &#8220;female slave.&#8221; The word translated &#8220;attendants&#8221; earlier in the verse is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1512;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">na</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arot</font>, &#8220;young women&#8221;), possibly referring here to an assortment of servants and companions.</p>
<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=78><b>tn</b> The verb is preterite, third person feminine singular, with a pronominal suffix, from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">laqakh</font>, &#8220;to take&#8221;). The form says literally &#8220;and she took it,&#8221; and retains the princess as the subject of the verb.</p>
<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=79><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and she opened.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=80><b>tn</b> The grammatical construction has a pronominal suffix on the verb as the direct object along with the expressed object: &#8220;and she saw him, the child.&#8221; The second object defines the previous pronominal object to avoid misunderstanding (see GKC 425 §131.<i>m</i>).</p>
<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=81><b>tn</b> The text has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">na</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ar</font>, &#8220;lad, boy, young man&#8221;), which in this context would mean a baby boy. </p>
<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=82><b>tn</b> This clause is introduced with a disjunctive <i>vav </i>and the deictic particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>, &#8220;behold&#8221; in the KJV). The particle in this kind of clause introduces the unexpected &#8211; what Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter saw when she opened the basket: &#8220;and look, there was a baby boy crying.&#8221; The clause provides a parenthetical description of the child as she saw him when she opened the basket and does not advance the narrative. It is an important addition, however, for it puts readers in the position of looking with her into the basket and explains her compassion. </p>
<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=83><b>tn</b> The verb could be given a more colloquial translation such as &#8220;she felt sorry for him.&#8221; But the verb is stronger than that; it means &#8220;to have compassion, to pity, to spare.&#8221; What she felt for the baby was strong enough to prompt her to spare the child from the fate decreed for Hebrew boys. Here is part of the irony of the passage: What was perceived by many to be a womanly weakness &#8211; compassion for a baby &#8211; is a strong enough emotion to prompt the woman to defy the orders of Pharaoh. The ruler had thought sparing women was safe, but the midwives, the Hebrew mother, the daughter of Pharaoh, and Miriam, all work together to spare one child &#8211; Moses (cf. 1 Cor 1:27-29). </p>
<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=84><b>sn</b> The text uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qara</font>&#8217;), meaning &#8220;to call&#8221; or &#8220;summon.&#8221; Pharaoh himself will &#8220;summon&#8221; Moses many times in the plague narratives. Here the word is used for the daughter summoning the child&#8217;s mother to take care of him. The narratives in the first part of the book of Exodus include a good deal of foreshadowing of events that occur in later sections of the book (see M. Fishbane, <i>Biblical Text and Texture</i>).</p>
<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=85><b>tn</b> The object of the verb &#8220;get/summon&#8221; is &#8220;a woman.&#8221; But <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1497;&#1504;&#1462;&#1511;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">meneqet</font>, &#8220;nursing&#8221;), the Hiphil participle of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yanaq</font>, &#8220;to suck&#8221;), is in apposition to it, clarifying what kind of woman should be found &#8211; a woman, a nursing one. Of course Moses&#8217; mother was ready for the task. </p>
<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=86><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1514;&#1461;&#1497;&#1504;&#1460;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿteniq</font>) is the Hiphil imperfect/jussive, third feminine singular, of the same root as the word for &#8220;nursing.&#8221; It is here subordinated to the preceding imperfect (&#8220;shall I go&#8221;) and perfect with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive (&#8220;and summon&#8221;) to express the purpose: &#8220;in order that she may.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> No respectable Egyptian woman of this period would have undertaken the task of nursing a foreigner&#8217;s baby, and so the suggestion by Miriam was proper and necessary. Since she was standing a small distance away from the events, she was able to come forward when the discovery was made.</p>
<A NAME="227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=87><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Go&#8221; (so KJV, ASV); NASB &#8220;Go ahead&#8221;; TEV &#8220;Please do.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=88><b>sn</b> The word used to describe the sister (Miriam probably) is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alma</font>), the same word used in Isa 7:14, where it is usually translated either &#8220;virgin&#8221; or &#8220;young woman.&#8221; The word basically means a young woman who is ripe for marriage. This would indicate that Miriam is a teenager and so about fifteen years older than Moses. </p>
<A NAME="229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=89><b>tn</b> <font face="Scholar">Heb</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qara</font>&#8217;, &#8220;called&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=90><b>sn</b> During this period of Egyptian history the royal palaces were in the northern or Delta area of Egypt, rather than up the Nile as in later periods. The proximity of the royal residences to the Israelites makes this and the plague narratives all the more realistic. Such direct contact would have been unlikely if Moses had had to travel up the Nile to meet with Pharaoh. In the Delta area things were closer. Here all the people would have had access to the tributaries of the Nile near where the royal family came, but the royal family probably had pavilions and hunting lodges in the area. See also N. Osborn, &#8220;Where on Earth Are We? Problems of Position and Movement in Space,&#8221; <i>BT</i> 31 (1980): 239-42.</p>
<A NAME="231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=91><b>tn</b> The verb is the Hiphil imperative of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">halakh</font>), and so is properly rendered &#8220;cause to go&#8221; or &#8220;take away.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=92><b>tn</b> The possessive pronoun on the noun &#8220;wage&#8221; expresses the indirect object: &#8220;I will pay wages to you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=93><b>tn</b> The verb is the preterite of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gadal</font>), and so might be rendered &#8220;and he became great.&#8221; But the context suggests that it refers to when he was weaned and before he was named, perhaps indicating he was three or four years old (see Gen 21:8).</p>
<A NAME="234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=94><b>tn</b> The idiomatic expression literally reads: &#8220;and he was to her for a son.&#8221; In this there are two prepositions <i>lamed.</i> The first expresses possession: &#8220;he was to her&#8221; means &#8220;she had.&#8221; The second is part of the usage of the verb: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">haya</font>) with the <font face="Scholar">lamed</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font>) preposition means &#8220;to become.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=95><b>sn</b> The naming provides the climax and summary of the story. The name of &#8220;Moses&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mosheh</font>) is explained by &#8220;I have drawn him (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mÿshitihu</font>) from the water.&#8221; It appears that the name is etymologically connected to the verb in the saying, which is from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mashah</font>, &#8220;to draw out&#8221;). But commentators have found it a little difficult that the explanation of the name by the daughter of Pharaoh is in Hebrew when the whole background is Egyptian (U. Cassuto, <i>Exodus</i>, 20). Moreover, the Hebrew spelling of the name is the form of the active participle (&#8220;the one who draws out&#8221;); to be a precise description it should have been spelled <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mashuy</font>), the passive participle (&#8220;the one drawn out&#8221;). The etymology is not precise; rather, it is a wordplay (called paronomasia). Either the narrator merely attributed words to her (which is unlikely outside of fiction), or the Hebrew account simply translated what she had said into Hebrew, finding a Hebrew verb with the same sounds as the name. Such wordplays on names (also popular etymology) are common in the Bible. Most agree that the name is an Egyptian name. Josephus attempted to connect the biblical etymology with the name in Greek, <i>Mouses</i>, stating that <i>Mo</i> is Egyptian for water, and <i>uses</i> means those rescued from it (<i>Ant.</i> 2.9.6 [2.228]; see also J. Gwyn Griffiths, &#8220;The Egyptian Derivation of the Name Moses,&#8221; <i>JNES</i> 12 [1953]: 225). But the solution to the name is not to be derived from the Greek rendering. Due to the estimation Egyptians had of the Nile, the princess would have thought of the child from the river as a supernatural provision. The Egyptian hieroglyphic <font face="Scholar">ms</font> can be the noun &#8220;child&#8221; or the perfective verb &#8220;be born.&#8221; This was often connected with divine elements for names: Ptah-mose, &#8220;Ptah is born.&#8221; Also the name Rameses (<font face="Scholar">R</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">-m-sw</font>) means &#8220;[the god] Re&#8217; is he who has born him.&#8221; If the name Moses is Egyptian, there are some philological difficulties (see the above article for their treatment). The significance of all this is that when the child was named by the princess, an Egyptian word related to <font face="Scholar">ms</font> was used, meaning something like &#8220;child&#8221; or &#8220;born.&#8221; The name might have even been longer, perhaps having a theophoric element (divine name) with it &#8211; &#8220;child of [some god].&#8221; The name&#8217;s motivation came from the fact that she drew him from the Nile, the source of life in Egypt. But the sound of the name recalled for the Hebrews the verb &#8220;to draw out&#8221; in their own language. Translating the words of the princess into Hebrew allowed for the effective wordplay to capture the significance of the story in the sound of the name. The implication for the Israelites is something to this effect: &#8220;You called him &#8216;born one&#8217; in your language and after your custom, but in our language that name means &#8216;drawing out&#8217; &#8211; which is what was to become of him. You drew him out of the water, but he would draw us out of Egypt through the water.&#8221; So the circumstances of the story show Moses to be a man of destiny, and this naming episode summarizes how divine providence was at work in Israel. To the Israelites the name forever commemorated the portent of this event in the early life of the great deliverer (see Isa 63:11).</p>
<A NAME="236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=96><b>sn</b> Chapter 1 described how Israel was flourishing in spite of the bondage. Chapter 2 first told how God providentially provided the deliverer, but now when this deliverer attempted to deliver one of his people, it turned out badly, and he had to flee for his life. This section makes an interesting study in the presumption of the leader, what Christian expositors would rightly describe as trying to do God&#8217;s work by the flesh. The section has two parts to it: the flight from Egypt over the failed attempt to deliver (vv. 11-15), and Moses&#8217; introduction to life as the deliverer in Midian (vv. 16-22). </p>
<A NAME="237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=97><b>sn</b> The expression &#8220;those days&#8221; refers to the days of bondage.</p>
<A NAME="238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=98><b>tn</b> The preterite with the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive is here subordinated to the next and main idea of the verse. This is the second use of this verb in the chapter. In v. 10 the verb had the sense of &#8220;when he began to grow&#8221; or &#8220;when he got older,&#8221; but here it carries the nuance of &#8220;when he had grown up.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=99><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;brothers.&#8221; This term does not require them to be literal siblings, or even close family members. It simply refers to fellow Hebrews, people with whom Moses has begun to feel close ties of kinship. They are &#8220;brothers&#8221; in a broad sense, ultimately fellow members of the covenant community.</p>
<A NAME="240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=100><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">a</font>, &#8220;to see&#8221;) followed by the preposition <font face="Scholar">bet</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;</font>) can indicate looking on something as an overseer, or supervising, or investigating. Here the emphasis is on Moses&#8217; observing their labor with sympathy or grief. It means more than that he simply saw the way his fellow Hebrews were being treated (cf. 2:25).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This journey of Moses to see his people is an indication that he had become aware of his destiny to deliver them.

<A NAME="286"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">86</span><note=146><b>sn</b> Like the naming of Moses, this naming that incorporates a phonetic wordplay forms the commemorative summary of the account just provided. Moses seems to have settled into a domestic life with his new wife and his father-in-law. But when the first son is born, he named him <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gerÿshom</font>). There is little information available about what the name by itself might have meant. If it is linked to the verb &#8220;drive away&#8221; used earlier (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font>, <font face="Scholar">garash</font>), then the final <font face="Scholar">mem</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;</font>) would have to be explained as an enclitic <font face="Scholar">mem</font>. It seems most likely that that verb was used in the narrative to make a secondary wordplay on the name. The primary explanation is the popular etymology supplied by Moses himself. He links the name to the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gur</font>, &#8220;to sojourn, to live as an alien&#8221;). He then adds that he was a sojourner (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ger</font>, the participle) in a foreign land. The word &#8220;foreign&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1499;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nokhriyyah</font>) adds to the idea of his being a resident alien. The final syllable in the name would then be connected to the adverb &#8220;there&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">sham</font>). Thus, the name is given the significance in the story of &#8220;sojourner there&#8221; or &#8220;alien there.&#8221; He no doubt knew that this was not the actual meaning of the name; the name itself had already been introduced into the family of Levi (1 Chr 6:1, 16). He chose the name because its sounds reflected his sentiment at that time. But to what was Moses referring? In view of naming customs among the Semites, he was most likely referring to Midian as the foreign land. If Egypt had been the strange land, and he had now found his place, he would not have given the lad such a name. Personal names reflect the present or recent experiences, or the hope for the future. So this naming is a clear expression by Moses that he knows he is not where he is supposed to be. That this is what he meant is supported in the NT by Stephen (Acts 7:29). So the choice of the name, the explanation of it, and the wordplay before it, all serve to stress the point that Moses had been driven away from his proper place of service. </p>
<A NAME="287"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">87</span><note=147><b>sn</b> The next section of the book is often referred to as the &#8220;Call of Moses,&#8221; and that is certainly true. But it is much more than that. It is the divine preparation of the servant of God, a servant who already knew what his destiny was. In this section Moses is shown how his destiny will be accomplished. It will be accomplished because the divine presence will guarantee the power, and the promise of that presence comes with the important &#8220;I AM&#8221; revelation. The message that comes through in this, and other &#8220;I will be with you&#8221; passages, is that when the promise of God&#8217;s presence is correctly appropriated by faith, the servant of God can begin to build confidence for the task that lies ahead. It will no longer be, &#8220;Who am I that I should go?&#8221; but &#8220;I AM with you&#8221; that matters. The first little section, 2:23-25, serves as a transition and introduction, for it records the <sc>Lord&#8217;s response to Israel in her affliction. The second part is the revelation to Moses at the burning bush (3:1-10), which is one of the most significant theological sections in the Torah. Finally, the record of Moses&#8217; response to the call with his objections (3:11-22), makes up the third part, and in a way, is a transition to the next section, where God supplies proof of his power.</p>

A prayer to God that says, &#8220;Remember me,&#8221; is asking for more than mere recollection (see B. S. Childs, <i>Memory and Tradition in Israel</i> [SBT], 1-8). The structure of this section at the end of the chapter is powerful. There are four descriptions of the Israelites, with a fourfold reaction from God. On the Israelites&#8217; side, they groaned (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1495;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anakh</font>], <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">nÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aqah</font>]) and cried out (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1511;</font> [<font face="Scholar">za</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aq</font>], <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">shav</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>]) to God. On the divine side God heard (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1506;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shama</font>&#8217;) their groaning, remembered (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">zakhar</font>) his covenant, looked (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>) at the Israelites, and took notice (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yada</font>&#8217;) of them. These verbs emphasize God&#8217;s sympathy and compassion for the people. God is near to those in need; in fact, the deliverer had already been chosen. It is important to note at this point the repetition of the word &#8220;God.&#8221; The text is waiting to introduce the name &#8220;Yahweh&#8221; in a special way. Meanwhile, the fourfold repetition of &#8220;God&#8221; in vv. 24-25 is unusual and draws attention to the statements about his attention to Israel&#8217;s plight.</p>
<A NAME="294"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">94</span><note=154><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and God saw.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="295"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">95</span><note=155><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and God knew&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yada</font>&#8217;). The last clause contains a widely used verb for knowing, but it leaves the object unexpressed within the clause, so as to allow all that vv. 23-24 have described to serve as the compelling content of God&#8217;s knowing. (Many modern English versions supply an object for the verb following the LXX, which reads &#8220;knew <i>them</i>.&#8221;) The idea seems to be that God took personal knowledge of, noticed, or regarded them. In other passages the verb &#8220;know&#8221; is similar in meaning to &#8220;save&#8221; or &#8220;show pity.&#8221; See especially Gen 18:21, Ps 1:6; 31:7, and Amos 3:2. Exodus has already provided an example of the results of not knowing in 1:8 (cf. 5:2).</p>
