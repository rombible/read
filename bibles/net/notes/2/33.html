<A NAME="331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2166><b>tn</b> The two imperatives underscore the immediacy of the demand: &#8220;go, go up,&#8221; meaning &#8220;get going up&#8221; or &#8220;be on your way.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2167><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the land which I swore.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2168><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;seed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2169><b>sn</b> This seems not to be the same as the Angel of the Presence introduced before. </p>
<A NAME="335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2170><b>sn</b> See T. Ishida, &#8220;The Structure and Historical Implications of Lists of Pre-Israelite Nations,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> (1979): 461-90. </p>
<A NAME="336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2171><b>tn</b> This verse seems to be a continuation of the command to &#8220;go up&#8221; since it begins with &#8220;to a land&#8230;.&#8221; The intervening clauses are therefore parenthetical or relative. But the translation is made simpler by supplying the verb.</p>
<A NAME="337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2172><b>tn</b> This is a strong adversative here, &#8220;but.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="338"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2173><b>tn</b> The clause is &#8220;lest I consume you.&#8221; It would go with the decision not to accompany them: &#8220;I will not go up with you&#8230;lest I consume (destroy) you in the way.&#8221; The verse is saying that because of the people&#8217;s bent to rebellion, Yahweh would not remain in their midst as he had formerly said he would do. Their lives would be at risk if he did.</p>
<A NAME="339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2174><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;bad news&#8221; (NAB, NCV).</p>
<A NAME="3310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2175><b>sn</b> The people would rather have risked divine discipline than to go without Yahweh in their midst. So they mourned, and they took off the ornaments. Such had been used in making the golden calf, and so because of their association with all of that they were to be removed as a sign of remorse. </p>
<A NAME="3311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2176><b>tn</b> The verse simply begins &#8220;And Yahweh said.&#8221; But it is clearly meant to be explanatory for the preceding action of the people.</p>
<A NAME="3312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2177><b>tn</b> The construction is formed with a simple imperfect in the first half and a perfect tense with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) in the second half. <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[in] one moment I will go up in your midst and I will destroy you.&#8221; The verse is certainly not intended to say that God was about to destroy them. That, plus the fact that he has announced he will not go in their midst, leads most commentators to take this as a conditional clause: &#8220;If I were to do such and such, then&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2178><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text also has &#8220;from on you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2179><b>tn</b> The form is the cohortative with a <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) following the imperative; it therefore expresses the purpose or result: &#8220;strip off&#8230;that I may know.&#8221; The call to remove the ornaments must have been perceived as a call to show true repentance for what had happened. If they repented, then God would know how to deal with them.</p>
<A NAME="3315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2180><b>tn</b> This last clause begins with the interrogative &#8220;what,&#8221; but it is used here as an indirect interrogative. It introduces a noun clause, the object of the verb &#8220;know.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="3316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2181><b>sn</b> This unit of the book could actually include all of chap. 33, starting with the point of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s withdrawal from the people. If that section is not part of the exposition, it would have to be explained as the background. The point is that sinfulness prevents the active presence of the <sc>Lord leading his people. But then the rest of chap. 33 forms the development. In vv. 7-11 there is the gracious provision: the <sc>Lord reveals through his faithful mediator. The <sc>Lord was leading his people, but now more remotely because of their sin. Then, in vv. 12-17 Moses intercedes for the people, and the intercession of the mediator guarantees the <sc>Lord&#8217;s presence. The point of all of this is that God wanted the people to come to know that if he was not with them they should not go. Finally, the presence of the <sc>Lord is verified to the mediator by a special revelation (18-23). The point of the whole chapter is that by his grace the <sc>Lord renews the promise of his presence by special revelation.</p>
<A NAME="3317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2182><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Moses took.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2183><b>sn</b> A widespread contemporary view is that this section represents a source that thought the tent of meeting was already erected (see S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 359). But the better view is that this is a temporary tent used for meeting the <sc>Lord. U. Cassuto explains this view very well (<i>Exodus</i>, 429-30), namely, that because the building of the tabernacle was now in doubt if the <sc>Lord was not going to be in their midst, another plan seemed necessary. Moses took this tent, his tent, and put some distance between the camp and it. Here he would use the tent as the place to meet God, calling it by the same name since it was a surrogate tent. Thus, the entire section was a temporary means of meeting God, until the current wrath was past.</p>
<A NAME="3319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2184><b>tn</b> The infinitive absolute is used here as an adverb (see GKC 341 §113.<i>h</i>).</p>
<A NAME="3320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2185><b>tn</b> The clause begins with &#8220;and it was,&#8221; the perfect tense with the <i>vav </i>conjunction. The imperfect tenses in this section are customary, describing what used to happen (others describe the verbs as frequentative). See GKC 315 §107.<i>e</i>.</p>
<A NAME="3321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2186><b>tn</b> The form is the Piel participle. The seeking here would indicate seeking an oracle from Yahweh or seeking to find a resolution for some difficulty (as in 2 Sam 21:1) or even perhaps coming with a sacrifice. B. Jacob notes that the tent was even here a place of prayer, for the benefit of the people (<i>Exodus</i>, 961). It is not known how long this location was used. </p>
<A NAME="3322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2187><b>tn</b> The clause is introduced again with &#8220;and it was.&#8221; The perfect tense here with the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) is used to continue the sequence of actions that were done repeatedly in the past (see GKC 331-32 §112.<i>e</i>). The temporal clause is then formed with the infinitive construct of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatsa</font>&#8217;), with &#8220;Moses&#8221; as the subjective genitive: &#8220;and it was according to the going out of Moses.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2188><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;rise up.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2189><b>tn</b> The subject of this verb is specified with the individualizing use of &#8220;man&#8221;: &#8220;and all Israel would station themselves, each person (man) at the entrance to his tent.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2190><b>tn</b> The perfect tense with the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) continues the sequence of the customary imperfect. The people &#8220;would gaze&#8221; (after) Moses until he entered the tent.</p>
<A NAME="3326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2191><b>tn</b> This is a temporal clause using an infinitive construct with a suffixed subject.</p>
<A NAME="3327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2192><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and it was when.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2193><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he&#8221;; the referent (the <sc>Lord) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2194><b>tn</b> Both verbs, &#8220;stand&#8221; and &#8220;speak,&#8221; are perfect tenses with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive. </p>
<A NAME="3330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2195><b>tn</b> All the main verbs in this verse are perfect tenses continuing the customary sequence (see GKC 337 §112.<i>kk</i>). The idea is that the people would get up (rise) when the cloud was there and then worship, meaning in part bow down. When the cloud was not there, there was access to seek God. </p>
<A NAME="3331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2196><b>tn</b> &#8220;Face to face&#8221; is circumstantial to the action of the verb, explaining how they spoke (see GKC 489-90 §156.<i>c</i>). The point of this note of friendly relationship with Moses is that Moses was &#8220;at home&#8221; in this tent speaking with God. Moses would derive courage from this when he interceded for the people (B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 966).</p>
<A NAME="3332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2197><b>tn</b> The verb in this clause is a progressive imperfect.</p>
<A NAME="3333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2198><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Moses) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2199><b>sn</b> Moses did not live in the tent. But Joshua remained there most of the time to guard the tent, it seems, lest any of the people approach it out of curiosity.</p>
<A NAME="3335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2200><b>tn</b> The Hiphil imperative is from the same verb that has been used before for bringing the people up from Egypt and leading them to Canaan.</p>
<A NAME="3336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2201><b>tn</b> That is, &#8220;chosen you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2202><b>tn</b> The prayer uses the Hiphil imperative of the verb &#8220;to know.&#8221; &#8220;Cause me to know&#8221; is &#8220;show me, reveal to me, teach or inform me.&#8221; Moses wanted to know more of God&#8217;s dealings with people, especially after all that has happened in the preceding chapter.</p>
<A NAME="3338"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2203><b>tn</b> The imperfect tense of the verb &#8220;to know&#8221; with the <i>vav</i> follows the imperative of this root, and so this indicates the purpose clause (final imperfect): &#8220;in order that I may know you.&#8221; S. R. Driver summarizes it this way: that I may understand what your nature and character is, and shape my petitions accordingly, so that I may find grace in your sight, and my future prayers may be answered (<i>Exodus</i>, 361).</p>
<A NAME="3339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2204><b>tn</b> The purpose clause simply uses the imperfect, &#8220;that I may find.&#8221; But since he already has found favor in God&#8217;s eyes, he is clearly praying that it be so in the future as well as now.</p>
<A NAME="3340"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=2205><b>tn</b> The verb &#8220;see&#8221; (an imperative) is a request for God to acknowledge Israel as his people by providing the divine leadership needed. So his main appeal will be for the people and not himself. To underscore this, he repeats &#8220;see&#8221; the way the section opened. </p>
<A NAME="3341"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=2206><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he said&#8221;; the referent (the <sc>Lord) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3342"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=2207><b>sn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my face.&#8221; This represents the presence of Yahweh going with the people (see 2 Sam 17:11 for an illustration). The &#8220;presence&#8221; probably refers to the angel of the presence or some similar manifestation of God&#8217;s leading and caring for his people. </p>
<A NAME="3343"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2208><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;with you&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but is implied.</p>
<A NAME="3344"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=2209><b>sn</b> The expression certainly refers to the peace of mind and security of knowing that God was with them. But the expression came to mean &#8220;settle them in the land of promise&#8221; and give them rest and peace from their enemies. U. Cassuto (<i>Exodus</i>, 434) observes how in 32:10 God had told Moses, &#8220;Leave me alone&#8221; (&#8220;give me rest&#8221;), but now he promises to give them rest. The parallelism underscores the great transition through intercession. </p>
<A NAME="3345"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=2210><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he said&#8221;; the referent (<sc>Moses) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3346"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=2211><b>tn</b> The construction uses the active participle to stress the continual going of the presence: if there is not your face going. </p>
<A NAME="3347"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=2212><b>tn</b> &#8220;with us&#8221; has been supplied.</p>
<A NAME="3348"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=2213><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from this.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3349"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=2214><b>sn</b> See W. Brueggemann, &#8220;The Crisis and Promise of Presence in Israel,&#8221; <i>HBT</i> 1 (1979): 47-86; and N. M. Waldman, &#8220;God&#8217;s Ways &#8211; A Comparative Note,&#8221; <i>JQR</i> 70 (1979): 67-70. </p>
<A NAME="3350"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=2215><b>tn</b> The verb in this place is a preterite with the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive, judging from the pointing. It then follows in sequence the verb &#8220;you have found favor,&#8221; meaning you stand in that favor, and so it means &#8220;I have known you&#8221; and still do (equal to the present perfect). The emphasis, however, is on the results of the action, and so &#8220;I know you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3351"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=2216><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he said&#8221;; the referent (<sc>Moses) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3352"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=2217><b>sn</b> Moses now wanted to see the glory of Yahweh, more than what he had already seen and experienced. He wanted to see God in all his majesty. The LXX chose to translate this without a word for &#8220;glory&#8221; or &#8220;honor&#8221;; instead they used the pronoun <i>seautou</i>, &#8220;yourself&#8221; &#8211; show me the real You. God tells him that he cannot see it fully, but in part. It will be enough for Moses to disclose to him the reality of the divine presence as well as God&#8217;s moral nature. It would be impossible for Moses to comprehend all of the nature of God, for there is a boundary between God and man. But God would let him see his goodness, the sum of his nature, pass by in a flash. B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 972) says that the glory refers to God&#8217;s majesty, might, and glory, as manifested in nature, in his providence, his laws, and his judgments. He adds that this glory should and would be made visible to man &#8211; that was its purpose in the world. </p>
<A NAME="3353"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=2218><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he said&#8221;; the referent (the <sc>Lord) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3354"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=2219><b>sn</b> The word &#8220;goodness&#8221; refers to the divine appearance in summary fashion.</p>
<A NAME="3355"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=2220><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;make proclamation in the name of Yahweh&#8221; (here a perfect tense with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>] consecutive for future) means to declare, reveal, or otherwise make proclamation of who Yahweh is. The &#8220;name of Yahweh&#8221; (rendered &#8220;the name of the <sc>Lord&#8221; throughout) refers to his divine attributes revealed to his people, either in word or deed. What will be focused on first will be his grace and compassion.</p>
<A NAME="3356"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=2221><b>sn</b> God declares his mercy and grace in similar terms to his earlier self-revelation (&#8220;I am that I am&#8221;): &#8220;I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious.&#8221; In other words, the grace and mercy of God are bound up in his own will. Obviously, in this passage the recipients of that favor are the penitent Israelites who were forgiven through Moses&#8217; intercession. The two words are at the heart of God&#8217;s dealings with people. The first is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khanan</font>, &#8220;to be gracious, show favor&#8221;). It means to grant favor or grace to someone, grace meaning unmerited favor. All of God&#8217;s dealings are gracious, but especially in forgiving sins and granting salvation it is critical. Parallel to this is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rakham</font>), a word that means &#8220;show compassion, tender mercy.&#8221; It is a word that is related to the noun &#8220;womb,&#8221; the connection being in providing care and protection for that which is helpless and dependent &#8211; a motherly quality. In both of these constructions the verbs simply express what God will do, without explaining why. See further, J. R. Lundbom, &#8220;God&#8217;s Use of the <i>Idem per idem</i> to Terminate Debate,&#8221; <i>HTR</i> 71 (1978): 193-201; and J. Piper, &#8220;Prolegomena to Understanding Romans 9:14-15: An Interpretation of Exodus 33:19,&#8221; <i>JETS </i>22 (1979): 203-16. </p>
<A NAME="3357"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=2222><b>tn</b> In view of the use of the verb &#8220;can, be able to&#8221; in the first clause, this imperfect tense is given a potential nuance.</p>
<A NAME="3358"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=2223><b>tn</b> Gesenius notes that sometimes a negative statement takes the place of a conditional clause; here it is equal to &#8220;if a man sees me he does not live&#8221; (GKC 498 §159.<i>gg</i>). The other passages that teach this are Gen 32:30; Deut 4:33, 5:24, 26; Judg 6:22, 13:22, and Isa 6:5.</p>
<A NAME="3359"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=2224><b>tn</b> The deictic particle is used here simply to call attention to a place of God&#8217;s knowing and choosing.</p>
<A NAME="3360"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=2225><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and you will,&#8221; or interpretively, &#8220;where you will.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3361"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=2226><b>sn</b> Note the use in Exod 40:3, &#8220;and you will screen the ark with the curtain.&#8221; The glory is covered, veiled from being seen. </p>
<A NAME="3362"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=2227><b>tn</b> The circumstantial clause is simply, &#8220;my hand [being] over you.&#8221; This protecting hand of Yahweh represents a fairly common theme in the Bible.</p>
<A NAME="3363"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=2228><b>tn</b> The construction has a preposition with an infinitive construct and a suffix: &#8220;while [or until] I pass by&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the passing by of me&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="3364"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=2229><b>tn</b> The plural &#8220;my backs&#8221; is according to Gesenius an extension plural (compare &#8220;face,&#8221; a dual in Hebrew). The word denotes a locality in general, but that is composed of numerous parts (see GKC 397 §124.<i>b</i>). W. C. Kaiser says that since God is a spirit, the meaning of this word could just as easily be rendered &#8220;after effects&#8221; of his presence (&#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:484). As S. R. Driver says, though, while this may indicate just the &#8220;afterglow&#8221; that he leaves behind him, it was enough to suggest what the full brilliancy of his presence must be (<i>Exodus</i>, 363; see also Job 26:14).</p>
<A NAME="3365"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=2230><b>tn</b> The Niphal imperfect could simply be rendered &#8220;will not be seen,&#8221; but given the emphasis of the preceding verses, it is more binding than that, and so a negated obligatory imperfect fits better: &#8220;it must not be seen.&#8221; It would also be possible to render it with a potential imperfect tense: &#8220;it cannot be seen.&#8221;</p>
