<A NAME="2124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1441><b>tn</b> The translation of &#8220;food&#8221; does not quite do justice to the Hebrew word. It is &#8220;flesh.&#8221; The issue here is that the family she was to marry into is wealthy, they ate meat. She was not just to be given the basic food the ordinary people ate, but the fine foods that this family ate.</p>
