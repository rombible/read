<A NAME="2169"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=1486><b>sn</b> A shekel was a unit for measure by means of a scale. Both the weight and the value of a shekel of silver are hard to determine. &#8220;Though there is no certainty, the shekel is said to weigh about 11,5 grams&#8221; (C. Houtman, <i>Exodus</i>,<i> </i>3:181). Over four hundred years earlier, Joseph was sold into Egypt for 20 shekels. The free Israelite citizen was worth about 50 shekels (Lev 27:3f.). </p>
