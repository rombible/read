<A NAME="2138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1455><b>tn</b> The form is a Piel participle from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qalal</font>), meaning in Qal &#8220;be light,&#8221; in Piel &#8220;treat lightly, curse, revile, declare contemptible, treat shamefully.&#8221; (See its use in Lev 19:14; Josh 24:9; Judg 9:26-28; 1 Sam 3:13; 17:43; 2 Sam 16:5-13; Prov 30:10-11; Eccl 7:21-22; 10:20.) It is opposite of &#8220;honor&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1461;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kaved</font>; Qal &#8220;be heavy&#8221;; Piel &#8220;honor,&#8221; as in 20:12) and of &#8220;bless.&#8221; This verse then could refer to any act contrary to the commandment to honor the parents. B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 640) cites parallels in Sumerian where people were severely punished for publicly disowning their parents. &#8220;21:15, 17 taken together evoke the picture of parents who, physically and verbally, are forcibly turned out of the house (cf. Prov. 19:26)&#8221; (C. Houtman, <i>Exodus</i>,<i> </i>3:148).</p>
