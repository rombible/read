<A NAME="2116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1433><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amah</font>) refers to a female servant who would eventually become a concubine or wife; the sale price included the amount for the service as well as the bride price (see B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 621). The arrangement recognized her honor as an Israelite woman, one who could be a wife, even though she entered the household in service. The marriage was not automatic, as the conditions show, but her treatment was safeguarded come what may. The law was a way, then, for a poor man to provide a better life for a daughter. </p>
