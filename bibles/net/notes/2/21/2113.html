<A NAME="2113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1430><b>tn</b> The word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohim</font>). S. R. Driver (<i>Exodus</i>, 211) says the phrase means &#8220;to God,&#8221; namely the nearest sanctuary in order that the oath and the ritual might be made solemn, although he does say that it would be done by human judges. That the reference is to Yahweh God is the view also of F. C. Fensham, &#8220;New Light on Exodus 21:7 and 22:7 from the Laws of Eshnunna,&#8221; <i>JBL </i>78 (1959): 160-61. Cf. also ASV, NAB, NASB, NCV, NRSV, NLT. Others have made a stronger case that it refers to judges who acted on behalf of God; see C. Gordon, &#8220;<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;</font> in its Reputed Meaning of Rulers, Judges,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 54 (1935): 134-44; and A. E. Draffkorn, &#8220;Ilani/Elohim,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 76 (1957): 216-24; cf. KJV, NIV. </p>
