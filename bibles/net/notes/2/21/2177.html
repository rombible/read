<A NAME="2177"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=1494><b>sn</b> The point of this section (21:28-36) seems to be that one must ensure the safety of others by controlling one&#8217;s property and possessions. This section pertained to neglect with animals, but the message would have applied to similar situations. The people of God were to take heed to ensure the well-being of others, and if there was a problem, it had to be made right. </p>
