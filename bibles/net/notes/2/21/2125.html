<A NAME="2125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1442><b>sn</b> See S. Paul, &#8220;Exodus 21:10, A Threefold Maintenance Clause,&#8221; <i>JNES</i> 28 (1969): 48-53. Paul suggests that the third element listed is not marital rights but ointments since Sumerian and Akkadian texts list food, clothing, and oil as the necessities of life. The translation of &#8220;marital rights&#8221; is far from certain, since the word occurs only here. The point is that the woman was to be cared for with all that was required for a woman in that situation. </p>
