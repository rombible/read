<A NAME="2151"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1468><b>tn</b> This line has occasioned a good deal of discussion. It may indicate that the child was killed, as in a miscarriage; or it may mean that there was a premature birth. The latter view is taken here because of the way the whole section is written: (1) &#8220;her children come out&#8221; reflects a birth and not the loss of children, (2) there is no serious damage, and (3) payment is to be set for any remuneration. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1505;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ason</font>) is translated &#8220;serious damage.&#8221; The word was taken in <i>Mekilta</i> to mean &#8220;death.&#8221; U. Cassuto says the point of the phrase is that neither the woman or the children that are born die (<i>Exodus</i>, 275). But see among the literature on this: M. G. Kline, &#8220;<i>Lex Talionis </i>and the Human Fetus,&#8221; <i>JETS</i> 20 (1977): 193-201; W. House, &#8220;Miscarriage or Premature Birth: Additional Thoughts on Exodus 21:22-25,&#8221; <i>WTJ</i> 41 (1978): 108-23; S. E. Loewenstamm, &#8220;Exodus XXI 22-25,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 27 (1977): 352-60.</p>
