<A NAME="2133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1450><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ormah</font>) is problematic. It could mean with prior intent, which would be connected with the word in Prov 8:5, 12 which means &#8220;understanding&#8221; (or &#8220;prudence&#8221; &#8211; fully aware of the way things are). It could be connected also to an Arabic word for &#8220;enemy&#8221; which would indicate this was done with malice or evil intentions (U. Cassuto, <i>Exodus</i>, 270). The use here seems parallel to the one in Josh 9:4, an instance involving intentionality and clever deception.</p>
