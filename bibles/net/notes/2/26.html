<A NAME="261"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1747><b>sn</b> This chapter is given over to the details of the structure itself, the curtains, coverings, boards and walls and veil. The passage can be studied on one level for its function both practically and symbolically for Israel&#8217;s worship. On another level it can be studied for its typology, for the tabernacle and many of its parts speak of Christ. For this one should see the commentaries. </p>
<A NAME="262"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1748><b>tn</b> The word order in Hebrew thrusts the direct object to the front for particular emphasis. After the first couple of pieces of furniture are treated (chap. 25), attention turns to the tabernacle itself.</p>
<A NAME="263"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1749><b>tn</b> This is for the adverbial accusative explaining how the dwelling place is to be made.</p>
<A NAME="264"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1750><b>sn</b> S. R. Driver suggests that the curtains were made with threads dyed with these colors (<i>Exodus</i>, 280). Perhaps the colored threads were used for embroidering the cherubim in the curtains. </p>
<A NAME="265"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1751><b>tn</b> The construction is difficult in this line because of the word order. &#8220;Cherubim&#8221; is an adverbial accusative explaining how they were to make the curtains. And <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1461;&#1492; &#1495;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ma</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aseh khoshev</font>) means literally &#8220;work of a designer&#8221;; it is in apposition to &#8220;cherubim.&#8221; The Hebrew participle means &#8220;designer&#8221; or &#8220;deviser&#8221; so that one could render this &#8220;of artistic designs in weaving&#8221; (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>,<i> </i>280-81). B. Jacob says that it refers to &#8220;artistic weavers&#8221; (<i>Exodus</i>, 789).</p>
<A NAME="266"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1752><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;one&#8221; (so KJV).</p>
<A NAME="267"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1753><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;twenty-eight cubits&#8221; long and &#8220;four cubits&#8221; wide. </p>
<A NAME="268"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1754><b>tn</b> This is the active participle, not the passive. It would normally be rendered &#8220;joining together.&#8221; The Bible uses the active because it has the result of the sewing in mind, namely, that every curtain accompanies another (U. Cassuto, <i>Exodus</i>, 348).</p>
<A NAME="269"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1755><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a woman to her sister,&#8221; this form of using nouns to express &#8220;one to another&#8221; is selected because &#8220;curtains&#8221; is a feminine noun (see GKC 448 §139.<i>e</i>).</p>
<A NAME="2610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1756><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;the other&#8221; has been supplied.</p>
<A NAME="2611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1757><b>tn</b> Here &#8220;loops&#8221; has been supplied.</p>
<A NAME="2612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1758><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a woman to her sister.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1759><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;one&#8221;; KJV &#8220;it shall be one tabernacle&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;that the tabernacle may be one whole&#8221;; NLT &#8220;a single unit.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1760><b>sn</b> This chapter will show that there were two sets of curtains and two sets of coverings that went over the wood building to make the tabernacle or dwelling place. The curtains of fine linen described above could be seen only by the priests from inside. Above that was the curtain of goats&#8217; hair. Then over that were the coverings, an inner covering of rams&#8217; skins dyed red and an outer covering of hides of fine leather. The movement is from the inside to the outside because it is God&#8217;s dwelling place; the approach of the worshiper would be the opposite. The pure linen represented the righteousness of God, guarded by the embroidered cherubim; the curtain of goats&#8217; hair was a reminder of sin through the daily sin offering of a goat; the covering of rams&#8217; skins dyed red was a reminder of the sacrifice and the priestly ministry set apart by blood, and the outer covering marked the separation between God and the world. These are the interpretations set forth by Kaiser; others vary, but not greatly (see W. C. Kaiser, Jr., &#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:459). </p>
<A NAME="2615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1761><b>sn</b> This curtain will serve &#8220;for a tent over the tabernacle,&#8221; as a dwelling place. </p>
<A NAME="2616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1762><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you will make them&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1763><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;one&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1764><b>sn</b> The text seems to describe this part as being in front of the tabernacle, hanging down to form a valence at the entrance (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 284).</p>
<A NAME="2619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1765><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;one&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1766><b>sn</b> U. Cassuto (<i>Exodus</i>, 353) cites <i>b. Shabbat</i> 98b which says, &#8220;What did the tabernacle resemble? A woman walking on the street with her train trailing behind her.&#8221; In the expression &#8220;the half of the curtain that remains,&#8221; the verb agrees in gender with the genitive near it. </p>
<A NAME="2621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1767><b>tn</b> Literally &#8220;cubit.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1768><b>sn</b> U. Cassuto states the following: &#8220;To the north and to the south, since the tent curtains were thirty cubits long, there were ten cubits left over on each side; these covered the nine cubits of the curtains of the tabernacle and also the bottom cubit of the boards, which the tabernacle curtains did not suffice to cover. It is to this that v. 13 refers&#8221; (<i>Exodus</i>, 353). </p>
<A NAME="2623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1769><b>sn</b> Two outer coverings made of stronger materials will be put over the tent and the curtain, the two inner layers. </p>
<A NAME="2624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1770><b>tn</b> See the note on this phrase in Exod 25:5.</p>
<A NAME="2625"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1771><b>tn</b> There is debate whether the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">haqqÿrashim</font>) means &#8220;boards&#8221; (KJV, ASV, NAB, NASB) or &#8220;frames&#8221; (NIV, NCV, NRSV, TEV) or &#8220;planks&#8221; (see Ezek 27:6) or &#8220;beams,&#8221; given the size of them. The literature on this includes M. Haran, &#8220;The Priestly Image of the Tabernacle,&#8221; <i>HUCA</i> 36 (1965): 192; B. A. Levine, &#8220;The Description of the Tabernacle Texts of the Pentateuch,&#8221; <i>JAOS</i> 85 (1965): 307-18; J. Morgenstern, &#8220;The Ark, the Ephod, and the Tent,&#8221; <i>HUCA</i> 17 (1942/43): 153-265; 18 (1943/44): 1-52. </p>
<A NAME="2626"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1772><b>tn</b> &#8220;Wood&#8221; is an adverbial accusative.</p>
<A NAME="2627"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1773><b>tn</b> The plural participle &#8220;standing&#8221; refers to how these items will be situated; they will be vertical rather than horizontal (U. Cassuto, <i>Exodus</i>,<i> </i>354). </p>
<A NAME="2628"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1774><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the frame.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2629"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1775><b>sn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;hands,&#8221; the reference is probably to projections that served as stays or supports. They may have been tenons, or pegs, projecting from the bottom of the frames to hold the frames in their sockets (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 286). </p>
<A NAME="2630"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1776><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;being joined each to the other.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2631"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1777><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;on the south side southward.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2632"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1778><b>tn</b> The clause is repeated to show the distributive sense; it literally says, &#8220;and two bases under the one frame for its two projections.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2633"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1779><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;westward&#8221; (toward the sea).</p>
<A NAME="2634"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1780><b>sn</b> The term rendered &#8220;corners&#8221; is &#8220;an architectural term for some kind of special corner structure. Here it seems to involve two extra supports, one at each corner of the western wall&#8221; (N. M. Sarna, <i>Exodus </i>[JPSTC], 170).</p>
<A NAME="2635"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1781><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they will be for the two corners.&#8221; This is the last clause of the verse, moved forward for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2636"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1782><b>sn</b> These bars served as reinforcements to hold the upright frames together. The Hebrew term for these bars is also used of crossbars on gates (Judg 16:3; Neh 3:3). </p>
<A NAME="2637"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1783><b>tn</b> The noun is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mishpat</font>), often translated &#8220;judgment&#8221; or &#8220;decision&#8221; in other contexts. In those settings it may reflect its basic idea of custom, which here would be reflected with a rendering of &#8220;prescribed norm&#8221; or &#8220;plan.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2638"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1784><b>tn</b> Although translated &#8220;curtain&#8221; (traditionally &#8220;veil,&#8221; so ASV, NAB, NASB) this is a different word from the one used earlier of the tent curtains, so &#8220;special curtain&#8221; is used. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1464;&#1512;&#1465;&#1499;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">farokhet</font>) seems to be connected with a verb that means &#8220;to shut off&#8221; and was used with a shrine. This curtain would form a barrier in the approach to God (see S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 289).</p>
<A NAME="2639"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1785><b>tn</b> The verb is the third masculine singular form, but no subject is expressed. It could be translated &#8220;one will make&#8221; or as a passive. The verb means &#8220;to make,&#8221; but probably has the sense of embroidering both here and in v. 1.</p>
<A NAME="2640"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1786><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;put it.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2641"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1787><b>tn</b> This clause simply says &#8220;and their hooks gold,&#8221; but is taken as a circumstantial clause telling how the veil will be hung. </p>
<A NAME="2642"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1788><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;on four silver bases.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2643"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1789><b>tn</b> The traditional expression is &#8220;within the veil,&#8221; literally &#8220;into the house (or area) of the (special) curtain.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2644"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1790><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the Holy of Holies.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2645"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1791><b>sn</b> This was another curtain, serving as a screen in the entrance way. Since it was far away from the special curtain screening the Most Holy Place, it was less elaborate. It was not the work of the master designer, but of the &#8220;embroiderer,&#8221; and it did not have the cherubim on it. </p>
<A NAME="2646"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1792><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1465;&#1511;&#1461;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">roqem</font>) refers to someone who made cloth with colors. It is not certain, however, whether the colors were woven into the fabric on the loom or applied with a needle; so &#8220;embroiderer&#8221; should be understood as an approximation (cf. <i>HALOT</i> 1290-91 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1511;&#1501;</font>).</p>
<A NAME="2647"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1793><b>tn</b> &#8220;will be&#8221; has been supplied.</p>
<A NAME="2648"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1794><b>sn</b> In all the details of this chapter the expositor should pay attention to the overall message rather than engage in speculation concerning the symbolism of the details. It is, after all, the divine instruction for the preparation of the dwelling place for Yahweh. The point could be said this way: The dwelling place of Yahweh must be prepared in accordance with, and by the power of, his divine word. If God was to fellowship with his people, then the center of worship had to be made to his specifications, which were in harmony with his nature. Everything was functional for the approach to God through the ritual by divine provisions. But everything also reflected the nature of God, the symmetry, the order, the pure wood, the gold overlay, or (closer to God) the solid gold. And the symbolism of the light, the table, the veil, the cherubim &#8211; all of it was revelatory. All of it reflected the reality in heaven. Churches today do not retain the pattern and furnishings of the old tabernacle. However, they would do well to learn what God was requiring of Israel, so that their structures are planned in accordance with the theology of worship and the theology of access to God. Function is a big part, but symbolism and revelation instruct the planning of everything to be used. Christians live in the light of the fulfillment of Christ, and so they know the realities that the old foreshadowed. While a building is not necessary for worship (just as Israel worshiped in places other than the sanctuary), it is practical, and if there is going to be one, then the most should be made of it in the teaching and worshiping of the assembly. This chapter, then, provides an inspiration for believers on preparing a functional, symbolical, ordered place of worship that is in harmony with the word of God. And there is much to be said for making it as beautiful and uplifting as is possible &#8211; as a gift of freewill offering to God. Of course, the most important part of preparing a place of worship is the preparing of the heart. Worship, to be acceptable to God, must be in Christ. He said that when the temple was destroyed he would raise it up in three days. While he referred to his own body, he also alluded to the temple by the figure. When they put Jesus to death, they were destroying the temple; at his resurrection he would indeed begin a new form of worship. He is the tent, the curtain, the atonement, that the sanctuary foreshadowed. And then, believers also (when they receive Christ) become the temple of the Lord. So the NT will take the imagery and teaching of this chapter in a number of useful ways that call for more study. This does not, however, involve allegorization of the individual tabernacle parts. </p>
