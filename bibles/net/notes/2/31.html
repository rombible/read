<A NAME="311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2065><b>sn</b> The next unit describes the preparation of skilled workers to build all that has been listed now for several chapters. This chapter would have been the bridge to the building of the sanctuary (35-39) if it were not for the idolatrous interlude. God called individuals and prepared them by his Spirit to be skilled to do the work for the tabernacle. If this were the substance of an exposition, it would clearly be a message on gifted people doing the work &#8211; close to the spiritual lesson of Ephesians 4. There would be two levels of meaning: the physical, which looks at the skilled artisans providing for a place to worship Yahweh, and the spiritual, which would bring in the Spirit-filled servants of God participating in building up his kingdom.</p>
<A NAME="312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2066><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2067><b>tn</b> Heb &#8220;called by name.&#8221; This expression means that the person was specifically chosen for some important task (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 342). See the expression with Cyrus in Isa 45:3-4. </p>
<A NAME="314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2068><b>sn</b> The expression in the Bible means that the individual was given special, supernatural enablement to do what God wanted done. It usually is said of someone with exceptional power or ability. The image of &#8220;filling&#8221; usually means under the control of the Spirit, so that the Spirit is the dominant force in the life. </p>
<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2069><b>sn</b> The following qualities are the ways in which the Spirit&#8217;s enablement will be displayed. &#8220;Skill&#8221; is the ability to produce something valuable to God and the community, &#8220;understanding&#8221; is the ability to distinguish between things, to perceive the best way to follow, and &#8220;knowledge&#8221; is the experiential awareness of how things are done. </p>
<A NAME="316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2070><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and in all work&#8221;; &#8220;all&#8221; means &#8220;all kinds of&#8221; here.</p>
<A NAME="317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2071><b>tn</b> The expression is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1489; &#1502;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lakhshov makhashavot</font>, &#8220;to devise devices&#8221;). The infinitive emphasizes that Bezalel will be able to design or plan works that are artistic or skillful. He will think thoughts or devise the plans, and then he will execute them in silver or stone or whatever other material he uses.</p>
<A NAME="318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2072><b>tn</b> The expression uses the independent personal pronoun (&#8220;and I&#8221;) with the deictic particle (&#8220;behold&#8221;) to enforce the subject of the verb &#8211; &#8220;and I, indeed I have given.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2073><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and in the heart of all that are wise-hearted I have put wisdom.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The verse means that there were a good number of very skilled and trained artisans that could come to do the work that God wanted done. But God&#8217;s Spirit further endowed them with additional wisdom and skill for the work that had to be done. </p>
<A NAME="3110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2074><b>tn</b> The form is a perfect with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive. The form at this place shows the purpose or the result of what has gone before, and so it is rendered &#8220;that they may make.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="3111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2075><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all the vessels of the tent.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2076><b>sn</b> There are some questions about the arrangement of the book. The placement of this section here, however, should come as no surprise. After the instructions and preparation for work, a Sabbath day when work could not be done had to be legislated. In all that they were going to do, they must not violate the Sabbath,</p>
<A NAME="3113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2077><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Yahweh said (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">amar</font>) to Moses, saying.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2078><b>sn</b> The instruction for the Sabbath at this point seems rather abrupt, but it follows logically the extended plans of building the sanctuary. B. Jacob, following some of the earlier treatments, suggests that these are specific rules given for the duration of the building of the sanctuary (<i>Exodus</i>, 844). The Sabbath day is a day of complete cessation; no labor or work could be done. The point here is that God&#8217;s covenant people must faithfully keep the sign of the covenant as a living commemoration of the finished work of Yahweh, and as an active part in their sanctification. See also H. Routtenberg, &#8220;The Laws of Sabbath: Biblical Sources,&#8221; <i>Dor le Dor</i> 6 (1977): 41-43, 99-101, 153-55, 204-6; G. Robinson, &#8220;The Idea of Rest in the OT and the Search for the Basic Character of Sabbath,&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 92 (1980): 32-42; M. Tsevat, &#8220;The Basic Meaning of the Biblical Sabbath, <i>ZAW</i> 84 (1972): 447-59; M. T. Willshaw, &#8220;A Joyous Sign,&#8221; <i>ExpTim</i> 89 (1978): 179-80. </p>
<A NAME="3115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2079><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;your sanctifier.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2080><b>tn</b> This clause is all from one word, a Piel plural participle with a third, feminine suffix: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1500;&#1462;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿkhalleha</font>, &#8220;defilers of it&#8221;). This form serves as the subject of the sentence. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khalal</font>) is the antonym of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qadash</font>, &#8220;to be holy&#8221;). It means &#8220;common, profane,&#8221; and in the Piel stem &#8220;make common, profane&#8221; or &#8220;defile.&#8221; Treating the Sabbath like an ordinary day would profane it, make it common. </p>
<A NAME="3117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2081><b>tn</b> This is the asseverative use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) meaning &#8220;surely, indeed,&#8221; for it restates the point just made (see R. J. Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 73, §449).</p>
<A NAME="3118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2082><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the one who does.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2083><b>tn</b> &#8220;any&#8221; has been supplied.</p>
<A NAME="3120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2084><b>tn</b> Literally &#8220;her&#8221; (a feminine pronoun agreeing with &#8220;soul/life,&#8221; which is grammatically feminine).</p>
<A NAME="3121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2085><b>tn</b> This is an adverbial accusative of time, indicating that work may be done for six days out of the week.</p>
<A NAME="3122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2086><b>tn</b> The form is a Niphal imperfect; it has the nuance of permission in this sentence, for the sentence is simply saying that the six days are work days &#8211; that is when work may be done.</p>
<A NAME="3123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2087><b>tn</b> The expression is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1514; &#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shabbat shabbaton</font>), &#8220;a Sabbath of entire rest,&#8221; or better, &#8220;a sabbath of complete desisting&#8221; (U. Cassuto, <i>Exodus</i>, 404). The second noun, the modifying genitive, is an abstract noun. The repetition provides the superlative idea that complete rest is the order of the day.</p>
<A NAME="3124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2088><b>tn</b> The expression again forms an adverbial accusative of time.</p>
<A NAME="3125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2089><b>sn</b> The word &#8220;rest&#8221; essentially means &#8220;to cease, stop.&#8221; So describing God as &#8220;resting&#8221; on the seventh day does not indicate that he was tired &#8211; he simply finished creation and then ceased or stopped. But in this verse is a very bold anthropomorphism in the form of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyinnafash</font>), a Niphal preterite from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nafash</font>), the word that is related to &#8220;life, soul&#8221; or more specifically &#8220;breath, throat.&#8221; The verb is usually translated here as &#8220;he was refreshed,&#8221; offering a very human picture. It could also be rendered &#8220;he took breath&#8221; (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 345). Elsewhere the verb is used of people and animals. The anthropomorphism is clearly intended to teach people to stop and refresh themselves physically, spiritually, and emotionally on this day of rest. </p>
<A NAME="3126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2090><b>sn</b> The expression &#8220;the finger of God&#8221; has come up before in the book, in the plagues (Exod 8:15) to express that it was a demonstration of the power and authority of God. So here too the commandments given to Moses on stone tablets came from God. It too is a bold anthropomorphism; to attribute such a material action to Yahweh would have been thought provoking to say the least. But by using &#8220;God&#8221; and by stating it in an obviously figurative way, balance is maintained. Since no one writes with one finger, the expression simply says that the Law came directly from God.</p>
