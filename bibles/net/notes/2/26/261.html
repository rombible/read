<A NAME="261"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1747><b>sn</b> This chapter is given over to the details of the structure itself, the curtains, coverings, boards and walls and veil. The passage can be studied on one level for its function both practically and symbolically for Israel&#8217;s worship. On another level it can be studied for its typology, for the tabernacle and many of its parts speak of Christ. For this one should see the commentaries. </p>
