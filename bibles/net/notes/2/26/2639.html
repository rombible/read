<A NAME="2639"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1785><b>tn</b> The verb is the third masculine singular form, but no subject is expressed. It could be translated &#8220;one will make&#8221; or as a passive. The verb means &#8220;to make,&#8221; but probably has the sense of embroidering both here and in v. 1.</p>
