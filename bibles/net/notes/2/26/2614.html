<A NAME="2614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1760><b>sn</b> This chapter will show that there were two sets of curtains and two sets of coverings that went over the wood building to make the tabernacle or dwelling place. The curtains of fine linen described above could be seen only by the priests from inside. Above that was the curtain of goats&#8217; hair. Then over that were the coverings, an inner covering of rams&#8217; skins dyed red and an outer covering of hides of fine leather. The movement is from the inside to the outside because it is God&#8217;s dwelling place; the approach of the worshiper would be the opposite. The pure linen represented the righteousness of God, guarded by the embroidered cherubim; the curtain of goats&#8217; hair was a reminder of sin through the daily sin offering of a goat; the covering of rams&#8217; skins dyed red was a reminder of the sacrifice and the priestly ministry set apart by blood, and the outer covering marked the separation between God and the world. These are the interpretations set forth by Kaiser; others vary, but not greatly (see W. C. Kaiser, Jr., &#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:459). </p>
