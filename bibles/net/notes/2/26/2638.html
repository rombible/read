<A NAME="2638"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1784><b>tn</b> Although translated &#8220;curtain&#8221; (traditionally &#8220;veil,&#8221; so ASV, NAB, NASB) this is a different word from the one used earlier of the tent curtains, so &#8220;special curtain&#8221; is used. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1464;&#1512;&#1465;&#1499;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">farokhet</font>) seems to be connected with a verb that means &#8220;to shut off&#8221; and was used with a shrine. This curtain would form a barrier in the approach to God (see S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 289).</p>
