<A NAME="240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=100><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">a</font>, &#8220;to see&#8221;) followed by the preposition <font face="Scholar">bet</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;</font>) can indicate looking on something as an overseer, or supervising, or investigating. Here the emphasis is on Moses&#8217; observing their labor with sympathy or grief. It means more than that he simply saw the way his fellow Hebrews were being treated (cf. 2:25).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This journey of Moses to see his people is an indication that he had become aware of his destiny to deliver them. This verse says that he looked on their oppression; the next section will say that the <sc>Lord looked on it.</p>
