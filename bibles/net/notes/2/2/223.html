<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=83><b>tn</b> The verb could be given a more colloquial translation such as &#8220;she felt sorry for him.&#8221; But the verb is stronger than that; it means &#8220;to have compassion, to pity, to spare.&#8221; What she felt for the baby was strong enough to prompt her to spare the child from the fate decreed for Hebrew boys. Here is part of the irony of the passage: What was perceived by many to be a womanly weakness &#8211; compassion for a baby &#8211; is a strong enough emotion to prompt the woman to defy the orders of Pharaoh. The ruler had thought sparing women was safe, but the midwives, the Hebrew mother, the daughter of Pharaoh, and Miriam, all work together to spare one child &#8211; Moses (cf. 1 Cor 1:27-29). </p>
