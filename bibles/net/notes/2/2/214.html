<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=74><b>sn</b> It is impossible, perhaps, to identify with certainty who this person was. For those who have taken a view that Rameses was the pharaoh, there were numerous daughters for Rameses. She is named Tharmuth in <i>Jub</i>. 47:5; Josephus spells it Thermouthis (<i>Ant.</i> 2.9.5 [2.224]), but Eusebius has Merris (<i>Praep. Ev.</i> ix. 27). E. H. Merrill (<i>Kingdom of Priests</i>, 60) makes a reasonable case for her identification as the famous Hatshepsut, daughter of Thutmose I. She would have been there about the time of Moses&#8217; birth, and the general picture of her from history shows her to be the kind of princess with enough courage to countermand a decree of her father. </p>
