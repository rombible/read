<A NAME="295"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">95</span><note=155><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and God knew&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yada</font>&#8217;). The last clause contains a widely used verb for knowing, but it leaves the object unexpressed within the clause, so as to allow all that vv. 23-24 have described to serve as the compelling content of God&#8217;s knowing. (Many modern English versions supply an object for the verb following the LXX, which reads &#8220;knew <i>them</i>.&#8221;) The idea seems to be that God took personal knowledge of, noticed, or regarded them. In other passages the verb &#8220;know&#8221; is similar in meaning to &#8220;save&#8221; or &#8220;show pity.&#8221; See especially Gen 18:21, Ps 1:6; 31:7, and Amos 3:2. Exodus has already provided an example of the results of not knowing in 1:8 (cf. 5:2).</p>
