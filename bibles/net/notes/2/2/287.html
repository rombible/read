<A NAME="287"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">87</span><note=147><b>sn</b> The next section of the book is often referred to as the &#8220;Call of Moses,&#8221; and that is certainly true. But it is much more than that. It is the divine preparation of the servant of God, a servant who already knew what his destiny was. In this section Moses is shown how his destiny will be accomplished. It will be accomplished because the divine presence will guarantee the power, and the promise of that presence comes with the important &#8220;I AM&#8221; revelation. The message that comes through in this, and other &#8220;I will be with you&#8221; passages, is that when the promise of God&#8217;s presence is correctly appropriated by faith, the servant of God can begin to build confidence for the task that lies ahead. It will no longer be, &#8220;Who am I that I should go?&#8221; but &#8220;I AM with you&#8221; that matters. The first little section, 2:23-25, serves as a transition and introduction, for it records the <sc>Lord&#8217;s response to Israel in her affliction. The second part is the revelation to Moses at the burning bush (3:1-10), which is one of the most significant theological sections in the Torah. Finally, the record of Moses&#8217; response to the call with his objections (3:11-22), makes up the third part, and in a way, is a transition to the next section, where God supplies proof of his power.</p>
