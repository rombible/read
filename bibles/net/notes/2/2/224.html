<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=84><b>sn</b> The text uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qara</font>&#8217;), meaning &#8220;to call&#8221; or &#8220;summon.&#8221; Pharaoh himself will &#8220;summon&#8221; Moses many times in the plague narratives. Here the word is used for the daughter summoning the child&#8217;s mother to take care of him. The narratives in the first part of the book of Exodus include a good deal of foreshadowing of events that occur in later sections of the book (see M. Fishbane, <i>Biblical Text and Texture</i>).</p>
