<A NAME="236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=96><b>sn</b> Chapter 1 described how Israel was flourishing in spite of the bondage. Chapter 2 first told how God providentially provided the deliverer, but now when this deliverer attempted to deliver one of his people, it turned out badly, and he had to flee for his life. This section makes an interesting study in the presumption of the leader, what Christian expositors would rightly describe as trying to do God&#8217;s work by the flesh. The section has two parts to it: the flight from Egypt over the failed attempt to deliver (vv. 11-15), and Moses&#8217; introduction to life as the deliverer in Midian (vv. 16-22). </p>
