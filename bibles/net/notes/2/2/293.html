<A NAME="293"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">93</span><note=153><b>sn</b> The two verbs &#8220;heard&#8221; and &#8220;remembered,&#8221; both preterites, say far more than they seem to say. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shama</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to hear&#8221;) ordinarily includes responding to what is heard. It can even be found in idiomatic constructions meaning &#8220;to obey.&#8221; To say God heard their complaint means that God responded to it. Likewise, the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zakhar</font>, &#8220;to remember&#8221;) means to begin to act on the basis of what is remembered. A prayer to God that says, &#8220;Remember me,&#8221; is asking for more than mere recollection (see B. S. Childs, <i>Memory and Tradition in Israel</i> [SBT], 1-8). The structure of this section at the end of the chapter is powerful. There are four descriptions of the Israelites, with a fourfold reaction from God. On the Israelites&#8217; side, they groaned (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1495;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anakh</font>], <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">nÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aqah</font>]) and cried out (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1511;</font> [<font face="Scholar">za</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aq</font>], <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">shav</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>]) to God. On the divine side God heard (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1506;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shama</font>&#8217;) their groaning, remembered (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">zakhar</font>) his covenant, looked (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>) at the Israelites, and took notice (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yada</font>&#8217;) of them. These verbs emphasize God&#8217;s sympathy and compassion for the people. God is near to those in need; in fact, the deliverer had already been chosen. It is important to note at this point the repetition of the word &#8220;God.&#8221; The text is waiting to introduce the name &#8220;Yahweh&#8221; in a special way. Meanwhile, the fourfold repetition of &#8220;God&#8221; in vv. 24-25 is unusual and draws attention to the statements about his attention to Israel&#8217;s plight.</p>
