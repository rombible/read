<A NAME="245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=105><b>sn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyakh</font>) is from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhah</font>, &#8220;to smite, attack&#8221;) which is used in v. 11. This new attack is fatal. The repetition of the verb, especially in Exodus, anticipates the idea of &#8220;eye for eye, tooth for tooth.&#8221; The problem is, however, that Moses was not authorized to take this matter into his own hands in this way. The question the next day was appropriate: &#8220;Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?&#8221; The answer? No one &#8211; yet.</p>
