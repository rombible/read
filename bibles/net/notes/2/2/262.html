<A NAME="262"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=122><b>sn</b> The location of Midyan or Midian is uncertain, but it had to have been beyond the Egyptian borders on the east, either in the Sinai or beyond in the Arabah (south of the Dead Sea) or even on the east side of the Gulf of Aqaba. The Midianites seem to have traveled extensively in the desert regions. R. A. Cole (<i>Exodus</i> [TOTC], 60) reasons that since they later were enemies of Israel, it is unlikely that these traditions would have been made up about Israel&#8217;s great lawgiver; further, he explains that &#8220;Ishmaelite&#8221; and &#8220;Kenite&#8221; might have been clan names within the region of Midian. But see, from a different point of view, G. W. Coats, &#8220;Moses and Midian,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 92 (1973): 3-10.</p>
