<A NAME="28"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=68><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;fine&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tov</font>). The construction is parallel to phrases in the creation narrative (&#8220;and God saw that it was good,&#8221; Gen 1:4, 10, 12, 17, 21, 25, 31). B. Jacob says, &#8220;She looked upon her child with a joy similar to that of God upon His creation (Gen 1.4ff.)&#8221; (<i>Exodus</i>, 25). </p>
