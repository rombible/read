<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=82><b>tn</b> This clause is introduced with a disjunctive <i>vav </i>and the deictic particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>, &#8220;behold&#8221; in the KJV). The particle in this kind of clause introduces the unexpected &#8211; what Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter saw when she opened the basket: &#8220;and look, there was a baby boy crying.&#8221; The clause provides a parenthetical description of the child as she saw him when she opened the basket and does not advance the narrative. It is an important addition, however, for it puts readers in the position of looking with her into the basket and explains her compassion. </p>
