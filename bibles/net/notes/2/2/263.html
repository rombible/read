<A NAME="263"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=123><b>tn</b> The verb reads &#8220;and he sat&#8221; or &#8220;and he lived.&#8221; To translate it &#8220;he sat by a well&#8221; would seem anticlimactic and unconnected. It probably has the same sense as in the last clause, namely, that he lived in Midian, and he lived near a well, which detail prepares for what follows. </p>
