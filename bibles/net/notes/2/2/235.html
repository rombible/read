<A NAME="235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=95><b>sn</b> The naming provides the climax and summary of the story. The name of &#8220;Moses&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mosheh</font>) is explained by &#8220;I have drawn him (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mÿshitihu</font>) from the water.&#8221; It appears that the name is etymologically connected to the verb in the saying, which is from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mashah</font>, &#8220;to draw out&#8221;). But commentators have found it a little difficult that the explanation of the name by the daughter of Pharaoh is in Hebrew when the whole background is Egyptian (U. Cassuto, <i>Exodus</i>, 20). Moreover, the Hebrew spelling of the name is the form of the active participle (&#8220;the one who draws out&#8221;); to be a precise description it should have been spelled <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mashuy</font>), the passive participle (&#8220;the one drawn out&#8221;). The etymology is not precise; rather, it is a wordplay (called paronomasia). Either the narrator merely attributed words to her (which is unlikely outside of fiction), or the Hebrew account simply translated what she had said into Hebrew, finding a Hebrew verb with the same sounds as the name. Such wordplays on names (also popular etymology) are common in the Bible. Most agree that the name is an Egyptian name. Josephus attempted to connect the biblical etymology with the name in Greek, <i>Mouses</i>, stating that <i>Mo</i> is Egyptian for water, and <i>uses</i> means those rescued from it (<i>Ant.</i> 2.9.6 [2.228]; see also J. Gwyn Griffiths, &#8220;The Egyptian Derivation of the Name Moses,&#8221; <i>JNES</i> 12 [1953]: 225). But the solution to the name is not to be derived from the Greek rendering. Due to the estimation Egyptians had of the Nile, the princess would have thought of the child from the river as a supernatural provision. The Egyptian hieroglyphic <font face="Scholar">ms</font> can be the noun &#8220;child&#8221; or the perfective verb &#8220;be born.&#8221; This was often connected with divine elements for names: Ptah-mose, &#8220;Ptah is born.&#8221; Also the name Rameses (<font face="Scholar">R</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">-m-sw</font>) means &#8220;[the god] Re&#8217; is he who has born him.&#8221; If the name Moses is Egyptian, there are some philological difficulties (see the above article for their treatment). The significance of all this is that when the child was named by the princess, an Egyptian word related to <font face="Scholar">ms</font> was used, meaning something like &#8220;child&#8221; or &#8220;born.&#8221; The name might have even been longer, perhaps having a theophoric element (divine name) with it &#8211; &#8220;child of [some god].&#8221; The name&#8217;s motivation came from the fact that she drew him from the Nile, the source of life in Egypt. But the sound of the name recalled for the Hebrews the verb &#8220;to draw out&#8221; in their own language. Translating the words of the princess into Hebrew allowed for the effective wordplay to capture the significance of the story in the sound of the name. The implication for the Israelites is something to this effect: &#8220;You called him &#8216;born one&#8217; in your language and after your custom, but in our language that name means &#8216;drawing out&#8217; &#8211; which is what was to become of him. You drew him out of the water, but he would draw us out of Egypt through the water.&#8221; So the circumstances of the story show Moses to be a man of destiny, and this naming episode summarizes how divine providence was at work in Israel. To the Israelites the name forever commemorated the portent of this event in the early life of the great deliverer (see Isa 63:11).</p>
