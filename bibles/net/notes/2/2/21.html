<A NAME="21"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=61><b>sn</b> The chapter records the exceptional survival of Moses under the decree of death by Pharaoh (vv. 1-10), the flight of Moses from Pharaoh after killing the Egyptian (vv. 11-15), the marriage of Moses (vv. 16-22), and finally a note about the <sc>Lord&#8217;s hearing the sighing of the people in bondage (vv. 23-25). The first part is the birth. The Bible has several stories about miraculous or special births and deliverances of those destined to lead Israel. Their impact is essentially to authenticate the individual&#8217;s ministry. If the person&#8217;s beginning was providentially provided and protected by the <sc>Lord, then the mission must be of divine origin too. In this chapter the plot works around the decree for the death of the children &#8211; a decree undone by the women. The second part of the chapter records Moses&#8217; flight and marriage. Having introduced the deliverer Moses in such an auspicious way, the chapter then records how this deliverer acted presumptuously and had to flee for his life. Any deliverance God desired had to be supernatural, as the chapter&#8217;s final note about answering prayer shows. </p>
