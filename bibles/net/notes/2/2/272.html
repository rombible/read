<A NAME="272"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=132><b>sn</b> The name &#8220;Reuel&#8221; is given here. In other places (e.g., chap. 18) he is called Jethro (cf. CEV, which uses &#8220;Jethro&#8221; here). Some suggest that this is simply a confusion of traditions. But it is not uncommon for ancients, like Sabean kings and priests, to have more than one name. Several of the kings of Israel, including Solomon, did. &#8220;Reuel&#8221; means &#8220;friend of God.&#8221; </p>
