<A NAME="239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=99><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;brothers.&#8221; This term does not require them to be literal siblings, or even close family members. It simply refers to fellow Hebrews, people with whom Moses has begun to feel close ties of kinship. They are &#8220;brothers&#8221; in a broad sense, ultimately fellow members of the covenant community.</p>
