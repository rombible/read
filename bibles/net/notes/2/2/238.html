<A NAME="238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=98><b>tn</b> The preterite with the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive is here subordinated to the next and main idea of the verse. This is the second use of this verb in the chapter. In v. 10 the verb had the sense of &#8220;when he began to grow&#8221; or &#8220;when he got older,&#8221; but here it carries the nuance of &#8220;when he had grown up.&#8221;</p>
