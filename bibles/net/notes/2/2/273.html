<A NAME="273"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=133><b>tn</b> The sentence uses a verbal hendiadys construction: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1492;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">miharten bo</font>&#8217;, &#8220;you have made quick [to] come&#8221;). The finite verb functions as if it were an adverb modifying the infinitive, which becomes the main verb of the clause.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Two observations should be made at this point. First, it seems that the oppression at the well was a regular part of their routine because their father was surprised at their early return, and their answer alluded to the shepherds rather automatically. Secondly, the story is another meeting-at-the-well account. Continuity with the patriarchs is thereby kept in the mind of the reader (cf. Gen 24; 29:1-12). </p>
