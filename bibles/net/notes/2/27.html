<A NAME="271"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1795><b>tn</b> The article on this word identifies this as <i>the</i> altar, meaning the main high altar on which the sacrifices would be made. </p>
<A NAME="272"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1796><b>tn</b> The dimensions are five cubits by five cubits by three cubits high.</p>
<A NAME="273"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1797><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;four&#8221;; this refers to four sides. S. R. Driver says this is an archaism that means there were four equal sides (<i>Exodus</i>, 291).</p>
<A NAME="274"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1798><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and three cubits its height.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="275"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1799><b>sn</b> The horns of the altar were indispensable &#8211; they were the most sacred part. Blood was put on them; fugitives could cling to them, and the priests would grab the horns of the little altar when making intercessory prayer. They signified power, as horns on an animal did in the wild (and so the word was used for kings as well). The horns may also represent the sacrificial animals killed on the altar.</p>
<A NAME="276"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1800><b>sn</b> The text, as before, uses the prepositional phrase &#8220;from it&#8221; or &#8220;part of it&#8221; to say that the horns will be part of the altar &#8211; of the same piece as the altar. They were not to be made separately and then attached, but made at the end of the boards used to build the altar (U. Cassuto, <i>Exodus</i>, 363).</p>
<A NAME="277"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1801><b>sn</b> The word is literally &#8220;its fat,&#8221; but sometimes it describes &#8220;fatty ashes&#8221; (TEV &#8220;the greasy ashes&#8221;). The fat would run down and mix with the ashes, and this had to be collected and removed.</p>
<A NAME="278"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1802><b>sn</b> This was the larger bowl used in tossing the blood at the side of the altar. </p>
<A NAME="279"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1803><b>tn</b> The text has &#8220;to all its vessels.&#8221; This is the <font face="Scholar">lamed</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font>) of inclusion according to Gesenius, meaning &#8220;all its utensils&#8221; (GKC 458 §143.<i>e</i>).</p>
<A NAME="2710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1804><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mikhbar</font>) means &#8220;a grating&#8221;; it is related to the word that means a &#8220;sieve.&#8221; This formed a vertical support for the ledge, resting on the ground and supporting its outer edge (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 292).</p>
<A NAME="2711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1805><b>tn</b> The verb is the verb &#8220;to be,&#8221; here the perfect tense with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive. It is &#8220;and it will be&#8221; or &#8220;that it may be,&#8221; or here &#8220;that it may come&#8221; halfway up.</p>
<A NAME="2712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1806><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to the half of the altar.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1807><b>tn</b> The verb is a Hophal perfect with <i>vav</i> consecutive: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿhuva</font>&#8217;, &#8220;and it will be brought&#8221;). The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et</font>) here introduces the subject of the passive verb (see a similar use in 21:28, &#8220;and its flesh will not be eaten&#8221;). </p>
<A NAME="2714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1808><b>tn</b> The construction is the infinitive construct with <font face="Scholar">bet</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;</font>) preposition: &#8220;in carrying it.&#8221; Here the meaning must be that the poles are not left in the rings, but only put into the rings when they carried it.</p>
<A NAME="2715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1809><b>tn</b> The verb is used impersonally; it reads &#8220;just as he showed you.&#8221; This form then can be made a passive in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="2716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1810><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;thus they will make.&#8221; Here too it could be given a passive translation since the subject is not expressed. But &#8220;they&#8221; would normally refer to the people who will be making this and so can be retained in the translation.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Nothing is said about the top of the altar. Some commentators suggest, in view of the previous instruction for making an altar out of earth and stone, that when this one was to be used it would be filled up with dirt clods and the animal burnt on the top of that. If the animal was burnt inside it, the wood would quickly burn. A number of recent scholars think this was simply an imagined plan to make a portable altar after the pattern of Solomon&#8217;s &#8211; but that is an unsatisfactory suggestion. This construction must simply represent a portable frame for the altar in the courtyard, an improvement over the field altar. The purpose and function of the altar are not in question. Here worshipers would make their sacrifices to God in order to find forgiveness and atonement, and in order to celebrate in worship with him. No one could worship God apart from this; no one could approach God apart from this. So too the truths that this altar communicated form the basis and center of all Christian worship. One could word an applicable lesson this way: Believers must ensure that the foundation and center of their worship is the altar, i.e., the sacrificial atonement. </p>
<A NAME="2717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1811><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;enclosure&#8221; (TEV).</p>
<A NAME="2718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1812><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;south side southward.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1813><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;curtains.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1814><b>sn</b> The entire courtyard of 150 feet by 75 feet was to be enclosed by a curtain wall held up with posts in bases. All these hangings were kept in place by a cord and tent pegs. </p>
<A NAME="2721"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1815><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2722"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1816><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and thus.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1817><b>tn</b> Here the phrase &#8220;there will be&#8221; has been supplied.</p>
<A NAME="2724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1818><b>sn</b> These bands have been thought by some to refer to connecting rods joining the tops of the posts. But it is more likely that they are bands or bind rings surrounding the posts at the base of the capitals (see 38:17). </p>
<A NAME="2725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1819><b>tn</b> The word literally means &#8220;shoulder.&#8221; The next words, &#8220;of the gate,&#8221; have been supplied here and in v. 15. The east end would contain the courtyard&#8217;s entry with a wall of curtains on each side of the entry (see v. 16).</p>
<A NAME="2726"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1820><b>tn</b> Here &#8220;will be&#8221; has been supplied.</p>
<A NAME="2727"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1821><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;shoulder.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2728"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1822><b>tn</b> Here the phrase &#8220;there will be&#8221; has been supplied.</p>
<A NAME="2729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1823><b>tn</b> The text uses the passive participle here: they are to &#8220;be filleted with silver&#8221; or &#8220;bound round&#8221; with silver.</p>
<A NAME="2730"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1824><b>tn</b> Here the phrase &#8220;are to be&#8221; has been supplied.</p>
<A NAME="2731"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1825><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a hundred cubits.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2732"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1826><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;fifty.&#8221; The text has &#8220;and the width fifty [cubits] with fifty.&#8221; This means that it is fifty cubits wide on the western end and fifty cubits wide on the eastern end.</p>
<A NAME="2733"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1827><b>tn</b> Here &#8220;hangings&#8221; has been supplied.</p>
<A NAME="2734"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1828><b>tn</b> Here the phrase &#8220;is to be&#8221; has been supplied.</p>
<A NAME="2735"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1829><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to all&#8221;; for use of the preposition <font face="Scholar">lamed</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font>) to show inclusion (all belonging to) see GKC 458 §143.<i>e</i>.</p>
<A NAME="2736"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1830><b>tn</b> Here &#8220;used&#8221; has been supplied.</p>
<A NAME="2737"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1831><b>sn</b> The tabernacle is an important aspect of OT theology. The writer&#8217;s pattern so far has been: ark, table, lamp, and then their container (the tabernacle); then the altar and its container (the courtyard). The courtyard is the place of worship where the people could gather &#8211; they entered God&#8217;s courts. Though the courtyard may not seem of much interest to current readers, it did interest the Israelites. Here the sacrifices were made, the choirs sang, the believers offered their praises, they had their sins forgiven, they came to pray, they appeared on the holy days, and they heard from God. It was sacred because God met them there; they left the &#8220;world&#8221; (figuratively speaking) and came into the very presence of God. </p>
<A NAME="2738"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1832><b>tn</b> The form is the imperfect tense with the <i>vav</i> showing a sequence with the first verb: &#8220;you will command&#8230;that they take.&#8221; The verb &#8220;take, receive&#8221; is used here as before for receiving an offering and bringing it to the sanctuary.</p>
<A NAME="2739"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1833><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lamp,&#8221; which must be a collective singular here.</p>
<A NAME="2740"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1834><b>tn</b> The verb is unusual; it is the Hiphil infinitive construct of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alah</font>), with the sense here of &#8220;to set up&#8221; to burn, or &#8220;to fix on&#8221; as in Exod 25:37, or &#8220;to kindle&#8221; (U. Cassuto, <i>Exodus</i>, 370).</p>
<A NAME="2741"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1835><b>sn</b> The word can mean &#8220;continually,&#8221; but in this context, as well as in the passages on the sacrifices, &#8220;regularly&#8221; is better, since each morning things were cleaned and restored.</p>
<A NAME="2742"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1836><b>tn</b> The LXX has mistakenly rendered this name &#8220;the tent of the testimony.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2743"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1837><b>sn</b> The lamps were to be removed in the morning so that the wicks could be trimmed and the oil replenished (30:7) and then lit every evening to burn through the night. </p>
<A NAME="2744"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1838><b>sn</b> This is the first of several sections of priestly duties. The point is a simple one here: those who lead the worship use the offerings of the people to ensure that access to God is illumined regularly. The NT will make much of the symbolism of light. </p>
