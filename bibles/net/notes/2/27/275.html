<A NAME="275"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1799><b>sn</b> The horns of the altar were indispensable &#8211; they were the most sacred part. Blood was put on them; fugitives could cling to them, and the priests would grab the horns of the little altar when making intercessory prayer. They signified power, as horns on an animal did in the wild (and so the word was used for kings as well). The horns may also represent the sacrificial animals killed on the altar.</p>
