<A NAME="2737"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1831><b>sn</b> The tabernacle is an important aspect of OT theology. The writer&#8217;s pattern so far has been: ark, table, lamp, and then their container (the tabernacle); then the altar and its container (the courtyard). The courtyard is the place of worship where the people could gather &#8211; they entered God&#8217;s courts. Though the courtyard may not seem of much interest to current readers, it did interest the Israelites. Here the sacrifices were made, the choirs sang, the believers offered their praises, they had their sins forgiven, they came to pray, they appeared on the holy days, and they heard from God. It was sacred because God met them there; they left the &#8220;world&#8221; (figuratively speaking) and came into the very presence of God. </p>
