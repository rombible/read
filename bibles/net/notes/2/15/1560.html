<A NAME="1560"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=1091><b>sn</b> The Hebrew word &#8220;Marah&#8221; means &#8220;bitter.&#8221; This motif will be repeated four times in this passage to mark the central problem. Earlier in the book the word had been used for the &#8220;bitter herbs&#8221; in the Passover, recalling the bitter labor in bondage. So there may be a double reference here &#8211; to the bitter waters and to Egypt itself &#8211; God can deliver from either.</p>
