<A NAME="1510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1041><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;man of war&#8221; (so KJV, ASV). &#8220;Warrior&#8221; is now the preferred translation since &#8220;man of war&#8221; is more commonly known today as a warship. The expression indicates that Yahweh is one who understands how to fight and defeat the enemy. The word &#8220;war&#8221; modifies &#8220;man&#8221; to reveal that Yahweh is a warrior. Other passages use similar descriptions: Isa 42:13 has &#8220;man of wars&#8221;; Ps 24:8 has &#8220;mighty man of battle.&#8221; See F. Cross, &#8220;The Divine Warrior in Israel&#8217;s Early Cult,&#8221; <i>Biblical Motifs</i>, 11-30.</p>
