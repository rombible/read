<A NAME="151"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1032><b>sn</b> This chapter is a song of praise sung by Moses and the people right after the deliverance from the Sea. The song itself is vv. 1b-18; it falls into three sections &#8211; praise to God (1b-3), the cause for the praise (4-13), and the conclusion (14-18). The point of the first section is that God&#8217;s saving acts inspire praise from his people; the second is that God&#8217;s powerful acts deliver his people from the forces of evil; and the third section is that God&#8217;s demonstrations of his sovereignty inspire confidence in him by his people. So the Victory Song is very much like the other declarative praise psalms &#8211; the resolve to praise, the power of God, the victory over the enemies, the incomparability of God in his redemption, and the fear of the people.
