<A NAME="158"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1039><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1494;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿzimrat</font>) is problematic. It probably had a suffix <font face="Scholar">yod</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font>) that was accidentally dropped because of the <i>yod</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font>) on the divine name following. Most scholars posit another meaning for the word. A meaning of &#8220;power&#8221; fits the line fairly well, forming a hendiadys with strength &#8211; &#8220;strength and power&#8221; becoming &#8220;strong power.&#8221; Similar lines are in Isa 12:2 and Ps 118:14. Others suggest &#8220;protection&#8221; or &#8220;glory.&#8221; However, there is nothing substantially wrong with &#8220;my song&#8221; in the line &#8211; only that it would be a nicer match if it had something to do with strength.</p>
