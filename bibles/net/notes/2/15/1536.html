<A NAME="1536"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1067><b>tn</b> The verb is the prefixed conjugation, the preterite without the <i>vav</i> consecutive. The subject, the &#8220;earth,&#8221; must be inclusive of the sea, or it may indicate the grave or Sheol; the sea drowned them. Some scholars wish to see this as a reference to Dathan and Abiram, and therefore evidence of a later addition or compilation. It fits this passage well, however.</p>
