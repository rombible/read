<A NAME="1575"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">75</span><note=1106><b>tn</b> The construction uses the infinitive absolute and the imperfect tense of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shama</font>&#8217;). The meaning of the verb is idiomatic here because it is followed by &#8220;to the voice of Yahweh your God.&#8221; When this is present, the verb is translated &#8220;obey.&#8221; The construction is in a causal clause. It reads, &#8220;If you will diligently obey.&#8221; Gesenius points out that the infinitive absolute in a conditional clause also emphasizes the importance of the condition on which the consequence depends (GKC 342-43 §113.<i>o</i>).</p>
