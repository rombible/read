<A NAME="156"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1037><b>sn</b> The common understanding is that Egypt did not have people riding horses at this time, and so the phrase <i>the horse and its rider</i> is either viewed as an anachronism or is interpreted to mean charioteers. The word &#8220;to ride&#8221; can mean on a horse or in a chariot. Some have suggested changing &#8220;rider&#8221; to &#8220;chariot&#8221; (re-vocalization) to read &#8220;the horse and its chariot.&#8221;</p>
