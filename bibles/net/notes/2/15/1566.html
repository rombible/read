<A NAME="1566"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=1097><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1500;&#1465;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyillonu</font>)<font face="Scholar"> </font>from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lun</font>) is a much stronger word than &#8220;to grumble&#8221; or &#8220;to complain.&#8221; It is used almost exclusively in the wilderness wandering stories, to describe the rebellion of the Israelites against God (see also Ps 59:14-15). They were not merely complaining &#8211; they were questioning God&#8217;s abilities and motives. The action is something like a parliamentary vote of no confidence.</p>
