<A NAME="1563"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=1094><b>sn</b> Many scholars have attempted to explain these things with natural phenomena.

It is said that the waters of this well are notoriously salty and brackish; Robinson said it was six to eight feet in diameter and the water about two feet deep; the water is unpleasant, salty, and somewhat bitter. As a result the Arabs say it is the worst tasting water in the area (W. C. Kaiser, Jr., &#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:398). But that would not be a sufficient amount of water for the number of Israelites in the first place, and in the second, they could not drink it at all. But third, how did Moses change it?</p>
