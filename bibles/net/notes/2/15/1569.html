NAB, NIV, NRSV, TEV, CEV); NLT &#8220;a branch.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> S. R. Driver (<i>Exodus</i>, 143) follows some local legends in identifying this tree as one that is supposed to have &#8211; even to this day &#8211; the properties necessary for making bitter water sweet. B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 436) reports that no such tree has ever been found, but then he adds that this does not mean there was not such a bush in the earlier days. He believes that here God used a natural means (&#8220;showed, instructed&#8221;) to sweeten the water. He quotes Ben Sira as saying God had created these things with healing properties in them.</p>
