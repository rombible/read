<A NAME="3318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2183><b>sn</b> A widespread contemporary view is that this section represents a source that thought the tent of meeting was already erected (see S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 359). But the better view is that this is a temporary tent used for meeting the <sc>Lord. U. Cassuto explains this view very well (<i>Exodus</i>, 429-30), namely, that because the building of the tabernacle was now in doubt if the <sc>Lord was not going to be in their midst, another plan seemed necessary. Moses took this tent, his tent, and put some distance between the camp and it. Here he would use the tent as the place to meet God, calling it by the same name since it was a surrogate tent. Thus, the entire section was a temporary means of meeting God, until the current wrath was past.</p>
