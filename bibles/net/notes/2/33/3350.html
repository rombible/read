<A NAME="3350"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=2215><b>tn</b> The verb in this place is a preterite with the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive, judging from the pointing. It then follows in sequence the verb &#8220;you have found favor,&#8221; meaning you stand in that favor, and so it means &#8220;I have known you&#8221; and still do (equal to the present perfect). The emphasis, however, is on the results of the action, and so &#8220;I know you.&#8221;</p>
