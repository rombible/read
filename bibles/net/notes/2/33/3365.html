<A NAME="3365"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=2230><b>tn</b> The Niphal imperfect could simply be rendered &#8220;will not be seen,&#8221; but given the emphasis of the preceding verses, it is more binding than that, and so a negated obligatory imperfect fits better: &#8220;it must not be seen.&#8221; It would also be possible to render it with a potential imperfect tense: &#8220;it cannot be seen.&#8221;</p>
