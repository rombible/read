<A NAME="3316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2181><b>sn</b> This unit of the book could actually include all of chap. 33, starting with the point of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s withdrawal from the people. If that section is not part of the exposition, it would have to be explained as the background. The point is that sinfulness prevents the active presence of the <sc>Lord leading his people. But then the rest of chap. 33 forms the development. In vv. 7-11 there is the gracious provision: the <sc>Lord reveals through his faithful mediator. The <sc>Lord was leading his people, but now more remotely because of their sin. Then, in vv. 12-17 Moses intercedes for the people, and the intercession of the mediator guarantees the <sc>Lord&#8217;s presence. The point of all of this is that God wanted the people to come to know that if he was not with them they should not go. Finally, the presence of the <sc>Lord is verified to the mediator by a special revelation (18-23). The point of the whole chapter is that by his grace the <sc>Lord renews the promise of his presence by special revelation.</p>
