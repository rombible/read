<A NAME="3340"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=2205><b>tn</b> The verb &#8220;see&#8221; (an imperative) is a request for God to acknowledge Israel as his people by providing the divine leadership needed. So his main appeal will be for the people and not himself. To underscore this, he repeats &#8220;see&#8221; the way the section opened. </p>
