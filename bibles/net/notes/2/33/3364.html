<A NAME="3364"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=2229><b>tn</b> The plural &#8220;my backs&#8221; is according to Gesenius an extension plural (compare &#8220;face,&#8221; a dual in Hebrew). The word denotes a locality in general, but that is composed of numerous parts (see GKC 397 §124.<i>b</i>). W. C. Kaiser says that since God is a spirit, the meaning of this word could just as easily be rendered &#8220;after effects&#8221; of his presence (&#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:484). As S. R. Driver says, though, while this may indicate just the &#8220;afterglow&#8221; that he leaves behind him, it was enough to suggest what the full brilliancy of his presence must be (<i>Exodus</i>, 363; see also Job 26:14).</p>
