<A NAME="3338"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2203><b>tn</b> The imperfect tense of the verb &#8220;to know&#8221; with the <i>vav</i> follows the imperative of this root, and so this indicates the purpose clause (final imperfect): &#8220;in order that I may know you.&#8221; S. R. Driver summarizes it this way: that I may understand what your nature and character is, and shape my petitions accordingly, so that I may find grace in your sight, and my future prayers may be answered (<i>Exodus</i>, 361).</p>
