<A NAME="3321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2186><b>tn</b> The form is the Piel participle. The seeking here would indicate seeking an oracle from Yahweh or seeking to find a resolution for some difficulty (as in 2 Sam 21:1) or even perhaps coming with a sacrifice. B. Jacob notes that the tent was even here a place of prayer, for the benefit of the people (<i>Exodus</i>, 961). It is not known how long this location was used. </p>
