<A NAME="3356"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=2221><b>sn</b> God declares his mercy and grace in similar terms to his earlier self-revelation (&#8220;I am that I am&#8221;): &#8220;I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious.&#8221; In other words, the grace and mercy of God are bound up in his own will. Obviously, in this passage the recipients of that favor are the penitent Israelites who were forgiven through Moses&#8217; intercession. The two words are at the heart of God&#8217;s dealings with people. The first is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khanan</font>, &#8220;to be gracious, show favor&#8221;). It means to grant favor or grace to someone, grace meaning unmerited favor. All of God&#8217;s dealings are gracious, but especially in forgiving sins and granting salvation it is critical. Parallel to this is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rakham</font>), a word that means &#8220;show compassion, tender mercy.&#8221; It is a word that is related to the noun &#8220;womb,&#8221; the connection being in providing care and protection for that which is helpless and dependent &#8211; a motherly quality. In both of these constructions the verbs simply express what God will do, without explaining why. See further, J. R. Lundbom, &#8220;God&#8217;s Use of the <i>Idem per idem</i> to Terminate Debate,&#8221; <i>HTR</i> 71 (1978): 193-201; and J. Piper, &#8220;Prolegomena to Understanding Romans 9:14-15: An Interpretation of Exodus 33:19,&#8221; <i>JETS </i>22 (1979): 203-16. </p>
