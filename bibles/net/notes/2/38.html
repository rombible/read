<BODY ><p>
<A NAME="381"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2422><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;its horns were from it,&#8221; meaning from the same piece.</p>
<A NAME="382"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2423><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;it&#8221;; the referent (the altar) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="383"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2424><b>sn</b> The word for &#8220;serve&#8221; is not the ordinary one. It means &#8220;to serve in a host,&#8221; especially in a war. It appears that women were organized into bands and served at the tent of meeting. S. R. Driver thinks that this meant &#8220;no doubt&#8221; washing, cleaning, or repairing (<i>Exodus</i>, 391). But there is no hint of that (see 1 Sam 2:22; and see Ps 68:11 [12 Hebrew text]). They seem to have had more to do than what Driver said.</p>
<A NAME="384"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2425><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;south side southward.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="385"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2426><b>tn</b> While this verse could be translated as an independent sentence, it is probably to be subordinated as a circumstantial clause in line with Exod 27:10-12, as well as v. 12 of this passage.</p>
<A NAME="386"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2427><b>tn</b> Here the phrase &#8220;the hangings were&#8221; has been supplied.</p>
<A NAME="387"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2428><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;there were&#8221; has been supplied.</p>
<A NAME="388"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2429><b>tn</b> The text simply has &#8220;their posts ten and their bases ten&#8221;; this may be added here as a circumstantial clause with the main sentence in order to make sense out of the construction.</p>
<A NAME="389"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2430><b>tn</b> The text simply says &#8220;seventy-five feet.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2431><b>tn</b> The word literally means &#8220;shoulder.&#8221; The next words, &#8220;of the gate,&#8221; have been supplied here. The east end contained the courtyard&#8217;s entry with a wall of curtains on each side of the entry (see v. 15).</p>
<A NAME="3811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2432><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from this and from this&#8221; (cf, 17:12; 25:19; 26:13; 32:15; Josh 8:22, 33; 1 Kgs 10:19-20; Ezek 45:7).</p>
<A NAME="3812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2433><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they were banded with silver.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="3813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2434><b>tn</b> This word is different from the word for hangings; it has more of the idea of a screen, shielding or securing the area.</p>
<A NAME="3814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2435><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pÿqude</font>), which in a slavishly literal way would be &#8220;visitations of&#8221; the tabernacle. But the word often has the idea of &#8220;numbering&#8221; or &#8220;appointing&#8221; as well. Here it is an accounting or enumeration of the materials that people brought, so the contemporary term &#8220;inventory&#8221; is a close approximation. By using this Hebrew word there is also the indication that whatever was given, i.e., appointed for the tabernacle, was changed forever in its use. This is consistent with this Hebrew root, which does have a sense of changing the destiny of someone (&#8220;God will surely visit you&#8221;). The list in this section will also be tied to the numbering of the people.</p>
<A NAME="3815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2436><b>tn</b> The same verb is used here, but now in the Pual perfect tense, third masculine singular. A translation &#8220;was numbered&#8221; or &#8220;was counted&#8221; works. The verb is singular because it refers to the tabernacle as a unit. This section will list what made up the tabernacle.</p>
<A NAME="3816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2437><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;at/by the mouth of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2438><b>tn</b> The noun is &#8220;work&#8221; or &#8220;service.&#8221; S. R. Driver explains that the reckonings were not made for the Levites, but that they were the work of the Levites, done by them under the direction of Ithamar (<i>Exodus</i>,<i> </i>393).</p>
<A NAME="3818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2439><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;by the hand of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2440><b>tn</b> These words form the <i>casus pendens</i>, or independent nominative absolute, followed by the apodosis beginning with the <font face="Scholar">vav </font>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>; see U. Cassuto, <i>Exodus</i>, 469).</p>
<A NAME="3820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2441><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and it was.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2442><b>sn</b> There were 3000 shekels in a talent, and so the total weight here in shekels would be 87,730 shekels of gold. If the sanctuary shekel was 224 grs., then this was about 40,940 oz. troy. This is estimated to be a little over a ton (cf. NCV &#8220;over 2,000 pounds&#8221;; TEV &#8220;a thousand kilogrammes&#8221;; CEV &#8220;two thousand two hundred nine pounds&#8221;; NLT &#8220;about 2,200 pounds&#8221;), although other widely diverging estimates are also given.</p>
<A NAME="3822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2443><b>sn</b> This would be a total of 301,775 shekels (about 140,828 oz), being a half shekel exacted per person from 605,550 male Israelites 20 years old or more (Num 1:46). The amount is estimated to be around 3.75 tons.</p>
<A NAME="3823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2444><b>sn</b> The weight would be about half an ounce. </p>
<A NAME="3824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2445><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;upward.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2446><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;in all&#8221; has been supplied.</p>
<A NAME="3826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2447><b>tn</b> Here the word &#8220;shekels&#8221; is understood; about 45 pounds.</p>
<A NAME="3827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2448><b>sn</b> The total shekels would have been 212,400 shekels, which would be about 108,749 oz. This would make about 2.5 to 3 tons.</p>
<A NAME="3828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2449><b>sn</b> The bronze altar is the altar for the burnt offering; the large bronze basin is not included here in the list. </p>
