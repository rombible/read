<A NAME="112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=740><b>tn</b> The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465; &#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kÿsallÿkho kalah</font>) is difficult. It seems to say, &#8220;as/when he releases [you] altogether.&#8221; The LXX has &#8220;and when he sends you forth with everything.&#8221; <i>Tg. Onq.</i> and modern translators make <i>kala</i> adverbial, &#8220;completely&#8221; or &#8220;altogether.&#8221; B. S. Childs follows an emendation to read, &#8220;as one sends away a bride&#8221; (<i>Exodus</i> [OTL], 130). W. C. Kaiser prefers the view of Yaron that would render it &#8220;in the manner of one&#8217;s sending away a <i>kallah</i> [a slave purchased to be one&#8217;s daughter-in-law]&#8221; (&#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:370). The last two readings call for revising the vocalization and introducing a rare word into the narrative. The simplest approach is to follow a meaning &#8220;when he releases [you] altogether,&#8221; i.e., with all your people and your livestock.</p>
