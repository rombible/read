<A NAME="161"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1113><b>sn</b> Exod 16 plays an important part in the development of the book&#8217;s theme. It is part of the wider section that is the prologue leading up to the covenant at Sinai, a part of which was the obligation of obedience and loyalty (P. W. Ferris, Jr., &#8220;The Manna Narrative of Exodus 16:1-10,&#8221; <i>JETS</i> 18 [1975]: 191-99). The record of the wanderings in the wilderness is selective and not exhaustive. It may have been arranged somewhat topically for instructional reasons. U. Cassuto describes this section of the book as a didactic anthology arranged according to association of both context and language (<i>Exodus</i>, 187). Its themes are: lack of vital necessities, murmuring, proving, and providing. All the wilderness stories reiterate the same motifs. So, later, when Israel arrived in Canaan, they would look back and be reminded that it was Yahweh who brought them all the way, in spite of their rebellions. Because he is their Savior and their Provider, he will demand loyalty from them. In the Manna Narrative there is murmuring over the lack of bread (1-3), the disputation with Moses (4-8), the appearance of the glory and the promise of bread (9-12), the provision (13-22), the instructions for the Sabbath (23-30), and the memorial manna (31-36).</p>
<A NAME="162"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1114><b>tn</b> The sentence begins with a preterite and <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive, which can be subordinated to the next clause with the preterite and <i>vav</i> consecutive. Here it has been treated as a temporal clause.</p>
<A NAME="163"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1115><b>tn</b> The word is often rendered &#8220;congregation&#8221; (so KJV, ASV, NASB, NRSV), but the modern perception of a congregation is not exactly what is in mind in the desert. Another possible rendering is &#8220;community&#8221; (NAB, NIV, NCV, TEV) or &#8220;assembly.&#8221; The Hebrew word is used of both good and bad groups (Judg 14:8; Ps 1:5; 106:17-18).</p>
<A NAME="164"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1116><b>tn</b> The form in the text is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1510;&#1461;&#1488;&#1514;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿtse</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">tam</font>, &#8220;after their going out&#8221;). It clearly refers to their deliverance from Egypt, and so it may be vividly translated.</p>
<A NAME="165"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1117><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;community&#8221; or &#8220;assembly.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="166"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1118><b>tn</b> The text reads: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503; &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1461;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mi-yitten mutenu</font>, &#8220;who will give our dying&#8221;) meaning &#8220;If only we had died.&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1461;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</font> is the Qal infinitive construct with the suffix. This is one way that Hebrew expresses the optative with an infinitive construct. See R. J. Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 91-92, §547.</p>
<A NAME="167"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1119><b>tn</b> The form is a Qal infinitive construct used in a temporal clause, and the verb &#8220;when we ate&#8221; has the same structure. </p>
<A NAME="168"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1120><b>sn</b> That the complaint leading up to the manna is unjustified can be seen from the record itself. They left Egypt with flocks and herds and very much cattle, and about 45 days later they are complaining that they are without food. Moses reminded them later that they lacked nothing (Deut 3:7; for the whole sermon on this passage, see 8:1-20). Moreover, the complaint is absurd because the food of work gangs was far more meager than they recall. The complaint was really against Moses. They crave the eating of meat and of bread and so God will meet that need; he will send bread from heaven and quail as well.</p>
<A NAME="169"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1121><b>tn</b> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿhamit</font>) is the Hiphil infinitive construct showing purpose. The people do not trust the intentions or the plan of their leaders and charge Moses with bringing everyone out to kill them.</p>
<A NAME="1610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1122><b>tn</b> The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinni</font>) before the active participle indicates the imminent future action: &#8220;I am about to rain.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1123><b>tn</b> This verb and the next are the Qal perfect tenses with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutives; they follow the sequence of the participle, and so are future in orientation. The force here is instruction &#8211; &#8220;they will go out&#8221; or &#8220;they are to go out.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1124><b>tn</b> The verb in the purpose/result clause is the Piel imperfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1505;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nasah</font>), <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1463;&#1505;&#1468;&#1462;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anassenu</font>) &#8211; &#8220;in order that I may prove them [him].&#8221; The giving of the manna will be a test of their obedience to the detailed instructions of God as well as being a test of their faith in him (if they believe him they will not gather too much). In chap. 17 the people will test God, showing that they do not trust him.</p>
<A NAME="1613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1125><b>sn</b> The word &#8220;law&#8221; here properly means &#8220;direction&#8221; at this point (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 146), but their obedience here would indicate also whether or not they would be willing to obey when the Law was given at Sinai. </p>
<A NAME="1614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1126><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and it will be on the sixth day.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1127><b>sn</b> There is a question here concerning the legislation &#8211; the people were not told why to gather twice as much on the sixth day. In other words, this instruction seems to presume that they knew about the Sabbath law. That law will be included in this chapter in a number of ways, suggesting to some scholars that this chapter is out of chronological order, placed here for a purpose. Some argue that the manna episode comes after the revelation at Sinai. But it is not necessary to take such a view. God had established the Sabbath in the creation, and if Moses has been expounding the Genesis traditions in his teachings then they would have known about that. </p>
<A NAME="1616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1128><b>tn</b> The text simply has &#8220;evening, and you will know.&#8221; Gesenius notes that the perfect tense with the <i>vav</i> consecutive occurs as the apodosis to temporal clauses or their equivalents. Here the first word implies the idea &#8220;[when it becomes] evening&#8221; or simply &#8220;[in the] evening&#8221; (GKC 337-38 §112.<i>oo</i>).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Moses is very careful to make sure that they know it is Yahweh who has brought them out, and it will be Yahweh who will feed them. They are going to be convinced of this now.</p>
<A NAME="1617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1129><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;morning, and you will see.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1130><b>tn</b> The form is a Qal infinitive construct with a preposition and a suffix. It forms an adverbial clause, usually of time, but here a causal clause.</p>
<A NAME="1619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1131><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;as for us&#8221; attempt to convey the force of the Hebrew word order, which puts emphasis on the pronoun: &#8220;and we &#8211; what?&#8221; The implied answer to the question is that Moses and Aaron are nothing, merely the messengers. The next verse repeats the question to further press the seriousness of what the Israelites are doing.</p>
<A NAME="1620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1132><b>tn</b> &#8220;You will know this&#8221; has been added to make the line smooth. Because of the abruptness of the lines in the verse, and the repetition with v. 7, B. S. Childs (Exodus [OTL], 273) thinks that v. 8 is merely a repetition by scribal error &#8211; even though the versions render it as the MT has it. But B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 447) suggests that the contrast with vv. 6 and 7 is important for another reason &#8211; there Moses and Aaron speak, and it is smooth and effective, but here only Moses speaks, and it is labored and clumsy. &#8220;We should realize that Moses had properly claimed to be no public speaker.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1133><b>tn</b> Here again is an infinitive construct with the preposition forming a temporal clause.</p>
<A NAME="1622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1134><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;as for us&#8221; attempt to convey the force of the Hebrew word order, which puts emphasis on the pronoun: &#8220;and we &#8211; what?&#8221; The implied answer to the question is that Moses and Aaron are nothing, merely the messengers.</p>
<A NAME="1623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1135><b>tn</b> The word order is &#8220;not against us [are] your murmurings.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1136><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;congregation&#8221; (KJV, ASV, NASB, NRSV); the same word occurs in v. 10.</p>
<A NAME="1625"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1137><b>tn</b> The verb means &#8220;approach, draw near.&#8221; It is used in the Torah of drawing near for religious purposes. It is possible that some sacrifice was involved here, but no mention is made of that. </p>
<A NAME="1626"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1138><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and it was as Aaron spoke.&#8221; The construction uses the temporal indicator and then the Piel<i> </i>infinitive construct followed by the subjective genitive &#8220;Aaron.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1627"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1139><b>sn</b> S. R. Driver says, &#8220;A brilliant glow of fire&#8230;symbolizing Jehovah&#8217;s presence, gleamed through the cloud, resting&#8230;on the Tent of Meeting. The cloud shrouds the full brilliancy of the glory, which human eye could not behold&#8221; (<i>Exodus</i>, 147-48; see also Ezek 1:28; 3:12, 23; 8:4; 9:3, et al.). A Hebrew word often translated &#8220;behold&#8221; or &#8220;lo&#8221; introduces the surprising sight. </p>
<A NAME="1628"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1140><b>tn</b> The verb is the Niphal perfect of the verb &#8220;to see&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;it was seen.&#8221; But the standard way of translating this form is from the perspective of Yahweh as subject &#8211; &#8220;he appeared.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1629"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1141><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;during the evenings&#8221;; see Exod 12:6. </p>
<A NAME="1630"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1142><b>sn</b> One of the major interpretive difficulties is the comparison between Exod 16 and Num 11. In Numbers we find that the giving of the manna was about 24 months after the Exod 16 time (assuming there was a distinct time for this chapter), that it was after the erection of the tabernacle, that <i>Taberah</i> (the Burning) preceded it (not in Exod 16), that the people were tired of the manna (not that there was no bread to eat) and so God would send the quail, and that there was a severe tragedy over it. In Exod 16 both the manna and the quail are given on the same day, with no mention of quail on the following days. Contemporary scholarship generally assigns the accounts to two different sources because complete reconciliation seems impossible. Even if we argue that Exodus has a thematic arrangement and &#8220;telescopes&#8221; some things to make a point, there will still be difficulties in harmonization. Two considerations must be kept in mind: 1) First, they could be separate events entirely. If this is true, then they should be treated separately as valid accounts of things that appeared or occurred during the period of the wanderings. Similar things need not be the same thing. 2) Secondly, strict chronological order is not always maintained in the Bible narratives, especially if it is a didactic section. Perhaps Exod 16 describes the initiation of the giving of manna as God&#8217;s provision of bread, and therefore placed in the prologue of the covenant, and Num 11 is an account of a mood which developed over a period of time in response to the manna. Num 11 would then be looking back from a different perspective. </p>
<A NAME="1631"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1143><b>tn</b> The verb means &#8220;to be sated, satisfied&#8221;; in this context it indicates that they would have sufficient bread to eat &#8211; they would be full.</p>
<A NAME="1632"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1144><b>tn</b> The form is a Qal perfect with the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive; it is in sequence with the imperfect tenses before it, and so this is equal to an imperfect nuance. But, from the meanings of the words, it is clear that this will be the outcome of their eating the food, a divinely intended outcome.</p>
<A NAME="1633"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1145><b>sn</b> This verse supports the view taken in chap. 6 concerning the verb &#8220;to know.&#8221; Surely the Israelites by now knew that Yahweh was their God. Yes, they did. But they had not experienced what that meant; they had not received the fulfillment of the promises. </p>
<A NAME="1634"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1146><b>sn</b> These are migratory birds, said to come up in the spring from Arabia flying north and west, and in the fall returning. They fly with the wind, and so generally alight in the evening, covering the ground. If this is part of the explanation, the divine provision would have had to alter their flight paths to bring them to the Israelites, and bring them in vast numbers. </p>
<A NAME="1635"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1147><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and [the dew&#8230;] went up.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1636"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1148><b>tn</b> The preterite with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive is here subordinated as a temporal clause to the main clause; since that clause calls special attention to what was there after the dew evaporated.</p>
<A NAME="1637"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1149><b>sn</b> Translations usually refer to the manna as &#8220;bread.&#8221; In fact it appears to be more like grain, because it could be ground in hand-mills and made into cakes. The word involved says it is thin, flakelike (if an Arabic etymological connection is correct). What is known about it from the Bible in Exodus is that it was a very small flakelike substance, it would melt when the sun got hot, if left over it bred worms and became foul, it could be ground, baked, and boiled, it was abundant enough for the Israelites to gather an omer a day per person, and they gathered it day by day throughout the wilderness sojourn. Num 11 says it was like coriander seed with the appearance of bdellium, it tasted like fresh oil, and it fell with the dew. Deut 8:3 says it was unknown to Israel or her ancestors; Psalm 78:24 parallels it with grain. Some scholars compare ancient references to honeydew that came from the heavens. F. S. Bodenheimer (&#8220;The Manna of Sinai,&#8221; <i>BA</i> 10 [1947]: 2) says that it was a sudden surprise for the nomadic Israelites because it provided what they desired &#8211; sweetness. He says that it was a product that came from two insects, making the manna a honeydew excretion from plant lice and scale insects. The excretion hardens and drops to the ground as a sticky solid. He notes that some cicadas are called <i>man</i> in Arabic. This view accounts for some of the things in these passages: the right place, the right time, the right description, and a similar taste. But there are major difficulties: Exodus requires a far greater amount, it could breed worms, it could melt away, it could be baked into bread, it could decay and stink. The suggestion is in no way convincing. Bodenheimer argues that &#8220;worms&#8221; could mean &#8220;ants&#8221; that carried them away, but that is contrived &#8211; the text could have said ants. The fact that the Bible calls it &#8220;bread&#8221; creates no problem. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1462;&#1495;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lekhem</font>) is used in a wide range of meanings from bread to all kinds of food including goats (Judg 13:15-16) and honey (1 Sam 14:24-28). Scripture does not say that manna was the only thing that they ate for the duration. But they did eat it throughout the forty years. It simply must refer to some supernatural provision for them in their diet. Modern suggestions may invite comparison and analysis, but they do not satisfy or explain the text. </p>
<A NAME="1638"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1150><b>tn</b> The preterite with <i>vav</i> consecutive is here subordinated to the next verb as a temporal clause. The main point of the verse is what they said.</p>
<A NAME="1639"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1151><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a man to his brother.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1640"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1152><b>tn</b> The text has: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1503; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497; &#1500;&#1488;&#1465; &#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; &#1502;&#1463;&#1492;&#1470;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">man hu</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> ki lo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> yadÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">u mah hu</font>&#8217;). From this statement the name &#8220;manna&#8221; was given to the substance. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1503;</font> for &#8220;what&#8221; is not found in Hebrew, but appears in Syriac as a contraction of <i>ma den</i>, &#8220;what then?&#8221; In Aramaic and Arabic <font face="Scholar">man</font> is &#8220;what?&#8221; The word is used here apparently for the sake of etymology. B. S. Childs (<i>Exodus</i> [OTL], 274) follows the approach that any connections to words that actually meant &#8220;what?&#8221; are unnecessary, for it is a play on the name (whatever it may have been) and therefore related only by sound to the term being explained. This, however, presumes that a substance was known prior to this account &#8211; a point that Deuteronomy does not seem to allow. S. R. Driver says that it is not known how early the contraction came into use, but that this verse seems to reflect it (<i>Exodus</i>, 149). Probably one must simply accept that in the early Israelite period <i>man</i> meant &#8220;what?&#8221; There seems to be sufficient evidence to support this. See <i>EA</i> 286,5; <i>UT</i> 435; <i>DNWSI </i>1:157.</p>
<A NAME="1641"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1153><b>sn</b> B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 454-55) suggests that Moses was saying to them, &#8220;It is not manna. It is the food Yahweh has given you.&#8221; He comes to this conclusion based on the strange popular etymology from the interrogative word, noting that people do not call things &#8220;what?&#8221;</p>

This is a display of sovereign power that differs from the display of military power. Once again the story calls for faith, but here it is faith in Yahweh to provide for his people. The provision is also a test to see if they will obey the instructions of God. Deut 8 explains this. The point, then, is that God provides for the needs of his people that they may demonstrate their dependence on him by obeying him. The exposition of this passage must also correlate to John 6. God&#8217;s providing manna from heaven to meet the needs of his people takes on new significance in the application that Jesus makes of the subject to himself. There the requirement is the same &#8211; will they believe and obey? But at the end of the event John explains that they murmured about Jesus. </p>
