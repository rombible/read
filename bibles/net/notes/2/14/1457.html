<A NAME="1457"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=1006><b>tn</b> The clause literally reads, &#8220;and the waters [were] for them a wall.&#8221; The word order in Hebrew is disjunctive, with the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) on the noun introducing a circumstantial clause.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> S. R. Driver (<i>Exodus</i>, 119), still trying to explain things with natural explanations, suggests that a northeast wind is to be thought of (an east wind would be directly in their face he says), such as a shallow ford might cooperate with an ebb tide in keeping a passage clear. He then quotes Dillmann about the &#8220;wall&#8221; of water: &#8220;A very summary poetical and hyperbolical (xv. 8) description of the occurrence, which at most can be pictured as the drying up of a shallow ford, on both sides of which the basin of the sea was much deeper, and remained filled with water.&#8221; There is no way to &#8220;water down&#8221; the text to fit natural explanations; the report clearly shows a miraculous work of God making a path through the sea &#8211; a path that had to be as wide as half a mile in order for the many people and their animals to cross between about 2:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. (W. C. Kaiser, Jr., &#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:389). The text does not say that they actually only started across in the morning watch, however.</p>
