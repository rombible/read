<A NAME="1432"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=981><b>sn</b> U. Cassuto (<i>Exodus</i>, 164) explains this statement by the people as follows: &#8220;The question appears surprising at first, for we have not read previously that such words were spoken to Moses. Nor is the purport of the protest of the Israelite foremen (v 21 [5:21]) identical with that of the words uttered now. However, from a psychological standpoint the matter can be easily explained. In the hour of peril the children of Israel remember that remonstrance, and now it seems to them that it was of a sharper character and flowed from their foresight, and that the present situation justifies it, for death awaits them at this moment in the desert.&#8221; This declaration that &#8220;we told you so,&#8221; born of fright, need not have been strictly accurate or logical.</p>
