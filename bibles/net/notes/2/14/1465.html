<A NAME="1465"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=1014><b>tn</b> The cohortative has the hortatory use here, &#8220;Let&#8217;s flee.&#8221; Although the form is singular, the sense of it is plural and so hortatory can be used. The form is singular to agree with the singular subject, &#8220;Egypt,&#8221; which obviously means the Egyptian army. The word for &#8220;flee&#8221; is used when someone runs from fear of immanent danger and is a different word than the one used in 14:5.</p>
