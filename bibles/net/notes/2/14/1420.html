<A NAME="1420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=969><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (<i>shalishim</i>) means &#8220;officers&#8221; or some special kind of military personnel. At one time it was taken to mean a &#8220;three man chariot,&#8221; but the pictures of Egyptian chariots only show two in a chariot. It may mean officers near the king, &#8220;men of the third rank&#8221; (B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 394). So the chariots and the crew represented the elite. See the old view by A. E. Cowley that linked it to a Hittite word (&#8220;A Hittite Word in Hebrew,&#8221; <i>JTS</i> 21 [1920]: 326), and the more recent work by P. C. Craigie connecting it to Egyptian &#8220;commander&#8221; (&#8220;An Egyptian Expression in the Song of the Sea: Exodus XV.4,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 20 [1970]: 85).</p>
