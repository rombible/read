<A NAME="1481"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">81</span><note=1030><b>tn</b> The verb is the Hiphil preterite of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aman</font>).<i> </i></p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> S. R. Driver says that the belief intended here is not simply a crediting of a testimony concerning a person or a thing, but a laying firm hold morally on a person or a thing (<i>Exodus</i>, 122). Others take the Hiphil sense to be declarative, and that would indicate a considering of the object of faith trustworthy or dependable, and therefore to be acted on. In this passage it does not mean that here they came to faith, but that they became convinced that he would save them in the future.</p>
