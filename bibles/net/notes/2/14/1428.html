<A NAME="1428"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=977><b>sn</b> B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 396-97) notes how the speech is overly dramatic and came from a people given to using such exaggerations (Num 16:14), even using a double negative. The challenge to Moses brings a double irony. To die in the desert would be without proper burial, but in Egypt there were graves &#8211; it was a land of tombs and graves! Gesenius notes that two negatives in the sentence do not nullify each other but make the sentence all the more emphatic: &#8220;Is it because there were no graves&#8230;?&#8221; (GKC 483 §152.<i>y</i>).</p>
