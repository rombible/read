<A NAME="1427"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=976><b>sn</b> Their cry to the <sc>Lord was proper and necessary. But their words to Moses were a rebuke and disloyal, showing a lack of faith and understanding. Their arrogance failed them in the crisis because it was built on the arm of flesh. Moses would have to get used to this murmuring, but here he takes it in stride and gives them the proper instructions. They had cried to the <sc>Lord, and now the <sc>Lord would deliver.</p>
