<A NAME="1434"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=983><b>tn</b> Since Hebrew does not use quotation marks to indicate the boundaries of quotations, there is uncertainty about whether the Israelites&#8217; statement in Egypt includes the end of v. 12 or consists solely of &#8220;leave us alone so that we can serve the Egyptians.&#8221; In either case, the command to Moses to leave them alone rested on the assumption, spoken or unspoken, that serving Egypt would be less risky than what Moses was proposing. Now with the Egyptian army on the horizon, the Israelites are sure that their worst predictions are about to take place.</p>
