<A NAME="1421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=970><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;with a high hand&#8221;; the expression means &#8220;defiantly,&#8221; &#8220;boldly,&#8221; or &#8220;with confidence.&#8221; The phrase is usually used for arrogant sin and pride, the defiant fist, as it were. The image of the high hand can also mean the hand raised to deliver a blow (Job 38:15). So the narrative here builds tension between these two resolute forces.</p>
