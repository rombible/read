<A NAME="101"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=657><b>sn</b> The Egyptians dreaded locusts like every other ancient civilization. They had particular gods to whom they looked for help in such catastrophes. The locust-scaring deities of Greece and Asia were probably looked to in Egypt as well (especially in view of the origins in Egypt of so many of those religious ideas). The announcement of the plague falls into the now-familiar pattern. God tells Moses to go and speak to Pharaoh but reminds Moses that he has hardened his heart. Yahweh explains that he has done this so that he might show his power, so that in turn they might declare his name from generation to generation. This point is stressed so often that it must not be minimized. God was laying the foundation of the faith for Israel &#8211; the sovereignty of Yahweh.</p>
<A NAME="102"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=658><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Yahweh said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="103"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=659><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shiti</font>, &#8220;I have put&#8221;); it is used here as a synonym for the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sim</font>). Yahweh placed the signs in his midst, where they will be obvious.</p>
<A NAME="104"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=660><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in his midst.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="105"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=661><b>tn</b> The expression is unusual: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1505;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1494;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tÿsapper bÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ozne</font>, &#8220;[that] you may declare in the ears of&#8221;). The clause explains an additional reason for God&#8217;s hardening the heart of Pharaoh, namely, so that the Israelites can tell their children of God&#8217;s great wonders. The expression is highly poetic and intense &#8211; like Ps 44:1, which says, &#8220;we have heard with our ears.&#8221; The emphasis would be on the clear teaching, orally, from one generation to another.</p>
<A NAME="106"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=662><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hit</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">allalti</font>) is a bold anthropomorphism. The word means to occupy oneself at another&#8217;s expense, to toy with someone, which may be paraphrased with &#8220;mock.&#8221; The whole point is that God is shaming and disgracing Egypt, making them look foolish in their arrogance and stubbornness (W. C. Kaiser, Jr., &#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:366-67). Some prefer to translate it as &#8220;I have dealt ruthlessly&#8221; with Egypt (see U. Cassuto, <i>Exodus</i>, 123).</p>
<A NAME="107"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=663><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;of Egypt.&#8221; The place is put by metonymy for the inhabitants.</p>
<A NAME="108"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=664><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;about&#8221; is supplied to clarify this as another object of the verb &#8220;declare.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="109"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=665><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;put&#8221; or &#8220;placed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=666><b>tn</b> The form is the perfect tense with <i>vav</i> consecutive, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vida</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">tem</font>, &#8220;and that you might know&#8221;). This provides another purpose for God&#8217;s dealings with Egypt in the way that he was doing. The form is equal to the imperfect tense with <font face="Scholar">vav </font>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>)<font face="Scholar"> </font>prefixed<i>; </i>it thus parallels the imperfect that began v. 2 &#8211; &#8220;that you might tell.&#8221;<i> </i></p>
<A NAME="1011"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=667><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1463;&#1504;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">me</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anta</font>), a Piel perfect. After &#8220;how long,&#8221; the form may be classified as present perfect (&#8220;how long have you refused), for it describes actions begun previously but with the effects continuing. (See GKC 311 §106.<i>g-h</i>). The use of a verb describing a state or condition may also call for a present translation (&#8220;how long do you refuse&#8221;) that includes past, present, and potentially future, in keeping with the question &#8220;how long.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1012"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=668><b>tn</b> The clause is built on the use of the infinitive construct to express the direct object of the verb &#8211; it answers the question of what Pharaoh was refusing to do. The Niphal infinitive construct (note the elision of the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">hey</font>] prefix after the preposition [see GKC 139 §51.<i>l</i>]) is from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anah</font>). The verb in this stem would mean &#8220;humble oneself.&#8221; The question is somewhat rhetorical, since God was not yet through humbling Pharaoh, who would not humble himself. The issue between Yahweh and Pharaoh is deeper than simply whether or not Pharaoh will let the Israelites leave Egypt.</p>
<A NAME="1013"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=669><b>tn</b> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinni</font>) before the active participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mevi</font>&#8217;) is the imminent future construction: &#8220;I am about to bring&#8221; or &#8220;I am going to bring&#8221; &#8211; precisely, &#8220;here I am bringing.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1014"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=670><b>tn</b> One of the words for &#8220;locusts&#8221; in the Bible is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arbeh</font>), which comes from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ravah</font>, &#8220;to be much, many&#8221;). It was used for locusts because of their immense numbers.</p>
<A NAME="1015"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=671><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;within your border.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=672><b>tn</b> The verbs describing the locusts are singular because it is a swarm or plague of locusts. This verb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1460;&#1505;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">vÿkhissah</font>, &#8220;cover&#8221;) is a Piel perfect with a <i>vav</i> consecutive; it carries the same future nuance as the participle before it.</p>
<A NAME="1017"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=673><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;eye,&#8221; an unusual expression (see v. 15; Num 22:5, 11).</p>
<A NAME="1018"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=674><b>tn</b> The text has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1465;&#1514;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1488; &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿlo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> yukhal lir</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ot</font>, &#8220;and he will not be able to see&#8221;). The verb has no expressed subjects. The clause might, therefore, be given a passive translation: &#8220;so that [it] cannot be seen.&#8221; The whole clause is the result of the previous statement.</p>
<A NAME="1019"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=675><b>sn</b> As the next phrase explains &#8220;what escaped&#8221; refers to what the previous plague did not destroy. The locusts will devour everything, because there will not be much left from the other plagues for them to eat. </p>
<A NAME="1020"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=676><b>tn</b> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hannish</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eret</font>) parallels (by apposition) and adds further emphasis to the preceding two words; it is the Niphal<i> </i>participle, meaning &#8220;that which is left over.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=677><b>tn</b> The relative pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asher</font>) is occasionally used as a comparative conjunction (see GKC 499 §161.<i>b</i>).</p>
<A NAME="1022"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=678><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;which your fathers have not seen, nor your fathers&#8217; fathers.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=679><b>tn</b> The Hebrew construction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501; &#1492;&#1457;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">miyyom heyotam</font>, &#8220;from the day of their being&#8221;). The statement essentially says that no one, even the elderly, could remember seeing a plague of locusts like this. In addition, see B. Childs, &#8220;A Study of the Formula, &#8216;Until This Day,&#8217;&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 82 (1963).</p>
<A NAME="1024"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=680><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Moses) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1025"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=681><b>sn</b> The question of Pharaoh&#8217;s servants echoes the question of Moses &#8211; &#8220;How long?&#8221; Now the servants of Pharaoh are demanding what Moses demanded &#8211; &#8220;Release the people.&#8221; They know that the land is destroyed, and they speak of it as Moses&#8217; doing. That way they avoid acknowledging Yahweh or blaming Pharaoh. </p>
<A NAME="1026"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=682><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;snare&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1511;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473;</font>, <font face="Scholar">moqesh</font>), a word used for a trap for catching birds. Here it is a figure for the cause of Egypt&#8217;s destruction. </p>
<A NAME="1027"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=683><b>tn</b> With the adverb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">terem</font>), the imperfect tense receives a present sense: &#8220;Do you not know?&#8221; (See GKC 481 §152.<i>r</i>).</p>
<A NAME="1028"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=684><b>tn</b> The question is literally &#8220;who and who are the ones going?&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497; &#1493;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497; &#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1465;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mi vami haholÿkhim</font>). Pharaoh&#8217;s answer to Moses includes this rude question, which was intended to say that Pharaoh would control who went. The participle in this clause, then, refers to the future journey.</p>
<A NAME="1029"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=685><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;we have a pilgrim feast (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1490;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khag</font>) to Yahweh.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1030"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=686><b>sn</b> Pharaoh is by no means offering a blessing on them in the name of Yahweh. The meaning of his &#8220;wish&#8221; is connected to the next clause &#8211; as he is releasing them, may God help them. S. R. Driver says that in Pharaoh&#8217;s scornful challenge Yahweh is as likely to protect them as Pharaoh is likely to let them go &#8211; not at all (<i>Exodus</i>, 80). He is planning to keep the women and children as hostages to force the men to return. U. Cassuto (<i>Exodus</i>, 125) paraphrases it this way: &#8220;May the help of your God be as far from you as I am from giving you permission to go forth with your little ones.&#8221; The real irony, Cassuto observes, is that in the final analysis he will let them go, and Yahweh will be with them. </p>
<A NAME="1031"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=687><b>tn</b> The context of Moses&#8217; list of young and old, sons and daughters, and the contrast with the word for strong &#8220;men&#8221; in v. 11 indicates that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tappÿkhem</font>), often translated &#8220;little ones&#8221; or &#8220;children,&#8221; refers to dependent people, noncombatants in general.</p>
<A NAME="1032"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=688><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;see.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1033"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=689><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;before your face.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The &#8220;trouble&#8221; or &#8220;evil&#8221; that is before them could refer to the evil that they are devising &#8211; the attempt to escape from Egypt. But that does not make much sense in the sentence &#8211; why would he tell them to take heed or look out about that? U. Cassuto (<i>Exodus</i>, 126) makes a better suggestion. He argues that Pharaoh is saying, &#8220;Don&#8217;t push me too far.&#8221; The evil, then, would be what Pharaoh was going to do if these men kept making demands on him. This fits the fact that he had them driven out of his court immediately. There could also be here an allusion to Pharaoh&#8217;s god <i>Re&#8217;</i>, the sun-deity and head of the pantheon; he would be saying that the power of his god would confront them. </p>
<A NAME="1034"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=690><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;not thus.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1035"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=691><b>tn</b> The word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">haggÿvarim</font>, &#8220;the strong men&#8221;), a word different from the more general one that Pharaoh&#8217;s servants used (v. 7). Pharaoh appears to be conceding, but he is holding hostages. The word &#8220;only&#8221; has been supplied in the translation to indicate this. </p>
<A NAME="1036"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=692><b>tn</b> The suffix on the sign of the accusative refers in a general sense to the idea contained in the preceding clause (see GKC 440-41 §135.<i>p</i>).</p>
<A NAME="1037"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=693><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you are seeking.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1038"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=694><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they&#8221;; the referent (Moses and Aaron) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1039"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=695><b>tn</b> The verb is the Piel preterite, third person masculine singular, meaning &#8220;and he drove them out.&#8221; But &#8220;Pharaoh&#8221; cannot be the subject of the sentence, for &#8220;Pharaoh&#8221; is the object of the preposition. The subject is not specified, and so the verb can be treated as passive.</p>
<A NAME="1040"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=696><b>tn</b> The preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet</font>) is unexpected here. BDB 91 s.v. (the note at the end of the entry) says that in this case it can only be read as &#8220;with the locusts,&#8221; meaning that the locusts were thought to be implicit in Moses&#8217; lifting up of his hand. However, BDB prefers to change the preposition to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lamed</font>).</p>
<A NAME="1041"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=697><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1462;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">esev</font>) normally would indicate cultivated grains, but in this context seems to indicate plants in general.</p>
<A NAME="1042"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=698><b>tn</b> The clause begins <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">va</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adonay </font>[<font face="Scholar">vayhvah</font>], &#8220;Now Yahweh&#8230;.&#8221;). In contrast to a normal sequence, this beginning focuses attention on Yahweh as the subject of the verb.</p>
<A NAME="1043"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=699><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nahag</font>) means &#8220;drive, conduct.&#8221; It is elsewhere used for driving sheep, leading armies, or leading in processions.</p>
<A NAME="1044"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=700><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and all the night.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1045"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=701><b>tn</b> The text does not here use ordinary circumstantial clause constructions; rather, <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the morning was, and the east wind carried the locusts.&#8221; It clearly means &#8220;when it was morning,&#8221; but the style chosen gives a more abrupt beginning to the plague, as if the reader is in the experience &#8211; and at morning, the locusts are there!</p>
<A NAME="1046"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=702><b>tn</b> The verb here is a past perfect, indicting that the locusts had arrived before the day came.</p>
<A NAME="1047"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=703><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;border.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1048"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=704><b>tn</b> This is an interpretive translation. The clause simply has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1461;&#1491; &#1502;&#1456;&#1488;&#1465;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kaved mÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">od</font>), the stative verb with the adverb &#8211; &#8220;it was very heavy.&#8221; The description prepares for the following statement about the uniqueness of this locust infestation.</p>
<A NAME="1049"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=705><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;after them.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1051"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=707><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;eye,&#8221; an unusual expression (see v. 5; Num 22:5, 11).</p>
<A NAME="1052"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=708><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1495;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vattekhshakh</font>, &#8220;and it became dark&#8221;). The idea is that the ground had the color of the swarms of locusts that covered it. </p>
<A NAME="1053"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=709><b>sn</b> The third part of the passage now begins, the confrontation that resulted from the onslaught of the plague. Pharaoh goes a step further here &#8211; he confesses he has sinned and adds a request for forgiveness. But his acknowledgment does not go far enough, for this is not genuine confession. Since his heart was not yet submissive, his confession was vain.</p>
<A NAME="1054"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=710><b>tn</b> The Piel preterite <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1492;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vaymaher</font>) could be translated &#8220;and he hastened,&#8221; but here it is joined with the following infinitive construct to form the hendiadys. &#8220;He hurried to summon&#8221; means &#8220;He summoned quickly.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1055"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=711><b>sn</b> The severity of the plague prompted Pharaoh to confess his sin against Yahweh and them, now in much stronger terms than before. He also wants forgiveness &#8211; but in all probability what he wants is relief from the consequences of his sin. He pretended to convey to Moses that this was it, that he was through sinning, so he asked for forgiveness &#8220;only this time.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1056"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=712><b>sn</b> Pharaoh&#8217;s double emphasis on &#8220;only&#8221; uses two different words and was meant to deceive.

<A NAME="1061"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=717><b>tn</b> The Hebrew name here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1501;&#1470;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">Yam Suf</font>), sometimes rendered &#8220;Reed Sea&#8221; or &#8220;Sea of Reeds.&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;</font> is a collective noun that may have derived from an Egyptian name for papyrus reeds. Many English versions have used &#8220;Red Sea,&#8221; which translates the name that ancient Greeks used: <font face="Greek">ejruqrav qalavssa</font> (<font face="Greektl">eruqra qalassa</font>). </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The name Red Sea is currently applied to the sea west of the Arabian Peninsula. The northern fingers of this body of water extend along the west and east sides of the Sinai Peninsula and are presently called the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Aqaba or the Gulf of Eilat. In ancient times the name applied to a much larger body of water, including the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf (C. Houtman, <i>Exodus</i>,<i> </i>1:109-10). See also Num 14:25; 21:4; Deut 1:40; 2:1; Judg 11:16; 1 Kgs 9:26; Jer 49:21. The sea was deep enough to drown the entire Egyptian army later (and thus no shallow swamp land). God drives the locusts to their death in the water. He will have the same power over Egyptian soldiers, for he raised up this powerful empire for a purpose and soon will drown them in the sea. The message for the Israelites is that God will humble all who refuse to submit.</p>
<A NAME="1062"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=718><b>sn</b> The ninth plague is that darkness fell on all the land &#8211; except on Israel. This plague is comparable to the silence in heaven, just prior to the last and terrible plague (Rev 8:1). Here Yahweh is attacking a core Egyptian religious belief as well as portraying what lay before the Egyptians. Throughout the Bible darkness is the symbol of evil, chaos, and judgment. Blindness is one of its manifestations (see Deut 28:27-29). But the plague here is not blindness, or even spiritual blindness, but an awesome darkness from outside (see Joel 2:2; Zeph 1:15). It is particularly significant in that Egypt&#8217;s high god was the Sun God. Lord Sun was now being shut down by Lord Yahweh. If Egypt would not let Israel go to worship their God, then Egypt&#8217;s god would be darkness. The structure is familiar: the plague, now unannounced (21-23), and then the confrontation with Pharaoh (24-27).</p>

<A NAME="1064"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=720><b>sn</b> The verb form is the jussive with the sequential <font face="Scholar">vav</font> &#8211; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1460;&#1497;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497; &#1495;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vihi khoshekh</font>). B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 286) notes this as the only instance where Scripture says, &#8220;Let there be darkness&#8221; (although it is subordinated as a purpose clause; cf. Gen 1:3). Isa 45:7 alluded to this by saying, &#8220;who created light and darkness.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1065"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=721><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mush</font>) means &#8220;to feel.&#8221; The literal rendering would be &#8220;so that one may feel darkness.&#8221; The image portrays an oppressive darkness; it was sufficiently thick to possess the appearance of substance, although it was just air (B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 286). </p>
<A NAME="1066"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=722><b>tn</b> The construction is a variation of the superlative genitive: a substantive in the construct state is connected to a noun with the same meaning (see GKC 431 §133.<i>i</i>).</p>
<A NAME="1067"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=723><b>sn</b> S. R. Driver says, &#8220;The darkness was no doubt occasioned really by a <i>sand-storm</i>, produced by the hot electrical wind&#8230;which blows in intermittently&#8230;&#8221; (<i>Exodus</i>, 82, 83). This is another application of the antisupernatural approach to these texts. The text, however, is probably describing something that was not a seasonal wind, or Pharaoh would not have been intimidated. If it coincided with that season, then what is described here is so different and so powerful that the Egyptians would have known the difference easily. Pharaoh here would have had to have been impressed that this was something very abnormal, and that his god was powerless. Besides, there was light in all the dwellings of the Israelites. </p>
<A NAME="1068"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=724><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a man&#8230;his brother.&#8221;</p>

Pharaoh will now let all the people go, but he intends to detain the cattle to secure their return. </p>
<A NAME="1071"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=727><b>tn</b> B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 287) shows that the intent of Moses in using <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gam</font>) is to make an emphatic rhetorical question. He cites other samples of the usage in Num 22:33; 1 Sam 17:36; 2 Sam 12:14, and others. The point is that if Pharaoh told them to go and serve Yahweh, they had to have animals to sacrifice. If Pharaoh was holding the animals back, he would have to make some provision.</p>

<A NAME="1074"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=730><b>tn</b> This is the obligatory imperfect nuance. They were obliged to take the animals if they were going to sacrifice, but more than that, since they were not coming back, they had to take everything.</p>
