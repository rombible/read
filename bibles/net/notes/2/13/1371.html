<A NAME="1371"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=941><b>tn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1458;&#1502;&#1467;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khamushim</font>) is placed first for emphasis; it forms a circumstantial clause, explaining how they went up. Unfortunately, it is a rare word with uncertain meaning. Most translations have something to do with &#8220;in battle array&#8221; or &#8220;prepared to fight&#8221; if need be (cf. Josh 1:14; 4:12). The Targum took it as &#8220;armed with weapons.&#8221; The LXX had &#8220;in the fifth generation.&#8221; Some have opted for &#8220;in five divisions.&#8221;</p>
