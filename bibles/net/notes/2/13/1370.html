<A NAME="1370"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=940><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1501;&#1470;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">Yam Suf</font>) cannot be a genitive (&#8220;wilderness of the Red Sea&#8221;) because it follows a noun that is not in construct; instead, it must be an adverbial accusative, unless it is simply joined by apposition to &#8220;the wilderness&#8221; &#8211; the way to the wilderness [and] to the Red Sea (B. S. Childs, <i>Exodus</i> [OTL], 217).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The translation of this name as &#8220;Red Sea&#8221; comes from the sea&#8217;s Greek name in the LXX and elsewhere. The Red Sea on today&#8217;s maps is farther south, below the Sinai Peninsula. But the title Red Sea in ancient times may very well have covered both the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Aqaba (see Deut 1:1; 1 Kgs 9:26). The name &#8220;Sea of Reeds&#8221; in various English versions (usually in the form of a marginal note) and commentaries reflects the meaning of the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;</font> a word for reedy water plants (Exod 2:3, 5; Isa 19:6; Jonah 2:6 [Eng. v. 5]) that may have a connection with an Egyptian word used for papyrus and other marsh plants. On this basis some have taken the term Yam Suph as perhaps referring to Lake Menzaleh or Lake Ballah, which have abundant reeds, north of the extension of the Red Sea on the western side of Sinai. Whatever exact body of water is meant, it was not merely a marshy swamp that the people waded through, but a body of water large enough to make passage impossible without divine intervention, and deep enough to drown the Egyptian army. Lake Menzaleh has always been deep enough to preclude passage on foot (E. H. Merrill, <i>Kingdom of Priests</i>, 66). Among the many sources dealing with the geography, see B. F. Batto, &#8220;The Reed Sea: Requiescat in Pace,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 102 (1983): 27-35; M. Waxman, &#8220;I Miss the Red Sea,&#8221; <i>Conservative Judaism</i> 18 (1963): 35-44; G. Coats, &#8220;The Sea Tradition in the Wilderness Theme: A Review,&#8221; <i>JSOT</i> 12 (1979): 2-8; and K. A. Kitchen, <i>On the Reliability of the Old Testament</i>,<i> </i>261-63.</p>
