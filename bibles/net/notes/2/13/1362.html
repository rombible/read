<A NAME="1362"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=932><b>sn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhah</font>, &#8220;to lead&#8221;) is a fairly common word in the Bible for God&#8217;s leading of his people (as in Ps 23:3 for leading in the paths of righteousness). This passage illustrates what others affirm, that God leads his people in a way that is for their own good. There were shorter routes to take, but the people were not ready for them.</p>
