<A NAME="1340"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=910><b>tn</b> The unusual choice of words in this passage reflects the connection with the deliverance of the firstborn in the exodus when the Lord passed over the Israelites (12:12, 23). Here the Law said, &#8220;you will cause to pass over (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;</font>, <font face="Scholar">vÿha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avarta</font>) to Yahweh.&#8221; The Hiphil perfect with the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) provides the main clause after the temporal clauses. Yahweh here claimed the firstborn as his own. The remarkable thing about this is that Yahweh did not keep the firstborn that was dedicated to him, but allowed the child to be redeemed by his father. It was an acknowledgment that the life of the child belonged to God as the one redeemed from death, and that the child represented the family. Thus, the observance referred to the dedication of all the redeemed to God.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> It was once assumed by some scholars that child sacrifice lay behind this text in the earlier days, but that the priests and prophets removed those themes. Apart from the fact that there is absolutely no evidence for anything like that, the Law forbade child sacrifice, and always used child sacrifice as the sample of what not to do in conformity with the pagans (e.g., Deut 12:31). Besides, how absurd would it be for Yahweh to redeem the firstborn from death and then ask Israel to kill them. See further B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 371.</p>
