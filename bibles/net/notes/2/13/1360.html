<A NAME="1360"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=930><b>sn</b> This short section (vv. 17-22) marks the beginning of the journey of the Israelites toward the sea and Sinai. The emphasis here is on the leading of Yahweh &#8211; but this leading is manifested in a unique, supernatural way &#8211; unlikely to be repeated with these phenomena. Although a primary application of such a passage would be difficult, the general principle is clear: God, by his clear revelation, leads his people to the fulfillment of the promise. This section has three short parts: the leading to the sea (17-18), the bones of Joseph (19), and the leading by the cloud and pillar (20-22).</p>
