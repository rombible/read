The owner might not redeem the donkey, but if he did not, he could not keep it, he had to kill it by breaking its neck (so either a lamb for it, or the donkey itself). The donkey could not be killed by shedding blood because that would make it a sacrifice, and that was not possible with this kind of animal. See G. Brin, &#8220;The Firstling of Unclean Animals,&#8221; <i>JQR</i> 68 (1977): 1-15.</p>
