<A NAME="1364"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=934><b>sn</b> The term <i>Philistines</i> has been viewed by modern scholarship as an anachronism, since the Philistines were not believed to have settled in the region until the reign of Rameses III (in which case the term would not fit either the early or the late view of the exodus). But the OT clearly refers to Philistines in the days of the patriarchs. The people there in the earlier period may have been Semites, judging from their names, or they may have been migrants from Crete in the early time. The Philistines after the exodus were of Greek origin. The danger of warfare at this time was clearly with Canaanitish tribes. For further details, see K. A. Kitchen, &#8220;The Philistines,&#8221; <i>Peoples of Old Testament Times</i>, 53-54; J. M. Grintz, &#8220;The Immigration of the First Philistines in the Inscriptions,&#8221; <i>Tarbiz</i> 17 (1945): 32-42, and <i>Tarbiz</i> 19 (1947): 64; and E. Hindson, <i>The Philistines and the Old Testament</i> (Grand Rapids: Baker, 1970), 39-59.</p>
