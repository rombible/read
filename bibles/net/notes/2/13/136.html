The use of this form in place of the imperative (also found in the Decalogue with the Sabbath instruction) stresses the basic meaning of the root word, everything involved with remembering (emphatic imperative, according to GKC 346 §113.<i>bb</i>).

Both sections contain commands based on the mighty deliverance as reminders of the deliverance. &#8220;With a mighty hand&#8221; occurs in vv. 3, 9, 14, 16. An explanation to the son is found in vv. 8 and 14. The emphases &#8220;sign on your hand&#8221; and &#8220;between your eyes&#8221; are part of the conclusions to both halves (vv. 9, 16).</p>
