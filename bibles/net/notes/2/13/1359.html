<A NAME="1359"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=929><b>sn</b> The pattern of the passage now emerges more clearly; it concerns the grateful debt of the redeemed. In the first part eating the unleavened bread recalls the night of deliverance in Egypt, and it calls for purity. In the second part the dedication of the firstborn was an acknowledgment of the deliverance of the firstborn from bondage. They were to remember the deliverance and choose purity; they were to remember the deliverance and choose dedication. The NT will also say, &#8220;You are not your own, for you were bought with a price, therefore, glorify God&#8221; (1 Cor 6:20). Here too the truths of God&#8217;s great redemption must be learned well and retained well from generation to generation.</p>
