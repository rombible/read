<A NAME="131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=871><b>sn</b> This next section seems a little confusing at first glance: vv. 1 and 2 call for the dedication of the firstborn, then vv. 3-10 instruct concerning the ritual of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, and then vv. 11-16 return to the firstborn. B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 360) explains that vv. 3-16 contain a sermon, in which Moses &#8220;began his speech by reminding the people of the events which had just occurred and how they would be recalled by them in the future,&#8221; and then he explained the rulings that went along with it. So the first two verses state the core of the sermon, a new command calling for the redeemed (firstborn) to be sanctified. The second portion stresses that God requires the redeemed to remember their redemption by purifying themselves (3-10). The third section (11-16) develops the theme of dedication to Yahweh. The point is that in view of God&#8217;s mighty redemption, the redeemed (represented by the firstborn) must be set apart for Yahweh&#8217;s service.</p>
