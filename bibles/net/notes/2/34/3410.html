<A NAME="3410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2240><b>tn</b> Here is one of the clearest examples of what it means &#8220;to call on the name of the Lord,&#8221; as that clause has been translated traditionally (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488; &#1489;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1501; &#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">vayyiqra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> vÿshem yÿhvah</font>). It seems more likely that it means &#8220;to make proclamation of Yahweh by name.&#8221; Yahweh came down and made a proclamation &#8211; and the next verses give the content of what he said. This cannot be prayer or praise; it is a proclamation of the nature or attributes of God (which is what his &#8220;name&#8221; means throughout the Bible). Attempts to make Moses the subject of the verb are awkward, for the verb is repeated in v. 6 with Yahweh clearly doing the proclaiming.</p>
