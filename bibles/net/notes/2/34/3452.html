<A NAME="3452"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=2282><b>tn</b> Here the divine name reads in Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1465;&#1503; &#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adon yÿhvah</font>), which if rendered according to the traditional scheme of &#8220;<sc>Lord&#8221; for &#8220;Yahweh&#8221; would result in &#8220;Lord <sc>Lord.&#8221; A number of English versions therefore render this phrase &#8220;Lord <sc>God,&#8221; and that convention has been followed here.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The title &#8220;Lord&#8221; is included here before the divine name (translated &#8220;<sc>God&#8221; here; see Exod 23:17), perhaps to form a contrast with Baal (which means &#8220;lord&#8221; as well) and to show the sovereignty of Yahweh. But the distinct designation &#8220;the God of Israel&#8221; is certainly the point of the renewed covenant relationship. </p>
