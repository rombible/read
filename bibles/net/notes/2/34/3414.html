<A NAME="3414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2244><b>sn</b> These two words (&#8220;loyal love&#8221; and &#8220;truth&#8221;) are often found together, occasionally in a hendiadys construction. If that is the interpretation here, then it means &#8220;faithful covenant love.&#8221; Even if they are left separate, they are dual elements of a single quality. The first word is God&#8217;s faithful covenant love; the second word is God&#8217;s reliability and faithfulness. </p>
