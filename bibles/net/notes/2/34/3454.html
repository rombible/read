<A NAME="3454"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=2284><b>sn</b> The verb &#8220;covet&#8221; means more than desire; it means that some action will be taken to try to acquire the land that is being coveted. It is one thing to envy someone for their land; it is another to be consumed by the desire that stops at nothing to get it (it, not something like it).</p>
