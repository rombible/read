<A NAME="3433"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2263><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zanah</font>) means &#8220;to play the prostitute; to commit whoredom; to be a harlot&#8221; or something similar. It is used here and elsewhere in the Bible for departing from pure religion and engaging in pagan religion. The use of the word in this figurative sense is fitting, because the relationship between God and his people is pictured as a marriage, and to be unfaithful to it was a sin. This is also why God is described as a &#8220;jealous&#8221; or &#8220;impassioned&#8221; God. The figure may not be merely a metaphorical use, but perhaps a metonymy, since there actually was sexual immorality at the Canaanite altars and poles.</p>
