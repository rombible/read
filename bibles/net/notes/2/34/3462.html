<A NAME="3462"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=2292><b>sn</b> Now, at the culmination of the renewing of the covenant, comes the account of Moses&#8217; shining face. It is important to read this in its context first, holding off on the connection to Paul&#8217;s discussion in 2 Corinthians. There is a delicate balance here in Exodus. On the one hand Moses&#8217; shining face served to authenticate the message, but on the other hand Moses prevented the people from seeing more than they could handle. The subject matter in the OT, then, is how to authenticate the message. The section again can be subdivided into three points that develop the whole idea: I. The one who spends time with God reflects his glory (29-30). It will not always be as Moses; rather, the glory of the <sc>Lord is reflected differently today, but nonetheless reflected. II. The glory of Yahweh authenticates the message (31-32). III. The authentication of the message must be used cautiously with the weak and immature (33-35).</p>
