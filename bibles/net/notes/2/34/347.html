<A NAME="347"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2237><b>sn</b> Deuteronomy says that Moses was also to make an ark of acacia wood before the tablets, apparently to put the tablets in until the sanctuary was built. But this ark may not have been the ark built later; or, it might be the wood box, but Bezalel still had to do all the golden work with it. </p>
