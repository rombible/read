<A NAME="3468"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=2298><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qaran</font>) is derived from the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qeren</font>) in the sense of a &#8220;ray of light&#8221; (see Hab 3:4). Something of the divine glory remained with Moses. The Greek translation of Aquila and the Latin Vulgate convey the idea that he had horns, the primary meaning of the word from which this word is derived. Some have tried to defend this, saying that the glory appeared like horns or that Moses covered his face with a mask adorned with horns. But in the text the subject of the verb is the skin of Moses&#8217; face (see U. Cassuto, <i>Exodus</i>, 449).</p>
