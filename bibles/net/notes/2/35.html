<A NAME="351"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2309><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to do them&#8221;; this is somewhat redundant in English and has been simplified in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="352"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2310><b>tn</b> This is an adverbial accusative of time.</p>
<A NAME="353"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2311><b>tn</b> The word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1465;&#1491;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qodesh</font>, &#8220;holiness&#8221;). S. R. Driver suggests that the word was transposed, and the line should read: &#8220;a sabbath of entire rest, holy to Jehovah&#8221; (<i>Exodus</i>, 379). But the word may simply be taken as a substitution for &#8220;holy day.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="354"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2312><b>sn</b> See on this H. Routtenberg, &#8220;The Laws of the Sabbath: Biblical Sources,&#8221; <i>Dor le Dor</i> 6 (1977): 41-43, 99-101, 153-55, 204-6; G. Robinson, &#8220;The Idea of Rest in the Old Testament and the Search for the Basic Character of Sabbath,&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 92 (1980): 32-43.</p>
<A NAME="355"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2313><b>sn</b> Kindling a fire receives special attention here because the people thought that kindling a fire was not work, but only a preparation for some kind of work. The Law makes sure that this too was not done. But see also G. Robinson, &#8220;The Prohibition of Strange Fire in Ancient Israel: A Look at the Case of Gathering Wood and Kindling Fire on the Sabbath,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 28 (1978): 301-17.</p>
<A NAME="356"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2314><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;dwelling places&#8221;; KJV, ASV &#8220;habitations.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="357"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2315><b>sn</b> The presence of these three verses in this place has raised all kinds of questions. It may be that after the renewal of the covenant the people needed a reminder to obey God, and obeying the sign of the covenant was the starting point. But there is more to it than this; it is part of the narrative design of the book. It is the artistic design that puts the filling of the Spirit section (31:1-11) prior to the Sabbath laws (31:12-18) before the idolatry section, and then after the renewal there is the Sabbath reminder (35:1-3) before the filling of the Spirit material (35:4-36:7). </p>
<A NAME="358"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2316><b>sn</b> The book now turns to record how all the work of the sanctuary was done. This next unit picks up on the ideas in Exod 31:1-11. But it adds several features. The first part is the instruction of God for all people to give willingly (35:4-19); the next section tells how the faithful brought an offering for the service of the tabernacle (35:20-29); the next section tells how God set some apart with special gifts (35:30-35), and finally, the narrative reports how the faithful people of God enthusiastically began the work (36:1-7). </p>
<A NAME="359"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2317><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from with you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2318><b>tn</b> &#8220;Heart&#8221; is a genitive of specification, clarifying in what way they might be &#8220;willing.&#8221; The heart refers to their will, their choices.</p>
<A NAME="3511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2319><b>tn</b> The verb has a suffix that is the direct object, but the suffixed object is qualified by the second accusative: &#8220;let him bring it, an offering.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2320><b>tn</b> The phrase is literally &#8220;the offering of Yahweh&#8221;; it could be a simple possessive, &#8220;Yahweh&#8217;s offering,&#8221; but a genitive that indicates the indirect object is more appropriate.</p>
<A NAME="3513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2321><b>tn</b> See the note on this phrase in Exod 25:5.</p>
<A NAME="3514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2322><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and stones.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2323><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;filling.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2324><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;wise of heart&#8221;; here also &#8220;heart&#8221; would be a genitive of specification, showing that there were those who could make skillful decisions. </p>
<A NAME="3517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2325><b>tn</b> In Hebrew style all these items are typically connected with a <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) conjunction, but English typically uses commas except between the last two items in a series or between items in a series that are somehow related to one another. The present translation follows contemporary English style in lists such as this.</p>
<A NAME="3518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2326><b>tn</b> &#8220;for&#8221; has been supplied.</p>
<A NAME="3519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2327><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;man.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2328><b>tn</b> The verb means &#8220;lift up, bear, carry.&#8221; Here the subject is &#8220;heart&#8221; or will, and so the expression describes one moved within to act. </p>
<A NAME="3521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2329><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his spirit made him willing.&#8221; The verb is used in Scripture for the freewill offering that people brought (Lev 7). </p>
<A NAME="3522"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2330><b>tn</b> Literally &#8220;the garments of holiness,&#8221; the genitive is the attributive genitive, marking out what type of garments these were.</p>
<A NAME="3523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2331><b>tn</b> The expression in Hebrew is &#8220;men on/after the women,&#8221; meaning men with women, to ensure that it was clear that the preceding verse did not mean only men. B. Jacob takes it further, saying that the men came after the women because the latter had taken the initiative (<i>Exodus</i>, 1017).</p>
<A NAME="3524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2332><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all gold utensils.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2333><b>tn</b> The verb could be translated &#8220;offered,&#8221; but it is cognate with the following noun that is the wave offering. This sentence underscores the freewill nature of the offerings people made. The word &#8220;came&#8221; is supplied from v. 21 and v. 22.</p>
<A NAME="3526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2334><b>tn</b> The text uses a relative clause with a resumptive pronoun for this: &#8220;who was found with him,&#8221; meaning &#8220;with whom was found.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3527"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2335><b>tn</b> The conjunction in this verse is translated &#8220;or&#8221; because the sentence does not intend to say that each person had all these things. They brought what they had. </p>
<A NAME="3528"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2336><b>tn</b> See the note on this phrase in Exod 25:5.</p>
<A NAME="3529"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2337><b>tn</b> Here &#8220;them&#8221; has been supplied.</p>
<A NAME="3530"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2338><b>tn</b> This translation takes &#8220;offering&#8221; as an adverbial accusative explaining the form or purpose of their bringing things. It could also be rendered as the direct object, but that would seem to repeat without much difference what had just been said.</p>
<A NAME="3531"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2339><b>sn</b> U. Cassuto notes that the expression &#8220;with whom was found&#8221; does not rule out the idea that these folks went out and cut down acacia trees (<i>Exodus</i>, 458). It is unlikely that they had much wood in their tents. </p>
<A NAME="3532"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2340><b>tn</b> Here &#8220;it&#8221; has been supplied.</p>
<A NAME="3533"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2341><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;wisdom of heart,&#8221; which means that they were skilled and could make all the right choices about the work.</p>
<A NAME="3534"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2342><b>tn</b> The text simply uses a prepositional phrase, &#8220;with/in wisdom.&#8221; It seems to be qualifying &#8220;the women&#8221; as the relative clause is.</p>
<A NAME="3535"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2343><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and stones of the filling.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3536"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2344><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;by the hand of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3537"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2345><b>tn</b> Here &#8220;them&#8221; has been supplied.</p>
