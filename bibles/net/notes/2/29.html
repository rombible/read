<A NAME="291"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1912><b>sn</b> Chap. 29 is a rather long, involved discussion of the consecration of Aaron the priest. It is similar to the ordination service in Lev 8. In fact, the execution of what is instructed here is narrated there. But these instructions must have been formulated after or in conjunction with Lev 1-7, for they presuppose a knowledge of the sacrifices. The bulk of the chapter is the consecration of the priests: 1-35. It has the preparation (1-3), washing (4), investiture and anointing (5-9), sin offering (10-14), burnt offering (15-18), installation peace offering (19-26, 31-34), other offerings&#8217; rulings (27-30), and the duration of the ritual (35). Then there is the consecration of the altar (36-37), and the oblations (38-46). There are many possibilities for the study and exposition of this material. The whole chapter is the consecration of tabernacle, altar, people, and most of all the priests. God was beginning the holy operations with sacral ritual. So the overall message would be: Everyone who ministers, everyone who worships, and everything they use in the presence of Yahweh, must be set apart to God by the cleansing, enabling, and sanctifying work of God.</p>
<A NAME="292"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1913><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the thing.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="293"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1914><b>tn</b> Literally: &#8220;take one bull, a &#8216;son&#8217; of the herd.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="294"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1915><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tamim</font>) means &#8220;perfect.&#8221; The animals could not have diseases or be crippled or blind (see Mal 1). The requirement was designed to ensure that the people would give the best they had to Yahweh. The typology pointed to the sinless Messiah who would fulfill all these sacrifices in his one sacrifice on the cross. </p>
<A NAME="295"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1916><b>sn</b> This will be for the <font face="Scholar">minkhah</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font>) offering (Lev 2), which was to accompany the animal sacrifices. </p>
<A NAME="296"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1917><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;anointed&#8221; (KJV, ASV).</p>
<A NAME="297"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1918><b>tn</b> The &#8220;fine flour&#8221; is here an adverbial accusative, explaining the material from which these items were made. The flour is to be finely sifted, and from the wheat, not the barley, which was often the material used by the poor. Fine flour, no leaven, and perfect animals, without blemishes, were to be gathered for this service. </p>
<A NAME="298"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1919><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qarav</font>) in the Hiphil means to &#8220;bring near&#8221; to the altar, or, to offer something to God. These gifts will, therefore, be offered to him for the service of this ritual.</p>
<A NAME="299"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1920><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and with.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2910"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1921><b>tn</b> Here too the verb is Hiphil (now imperfect) meaning &#8220;bring near&#8221; the altar. The choice of this verb indicates that they were not merely being brought near, but that they were being formally presented to Yahweh as the offerings were.</p>
<A NAME="2911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1922><b>sn</b> This is the washing referred to in Lev 8:6. This is a complete washing, not just of the hands and feet that would follow in the course of service. It had to serve as a symbolic ritual cleansing or purifying as the initial stage in the consecration. The imagery of washing will be used in the NT for regeneration (Titus 3:5). </p>
<A NAME="2912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1923><b>tn</b> The Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lavash</font>, &#8220;to clothe&#8221;) will take double accusatives; so the sign of the accusative is with Aaron, and then with the articles of clothing. The translation will have to treat Aaron as the direct object and the articles as indirect objects, because Aaron receives the prominence in the verse &#8211; you will clothe Aaron.</p>
<A NAME="2913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1924><b>tn</b> The verb used in this last clause is a denominative verb from the word for ephod. And so &#8220;ephod the ephod on him&#8221; means &#8220;fasten as an ephod the ephod on him&#8221; (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 316).</p>
<A NAME="2914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1925><b>sn</b> This term does not appear in chap. 28, but it can only refer to the plate with the inscription on it that was tied to the turban. Here it is called a &#8220;holy diadem,&#8221; a diadem that is distinctly set apart for this service. All the clothing was described as &#8220;holy garments,&#8221; and so they were all meant to mark the separation of the priests to this holy service. The items of clothing were each intended for different aspects of ministry, and so this step in the consecration was designed to symbolize being set apart for those duties, or, prepared (gifted) to perform the ministry. </p>
<A NAME="2915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1926><b>sn</b> The act of anointing was meant to set him apart for this holy service within the house of Yahweh. The psalms indicate that no oil was spared in this ritual, for it ran down his beard and to the hem of his garment. Oil of anointing was used for all major offices (giving the label with the passive adjective &#8220;<font face="Scholar">mashiah</font>&#8221; (or &#8220;messiah&#8221;) to anyone anointed. In the further revelation of Scripture, the oil came to signify the enablement as well as the setting apart, and often the Holy Spirit came on the person at the anointing with oil. The olive oil was a symbol of the Spirit in the OT as well (Zech 4:4-6). And in the NT &#8220;anointing&#8221; signifies empowerment by the Holy Spirit for service. </p>
<A NAME="2916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1927><b>tc</b> Hebrew has both the objective pronoun &#8220;them&#8221; and the names &#8220;Aaron and his sons.&#8221; Neither the LXX nor Leviticus 8:13 has &#8220;Aaron and his sons,&#8221; suggesting that this may have been a later gloss in the text.</p>
<A NAME="2917"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1928><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and you will fill the hand&#8221; and so &#8220;consecrate&#8221; or &#8220;ordain.&#8221; The verb draws together the individual acts of the process.</p>
<A NAME="2918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1929><b>tn</b> The verb is singular, agreeing with the first of the compound subject &#8211; Aaron.</p>
<A NAME="2919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1930><b>sn</b> The details of these offerings have to be determined from a careful study of Leviticus. There is a good deal of debate over the meaning of laying hands on the animals. At the very least it identifies the animal formally as their sacrifice. But it may very well indicate that the animal is a substitute for them as well, given the nature and the effect of the sacrifices. </p>
<A NAME="2920"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1931><b>sn</b> This act seems to have signified the efficacious nature of the blood, since the horns represented power. This is part of the ritual of the sin offering for laity, because before the priests become priests they are treated as laity. The offering is better described as a purification offering rather than a sin offering, because it was offered, according to Leviticus, for both sins and impurities. Moreover, it was offered primarily to purify the sanctuary so that the once-defiled or sinful person could enter (see J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus</i> [AB]). </p>
<A NAME="2921"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1932><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;rest of&#8221; has been supplied in the translation for clarification.</p>
<A NAME="2922"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1933><b>tn</b> S. R. Driver suggests that this is the appendix or an appendix, both here and in v. 22 (<i>Exodus</i>, 320). &#8220;The surplus, the appendage of liver, found with cow, sheep, or goat, but not with humans: <i>Lobus caudatus&#8221;</i> (<i>HALOT</i> 453 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1465;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514;</font>).</p>
<A NAME="2923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1934><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;turn [them] into sweet smoke&#8221; since the word is used for burning incense.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The giving of the visceral organs and the fat has received various explanations. The fat represented the best, and the best was to go to God. If the animal is a substitute, then the visceral organs represent the will of the worshiper in an act of surrender to God.</p>
<A NAME="2924"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1935><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;burn with fire.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1936><b>sn</b> This is to be done because there is no priesthood yet. Once they are installed, then the sin/purification offering is to be eaten by the officiating priests as a sign that the offering was received. But priests could not consume their own sin offering. </p>
<A NAME="2926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1937><b>sn</b> There were two kinds of &#8220;purification offering,&#8221; those made with confession for sin and those made without. The title needs to cover both of them, and if it is called in the traditional way &#8220;the sin offering,&#8221; that will convey that when people offered it for skin diseases, menstruation, or having babies, they had sinned. That was not the case. Moreover, it is usual to translate the names of the sacrifices by what they do more than what they cover &#8211; so peace offering, reparation offering, and purification offering. </p>
<A NAME="2927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1938><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;turn to sweet smoke.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2928"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1939><b>sn</b> According to Lev 1 the burnt offering (often called whole burnt offering, except that the skins were usually given to the priests for income) was an atoning sacrifice. By consuming the entire animal, God was indicating that he had completely accepted the worshiper, and as it was a sweet smelling fire sacrifice, he was indicating that he was pleased to accept it. By offering the entire animal, the worshiper was indicating on his part a complete surrender to God.</p>
<A NAME="2929"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1940><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">isheh</font>) has traditionally been translated &#8220;an offering made with fire&#8221; or the like, because it appears so obviously connected with fire. But further evidence from Ugaritic suggests that it might only mean &#8220;a gift&#8221; (see Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 1-16</i>, 161).</p>
<A NAME="2930"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1941><b>sn</b> These sections show that the priest had to be purified or cleansed from defilement of sin and also be atoned for and accepted by the <sc>Lord through the blood of the sacrifice. The principles from these two sacrifices should be basic to anyone seeking to serve God.</p>
<A NAME="2931"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1942><b>sn</b> By this ritual the priests were set apart completely to the service of God. The ear represented the organ of hearing (as in &#8220;ears you have dug&#8221; in Ps 40 or &#8220;awakens my ear&#8221; in Isa 50), and this had to be set apart to God so that they could hear the Word of God. The thumb and the hand represented the instrument to be used for all ministry, and so everything that they &#8220;put their hand to&#8221; had to be dedicated to God and appropriate for his service. The toe set the foot apart to God, meaning that the walk of the priest had to be consecrated &#8211; where he went, how he conducted himself, what life he lived, all belonged to God now. </p>
<A NAME="2932"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1943><b>tn</b> Here &#8220;it&#8221; has been supplied.</p>
<A NAME="2933"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1944><b>tn</b> The verb in this instance is Qal and not Piel, &#8220;to be holy&#8221; rather than &#8220;sanctify.&#8221; The result of all this ritual is that Aaron and his sons will be set aside and distinct in their life and their service. </p>
<A NAME="2934"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1945><b>tn</b> S. R. Driver suggests that this is the appendix or an appendix, both here and in v. 13 (<i>Exodus</i>, 320). &#8220;The surplus, the appendage of liver, found with cow, sheep, or goat, but not with humans: <i>Lobus caudatus&#8221;</i> (<i>HALOT</i> 453 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1465;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514;</font>).</p>
<A NAME="2935"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1946><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;filling.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2936"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1947><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the whole&#8221; or &#8220;the all.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2937"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1948><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;palms.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2938"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1949><b>tn</b> The &#8220;wave offering&#8221; is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tÿnufah</font>); it is, of course, cognate with the verb, but an adverbial accusative rather than the direct object. In Lev 23 this seems to be a sacrificial gesture of things that are for the priests &#8211; but they present them first to Yahweh and then receive them back from him. So the waving is not side to side, but forward to Yahweh and then back to the priest. Here it is just an induction into that routine, since this is the ordination of the priests and the gifts are not yet theirs. So this will all be burned on the altar.</p>
<A NAME="2939"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1950><b>tn</b> &#8220;turn to sweet smoke.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2940"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1951><b>tn</b> &#8220;them&#8221; has been supplied.</p>
<A NAME="2941"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1952><b>sn</b> These are the two special priestly offerings: the wave offering (from the verb &#8220;to wave&#8221;) and the &#8220;presentation offering&#8221; (older English: heave offering; from a verb &#8220;to be high,&#8221; in Hiphil meaning &#8220;to lift up,&#8221; an item separated from the offering, a contribution). The two are then clarified with two corresponding relative clauses containing two Hophals: &#8220;which was waved and which was presented.&#8221; In making sacrifices, the breast and the thigh belong to the priests. </p>
<A NAME="2942"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1953><b>tn</b> The construction is an infinitive construct with a <font face="Scholar">lamed</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font>) preposition. The form simply means &#8220;for anointing,&#8221; but it serves to express the purpose or result of their inheriting the sacred garments.</p>
<A NAME="2943"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1954><b>tn</b> This form is a Piel infinitive construct with a <font face="Scholar">lamed</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font>) preposition. It literally reads &#8220;for filling the hands,&#8221; the idiom used throughout this chapter for ordination or installation. Here too it has a parallel use of purpose or result. </p>
<A NAME="2944"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1955><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;after him&#8221;; NCV, NLT &#8220;after Aaron.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2945"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1956><b>tn</b> The text just has the relative pronoun and the imperfect tense. It could be translated &#8220;who comes/enters.&#8221; But the context seems to indicate that this would be when he first comes to the tent to begin his tenure as High Priest, and so a temporal clause makes this clear. &#8220;First&#8221; has been supplied.</p>
<A NAME="2946"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1957><b>tn</b> &#8220;Seven days&#8221; is an adverbial accusative of time. The ritual of ordination is to be repeated for seven days, and so they are to remain there in the court in full dress.</p>
<A NAME="2947"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1958><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;boil&#8221; (see Lev 8:31).</p>
<A NAME="2948"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1959><b>sn</b> The &#8220;holy place&#8221; must be in the courtyard of the sanctuary. Lev 8:31 says it is to be cooked at the entrance of the tent of meeting. Here it says it will be eaten there as well. This, then, becomes a communion sacrifice, a peace offering which was a shared meal. Eating a communal meal in a holy place was meant to signify that the worshipers and the priests were at peace with God. </p>
<A NAME="2949"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1960><b>tn</b> The clause is a relative clause modifying &#8220;those things,&#8221; the direct object of the verb &#8220;eat.&#8221; The relative clause has a resumptive pronoun: &#8220;which atonement was made by them&#8221; becomes &#8220;by which atonement was made.&#8221; The verb is a Pual<i> </i>perfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kipper</font>, &#8220;to expiate, atone, pacify&#8221;). </p>
<A NAME="2950"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1961><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word is &#8220;stranger, alien&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">zar</font>). But in this context it means anyone who is not a priest (see S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 324).</p>
<A NAME="2951"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1962><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;ordination offerings&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;fillings&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="2952"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=1963><b>tn</b> The verb in the conditional clause is a Niphal imperfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatar</font>); this verb is repeated in the next clause (as a Niphal participle) as the direct object of the verb &#8220;you will burn&#8221; (a Qal<i> </i>perfect with a <i>vav</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>] consecutive to form the instruction).</p>
<A NAME="2953"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1964><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;burn with fire.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2954"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1965><b>tn</b> The verb is a Niphal<i> </i>imperfect negated. It expresses the prohibition against eating this, but in the passive voice: &#8220;it will not be eaten,&#8221; or stronger, &#8220;it must not be eaten.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2955"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=1966><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;you will fill their hand.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2956"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=1967><b>tn</b> The &#8220;seven days&#8221; is the adverbial accusative explaining that the ritual of the filling should continue daily for a week. Leviticus makes it clear that they are not to leave the sanctuary. </p>
<A NAME="2957"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=1968><b>tn</b> The construction uses a genitive: &#8220;a bull of the sin offering,&#8221; which means, a bull that is designated for a sin (or better, purification) offering.</p>
<A NAME="2958"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=1969><b>sn</b> It is difficult to understand how this verse is to be harmonized with the other passages. The ceremony in the earlier passages deals with atonement made for the priests, for people. But here it is the altar that is being sanctified. The &#8220;sin [purification] offering&#8221; seems to be for purification of the sanctuary and altar to receive people in their worship. </p>
<A NAME="2959"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=1970><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1496;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;&#1514;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿhitte</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ta</font>), a Piel perfect of the word usually translated &#8220;to sin.&#8221; Here it may be interpreted as a privative Piel (as in Ps 51:7 [9]), with the sense of &#8220;un-sin&#8221; or &#8220;remove sin.&#8221; It could also be interpreted as related to the word for &#8220;sin offering,&#8221; and so be a denominative verb. It means &#8220;to purify, cleanse.&#8221; The Hebrews understood that sin and contamination could corrupt and pollute even things, and so they had to be purged.</p>
<A NAME="2960"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=1971><b>tn</b> The construction is a Piel<i> </i>infinitive construct in an adverbial clause. The preposition <i>bet</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;</font>) that begins the clause could be taken as a temporal preposition, but in this context it seems to express the means by which the altar was purged of contamination &#8211; &#8220;in your making atonement&#8221; is &#8220;by [your] making atonement.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2961"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=1972><b>tn</b> Once again this is an adverbial accusative of time. Each day for seven days the ritual at the altar is to be followed.</p>
<A NAME="2962"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=1973><b>tn</b> The construction is the superlative genitive: &#8220;holy of holies,&#8221; or &#8220;most holy.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2963"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=1974><b>sn</b> This line states an unusual principle, meant to preserve the sanctity of the altar. S. R. Driver explains it this way (<i>Exodus</i>, 325): If anything comes in contact with the altar, it becomes holy and must remain in the sanctuary for Yahweh&#8217;s use. If a person touches the altar, he likewise becomes holy and cannot return to the profane regions. He will be given over to God to be dealt with as God pleases. Anyone who was not qualified to touch the altar did not dare approach it, for contact would have meant that he was no longer free to leave but was God&#8217;s holy possession &#8211; and might pay for it with his life (see Exod 30:29; Lev 6:18b, 27; and Ezek 46:20). </p>
<A NAME="2964"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=1975><b>tn</b> The verb is &#8220;you will do,&#8221; &#8220;you will make.&#8221; It clearly refers to offering the animals on the altar, but may emphasize all the preparation that was involved in the process.</p>
<A NAME="2965"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=1976><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;between the two evenings&#8221; or &#8220;between the two settings&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1503; &#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ben ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arbayim</font>). This expression has had a good deal of discussion. (1) <i>Tg. Onq. </i>says &#8220;between the two suns,&#8221; which the Talmud explains as the time between the sunset and the time the stars become visible. More technically, the first &#8220;evening&#8221; would be the time between sunset and the appearance of the crescent moon, and the second &#8220;evening&#8221; the next hour, or from the appearance of the crescent moon to full darkness (see Deut 16:6 &#8211; &#8220;at the going down of the sun&#8221;). (2) Saadia, Rashi, and Kimchi say the first evening is when the sun begins to decline in the west and cast its shadows, and the second evening is the beginning of night. (3) The view adopted by the Pharisees and the Talmudists (<i>b. Pesahim </i>61a) is that the first evening is when the heat of the sun begins to decrease, and the second evening begins at sunset, or, roughly from 3-5 <sc>p.m. The Mishnah (<i>m. Pesahim </i>5:1) indicates the lamb was killed about 2:30 <sc>p.m. &#8211; anything before noon was not valid. S. R. Driver concludes from this survey that the first view is probably the best, although the last view was the traditionally accepted one (<i>Exodus</i>, 89-90). Late afternoon or early evening seems to be intended, the time of twilight perhaps.</p>
<A NAME="2966"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=1977><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;of an ephah&#8221; has been supplied for clarity (cf. Num 28:5). The ephah was a commonly used dry measure whose capacity is now uncertain: &#8220;Quotations given for the ephah vary from ca. 45 to 20 liters&#8221; (C. Houtman, <i>Exodus</i>,<i> </i>2:340-41).</p>
<A NAME="2967"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=1978><b>tn</b> &#8220;Hin&#8221; is a transliterated Hebrew word that seems to have an Egyptian derivation. The amount of liquid measured by a hin is uncertain: &#8220;Its presumed capacity varies from about 3,5 liters to 7,5 liters&#8221; (C. Houtman, <i>Exodus</i>,<i> </i>3:550). </p>
