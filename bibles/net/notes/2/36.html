<A NAME="361"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2346><b>tn</b> Heb &#8220;called by name&#8221; (so KJV, ASV, NASB, NRSV). This expression means that the person was specifically chosen for some important task (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 342). See the expression with Cyrus in Isa 45:3-4. </p>
<A NAME="362"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2347><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to set.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="363"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2348><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in every work of thought,&#8221; meaning, every work that required the implementation of design or plan.</p>
<A NAME="364"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2349><b>sn</b> The expression means that God has given them the ability and the desire to teach others how to do the work. The infinitive construct &#8220;to teach&#8221; is related to the word Torah, &#8220;instruction, guide, law.&#8221; They will be able to direct others in the work.</p>
<A NAME="365"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2350><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;wisdom of heart,&#8221; or &#8220;wisdom in heart,&#8221; means artistic skill. The decisions and plans they make are skilled. The expression forms a second accusative after the verb of filling. </p>
<A NAME="366"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2351><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;all the work&#8221; means &#8220;all kinds of work.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="367"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2352><b>tn</b> Here &#8220;They are&#8221; has been supplied.</p>
<A NAME="368"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2353><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;doers of all work.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="369"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2354><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;designers of designs.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2355><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;wise of [in] heart.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2356><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;wisdom.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2357><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;understanding, discernment.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2358><b>tn</b> The relative clause includes this infinitive clause that expresses either the purpose or the result of God&#8217;s giving wisdom and understanding to these folk.</p>
<A NAME="3614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2359><b>tn</b> This noun is usually given an interpretive translation. B. Jacob renders the bound relationship as &#8220;the holy task&#8221; or &#8220;the sacred task&#8221; (<i>Exodus</i>, 1019). The NIV makes it &#8220;constructing,&#8221; so read &#8220;the work of constructing the sanctuary.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2360><b>tn</b> The first word of the verse is a perfect tense with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive; it is singular because it agrees with the first of the compound subject. The sentence is a little cumbersome because of the extended relative clause in the middle.</p>
<A NAME="3616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2361><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qara</font>&#8217;) plus the preposition &#8220;to&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;to call to&#8221; someone means &#8220;to summon&#8221; that person.</p>
<A NAME="3617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2362><b>tn</b> Here there is a slight change: &#8220;in whose heart Yahweh had put skill.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2363><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;whose heart was willing.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2364><b>sn</b> The verb means more than &#8220;approach&#8221; or &#8220;draw near&#8221;; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<i>qarav</i>) is the word used for drawing near the altar as in bringing an offering. Here they offer themselves, their talents and their time. </p>
<A NAME="3620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2365><b>tn</b> In the Hebrew text the infinitive &#8220;to do it&#8221; comes after &#8220;sanctuary&#8221;; it makes a smoother rendering in English to move it forward, rather than reading &#8220;brought <i>for</i> the work.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2366><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the morning, in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2367><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a man, a man from his work&#8221;; or &#8220;each one from his work.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2368><b>tn</b> The construction uses the verbal hendiadys: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">marbim lÿhavi</font>&#8217;) is the Hiphil participle followed (after the subject) by the Hiphil<i> </i>infinitive construct. It would read, &#8220;they multiply&#8230;to bring,&#8221; meaning, &#8220;they bring more&#8221; than is needed.</p>
<A NAME="3624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2369><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for the service&#8221; (so KJV, ASV).</p>
<A NAME="3625"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2370><b>tn</b> The last clause is merely the infinitive with an object &#8211; &#8220;to do it.&#8221; It clearly means the skilled workers are to do it.</p>
<A NAME="3626"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2371><b>tn</b> The verse simply reads, &#8220;and Moses commanded and they caused [a voice] to cross over in the camp.&#8221; The second preterite with the <i>vav</i> may be subordinated to the first clause, giving the intent (purpose or result). </p>
<A NAME="3627"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2372><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;voice.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3628"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2373><b>tn</b> The verse ends with the infinitive serving as the object of the preposition: &#8220;from bringing.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="3629"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2374><b>tn</b> This part of the sentence comes from the final verb, the Hiphil infinitive &#8211; leave over, meaning, have more than enough (see BDB 451 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1512;</font>).</p>
<A NAME="3630"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2375><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for all the work, to do it.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This lengthy section (35:1-36:7) forms one of the most remarkable sections in the book. Here there is a mixture of God&#8217;s preparation of people to do the work and their willingness to give and to serve. It not only provides insight into this renewed community of believers, but it also provides a timeless message for the church. The point is clear enough: In response to God&#8217;s commission, and inspired by God&#8217;s Spirit, the faithful and willing people rally to support and participate in the <sc>Lord&#8217;s work. </p>
<A NAME="3631"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2376><b>tn</b> The verb is singular since it probably is referring to Bezalel, but since he would not do all the work himself, it may be that the verbs could be given a plural subject: &#8220;they joined.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3632"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2377><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;the other&#8221; have been supplied. </p>
<A NAME="3633"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2378><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;one.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3634"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2379><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;eleven curtains he made them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3635"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2380><b>tn</b> The construction uses the infinitive construct from the verb &#8220;to be&#8221; to express this purpose clause: &#8220;to be one,&#8221; or, &#8220;so that it might be a unit.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="3636"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2381><b>tn</b> See the note on this phrase in Exod 25:5.</p>
<A NAME="3637"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2382><b>tn</b> There is debate whether the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">haqqÿrashim</font>) means &#8220;boards&#8221; or &#8220;frames&#8221; or &#8220;planks&#8221; (see Ezek 27:6) or &#8220;beams,&#8221; given the size of them. The literature on this includes M. Haran, &#8220;The Priestly Image of the Tabernacle,&#8221; <i>HUCA</i> 36 (1965): 192; B. A. Levine, &#8220;The Description of the Tabernacle Texts of the Pentateuch,&#8221; <i>JAOS</i> 85 (1965): 307-18; J. Morgenstern, &#8220;The Ark, the Ephod, and the Tent,&#8221; <i>HUCA</i> 17 (1942/43): 153-265; 18 (1943/44): 1-52.</p>
<A NAME="3638"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2383><b>tn</b> &#8220;Wood&#8221; is an adverbial accusative. </p>
<A NAME="3639"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2384><b>tn</b> The plural participle &#8220;standing&#8221; refers to how these items will be situated; they will be vertical rather than horizontal (U. Cassuto, <i>Exodus</i>,<i> </i>354).</p>
<A NAME="3640"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=2385><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the frame.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3641"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=2386><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the one.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3642"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=2387><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;two hands to the one frame.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3643"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2388><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;joined one to one.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="3644"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=2389><b>tn</b> The clause is repeated to show the distributive sense; it literally says, &#8220;and two bases under the one frame for its two projections.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3645"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=2390><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;under the one frame&#8221; again.</p>
<A NAME="3646"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=2391><b>tn</b> This is the last phrase of the verse, moved forward for clarity. </p>
<A NAME="3647"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=2392><b>tn</b> This difficult verse uses the perfect tense at the beginning, and the second clause parallels it with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yihyu</font>), which has to be taken here as a preterite without the consecutive <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>). The predicate &#8220;finished&#8221; or &#8220;completed&#8221; is the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tammim</font>); it normally means &#8220;complete, sound, whole,&#8221; and related words describe the sacrifices as without blemish. </p>
<A NAME="3648"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=2393><b>tn</b> Literally &#8220;houses&#8221;; i.e., places to hold the bars.</p>
<A NAME="3649"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=2394><b>tn</b> The verb is simply &#8220;he made&#8221; but as in Exod 26:31 it probably means that the cherubim were worked into the curtain with the yarn, and so embroidered on the curtain.</p>
<A NAME="3650"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=2395><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and their hooks gold.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="3651"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=2396><b>tn</b> The word is &#8220;their heads&#8221;; technically it would be &#8220;their capitals&#8221; (so ASV, NAB, NRSV). The bands were bands of metal surrounding these capitals just beneath them. These are not mentioned in Exod 26:37, and it sounds like the posts are to be covered with gold. But the gradation of metals is what is intended: the posts at the entrance to the Most Holy Place are all of gold; the posts at the entrance to the tent are overlaid with gold at the top; and the posts at the entrance to the courtyard are overlaid with silver at the top (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 387, citing Dillmann without reference).</p>
<A NAME="3652"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=2397><b>sn</b> For a good summary of the differences between the instruction section and the completion section, and the reasons for the changes and the omissions, see B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 1022-23. </p>
