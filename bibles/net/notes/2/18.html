<A NAME="181"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1241><b>sn</b> This chapter forms the transition to the Law. There has been the deliverance, the testing passages, the provision in the wilderness, and the warfare. Any God who can do all this for his people deserves their allegiance. In chap. 18 the Lawgiver is giving advice, using laws and rulings, but then he is given advice to organize the elders to assist. Thus, when the Law is fully revealed, a system will be in place to administer it. The point of the passage is that a great leader humbly accepts advice from other godly believers to delegate responsibility. He does not try to do it all himself; God does not want one individual to do it all. The chapter has three parts: vv. 1-12 tell how Jethro heard and came and worshiped and blessed; vv. 13-23 have the advice of Jethro, and then vv. 24-27 tell how Moses implemented the plan and Jethro went home. See further E. J. Runions, &#8220;Exodus Motifs in 1 Samuel 7 and 8,&#8221; <i>EvQ</i> 52 (1980): 130-31; and also see for another idea T. C. Butler, &#8220;An Anti-Moses Tradition,&#8221; <i>JSOT</i> 12 (1979): 9-15.</p>
<A NAME="182"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1242><b>tn</b> This clause beginning with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) answers the question of what Jethro had heard; it provides a second, explanatory noun clause that is the object of the verb &#8211; &#8220;he heard (1) all that God had done&#8230; (2) that he had brought&#8230;.&#8221; See R. J. Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 81, §490.</p>
<A NAME="183"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1243><b>sn</b> This is an important report that Jethro has heard, for the claim of God that he brought Israel out of bondage in Egypt will be the foundation of the covenant stipulations (Exod 20). </p>
<A NAME="184"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1244><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Moses) has been specified in the translation for clarity (also in the following verse).</p>
<A NAME="185"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1245><b>tn</b> The referent (Moses) and the verb have been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="186"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1246><b>tn</b> Now is given the etymological explanation of the name of Moses&#8217; other son, Eliezer (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1506;&#1462;&#1494;&#1462;&#1512;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">eli</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ezer</font>), which means &#8220;my God is a help.&#8221; The sentiment that explains this name is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1497; &#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1462;&#1494;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohe </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avi bÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ezri</font>, &#8220;the God of my father is my help&#8221;). The preposition in the sentiment is the <font face="Scholar">bet </font>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;</font>)<font face="Scholar"> essentiae</font> (giving the essence &#8211; see GKC 379 §119.<i>i</i>). Not mentioned earlier, the name has become even more appropriate now that God has delivered Moses from Pharaoh again. The word for &#8220;help&#8221; is a common word in the Bible, first introduced as a description of the woman in the Garden. It means to do for someone what he or she cannot do for himself or herself. Samuel raised the &#8220;stone of help&#8221; (Ebenezer) when Yahweh helped Israel win the battle (1 Sam 7:12).</p>
<A NAME="187"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1247><b>sn</b> The verb &#8220;delivered&#8221; is an important motif in this chapter (see its use in vv. 8, 9, and 10 with reference to Pharaoh). </p>
<A NAME="188"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1248><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his&#8221;; the referent (Moses) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="189"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1249><b>tn</b> This is an adverbial accusative that defines the place (see GKC 373-74 §118.<i>g</i>). </p>
<A NAME="1810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1250><b>sn</b> The mountain of God is Horeb, and so the desert here must be the Sinai desert by it. But chap. 19 suggests that they left Rephidim to go the 24 miles to Sinai. It may be that this chapter fits in chronologically after the move to Sinai, but was placed here thematically. W. C. Kaiser defends the present location of the story by responding to other reasons for the change given by Lightfoot, but does not deal with the travel locations (W. C. Kaiser, Jr., &#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 2:411). </p>
<A NAME="1811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1251><b>sn</b> This verse may seem out of place, since the report has already been given that they came to the desert. It begins to provide details of the event that the previous verse summarizes. The announcement in verse 6 may have come in advance by means of a messenger or at the time of arrival, either of which would fit with the attention to formal greetings in verse 7. This would suit a meeting between two important men; the status of Moses has changed. The LXX solves the problem by taking the pronoun &#8220;I&#8221; as the particle &#8220;behold&#8221; and reads it this way: &#8220;one said to Moses, &#8216;Behold, your father-in-law has come&#8230;.&#8217;&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1252><b>sn</b> This is more than polite oriental custom. Jethro was Moses&#8217; benefactor, father-in-law, and a priest. He paid much respect to him. Now he could invite Jethro into <i>his</i> home (see B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 496). </p>
<A NAME="1813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1253><b>tn</b> A rare word, &#8220;weariness&#8221; of the hardships.</p>
<A NAME="1814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1254><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;found them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1255><b>tn</b> Here &#8220;how&#8221; has been supplied.</p>
<A NAME="1816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1256><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khada</font>) is rare, occurring only in Job 3:6 and Ps 21:6, although it is common in Aramaic. The LXX translated it &#8220;he shuddered.&#8221; U. Cassuto suggests that that rendering was based on the midrashic interpretation in <i>b. Sanhedrin 94b</i>, &#8220;he felt cuts in his body&#8221; &#8211; a wordplay on the verb (<i>Exodus</i>, 215-16).</p>
<A NAME="1817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1257><b>tn</b> This is a common form of praise. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">barukh</font>) is the Qal passive participle of the verb. Here must be supplied a jussive, making this participle the predicate: &#8220;May Yahweh be blessed.&#8221; The verb essentially means &#8220;to enrich&#8221;; in praise it would mean that he would be enriched by the praises of the people.</p>
<A NAME="1818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1258><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from under the hand of the Egyptians.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1259><b>tn</b> The end of this sentence seems not to have been finished, or it is very elliptical. In the present translation the phrase &#8220;he has destroyed them&#8221; is supplied. Others take the last prepositional phrase to be the completion and supply only a verb: &#8220;[he was] above them.&#8221; U. Cassuto (<i>Exodus</i>, 216) takes the word &#8220;gods&#8221; to be the subject of the verb &#8220;act proudly,&#8221; giving the sense of &#8220;precisely (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ki</font>) in respect of these things of which the gods of Egypt boasted &#8211; He is greater than they (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">&#8216;alehem</font>).&#8221; He suggests rendering the clause, &#8220;excelling them in the very things to which they laid claim.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1260><b>tn</b> The verb is &#8220;and he took&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV, NASB). It must have the sense of getting the animals for the sacrifice. The Syriac, Targum, and Vulgate have &#8220;offered.&#8221; But Cody argues because of the precise wording in the text Jethro did not offer the sacrifices but received them (A. Cody, &#8220;Exodus 18,12: Jethro Accepts a Covenant with the Israelites,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 49 [1968]: 159-61).</p>
<A NAME="1821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1261><b>sn</b> Jethro brought offerings as if he were the one who had been delivered. The &#8220;burnt offering&#8221; is singular, to honor God first. The other sacrifices were intended for the invited guests to eat (a forerunner of the peace offering). See B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 498.</p>
<A NAME="1822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1262><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1462;&#1495;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lekhem</font>) here means the sacrifice and all the foods that were offered with it. The eating before God was part of covenantal ritual, for it signified that they were in communion with the Deity, and with one another.</p>
<A NAME="1823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1263><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and it was/happened on the morrow.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1264><b>sn</b> This is a simple summary of the function of Moses on this particular day. He did not necessarily do this every day, but it was time now to do it. The people would come to solve their difficulties or to hear instruction from Moses on decisions to be made. The tradition of &#8220;sitting in Moses&#8217; seat&#8221; is drawn from this passage. </p>
<A NAME="1825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1265><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;what is this thing.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1266><b>sn</b> This question, &#8220;what are you doing for the people,&#8221; is qualified by the next question. Sitting alone all day and the people standing around all day showed that Moses was exhibiting too much care for the people &#8211; he could not do this. </p>
<A NAME="1827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1267><b>tn</b> The form is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1512;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lidrosh</font>), the Qal<i> </i>infinitive construct giving the purpose. To inquire of God would be to seek God&#8217;s will on a matter, to obtain a legal decision on a matter, or to settle a dispute. As a judge Moses is speaking for God, but as the servant of Yahweh Moses&#8217; words will be God&#8217;s words. The psalms would later describe judges as &#8220;gods&#8221; because they made the right decisions based on God&#8217;s Law.</p>
<A NAME="1828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1268><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;thing,&#8221; &#8220;matter,&#8221; &#8220;issue.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1269><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shafat</font>) means &#8220;to judge&#8221;; more specifically, it means to make a decision as an arbiter or umpire. When people brought issues to him, Moses decided between them. In the section of laws in Exodus after the Ten Commandments come the decisions, the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1496;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mishppatim</font>). </p>
<A NAME="1830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1270><b>tn</b> The &#8220;decrees&#8221; or &#8220;statutes&#8221; were definite rules, stereotyped and permanent; the &#8220;laws&#8221; were directives or pronouncements given when situations arose. S. R. Driver suggests this is another reason why this event might have taken place after Yahweh had given laws on the mountain (<i>Exodus</i>, 165).</p>
<A NAME="1831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1271><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the thing.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1832"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1272><b>tn</b> The verb means &#8220;to fall and fade&#8221; as a leaf (Ps 1:3). In Ps 18:45 it is used figuratively of foes fading away, failing in strength and courage (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 166). Here the infinitive absolute construction heightens the meaning.</p>
<A NAME="1833"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1273><b>tn</b> Gesenius lists the specialized use of the comparative <i>min</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;</font>) where with an adjective the thought expressed is that the quality is too difficult for the attainment of a particular aim (GKC 430 §133.<i>c</i>).</p>
<A NAME="1834"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1274><b>tn</b> Here &#8220;a burden&#8221; has been supplied.</p>
<A NAME="1835"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1275><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;hear my voice.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1836"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1276><b>tn</b> The line reads &#8220;Be you to the people before God.&#8221; He is to be their representative before God. This is introducing the aspect of the work that only Moses could do, what he has been doing. He is to be before God for the people, to pray for them, to appeal on their behalf. Jethro is essentially saying, I understand that you cannot delegate this to anyone else, so continue doing it (U. Cassuto, <i>Exodus</i>, 219-20).</p>
<A NAME="1837"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1277><b>tn</b> The form is the perfect tense with the <i>vav </i>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive; following the imperative it will be instruction as well. Since the imperative preceding this had the idea of &#8220;continue to be&#8221; as you are, this too has that force.</p>
<A NAME="1838"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1278><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;words&#8221;; KJV, ASV &#8220;the causes&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;cases&#8221;; NLT &#8220;questions.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1839"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1279><b>tn</b> The perfect tense with the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) continues the sequence of instruction for Moses. He alone was to be the mediator, to guide them in the religious and moral instruction.</p>
<A NAME="1840"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1280><b>tn</b> The verb and its following prepositional phrase form a relative clause, modifying &#8220;the way.&#8221; The imperfect tense should be given the nuance of obligatory imperfect &#8211; it is the way they must walk. </p>
<A NAME="1841"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1281><b>tn</b> This last part is parallel to the preceding: &#8220;work&#8221; is also a direct object of the verb &#8220;make known,&#8221; and the relative clause that qualifies it also uses an obligatory imperfect.</p>
<A NAME="1842"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1282><b>tn</b> The construction uses the independent pronoun for emphasis, and then the imperfect tense &#8220;see&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1494;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khazah</font>) &#8211; &#8220;and <i>you</i> will see from all&#8230;.&#8221; Both in Hebrew and Ugaritic expressions of &#8220;seeing&#8221; are used in the sense of choosing (Gen 41:33). See U. Cassuto, <i>Exodus</i>, 220.</p>
<A NAME="1843"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1283><b>tn</b> The expression is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1504;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anshe khayil</font>, &#8220;capable men&#8221;). The attributive genitive is the word used in expressions like &#8220;mighty man of valor.&#8221; The word describes these men as respected, influential, powerful people, those looked up to by the community as leaders, and those who will have the needs of the community in mind. </p>
<A NAME="1844"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1284><b>tn</b> The description &#8220;fearers of God&#8221; uses an objective genitive. It describes them as devout, worshipful, obedient servants of God.</p>
<A NAME="1845"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1285><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;men of truth&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1504;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1497; &#1488;&#1457;&#1502;&#1462;&#1514;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">anshe </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">emet</font>) indicates that these men must be seekers of truth, who know that the task of a judge is to give true judgment (U. Cassuto, <i>Exodus</i>, 220). The word &#8220;truth&#8221; includes the ideas of faithfulness or reliability, as well as factuality itself. It could be understood to mean &#8220;truthful men,&#8221; men whose word is reliable and true.</p>
<A NAME="1846"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1286><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;haters of bribes.&#8221; Here is another objective genitive, one that refers to unjust gain. To hate unjust gain is to reject and refuse it. Their decisions will not be swayed by greed. </p>
<A NAME="1847"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1287><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;over them&#8221;; the referent (the people) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1848"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1288><b>sn</b> It is not clear how this structure would work in a judicial setting. The language of &#8220;captains of thousands,&#8221; etc., is used more for military ranks. There must have been more detailed instruction involved here, for each Israelite would have come under four leaders with this arrangement, and perhaps difficult cases would be sent to the next level. But since the task of these men would also involve instruction and guidance, the breakdown would be very useful. Deut 1:9, 13 suggest that the choice of these people was not simply Moses&#8217; alone. </p>
<A NAME="1849"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1289><b>tn</b> The form is the perfect tense with the <i>vav </i>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive, making it equivalent to the imperfect of instruction in the preceding verse. </p>
<A NAME="1850"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1290><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in every time,&#8221; meaning &#8220;in all normal cases&#8221; or &#8220;under normal circumstances.&#8221; The same phrase occurs in v. 26.</p>
<A NAME="1851"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1291><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;great thing.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1855"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=1295><b>tn</b> Here &#8220;the burden&#8221; has been supplied.</p>

<A NAME="1868"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=1308><b>sn</b> This chapter makes an excellent message on spiritual leadership of the people of God. Spiritually responsible people are to be selected to help in the work of the ministry (teaching, deciding cases, meeting needs), so that there will be peace, and so that leaders will not be exhausted. Probably capable people are more ready to do that than leaders are ready to relinquish control. But leaders have to be willing to take the risk, to entrust the task to others. Here Moses is the model of humility, receiving correction and counsel from Jethro. And Jethro is the ideal adviser, for he has no intention of remaining there to run the operation. </p>
