<A NAME="415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=165><b>sn</b> In context the phrase <i>those who are dead</i> refers to those now dead who had accepted the gospel while they were still living and had suffered persecution for their faith. Though they &#8220;suffered judgment&#8221; in this earthly life (i.e., they died, in the midst of physical abuse from the ungodly), they will enjoy life from God in the spiritual, heavenly realm because of the gospel (v. 6b). It clearly does not assume a second chance for conversion offered to unbelievers who had died; why would Peter urge people to suffer in this life for the sake of the gospel if he believed that mercy would be extended to all the dead in the hereafter (cf. 2:7-8; 4:1-5, 12-19)? </p>
