<A NAME="42"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=152><b>sn</b> <i>Has finished with sin. </i>The last sentence in v. 1 may refer to Christ as the one who suffered in the flesh (cf. 2:21, 23; 3:18; 4:1a) and the latter part would then mean, &#8220;he has finished dealing with sin.&#8221; But it is more likely that it refers to the Christian who suffers unjustly (cf. 2:19-20; 3:14, 17). This shows that he has made a break with sin as vs. 2 describes.</p>
