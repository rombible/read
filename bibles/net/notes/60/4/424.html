<A NAME="424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=174><b>sn</b> The statement of v. 8b, <i>love covers a multitude of sins</i>, is proverbial: It is quoted from Prov 10:12 (cf. Jas 5:20). It speaks of the forbearance that comes with love: Christian love is patient and forgiving toward the offenses of a fellow Christian (Matt 18:21-22; 1 Cor 13:4-7).</p>
