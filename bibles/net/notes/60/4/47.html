<A NAME="47"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=157><b>tn</b> According to BDAG 857 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#972;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font> the term refers to a social gathering at which wine is served, hence &#8220;drinking parties&#8221; (cf. TEV, NASB). However, the collocation with the other terms in v. 4 suggests something less sophisticated and more along the lines of wild and frenzied drinking bouts.</p>
