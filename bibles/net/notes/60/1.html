<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Peter.&#8221; The word &#8220;from&#8221; is not in the Greek text, but has been supplied to indicate the sender of the letter.</p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;to those living as resident aliens,&#8221; &#8220;to the exiles.&#8221; This term is used metaphorically of Christians who live in this world as foreigners, since their homeland is heaven.</p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;in the Diaspora.&#8221; The Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#963;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#940;</font> (<font face="Greektl">diaspora</font>, &#8220;dispersion&#8221;) refers to Jews not living in Palestine but &#8220;dispersed&#8221; or scattered among the Gentiles. But here it is probably metaphorical, used of Gentile Christians spread out as God&#8217;s people in the midst of a godless world.</p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;Asia&#8221;; in the NT this always refers to the Roman province of Asia, made up of about one-third of the west and southwest end of modern Asia Minor. Asia lay to the west of the region of Phrygia and Galatia. The words &#8220;the province of&#8221; are supplied to indicate to the modern reader that this does not refer to the continent of Asia.</p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;to the chosen sojourners&#8230;&#8221; On this reading the phrases in v. 2 describe their entire existence as sojourners, etc., not just their election.</p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=6><b>sn</b> <i>For obedience and for sprinkling</i> indicates the purpose of their choice or election by God.</p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=7><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;be multiplied to you.&#8221;</p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=8><b>tn</b> There is no verb in the Greek text; either the optative (&#8220;be&#8221;) or the indicative (&#8220;is&#8221;) can be supplied. The meaning of the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8016;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#951;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">euloghtos</font>) and the author&#8217;s intention at this point in the epistle must both come into play to determine which is the preferred nuance. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8016;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#951;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> as an adjective can mean either that one is praised or that one is blessed, that is, in a place of favor and benefit. Two factors of the author&#8217;s style come into play. At this point the author is describing the reality of believers&#8217; salvation and will soon explain believers&#8217; necessary response; this is in emulation of Pauline style which generally follows the same logical order (although the author here discusses the reality in a much more compressed fashion). On the other hand, when imitating the Pauline greeting, which is normally verbless, the author inserts the optative (see v. 2 above). When considered as a whole, although a decision is difficult, the fact that the author in the immediate context has used the optative when imitating a Pauline stylized statement would argue for the optative here. The translation uses the term &#8220;blessed&#8221; in the sense &#8220;worthy of praise&#8221; as this is in keeping with the traditional translation of <i>berakah</i> psalms. Cf. also 2 Cor 1:3; Eph 1:3.</p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=9><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;that is&#8221; is supplied in the translation to indicate that the imperishable inheritance is in apposition to the living hope of v. 3. </p>
<a name="110"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=10><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;into,&#8221; continuing the description of v. 3 without an &#8220;and.&#8221;</p>

<a name="112"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=12><b>tc</b> &#8225; The oldest and best witnesses lack the verb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* B, along with 1505 <i>pc</i>), but most <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>72</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2 </sup>A C P <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 048 33 1739 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>) have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#943;&#957;</font> here (<font face="Greektl">estin</font>, &#8220;[if] it is [necessary]&#8221;). The verb looks to be an explanatory gloss. But if no verb is present, this opens up the time frame in the author&#8217;s mind even more, since the conditional particle for both the first class condition and the fourth class condition is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ei</font>). That may well be what was on the author&#8217;s mind, as evidenced by some of his other allusions to suffering in this little letter (3:14, 17). NA<sup>27</sup> has the verb in brackets, indicating doubts as to its authenticity.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;Though now, for a little while if necessary, you may have to suffer.&#8221; </p>

<a name="139"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=39><b>tc</b> Although there may be only a slight difference in translation, the term translated as &#8220;trust&#8221; is the adjective <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#973;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pistous</font>). This is neither as common nor as clear as the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pisteuw</font>, &#8220;believe, trust&#8221;). Consequently, most <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> have the present participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pisteuonta&quot;</font>; <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>72</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> C P <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 1739 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>), or the aorist participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pisteusante&quot;</font>; 33 <i>pc</i>), while A B <i>pc </i>vg<i> </i>have the adjective. Thus, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#973;&#962;</font> is to be preferred. In the NT the adjective is routinely taken passively in the sense of &#8220;faithful&#8221; (BDAG 820 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> 1). That may be part of the force here as well: &#8220;you are now faithful to God,&#8221; although the primary force in this context seems to be that of trusting. Nevertheless, it is difficult to separate faith from faithfulness in NT descriptions of Christians&#8217; dependence on God.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;who through him [are] trusting,&#8221; describing the &#8220;you&#8221; of v. 20. Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started here in the translation.</p>
<a name="140"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=40><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;having purified,&#8221; as the preparation for the love described in the second half of the verse.</p>
<a name="141"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=41><b>tc</b> Most later <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> (P <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>) have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#8048; &#960;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">dia pneumato&quot;</font>, &#8220;through the spirit&#8221;) after <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ajlhqeia&quot;</font>, &#8220;truth&#8221;), while the words are lacking in a broad spectrum of early and important witnesses (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>72</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A B C <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 33 81 323 945 1241 1739 <i>al</i> vg sy co). On external grounds, the shorter reading cannot be easily explained if it were not original. The longer reading is clearly secondary, added to show more strongly God&#8217;s part in man&#8217;s obedience to the truth. But the addition ignores the force that the author gives to &#8220;purified&#8221; and ruins the balance between v. 22 and v. 23 (for in v. 23 the emphasis is on God&#8217;s part; here, on man&#8217;s part).</p>
<a name="142"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=42><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;for sincere brotherly love.&#8221;</p>
<a name="143"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=43><b>tn</b> Verses 22-23 are a single sentence in the Greek text. To improve clarity (and because contemporary English tends to use shorter sentences) these verses have been divided into three sentences in the translation. In addition, &#8220;So&#8221; has been supplied at the beginning of the second English sentence (v. 22b) to indicate the relationship with the preceding statement.</p>
<a name="144"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=44><b>tc</b> A few <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> (A B 1852 <i>pc</i>) lack <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#952;&#945;&#961;&#8118;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kaqaras</font>, &#8220;pure&#8221;) and read simply <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#961;&#948;&#943;&#945;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kardias</font>, &#8220;from the heart&#8221;), but there is excellent ms support (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>72</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* C P <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 33 1739 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> co) for the word. The omission may have been accidental. In the uncial script (<font face="Greek Uncials">kaqaras kardias</font>) an accidental omission could have happened via homoioteleuton or homoioarcton. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#952;&#945;&#961;&#8118;&#962;</font> should be considered original.</p>
