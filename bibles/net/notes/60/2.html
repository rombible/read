Not only is the longer reading superior externally, but since the notion of growing up [in]to salvation would have seemed theologically objectionable, it is easy to see why some scribes would omit it.</p>

<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=66><b>sn</b> A quotation from Isa 28:16.</p>
<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=67><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;to you who believe is the value,&#8221; referring to their perception of the stone in contrast to those who reject (vv. 7b-8). But the expression may also be translated as &#8220;to you who believe is this honor,&#8221; referring to the lack of shame cited in v. 6b.</p>
<A NAME="220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=68><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the value&#8221; or &#8220;the honor,&#8221; but the former is preferred since it comes from the same root as &#8220;priceless&#8221; in vv. 4, 6, and it is in contrast to the negative estimate of the stone by those who reject (vv. 7b-8).</p>
<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=69><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the head of the corner.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=71><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense.&#8221; The latter phrase uses the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#954;&#940;&#957;&#948;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">skandalon</font>), denoting an obstacle to faith, something that arouses anger and rejection.</p>
<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=72><b>sn</b> A quotation from Isa 8:14.</p>
<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=73><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;who stumble,&#8221; referring to &#8220;those who do not believe&#8221; in vs. 7. Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started here in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=74><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;to which they were also destined.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=75><b>sn</b> This verse contains various allusions and quotations from Exod 19:5-6; 23:22 (LXX); Isa 43:20-21; and Mal 3:17.</p>
<A NAME="228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=76><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;who,&#8221; continuing the description of the readers from vs. 9. Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started here in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=77><b>sn</b> The quotations in v. 10 are from Hos 1:6, 9; 2:23.</p>
<A NAME="230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=78><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;keeping your conduct good.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=79><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the Gentiles,&#8221; used here of those who are not God&#8217;s people.</p>
<A NAME="232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=80><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;in order that in what they malign you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=81><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;when he visits.&#8221; <i>Grk</i> &#8220;in the day of visitation,&#8221; denoting a time when God intervenes directly in human affairs, either for blessing (Luke 1:68, 78; 7:16; 19:44) or for judgment (Isa 10:3; Jer 6:15). This phrase may be a quotation from Isa 10:3, in which case judgment is in view here. But blessing seems to be the point, since part of the motive for good behavior is winning the non-Christian over to the faith (as in 3:1; also apparently in 3:15; cf. Matt 5:16).</p>
<A NAME="234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=82><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;every human being&#8221;; <i>Grk</i> &#8220;every human creation,&#8221; denoting either everything created for mankind (NRSV mg: &#8220;every institution ordained for human beings&#8221;) or every creature who is human. The meaning of the verb &#8220;be subject&#8221; and the following context supports the rendering adopted in the text.</p>
<A NAME="235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=83><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;those sent by him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=84><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;for the punishment&#8230;and the praise.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=85><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;because thus it is God&#8217;s will.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=86><b>tn</b> There is no main verb in this verse, but it continues the sense of command from v. 13, &#8220;be subject&#8230;, as free people&#8230;not using&#8230;but as slaves of God.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=87><b>tn</b> Traditionally, &#8220;servants&#8221; or &#8220;bondservants.&#8221; Though <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">doulos</font>) is normally translated &#8220;servant,&#8221; the word does not bear the connotation of a free individual serving another. BDAG notes that &#8220;&#8216;servant&#8217; for &#8216;slave&#8217; is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times&#8230;in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished&#8221; (BDAG 260 s.v.). The most accurate translation is &#8220;bondservant&#8221; (sometimes found in the ASV for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font>), in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another. But as this is archaic, few today understand its force.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Undoubtedly the background for the concept of being the Lord&#8217;s slave or servant is to be found in the Old Testament scriptures. For a Jew this concept did not connote drudgery, but honor and privilege. It was used of national Israel at times (Isa 43:10), but was especially associated with famous OT personalities, including such great men as Moses (Josh 14:7), David (Ps 89:3; cf. 2 Sam 7:5, 8) and Elijah (2 Kgs 10:10); all these men were &#8220;servants (or slaves) of the Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=88><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;love the brotherhood.&#8221; The Greek term &#8220;brotherhood&#8221; is used in a broad sense to connote familial relationships within the family of God. BDAG 19 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#962;</font> 1 suggests &#8220;a fellowship,&#8221; but in the present context &#8220;love the fellowship of believers&#8221; could be taken to mean &#8220;love to participate in fellowship with believers,&#8221; whereas the present verse suggests the Christian community as a whole, in familial terms, is in view. This same word occurs in 5:9; there it has been translated &#8220;brothers and sisters.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=89><b>tn</b> The Greek term here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#7984;&#954;&#941;&#964;&#951;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">oiketh&quot;</font>), often used of a servant in a household (who would have been a slave).</p>
<A NAME="242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=90><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;being subject,&#8221; but continuing the sense of command from vs. 13.</p>
<A NAME="243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=91><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;For this [is] favor/grace,&#8221; used as a metonymy of that which pleases him, which he looks on with favor (cf. BDAG 1079 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#967;&#940;&#961;&#953;&#962;</font> 2). Cf. 1 Pet 2:20.</p>
<A NAME="244"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=92><b>tc</b> The expression &#8220;consciousness/conscience of God&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#949;&#943;&#948;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font>; <font face="Greektl">suneidhsin qeou</font>) is unusual, occurring only here in the NT. Because <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> was liable to misinterpretation, several witnesses altered the text, either replacing it with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#8053;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">agaqhn</font>; C <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 323 614 630 945 1241 1505 1739 <i>al </i>sy) or expanding the expression by adding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#8053;&#957;</font> before <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>72</sup> [A* 33] 81).

The reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font>, however, has superior support (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A<sup>c</sup> B P 049 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat co), and best explains the rise of the other readings.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;conscious(ness) of God,&#8221; an awareness of God and allegiance to him.</p>
<A NAME="245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=93><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;For this [is] favor/grace with God,&#8221; used as a metonymy as in vs. 19 of that which pleases him, which he looks on with favor (cf.

<A NAME="248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=96><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;who being maligned,&#8221; continuing the reference to Christ. Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started here in the translation.</p>

<A NAME="251"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=99><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;to the one&#8221;; the referent (God) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="252"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=100><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;who.&#8221; Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started here in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="253"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=101><b>sn</b> A quotation from Isa 53:4, 12.</p>
<A NAME="254"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=102><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#947;&#943;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">apoginomai</font>) occurs only here in the NT. It can have a literal meaning (&#8220;to die&#8221;; L&amp;N 74.27) and a figurative meaning (&#8220;to cease&#8221;; L&amp;N 68.40). Because it is opposite the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#950;&#940;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">zaw</font>, &#8220;to live&#8221;), many argue that the meaning of the verb here must be &#8220;die&#8221; (so BDAG 108 s.v.), but even so literal death would not be in view. &#8220;In place of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#952;&#957;&#8131;&#963;&#954;&#953;&#949;&#957;</font>, the common verb for &#8216;die,&#8217; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#952;&#945;&#953;</font> serves Peter as a euphemism, with the meaning &#8216;to be away&#8217; or &#8216;to depart&#8217;&#8221; (J. R. Michaels, <i>1 Peter</i> [WBC 49], 148). It is a metaphorical way to refer to the decisive separation from sin Jesus accomplished for believers through his death; the result is that believers &#8220;may cease from sinning.&#8221;</p>
