<A NAME="58"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=204><b>sn</b><i> </i>In this context <i>younger</i> and <i>elder</i> are terms that combine two meanings: relative age and an official structure of leadership in the church. As in v. 1, <i>elder</i> here denotes those who exercise spiritual leadership, who for the most part are older in years. Likewise <i>younger</i> means the rest of the community, who for the most part are younger in age, who are urged to accept the authority of their leaders.</p>
