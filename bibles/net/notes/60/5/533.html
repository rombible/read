<A NAME="533"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=229><b>tc</b> Most <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> P 1739<sup>c</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>) have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">amen</font>, &#8220;amen&#8221;) at the end of 1 Peter. Such a conclusion is routinely added by scribes to NT books because a few of these books originally had such an ending (cf. Rom 16:27; Gal 6:18; Jude 25). A majority of Greek witnesses have the concluding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> in every NT book except Acts, James, and 3 John (and even in these books, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> is found in some witnesses). It is thus a predictable variant. Further, the absence of such a conclusion to the epistle in such witnesses as A B <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 81 323 945 1241 1739* co seems inexplicable unless the word here is not authentic.</p>
