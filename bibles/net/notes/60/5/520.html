<A NAME="520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=216><b>tn</b> This verb carries the nuance &#8220;to accomplish, complete,&#8221; emphasizing their faithful endurance in suffering. The verb is passive in Greek (&#8220;suffering is being endured by your brotherhood&#8221;), but has been translated as an active to give a smoother English style.</p>
