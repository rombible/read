<A NAME="524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=220><b>tn</b> No verb is expressed here but the verb &#8220;is&#8221; or &#8220;belongs&#8221; is clearly implied. This doxology expresses a fact for which God should be glorified (as in 4:11), rather than a wish or prayer (&#8220;may power be to him&#8221;).</p>
