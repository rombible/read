<A NAME="512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=208><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;throwing on&#8221;; &#8220;loading.&#8221; Some scholars take the participle to function imperativally, or as attendant circumstance &#8211; thus, &#8220;cast.&#8221; See below for discussion.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Casting. </i>According to <i>ExSyn </i>630, &#8220;Although treated as an independent command in several modern translations (e.g., RSV, NRSV, NIV), the participle [<i>casting</i>] should be connected with the verb of v 6, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#945;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#8061;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#949;</font> [<font face="Greektl">tapeinwqhte</font>, <i>Humble yourselves</i>]. As such, it is not offering a new command, but is defining <i>how</i> believers are to humble themselves. Taking the participle as means enriches the understanding of both verbs: Humbling oneself is not a negative act of self-denial per se, but a positive one of active dependence on God for help.&#8221; </p>
