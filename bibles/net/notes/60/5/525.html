<A NAME="525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=221><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>Through Silvanus </i>means either that Silvanus was the secretary (amanuensis) who assisted Peter in writing or composing the letter (cf. Rom 16:22) or that he carried the letter to the churches. The latter sense is more likely since this is the meaning of the Greek wording when it is used elsewhere (cf. Acts 15:23; Ignatius, <i>Letter to the Romans</i> 10:1; <i>Letter to the Philadelphians</i> 11:2; <i>Letter to the Smyrnaeans</i> 12:1; Polycarp, <i>Letter to the Philippians</i> 14), though it is perhaps possible that both ideas could be incorporated by this expression.
