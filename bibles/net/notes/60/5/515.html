<A NAME="515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=211><b>tc</b> A few <sc>mss (B <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 0206<sup>vid</sup> <i>pc</i>) lack the pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#953;&#957;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">tina</font>), while others have it. Those that have it either put the acute accent over the penult, making this an interrogative pronoun (&#8220;whom&#8221;; L P 322 323 614 630 945 1243 1739 2298 <i>al</i>), or leave off any accent, making this an indefinite pronoun (&#8220;someone&#8221;; <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>), or are too early to employ accents but nevertheless have the pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#953;&#957;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>72 </sup><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A). Generally speaking, the shorter and harder reading is to be preferred. In this instance, the omission of the pronoun would obviously be accommodated for by scribes, since both <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#950;&#951;&#964;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">zhtew</font>, &#8220;look, seek&#8221;) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#960;&#943;&#957;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">katapinw</font>, &#8220;devour&#8221;) are transitive verbs. However, if the omission were original, one might expect the position of the pronoun to float in the <sc>mss &#8211; both before and after the infinitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#960;&#953;&#949;&#8150;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">katapiein</font>, &#8220;to devour&#8221;). Further, other terms might be expected as well, such as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7957;&#957;&#945; &#7952;&#958; &#8017;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">{ena ex Jumwn</font>, &#8220;one of you&#8221;) or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#953;&#957;&#945; &#7952;&#958; &#8017;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">tina ex Jumwn</font>, &#8220;a certain one/someone of you&#8221;). The uniformity of both the word and its location suggests that the shorter reading (found in but a few Greek <sc>mss) in this instance was a scribal mistake. As to whether the pronoun is interrogative or indefinite, since accents were not a part of the earliest <sc>mss, such Greek witnesses are of no help to us in this kind of problem. There would be little difference in meaning between the two in this context.</p>
