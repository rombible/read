<A NAME="518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=214><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;your brotherhood.&#8221; The Greek term &#8220;brotherhood&#8221; is used in a broad sense to connote familial relationships within the family of God (cf. BDAG 19 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#962;</font> 1). Another alternative translation would be &#8220;your fellow believers,&#8221; though this would weaken the familial connotations. This same word occurs in 2:17; there it has been translated &#8220;family of believers.&#8221; </p>
