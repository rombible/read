<A NAME="318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=124><b>sn</b> Verses 10-12 are a quotation from Ps 34:12-16.</p>

<A NAME="320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=126><b>sn</b> The Greek construction here implies that such suffering was not the norm, even though it could happen, and in fact may well have happened to some of the readers (cf. 4:4, 12-19).</p>

<A NAME="322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=128><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;do not fear their fear,&#8221; referring to those who cause their suffering. The phrase &#8220;their fear&#8221; may mean &#8220;what they fear&#8221; (subjective genitive), but in a situation of persecution it more likely means &#8220;fear of them&#8221; (objective genitive).</p>
<A NAME="323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=129><b>sn</b> A quotation from Isa 8:12.</p>

But <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> is widely supported by excellent and early witnesses (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>72</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A B C <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 33 1739 <i>al</i> latt sy co), and as a less common idiom better explains the rise of the other reading.</p>

<A NAME="329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=135><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;if the will of God should will it.&#8221; As in 3:14 the Greek construction here implies that suffering for doing good was not what God normally willed, even though it could happen, and in fact may have happened to some of the readers (cf. 4:4, 12-19).</p>
<A NAME="330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=136><b>sn</b> This passage has been typeset as poetry because many scholars regard this passage as poetic or hymnic. These terms are used broadly to refer to the genre of writing, not to the content. There are two broad criteria for determining if a passage is poetic or hymnic: &#8220;(a) <i>stylistic:</i> a certain rhythmical lilt when the passages are read aloud, the presence of <i>parallelismus membrorum</i> (i.e., an arrangement into couplets), the semblance of some metre, and the presence of rhetorical devices such as alliteration, <i>chiasmus</i>, and antithesis; and (b) <i>linguistic: </i>an unusual vocabulary, particularly the presence of theological terms, which is different from the surrounding context&#8221; (P. T. O&#8217;Brien, <i>Philippians </i>[NIGTC], 188-89). Classifying a passage as hymnic or poetic is important because understanding this genre can provide keys to interpretation. However, not all scholars agree that the above criteria are present in this passage, so the decision to typeset it as poetry should be viewed as a tentative decision about its genre.</p>
<A NAME="331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=137><b>tc</b> The variants here are legion (B. M. Metzger produces eight variants in a nice layout of the evidence [<i>TCGNT</i> 622]). Most of these variants involve pronouns, prepositions, or word order changes, but the major problem involves whether Christ &#8220;suffered&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#960;&#945;&#952;&#949;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">epaqen</font>) or &#8220;died&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#941;&#952;&#945;&#957;&#949;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">apeqanen</font>). The witnesses that read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#941;&#952;&#945;&#957;&#949;&#957;</font> are <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>72</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A C<sup>vid</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 0285 33 614 630 945 1241 1505 1739; the witnesses that read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#960;&#945;&#952;&#949;&#957;</font> are B L P 81 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>. Although the external evidence slightly favors <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#941;&#952;&#945;&#957;&#949;&#957;</font>, such may be a secondary reading. Intrinsically, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#960;&#945;&#952;&#949;&#957;</font> both fits the context better, especially the verbal link between v. 17 and v. 18 (note in particular the introductory causal <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> [<font face="Greektl">{oti</font>, &#8220;because&#8221;] and the emphatic <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> [<font face="Greektl">kai</font>, &#8220;also&#8221;]), and fits the author&#8217;s style (1 Peter never uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#952;&#957;&#8132;&#963;&#954;&#969;</font> [<font face="Greektl">apoqnhskw</font>], but uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#940;&#963;&#967;&#969;</font> [<font face="Greektl">pascw</font>] 11 other times, more than any other NT book). However, scribes would most likely realize this, and might conform the verb in v. 18 to the author&#8217;s typical usage. It may be argued, however, that scribes tended to alter the text in light of more common NT idioms, and did not have as much sensitivity to the literary features in the immediate context. In this instance, it may not be insignificant that the NT collocates <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#952;&#957;&#8132;&#963;&#954;&#969;</font> with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#943;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jamartia</font>, &#8220;sin&#8221;) seven other times, though only once (1 Cor 15:3) with a meaning similar to what would be demanded here, but collocates <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#940;&#963;&#967;&#969;</font> with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#943;&#945;</font> in only one other place, 1 Pet 4:1, where the meaning also detours from what is seen here. All in all, a decision is difficult, but <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#960;&#945;&#952;&#949;&#957;</font> is to be preferred slightly.</p>
<A NAME="332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=138><b>sn</b> The reference to the just suffering for the unjust is an allusion to Isa 53:11-12.</p>
<A NAME="333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=139><b>tn</b> Greek emphasizes the contrast between these two phrases more than can be easily expressed in English.</p>
<A NAME="334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=140><b>sn</b> <i>Put to death in the flesh&#8230;made alive in the spirit. </i>The contrast of <i>flesh</i> and <i>spirit</i> is not between two parts of Christ&#8217;s person (material versus immaterial) but between two broader modes of existence: the realm of unregenerate earthly life versus eternal heavenly life. The reference may not be to the Holy Spirit directly, but indirectly, since the Spirit permeates and characterizes the spiritual mode of existence. However, <i>ExSyn </i>343 (n. 76) states &#8220;It is often objected that the Holy Spirit cannot be in view because the two datives of v 18 (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#945;&#961;&#954;&#943;</font>, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font> [<font face="Greektl">sarki</font>, <font face="Greektl">pneumati</font>]) would then have a different syntactical force (sphere, means). But if 1 Pet 3:18 is a hymnic or liturgical fragment, this can be no objection because of &#8216;poetic license&#8217;: poetry is replete with examples of grammatical and lexical license, not the least of which is the use of the same morpho-syntactic categories, in parallel lines, with entirely different senses (note, e.g., the dat. expressions in 1 Tim 3:16).&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=141><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;in which.&#8221; <i>ExSyn </i>343 notes: &#8220;The antecedent of the RP [relative pronoun] is by no means certain. Some take it to refer to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font> immediately preceding, the meaning of which might be either the Holy Spirit or the spiritual state. Others see the phrase as causal (&#8216;for which reason,&#8217; &#8216;because of this&#8217;), referring back to the entire clause, while still other scholars read the phrase as temporal (if so, it could be with or without an antecedent: &#8216;on which occasion&#8217; or &#8216;meanwhile&#8217;). None of these options is excluded by syntax. It may be significant, however, that every other time <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#8103;</font> is used in 1 Peter it bears an adverbial/conjunctive force (cf. 1:6; 2:12; 3:16 [here, temporal]; 4:4).&#8221; Also, because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started here in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=142><b>sn</b> <i>And preached to the spirits in prison. </i>The meaning of this preaching and the <i>spirits</i> to whom he preached are much debated. It is commonly understood to be: (1) Christ&#8217;s announcement of his victory over evil to the fallen angels who await judgment for their role in leading the Noahic generation into sin; this proclamation occurred sometime between Christ&#8217;s death and ascension; or (2) Christ&#8217;s preaching of repentance through Noah to the unrighteous humans, now dead and confined in hell, who lived in the days of Noah. The latter is preferred because of the temporal indications in v. 20a and the wider argument of the book. These verses encourage Christians to stand for righteousness and try to influence their contemporaries for the gospel in spite of the suffering that may come to them. All who identify with them and their Savior will be saved from the coming judgment, just as in Noah&#8217;s day.</p>
<A NAME="337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=143><b>tn</b> This reflects a Greek participle, literally &#8220;having been disobedient formerly,&#8221; that refers to the &#8220;spirits&#8221; in v. 19. Many translations take this as adjectival describing the spirits (&#8220;who had once been disobedient&#8221;; cf. NASB, NIV, NKJV, NLT, NRSV, TEV), but the grammatical construction strongly favors an adverbial interpretation describing the time of the preaching, as reflected above.</p>
<A NAME="338"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=144><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the patience of God waited.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=145><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;in which,&#8221; referring to the ark; the referent (the ark) has been specified in the translation for clarity. Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started here in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="340"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=146><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;which also, [as] an antitype, now saves you, [that is] baptism.&#8221; Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started here in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="341"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=147><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the removal of the dirt of the flesh,&#8221; where flesh refers to the physical make-up of the body with no moral connotations. </p>
<A NAME="342"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=148><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;response&#8221;; &#8220;answer.&#8221;</p>
