<A NAME="240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=88><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;love the brotherhood.&#8221; The Greek term &#8220;brotherhood&#8221; is used in a broad sense to connote familial relationships within the family of God. BDAG 19 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#962;</font> 1 suggests &#8220;a fellowship,&#8221; but in the present context &#8220;love the fellowship of believers&#8221; could be taken to mean &#8220;love to participate in fellowship with believers,&#8221; whereas the present verse suggests the Christian community as a whole, in familial terms, is in view. This same word occurs in 5:9; there it has been translated &#8220;brothers and sisters.&#8221;</p>
