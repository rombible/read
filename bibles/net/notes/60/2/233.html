<A NAME="233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=81><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;when he visits.&#8221; <i>Grk</i> &#8220;in the day of visitation,&#8221; denoting a time when God intervenes directly in human affairs, either for blessing (Luke 1:68, 78; 7:16; 19:44) or for judgment (Isa 10:3; Jer 6:15). This phrase may be a quotation from Isa 10:3, in which case judgment is in view here. But blessing seems to be the point, since part of the motive for good behavior is winning the non-Christian over to the faith (as in 3:1; also apparently in 3:15; cf. Matt 5:16).</p>
