<A NAME="41"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=151><b>tc</b> Most <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> A P <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>) add <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#960;&#8050;&#961; &#7969;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Juper Jhmwn</font>, &#8220;for us&#8221;); others (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* 69 1505 <i>pc</i>) add <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#960;&#8050;&#961; &#8017;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Juper Jumwn</font>, &#8220;for you&#8221;), the first hand of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> also has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#952;&#945;&#957;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">apoqanonto&quot;</font>, &#8220;since he died&#8221;) instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#952;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">paqonto&quot;</font>, &#8220;since he suffered&#8221;). But the reading without <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#960;&#8050;&#961; &#7969;</font>/<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</font> best explains the rise of the other readings, for not only is there confusion as to which pronoun belongs here, but the longer readings, being clarifications, are evidently motivated readings. The shortest reading is found in important and early Alexandrian and Western witnesses (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>72</sup> B C <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 0285 323 1739) and is strongly preferred.</p>
<A NAME="42"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=152><b>sn</b> <i>Has finished with sin. </i>The last sentence in v. 1 may refer to Christ as the one who suffered in the flesh (cf. 2:21, 23; 3:18; 4:1a) and the latter part would then mean, &#8220;he has finished dealing with sin.&#8221; But it is more likely that it refers to the Christian who suffers unjustly (cf. 2:19-20; 3:14, 17). This shows that he has made a break with sin as vs. 2 describes.</p>
<A NAME="43"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=153><b>tn</b> This verse may give the purpose or result of their &#8220;arming&#8221; themselves as called for in v. 1b and then the translation would be: &#8220;so that you may spend the rest of your time&#8230;&#8221; But it is better to take it as explanatory of the last phrase in v. 1: what it means to be finished with sin.</p>
<A NAME="44"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=154><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the Gentiles,&#8221; used here of those who are not God&#8217;s people.</p>
<A NAME="45"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=155><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;to accomplish the desire of the Gentiles.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="46"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=156><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;having gone along,&#8221; referring to the readers&#8217; behavior in time past.</p>
<A NAME="47"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=157><b>tn</b> According to BDAG 857 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#972;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font> the term refers to a social gathering at which wine is served, hence &#8220;drinking parties&#8221; (cf. TEV, NASB). However, the collocation with the other terms in v. 4 suggests something less sophisticated and more along the lines of wild and frenzied drinking bouts.</p>
<A NAME="48"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=158><b>tn</b> The Greek words here all occur in the plural to describe their common practice in the past.</p>
<A NAME="49"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=159><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;in/by which,&#8221; referring to the change of behavior described in v. 3. The unbelievers are astonished by the readers&#8217; moral transformation. Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started here in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=160><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;are surprised, are taken aback.&#8221; The same verb occurs in 4:12.</p>
<A NAME="411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=161><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;blaspheming,&#8221; giving the result of their astonishment. Here the target of their &#8220;blasphemy/vilification&#8221; is not God but the Christian.</p>
<A NAME="412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=162><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;give an account to.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=163><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the one&#8221;; the referent (Jesus Christ) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=164><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;since for this purpose the gospel was preached even to the dead,&#8221; referring to the purpose described in the clause to follow in v. 6b.</p>
<A NAME="415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=165><b>sn</b> In context the phrase <i>those who are dead</i> refers to those now dead who had accepted the gospel while they were still living and had suffered persecution for their faith. Though they &#8220;suffered judgment&#8221; in this earthly life (i.e., they died, in the midst of physical abuse from the ungodly), they will enjoy life from God in the spiritual, heavenly realm because of the gospel (v. 6b). It clearly does not assume a second chance for conversion offered to unbelievers who had died; why would Peter urge people to suffer in this life for the sake of the gospel if he believed that mercy would be extended to all the dead in the hereafter (cf. 2:7-8; 4:1-5, 12-19)? </p>
<A NAME="416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=166><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;so that they may be judged&#8230;but may live.&#8221; Greek emphasizes the contrast between these two clauses more than can be easily expressed in English. </p>
<A NAME="417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=167><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;in their earthly lives,&#8221; since &#8220;flesh&#8221; here denotes the physical, earthly life. The phrase &#8220;in the flesh&#8221; is retained to preserve the links with 3:18 and 4:1 which use the same wording. </p>
<A NAME="418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=168><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;according to men.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=169><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;in spirit,&#8221; referring to the heavenly, eternal realm of existence (cf. 3:18). </p>
<A NAME="420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=170><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;according to God.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=171><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;for prayers.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=172><b>tn</b> The primary verb of v. 8 is a participle (&#8220;having&#8221;) but it continues the sense of command from v. 7.</p>
<A NAME="423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=173><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;constant.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=174><b>sn</b> The statement of v. 8b, <i>love covers a multitude of sins</i>, is proverbial: It is quoted from Prov 10:12 (cf. Jas 5:20). It speaks of the forbearance that comes with love: Christian love is patient and forgiving toward the offenses of a fellow Christian (Matt 18:21-22; 1 Cor 13:4-7).</p>
<A NAME="425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=175><b>tn</b> There is no main verb in this verse (&#8220;showing hospitality&#8221; translates the adjective <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#953;&#955;&#972;&#958;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</font> [<font face="Greektl">filoxenoi</font>]), but it continues the sense of command from v. 7.</p>
<A NAME="426"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=176><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;serving it to one another.&#8221; The primary verb is a participle but it continues the sense of command from v. 7.</p>
<A NAME="427"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=177><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;if anyone speaks &#8211; as God&#8217;s words.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="429"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=179><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;if anyone serves &#8211; with strength&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="430"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=180><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;is/are.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="431"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=181><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;do not be surprised, taken aback.&#8221; The same verb occurs in 4:4.</p>
<A NAME="432"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=182><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;at the burning among you, occurring to you for testing.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="433"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=183><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;in the revelation of his glory.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="434"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=184><b>tn</b> The verb &#8220;be glad&#8221; is used also in 1:6 and 1:8. The verbs of v. 13b are used together in Matt 5:12 and Rev 19:7.</p>
<A NAME="435"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=185><b>tc</b> Many <sc>mss, some of them important and early ([<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>] A P 33 81 323 945 1241 1739 <i>pm </i>bo), add <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#969;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai dunamew&quot;</font>; &#8220;and of power&#8221;) here. The shorter reading is supported by <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>72 </sup>B K L <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 049 <i>pm</i>). Although the evidence is evenly divided, the longer reading looks to be an explanatory or liturgical expansion on the text and for this reason should be considered secondary.</p>
<A NAME="436"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=186><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the Spirit of glory and of God.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="437"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=187><b>sn</b> A quotation taken from Isa 11:2.</p>
<A NAME="438"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=188><b>tn</b> The meaning of the Greek word used here is uncertain. It may mean &#8220;spy, informer,&#8221; &#8220;revolutionary,&#8221; or &#8220;defrauder, embezzler.&#8221; But the most likely meaning is &#8220;busybody, one who meddles in the affairs of others, troublesome meddler.&#8221; The translation given in the text is intended to suggest this general idea.</p>
<A NAME="439"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=189><b>tn</b> The verb is implied by the context but not expressed; <i>Grk</i> &#8220;but if as a Christian.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="440"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=190><b>tn</b> These are third-person imperatives in Greek (&#8220;if [one of you suffers] as a Christian, let him not be ashamed&#8230;let him glorify&#8221;), but have been translated as second-person verbs since this is smoother English idiom.</p>
<A NAME="441"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=191><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;in this name.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="445"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=195><b>tn</b> The personal references in v. 18 are generic singulars, but they have been changed to the plural in English to maintain consistency with the plurals of v. 17.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> A quotation from Prov 11:31 (LXX).</p>
