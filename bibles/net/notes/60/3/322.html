<A NAME="322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=128><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;do not fear their fear,&#8221; referring to those who cause their suffering. The phrase &#8220;their fear&#8221; may mean &#8220;what they fear&#8221; (subjective genitive), but in a situation of persecution it more likely means &#8220;fear of them&#8221; (objective genitive).</p>
