<A NAME="334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=140><b>sn</b> <i>Put to death in the flesh&#8230;made alive in the spirit. </i>The contrast of <i>flesh</i> and <i>spirit</i> is not between two parts of Christ&#8217;s person (material versus immaterial) but between two broader modes of existence: the realm of unregenerate earthly life versus eternal heavenly life. The reference may not be to the Holy Spirit directly, but indirectly, since the Spirit permeates and characterizes the spiritual mode of existence. However, <i>ExSyn </i>343 (n. 76) states &#8220;It is often objected that the Holy Spirit cannot be in view because the two datives of v 18 (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#945;&#961;&#954;&#943;</font>, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font> [<font face="Greektl">sarki</font>, <font face="Greektl">pneumati</font>]) would then have a different syntactical force (sphere, means). But if 1 Pet 3:18 is a hymnic or liturgical fragment, this can be no objection because of &#8216;poetic license&#8217;: poetry is replete with examples of grammatical and lexical license, not the least of which is the use of the same morpho-syntactic categories, in parallel lines, with entirely different senses (note, e.g., the dat. expressions in 1 Tim 3:16).&#8221;</p>
