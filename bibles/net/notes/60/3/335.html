<A NAME="335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=141><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;in which.&#8221; <i>ExSyn </i>343 notes: &#8220;The antecedent of the RP [relative pronoun] is by no means certain. Some take it to refer to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font> immediately preceding, the meaning of which might be either the Holy Spirit or the spiritual state. Others see the phrase as causal (&#8216;for which reason,&#8217; &#8216;because of this&#8217;), referring back to the entire clause, while still other scholars read the phrase as temporal (if so, it could be with or without an antecedent: &#8216;on which occasion&#8217; or &#8216;meanwhile&#8217;). None of these options is excluded by syntax. It may be significant, however, that every other time <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#8103;</font> is used in 1 Peter it bears an adverbial/conjunctive force (cf. 1:6; 2:12; 3:16 [here, temporal]; 4:4).&#8221; Also, because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started here in the translation.</p>
