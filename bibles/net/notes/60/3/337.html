<A NAME="337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=143><b>tn</b> This reflects a Greek participle, literally &#8220;having been disobedient formerly,&#8221; that refers to the &#8220;spirits&#8221; in v. 19. Many translations take this as adjectival describing the spirits (&#8220;who had once been disobedient&#8221;; cf. NASB, NIV, NKJV, NLT, NRSV, TEV), but the grammatical construction strongly favors an adverbial interpretation describing the time of the preaching, as reflected above.</p>
