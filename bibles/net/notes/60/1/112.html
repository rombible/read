The verb looks to be an explanatory gloss. But if no verb is present, this opens up the time frame in the author&#8217;s mind even more, since the conditional particle for both the first class condition and the fourth class condition is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ei</font>). That may well be what was on the author&#8217;s mind, as evidenced by some of his other allusions to suffering in this little letter (3:14, 17). NA<sup>27</sup> has the verb in brackets, indicating doubts as to its authenticity.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;Though now, for a little while if necessary, you may have to suffer.&#8221; </p>
