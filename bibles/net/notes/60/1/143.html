<a name="143"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=43><b>tn</b> Verses 22-23 are a single sentence in the Greek text. To improve clarity (and because contemporary English tends to use shorter sentences) these verses have been divided into three sentences in the translation. In addition, &#8220;So&#8221; has been supplied at the beginning of the second English sentence (v. 22b) to indicate the relationship with the preceding statement.</p>
