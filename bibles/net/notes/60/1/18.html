<a name="18"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=8><b>tn</b> There is no verb in the Greek text; either the optative (&#8220;be&#8221;) or the indicative (&#8220;is&#8221;) can be supplied. The meaning of the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8016;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#951;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">euloghtos</font>) and the author&#8217;s intention at this point in the epistle must both come into play to determine which is the preferred nuance. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8016;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#951;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> as an adjective can mean either that one is praised or that one is blessed, that is, in a place of favor and benefit. Two factors of the author&#8217;s style come into play. At this point the author is describing the reality of believers&#8217; salvation and will soon explain believers&#8217; necessary response; this is in emulation of Pauline style which generally follows the same logical order (although the author here discusses the reality in a much more compressed fashion). On the other hand, when imitating the Pauline greeting, which is normally verbless, the author inserts the optative (see v. 2 above). When considered as a whole, although a decision is difficult, the fact that the author in the immediate context has used the optative when imitating a Pauline stylized statement would argue for the optative here. The translation uses the term &#8220;blessed&#8221; in the sense &#8220;worthy of praise&#8221; as this is in keeping with the traditional translation of <i>berakah</i> psalms. Cf. also 2 Cor 1:3; Eph 1:3.</p>
