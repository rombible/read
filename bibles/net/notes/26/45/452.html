<A NAME="452"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1395><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;twenty-five thousand cubits&#8221; (i.e., 13.125 kilometers). The measuring units here are the Hebrew &#8220;long&#8221; cubit, consisting of a cubit (about 18 inches or 45 cm) and a handbreadth (about 3 inches or 7.5 cm), for a total of 21 inches (52.5 cm). Because modern readers are not familiar with the cubit as a unit of measurement, and due to the additional complication of the &#8220;long&#8221; cubit as opposed to the regular cubit, all measurements have been converted to American standard miles (one mile = 5,280 feet), with the Hebrew measurements and the metric equivalents given in the notes.</p>
