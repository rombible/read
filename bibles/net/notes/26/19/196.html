<A NAME="196"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=514><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text reads &#8220;knew,&#8221; but is apparently the result of a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;</font>-<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;</font> (<i>dalet-resh</i>) confusion. For a defense of the emendation, see L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 1:284. However, Allen retains the reading &#8220;widows&#8221; as the object of the verb, which he understands in the sense of &#8220;do harm to,&#8221; and translates the line: &#8220;He did harm to women by making them widows&#8221; (p. 282). The line also appears to be lacking a beat for the meter of the poem.</p>
