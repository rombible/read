<A NAME="198"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=516><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;They put him in a neck stock with hooks.&#8221; The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sugar</font>), translated &#8220;collar,&#8221; occurs only here in the Bible. L. C. Allen and D. I. Block point out a Babylonian cognate that refers to a device for transporting prisoners of war that held them by their necks (D. I. Block, <i>Ezekiel </i>[NICOT], 1:597, n. 35; L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>[WBC], 1:284). Based on the Hebrew root, the traditional rendering had been &#8220;cage&#8221; (cf. ASV, NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV). </p>
