<A NAME="192"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=510><b>sn</b> <i>Lions</i> probably refer to Judahite royalty and/or nobility. The lioness appears to symbolize the Davidic dynasty, though some see the referent as Hamutal, the wife of Josiah and mother of Jehoahaz and Zedekiah. Gen 49:9 seems to be the background for Judah being compared to lions. </p>
