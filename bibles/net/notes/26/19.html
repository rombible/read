<A NAME="191"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=509><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lift up.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="192"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=510><b>sn</b> <i>Lions</i> probably refer to Judahite royalty and/or nobility. The lioness appears to symbolize the Davidic dynasty, though some see the referent as Hamutal, the wife of Josiah and mother of Jehoahaz and Zedekiah. Gen 49:9 seems to be the background for Judah being compared to lions. </p>
<A NAME="193"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=511><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;a man.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="194"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=512><b>sn</b> The description applies to king Jehoahaz (2 Kgs 23:31-34; Jer 22:10-12). </p>
<A NAME="195"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=513><b>sn</b> The identity of this second lion is unclear; the referent is probably Jehoiakim or Zedekiah. If the lioness is Hamutal, then Zedekiah is the lion described here.</p>
<A NAME="196"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=514><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text reads &#8220;knew,&#8221; but is apparently the result of a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;</font>-<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;</font> (<i>dalet-resh</i>) confusion. For a defense of the emendation, see L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 1:284. However, Allen retains the reading &#8220;widows&#8221; as the object of the verb, which he understands in the sense of &#8220;do harm to,&#8221; and translates the line: &#8220;He did harm to women by making them widows&#8221; (p. 282). The line also appears to be lacking a beat for the meter of the poem.</p>
<A NAME="197"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=515><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text reads &#8220;widows&#8221; instead of &#8220;strongholds,&#8221; apparently due to a confusion of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;</font><i> </i>(<i>resh</i>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font> (<i>lamed</i>). L. C. Allen (<i>Ezekiel </i>[WBC], 1:284) favors the traditional text, understanding &#8220;widows&#8221; in the sense of &#8220;women made widows.&#8221; D. I. Block, (<i>Ezekiel </i>[NICOT], 1:602) also defends the Hebrew text, arguing that the image is that of a dominant male lion who takes over the pride and by copulating with the females lays claim to his predecessor&#8217;s &#8220;widows.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="198"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=516><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;They put him in a neck stock with hooks.&#8221; The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sugar</font>), translated &#8220;collar,&#8221; occurs only here in the Bible. L. C. Allen and D. I. Block point out a Babylonian cognate that refers to a device for transporting prisoners of war that held them by their necks (D. I. Block, <i>Ezekiel </i>[NICOT], 1:597, n. 35; L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>[WBC], 1:284). Based on the Hebrew root, the traditional rendering had been &#8220;cage&#8221; (cf. ASV, NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV). </p>
<A NAME="199"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=517><b>tc</b> The term in the MT occurs only here and in Eccl 9:12 where it refers to a net for catching fish. The LXX translates this as &#8220;prison,&#8221; which assumes a confusion of <i>dalet</i> and <i>resh</i> took place in the MT. </p>
<A NAME="1910"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=518><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text reads &#8220;in your blood,&#8221; but most emend to &#8220;in your vineyard,&#8221; assuming a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;</font>-<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;</font> (<i>beth-kaph</i>) confusion. See L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 1:284. Another attractive emendation assumes a faulty word division and yields the reading &#8220;like a vine full of tendrils, which/because&#8230;&#8221;; see D. I. Block, <i>Ezekiel </i>(NICOT), 1:607, n. 68.</p>
<A NAME="1911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=519><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;fit&#8221; does not occur in the Hebrew text. </p>
<A NAME="1912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=520><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and it was seen by its height and by the abundance of its branches.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=521><b>sn</b> The east wind symbolizes the Babylonians.</p>
<A NAME="1914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=522><b>sn</b> This metaphor depicts the Babylonian exile of the Davidic dynasty.</p>
<A NAME="1915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=523><b>tn</b> The verse describes the similar situation recorded in Judg 9:20. </p>
