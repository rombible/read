<A NAME="181"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=470><b>tn</b> This word only occurs here and in the parallel passage in Jer 31:29-30 in the Qal stem and in Eccl 10:10 in the Piel stem. In the latter passage it refers to the bluntness of an ax that has not been sharpened. Here the idea is of the &#8220;bluntness&#8221; of the teeth, not from having ground them down due to the bitter taste of sour grapes but to the fact that they have lost their &#8220;edge,&#8221; &#8220;bite,&#8221; or &#8220;sharpness&#8221; because they are numb from the sour taste. For this meaning for the word, see W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i> (Hermeneia), 2:197. </p>
