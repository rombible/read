<A NAME="3621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1126><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and I will do that which in my statutes you will walk.&#8221; The awkward syntax (verb &#8220;to do, act&#8221; + accusative sign + relative clause + prepositional phrase + second person verb) is unique, though Eccl 3:14 contains a similar construction. In the last line of that verse we read that &#8220;God acts so that (relative pronoun) they fear before him.&#8221; However, unlike Ezek 36:27, the statement has no accusative sign before the relative pronoun.</p>
