<A NAME="738"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=220><b>tc</b> The Hebrew word &#8220;the chain&#8221; occurs only here in the OT. The reading of the LXX (&#8220;and they will make carnage&#8221;) seems to imply a Hebrew text of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1463;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">habbattoq</font>, &#8220;disorder, slaughter&#8221;) instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">haratoq</font>, &#8220;the chain&#8221;). The LXX is also translating the verb as a third person plural future and taking this as the end of the preceding verse. As M. Greenberg (<i>Ezekiel </i>[AB], 1:154) notes, this may refer to a chain for a train of exiles but &#8220;the context does not speak of exile but of the city&#8217;s fall. The versions guess desperately and we can do little better.&#8221;</p>
