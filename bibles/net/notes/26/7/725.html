<A NAME="725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=207><b>tc</b> The translation follows the LXX for the first line of the verse, although the LXX has lost the second line due to homoioteleuton (similar endings of the clauses). The MT reads &#8220;The seller will not return to the sale.&#8221; This Hebrew reading has been construed as a reference to land redemption, the temporary sale of the use of property, with property rights returned to the seller in the year of Jubilee. But the context has no other indicator that land redemption is in view. If correct, the LXX evidence suggests that one of the cases of &#8220;the customer&#8221; has been replaced by &#8220;the seller&#8221; in the MT, perhaps due to hoimoioarcton (similar beginnings of the words). </p>
