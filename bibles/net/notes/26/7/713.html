<A NAME="713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=195><b>tc</b> With different vowels the verb rendered &#8220;it has awakened&#8221; would be the noun &#8220;the end,&#8221; as in &#8220;the end is upon you.&#8221; The verb would represent a phonetic wordplay. The noun by virtue of repetition would continue to reinforce the idea of the end. Whether verb or noun, this is the only instance to occur with this preposition. </p>
