<A NAME="735"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=217><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;he set up the beauty of his ornament as pride.&#8221; The verb may be repointed as plural without changing the consonantal text. The Syriac reads &#8220;their ornaments&#8221; (plural), implying <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1491;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">edyam</font>) rather than <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1491;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">edyo</font>) and meaning &#8220;they were proud of their beautiful ornaments.&#8221; This understands &#8220;ornaments&#8221; in the common sense of women&#8217;s jewelry, which then were used to make idols. The singular suffix &#8220;his ornaments&#8221; would refer to using items from the temple treasury to make idols. D. I. Block points out the foreshadowing of Ezek 16:17 which, with Rashi and the Targum, supports the understanding that this is a reference to temple items. See D. I. Block, <i>Ezekiel </i>(NICOT), 1:265.</p>
