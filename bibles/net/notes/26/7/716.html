<A NAME="716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=198><b>tc</b> The LXX reads &#8220;neither tumult nor birth pains.&#8221; The LXX varies at many points from the MT in this chapter. The context suggests that one or both of these would be present on a day of judgment, thus favoring the MT. Perhaps more significant is the absence of &#8220;the mountains&#8221; in the LXX. If the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;</font> (<i>resh</i>) in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">harim</font>, &#8220;the mountains&#8221; not &#8220;on the mountains&#8221;) were a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;</font> (<i>dalet</i>), which is a common letter confusion, then it could be from the same root as the previous word, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1461;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hed</font>), meaning &#8220;the day is near &#8211; with destruction, not joyful shouting.&#8221; </p>
