<A NAME="714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=196><b>tc</b> For this entire verse, the LXX has only &#8220;the end is come.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> In each of the three cases of the verb translated with forms of &#8220;to come,&#8221; the form may either be a participle (&#8220;comes/is coming&#8221;) or a perfect (&#8220;has come&#8221;). Either form would indicate that the end is soon to arrive. This last form appears also to be feminine, although &#8220;end&#8221; is masculine. This shift may be looking ahead to the next verse, whose first noun (&#8220;Doom&#8221;) is feminine.</p>
