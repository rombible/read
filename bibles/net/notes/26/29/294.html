<A NAME="294"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=927><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;jackals,&#8221; but many medieval Hebrew <sc>mss read correctly &#8220;the serpent.&#8221; The Hebrew term appears to refer to a serpent in Exod 7:9-10, 12; Deut 32:33; and Ps 91:13. It also refers to large creatures that inhabit the sea (Gen 1:21; Ps 148:7). In several passages it is associated with the sea or with the multiheaded sea monster Leviathan (Job 7:12; Ps 74:13; Isa 27:1; 51:9). Because of the Egyptian setting of this prophecy and the reference to the creature&#8217;s scales (v. 4), many understand a crocodile to be the referent here (e.g., NCV &#8220;a great crocodile&#8221;; TEV &#8220;you monster crocodile&#8221;; CEV &#8220;a giant crocodile&#8221;).</p>
