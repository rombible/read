<A NAME="2910"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=933><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;you caused to stand for them all their hips.&#8221; An emendation which switches two letters but is supported by the LXX yields the reading &#8220;you caused all their hips to shake.&#8221; See L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 2:103. In 2 Kgs 18:21 and Isa 36:6 trusting in the Pharaoh is compared to leaning on a staff. The oracle may reflect Hophra&#8217;s attempt to aid Jerusalem (Jer 37:5-8). </p>
