<A NAME="41"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=106><b>sn</b> Ancient Near Eastern bricks were 10 to 24 inches long and 6 to 13 1/2 inches wide.</p>
<A NAME="42"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=107><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;draw.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="43"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=108><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;a barricade.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="44"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=109><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;set camps against it.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="45"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=110><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;a griddle,&#8221; that is, some sort of plate for cooking. </p>
<A NAME="46"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=111><b>tn</b> That is, a symbolic object lesson. </p>
<A NAME="47"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=112><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;punishment&#8221; (also in vv. 5, 6).</p>
<A NAME="48"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=113><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;I have assigned for you that the years of their iniquity be the number of days.&#8221; Num 14:33-34 is an example of the reverse, where the days were converted into years, the number of days spying out the land becoming the number of years of the wilderness wanderings.</p>
<A NAME="49"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=114><b>tc</b> The LXX reads &#8220;190 days.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b><sup> </sup>The significance of the number 390<i> </i>is not clear. The best explanation is that &#8220;days&#8221; are used figuratively for years and the number refers to the years of the sinfulness of Israel during the period of the First Temple. Some understand the number to refer to the length of the division of the northern and southern kingdoms down to the fall of Jerusalem (931-586 <sc>b.c.), but this adds up to only 345 years. </p>
<A NAME="410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=115><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;When you have carried the iniquity of the house of Israel,&#8221; and continuing on to the next verse.</p>
<A NAME="411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=116><b>sn</b> The number 40<i> </i>may refer in general to the period of Judah&#8217;s exile using the number of years Israel was punished in the wilderness. In this case, however, one would need to translate, &#8220;you will bear the punishment of the house of Judah.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=117><b>sn</b> The action surely refers to a series of daily acts rather than to a continuous period.</p>
<A NAME="413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=118><b>sn</b> <i>Wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt</i>. All these foods were common in Mesopotamia where Ezekiel was exiled.</p>
<A NAME="414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=119><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;bread.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=120><b>tc</b> The LXX reads &#8220;190 days.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=121><b>sn</b> <i>Eight ounces </i>(<i>Heb</i> &#8220;twenty shekels&#8221;). The standards for weighing money varied considerably in the ancient Near East, but the generally accepted weight for the shekel is 11.5 grams (0.4 ounce). This makes the weight of grain about 230 grams here (8 ounces).</p>
<A NAME="417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=122><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from time to time.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=123><b>sn</b> <i>A pint and a half</i> [<i>Heb</i> &#8220;one-sixth of a hin&#8221;]. One-sixth of a hin was a quantity of liquid equal to about 1.3 pints or 0.6 liters.</p>
<A NAME="419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=124><b>sn</b> Human waste was to remain outside the camp of the Israelites according to Deut 23:15.</p>
<A NAME="420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=125><b>sn</b> <i>Unclean food among the nations</i>. Lands outside of Israel were considered unclean (Josh 22:19; Amos 7:17).</p>
<A NAME="421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=126><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term refers to sacrificial meat not eaten by the appropriate time (Lev 7:18; 19:7). </p>
<A NAME="422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=127><b>tn</b> <i>Heb,</i> &#8220;break the staff of bread.&#8221; The bread supply is compared to a staff that one uses for support.</p>

<A NAME="424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=129><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;in their punishment.&#8221; Ezek 4:16-17 alludes to Lev 26:26, 39. The phrase &#8220;in/for [a person&#8217;s] iniquity&#8221; occurs fourteen times in Ezekiel: here, 3:18, 19; 7:13, 16; 18: 17, 18, 19, 20; 24:23; 33:6, 8, 9; 39:23. The Hebrew word for &#8220;iniquity&#8221; may also mean the &#8220;punishment for iniquity.&#8221;</p>
