<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=648><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;will you judge.&#8221; Here the imperfect form of the verb is probably used with a desiderative nuance. Addressed to the prophet, &#8220;judge&#8221; means to warn of or pronounce God&#8217;s impending judgment upon the city. See 20:4. </p>
<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=649><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;bloody city&#8221; is used of Nineveh in Nah 3:1. </p>
<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=650><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;her time&#8221;; this refers to the time of impending judgment (see the note on &#8220;doom&#8221; in v. 4). </p>
<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=651><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;you have brought near your days.&#8221; The expression &#8220;bring near your days&#8221; appears to be an adaptation of the idiom &#8220;days draw near,&#8221; which is used to indicate that an event, such as death, is imminent (see Gen 27:41; 47:29; Deut 31:14; 1 Kgs 2:1; Ezek 12:23). Here &#8220;your days&#8221; probably refers to the days of the personified city&#8217;s life, which was about to come to an end through God&#8217;s judgment. </p>
<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=652><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and you have come to your years.&#8221; This appears to mean that she has arrived at the time when her years (i.e., life) would end, though it may mean that her years of punishment will begin. Because &#8220;day&#8221; and &#8220;time&#8221; are so closely associated in the immediate context (see 21:25, 29) some prefer to emend the text and read &#8220;you have brought near your time.&#8221; See L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 2:31, as well as the translator&#8217;s note on verse 3.</p>
<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=653><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb is a prophetic perfect, emphasizing that the action is as good as done from the speaker&#8217;s perspective. </p>
<A NAME="227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=654><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;unclean of name.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=655><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Look! The princes of Israel, each according to his arm, were in you in order to shed blood.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=656><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;treated lightly, cursed.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=657><b>tn</b> Widows and orphans are often coupled together in the OT (Deut 14:29; 16:11, 14; 24:19-21; 26:12-13; Jer 7:6; 22:3). They represented all who were poor and vulnerable to economic exploitation.</p>
<A NAME="2211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=658><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;men of slander are in you in order to shed blood.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=659><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and on the mountains they eat within you.&#8221; The mountains mentioned here were the site of pagan sacrifices. See 18:6. </p>
<A NAME="2213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=660><b>sn</b> This statement introduces vv. 10-11 and refers in general terms to the sexual sins described there. For the legal background of vv. 10-11, see Lev 18:7-20; 20:10-21; Deut 22:22-23, 30; 27:22. </p>
<A NAME="2214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=661><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the nakedness of a father one uncovers within you.&#8221; The ancient versions read the verb as plural (&#8220;they uncover&#8221;). If the singular is retained, it must be taken as indefinite and representative of the entire group. The idiomatic expression &#8220;uncover the nakedness&#8221; refers here to sexual intercourse (cf. Lev 18:6). To uncover a father&#8217;s nakedness could include sexual relations with one&#8217;s own mother (Lev 18:7), but more likely it refers to having intercourse with another wife of one&#8217;s father, such as a stepmother (Lev 18:8; cf. Gen 35:22; 49:4). </p>
<A NAME="2215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=662><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;(one who is) unclean due to the impurity they humble within you.&#8221; The use of the verb &#8220;to humble&#8221; suggests that these men forced themselves upon women during menstruation. Having sexual relations with a woman during her period was forbidden by the Law (Lev 18:19; 20:18). </p>
<A NAME="2216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=663><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;a man.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=664><b>tn</b> The verb is the same one used in verse 10b and suggests forcible sexual violation of the woman. </p>
<A NAME="2218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=665><b>sn</b> Sexual relations with one&#8217;s half-sister may be primarily in view here. See Lev 18:9; 20:17. </p>
<A NAME="2219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=666><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;usury and interest you take.&#8221; See 18:13, 17. This kind of economic exploitation violated the law given in Lev 25:36. </p>
<A NAME="2220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=667><b>sn</b> Forgetting the Lord is also addressed in Deut 6:12; 8:11, 14; Jer 3:21; 13:25; Ezek 23:35; Hos 2:15; 8:14; 13:6. </p>
<A NAME="2221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=668><b>tn</b> The second person verb forms are feminine singular in Hebrew, indicating that the personified city is addressed here as representing its citizens. </p>
<A NAME="2222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=669><b>sn</b> This gesture apparently expresses mourning and/or anger (see 6:11; 21:14, 17). </p>
<A NAME="2223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=670><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the blood which was in you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=671><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;stand.&#8221; The heart here stands for the emotions; Jerusalem would panic in the face of God&#8217;s judgment. </p>
<A NAME="2225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=672><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;in the days when I act against you.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=673><b>sn</b> The ultimate purpose of divine judgment is to purify the covenant community of its sins.</p>
<A NAME="2227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=674><b>tc</b> Several ancient versions read the verb as first person, in which case the Lord refers to how his people&#8217;s sin brings disgrace upon him. For a defense of the Hebrew text, see D. I. Block, <i>Ezekiel </i>(NICOT), 1:712, n. 68, and M. Greenberg, <i>Ezekiel </i>(AB), 2:457-58. </p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;within yourself&#8221; is the same as the several previous occurrences of &#8220;within you&#8221; but adjusted to fit this clause which is the culmination of the series of indictments. </p>
<A NAME="2228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=675><b>tn</b> For similar imagery, see Isa 1:21-26; Jer 6:27-30. </p>
<A NAME="2229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=676><b>tn</b> The Hebrew second person pronoun is masculine plural here and in vv. 19b-21, indicating that the people are being addressed. </p>
<A NAME="2230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=677><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="2231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=678><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will put.&#8221; No object is supplied in the Hebrew, prompting many to emend the text to &#8220;I will blow.&#8221; See <i>BHS</i> and verse 21.</p>
<A NAME="2232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=679><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;that is not cleansed&#8221;; the LXX reads &#8220;that is not drenched,&#8221; which assumes a different vowel pointing as well as the loss of a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;</font> (<i>mem</i>) due to haplography. In light of the following reference to showers, the reading of the LXX certainly fits the context well. For a defense of the emendation, see L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 2:32. Yet the MT is not an unreasonable reading since uncleanness in the land also fits the context, and a poetic connection between rain and the land being uncleansed may be feasible since washing with water is elsewhere associated with cleansing (Num 8:7; 31:23; Ps 51:7).</p>
<A NAME="2233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=680><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;in a day of anger.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=681><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a conspiracy of her prophets is in her midst.&#8221; The LXX reads &#8220;whose princes&#8221; rather than &#8220;a conspiracy of prophets.&#8221; The prophets are mentioned later in the paragraph (v. 28). If one follows the LXX in verse 25, then five distinct groups are mentioned in vv. 25-29: princes, priests, officials, prophets, and the people of the land. For a defense of the Septuagintal reading, see L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 2:32, and D. I. Block, <i>Ezekiel </i>(NICOT), 1:720, n. 4. </p>
<A NAME="2235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=682><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;her widows they have multiplied.&#8221; The statement alludes to their murderous acts. </p>
<A NAME="2236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=683><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;between the consecrated and the common.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=684><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;hide their eyes from.&#8221; The idiom means to disregard or ignore something or someone (see Lev 20:4; 1 Sam 12:3; Prov 28:27; Isa 1:15). </p>
<A NAME="2238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=685><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;her prophets coat for themselves with whitewash.&#8221; The expression may be based on Ezek 13:10-15. </p>
<A NAME="2239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=686><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and the foreigner they have oppressed without justice.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=687><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;I did not find.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=688><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;their way on their head I have placed.&#8221; </p>
