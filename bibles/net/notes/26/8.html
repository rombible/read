<A NAME="82"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=226><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;power.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Hand</i> in the OT can refer metaphorically to power, authority, or influence. In Ezekiel God&#8217;s <i>hand</i> being on the prophet is regularly associated with communication or a vision from God (3:14, 22; 8:1; 37:1; 40:1).</p>
<A NAME="83"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=227><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fell upon me there,&#8221; that is, God&#8217;s influence came over him. </p>

<A NAME="85"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=229><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;fire&#8221; rather than &#8220;man,&#8221; the reading of the LXX. The nouns are very similar in Hebrew. </p>
<A NAME="86"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=230><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;what appeared to be his waist and downwards was fire.&#8221; The LXX omits &#8220;what appeared to be,&#8221; reading &#8220;from his waist to below was fire.&#8221; Suggesting that &#8220;like what appeared to be&#8221; belongs before &#8220;fire,&#8221; D. I. Block (<i>Ezekiel </i>[NICOT], 1:277) points out the resulting poetic symmetry of form with the next line as followed in the translation here. </p>
<A NAME="87"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=231><b>tc</b> The LXX omits &#8220;like a brightness.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="89"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=233><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term is normally used as an architectural term in describing the pattern of the tabernacle or temple or a representation of it (see Exod 25:8; 1 Chr 28:11).</p>

<A NAME="817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=241><b>sn</b> These engravings were prohibited in the Mosaic law (Deut 4:16-18).</p>
<A NAME="818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=242><b>sn</b> Note the contrast between these <i>seventy men</i> who represented Israel and the seventy elders who ate the covenant meal before God, inaugurating the covenant relationship (Exod 24:1, 9).</p>
<A NAME="819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=243><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word occurs only here in the OT.</p>
<A NAME="820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=244><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the room of his images.&#8221; The adjective &#8220;idolatrous&#8221; has been supplied in the translation for clarity.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This type of image is explicitly prohibited in the Mosaic law (Lev 26:1).</p>
<A NAME="821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=245><b>tn</b> Given the context this could be understood as a shock, e.g., idiomatically &#8220;Good grief! I saw&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=246><b>sn</b> The worship of <i>Tammuz</i> included the observation of the annual death and descent into the netherworld of the god Dumuzi.

<A NAME="824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=248><b>sn</b> The priests prayed to God <i>between the porch and the altar</i> on fast days (Joel 2:17). This is the location where Zechariah was murdered (Matt 23:35).</p>
<A NAME="825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=249><b>tc</b> The LXX reads &#8220;twenty&#8221; instead of twenty-five, perhaps because of the association of the number twenty with the Mesopotamian sun god Shamash. </p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;exactly twenty-five.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=250><b>sn</b> The temple faced east.</p>

<A NAME="828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=252><b>tn</b> It is not clear what the practice of &#8220;holding a branch to the nose&#8221; indicates. A possible parallel is the Syrian relief of a king holding a flower to his nose as he worships the stars (<i>ANEP</i> 281). See L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 1:145-46. The LXX glosses the expression as &#8220;Behold, they are like mockers.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=253><b>tn</b> The meaning of the Hebrew term is primarily emotional: &#8220;to pity,&#8221; which in context implies an action, as in being moved by pity in order to spare them from the horror of their punishment. </p>
