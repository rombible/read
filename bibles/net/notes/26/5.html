<A NAME="51"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=130><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word occurs only here in the OT. </p>
<A NAME="52"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=131><b>tn</b> <i>Heb,</i> &#8220;pass (it) over your head and your beard.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="53"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=132><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from there a few in number.&#8221; The word &#8220;strands&#8221; has been supplied in the translation for clarification.</p>
<A NAME="54"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=133><b>sn</b> Objects could be carried in the end of a garment (Hag 2:12).</p>
<A NAME="55"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=134><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;into the midst of&#8221; (so KJV, ASV). This phrase has been left untranslated for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="56"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=135><b>sn</b> <i>The nations</i> are subject to a natural law according to Gen 9; see also Amos 1:3-2:3; Jonah 1:2.</p>
<A NAME="57"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=136><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;she defied my laws, becoming wicked more than the nations, and [she defied] my statutes [becoming wicked] more than the countries around her.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="58"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=137><b>sn</b> One might conclude that the subject of the plural verbs is the nations/countries, but the context (vv. 5-6a) indicates that the people of Jerusalem are in view. The text shifts from using the feminine singular (referring to personified Jerusalem) to the plural (referring to Jerusalem&#8217;s residents). See L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 1:73.</p>
<A NAME="59"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=138><b>tn</b> Traditionally this difficult form has been derived from a hypothetical root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hamon</font>), supposedly meaning &#8220;be in tumult/uproar,&#8221; but such a verb occurs nowhere else. It is more likely that it is to be derived from a root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">manon</font>), meaning &#8220;disdain&#8221; (see L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>[WBC], 1:52). A derivative from this root is used in Prov 29:21 of a rebellious servant. See <i>HALOT</i> 600 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font>.</p>
<A NAME="510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=139><b>sn</b> <i>You are more arrogant than the nations around you</i>. Israel is accused of being worse than the nations in Ezek 16:27; 2 Kgs 21:11; Jer 2:11. </p>
<A NAME="511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=140><b>tc</b> Some Hebrew <sc>mss and the Syriac omit the words &#8220;not even.&#8221; In this case they are being accused of following the practices of the surrounding nations. See Ezek 11:12.</p>
<A NAME="512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=141><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I challenge you.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;I am against you&#8221; may be a formula for challenging someone to combat or a duel. See D. I. Block, <i>Ezekiel </i>(NICOT), 1:201-2, and P. Humbert, &#8220;Die Herausforderungsformel &#8216;<font face="Hebrewtl">h!nn#n' ?l?K&gt;</font>,&#8217;&#8221; <i>ZAW 45</i> (1933): 101-8. The Hebrew text switches to a second feminine singular form here, indicating that personified Jerusalem is addressed (see vv. 5-6a). The address to Jerusalem continues through v. 15. In vv. 16-17 the second masculine plural is used, as the people are addressed.</p>
<A NAME="513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=142><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text uses wordplay here to bring out the appropriate nature of God&#8217;s judgment. &#8220;Execute&#8221; translates the same Hebrew verb translated &#8220;carried out&#8221; (literally meaning &#8220;do&#8221;) in v. 7, while &#8220;judgment&#8221; in v. 8 and &#8220;regulations&#8221; in v. 7 translate the same Hebrew noun (meaning &#8220;regulations&#8221; or in some cases &#8220;judgments&#8221; executed on those who break laws). The point seems to be this: God would &#8220;carry out judgments&#8221; against those who refused to &#8220;carry out&#8221; his &#8220;laws.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=143><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the sight of the nations.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b><sup> </sup>This is one of the ironies of the passage. The Lord set Israel among the nations for honor and praise as they would be holy and obey God&#8217;s law as told in Ezek 5:5 and Deut 26:16-19. The practice of these laws and statutes would make the peoples consider Israel wise. (See Deut 4:5-8, where the words for laws and statutes are the same as those used here). Since Israel did not obey, they are made a different kind of object lesson to the nations, not by their obedience but in their punishment as told in Ezek 5:8 and Deut 29:24-29. Yet Deut 30 goes on to say that when they remember the cursings and blessings of the covenant and repent, God will restore them from the nations to which they have been scattered.</p>
<A NAME="515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=144><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;abominable idols.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=145><b>tn</b> In context &#8220;you&#8221; refers to the city of Jerusalem. To make this clear for the modern reader, &#8220;Jerusalem&#8221; has been supplied in the translation in apposition to &#8220;you.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This cannibalism would occur as a result of starvation due to the city being besieged. It is one of the judgments threatened for a covenant law violation (Lev 26:29; see also Deut 28:53; Jer 19:9; Lam 2:20; Zech 11:9).</p>
<A NAME="517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=146><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all of your survivors.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=147><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to every wind.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=148><b>tn</b> The meaning of the Hebrew term is primarily emotional: &#8220;to pity,&#8221; which in context implies an action, as in being moved by pity in order to spare them from the horror of their punishment. </p>
<A NAME="520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=149><b>sn</b> The judgment of <i>plague</i> and <i>famine</i> comes from the covenant curse (Lev 26:25-26). As in v. 10, the city of Jerusalem is figuratively addressed here.</p>
<A NAME="521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=150><b>sn</b> Judgment by <i>plague</i>, <i>famine</i>, and <i>sword</i> occurs in Jer 21:9; 27:13; Ezek 6:11, 12; 7:15. </p>
<A NAME="522"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=151><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;calm myself.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=152><b>tn</b> The Hebrew noun translated &#8220;jealousy&#8221; is used in the human realm to describe suspicion of adultery (Num 5:14ff.; Prov 6:34). Since Israel&#8217;s relationship with God was often compared to a marriage this term is appropriate here. The term occurs elsewhere in Ezekiel in 8:3, 5; 16:38, 42; 23:25.</p>
<A NAME="524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=153><b>tc</b> This reading is supported by the versions and by the Dead Sea Scrolls (11QEzek). Most Masoretic Hebrew <sc>mss read &#8220;it will be,&#8221; but if the final <i>he</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;</font>) is read as a <i>mater lectionis</i>, as it can be with the second masculine singular perfect, then they are in agreement. In either case the subject refers to Jerusalem.</p>
<A NAME="525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=154><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word occurs only here in the OT. A related verb means &#8220;revile, taunt&#8221; (see Ps 44:16).</p>
<A NAME="526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=155><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;discipline and devastation.&#8221; These words are omitted in the Old Greek. The first term pictures Jerusalem as a recipient or example of divine discipline; the second depicts her as a desolate ruin (see Ezek 6:14). </p>
<A NAME="527"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=156><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in anger and in fury and in rebukes of fury.&#8221; The heaping up of synonyms emphasizes the degree of God&#8217;s anger.</p>
<A NAME="528"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=157><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word carries the basic idea of &#8220;bad, displeasing, injurious,&#8221; but when used of weapons has the nuance &#8220;deadly&#8221; (see Ps 144:10).</p>
<A NAME="529"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=158><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;which are/were to destroy.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="530"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=159><b>tn</b> The language of this verse may have been influenced by Deut 32:23. </p>
<A NAME="531"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=160><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;which were to destroy those whom I will send to destroy you&#8221; (cf. NASB). </p>
<A NAME="532"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=161><b>tn</b> <i>Heb,</i> &#8220;break the staff of bread.&#8221; The bread supply is compared to a staff that one uses for support. See 4:16, as well as the covenant curse in Lev 26:26.</p>
<A NAME="533"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=162><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;will bereave you.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="534"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=163><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;will pass through you.&#8221; This threat recalls the warning of Lev 26:22, 25 and Deut 32:24-25. </p>
