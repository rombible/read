<BODY ><p>
<A NAME="61"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=164><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;set your face against.&#8221; The expression occurs at the beginning of Ezekiel&#8217;s prophetic oracles in Ezek 13:17; 20:46; 21:2; 25:2; 28:21; 29:2; 35:2; 38:2.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b><sup> </sup>Based on comparison to a similar expression in Ugaritic, the phrase may imply that Ezekiel was to actually go to these locations to deliver his message. </p>
<A NAME="62"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=165><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;mountains of Israel&#8221; occurs only in the book of Ezekiel (6:2, 3; 19:9; 33:28; 34:13, 14; 35:12; 36:1, 4, 8; 37:22; 38:8; 39:2, 4, 17). The expression refers to the whole land of Israel.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The mountainous terrain of <i>Israel</i> would contrast with the exiles&#8217; habitat in the river valley of Babylonia.</p>
<A NAME="63"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=166><b>tn</b> The introductory formula &#8220;Hear the word of the sovereign <sc>Lord&#8221; parallels a pronouncement delivered by the herald of a king (2 Kgs 18:28). </p>
<A NAME="64"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=167><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Look I, I am bringing.&#8221; The repetition of the pronoun draws attention to the speaker. The construction also indicates that the action is soon to come; the Lord is &#8220;about to bring a sword against&#8221; them.</p>
<A NAME="65"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=168><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term refers to elevated platforms where pagan sacrifices were performed.</p>
<A NAME="66"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=169><b>tn</b> Thirty-nine of the forty-eight biblical occurrences of this Hebrew word are found in the book of Ezekiel.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b><sup> </sup>This verse is probably based on Lev 26:30 in which God forecasts that he will destroy their high places, cut off their incense altars, and set their corpses by the corpses of their idols. </p>
<A NAME="67"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=170><b>tc</b> This first sentence, which explains the meaning of the last sentence of the previous verse, does not appear in the LXX and may be an instance of a marginal explanatory note making its way into the text. </p>
<A NAME="68"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=171><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb translated &#8220;wiped out&#8221; is used to describe the judgment of the Flood (Gen 6:7; 7:4, 23).</p>
<A NAME="69"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=172><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>you will know that I am the <sc>Lord</></i> concludes over sixty oracles in the book of Ezekiel and indicates the ultimate goal of God&#8217;s action. The phrase is often used in the book of Exodus as well (Exod 7:5; 14:4, 18). By Ezekiel&#8217;s day the people had forgotten that the Lord (Yahweh) was their covenant God and had turned to other gods. They had to be reminded that Yahweh alone deserved to be worshiped because only he possessed the power to meet their needs. Through judgment and eventually deliverance, Israel would be reminded that Yahweh alone held their destiny in his hands. </p>
<A NAME="610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=173><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;when you have fugitives from the sword among the nations, when you are scattered among the lands.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=174><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;they will realize&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text; they are added here for stylistic reasons since this clause assumes the previous verb &#8220;to remember&#8221; or &#8220;to take into account.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=175><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;how I was broken by their adulterous heart.&#8221; The image of God being &#8220;broken&#8221; is startling, but perfectly natural within the metaphorical framework of God as offended husband. The idiom must refer to the intense grief that Israel&#8217;s unfaithfulness caused God. For a discussion of the syntax and semantics of the Hebrew text, see M. Greenberg, <i>Ezekiel </i>(AB), 1:134. </p>
<A NAME="613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=176><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> adds<i> </i>&#8220;in their faces.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=177><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;not in vain did I speak to do to them this catastrophe.&#8221; The wording of the last half of v. 10 parallels God&#8217;s declaration after the sin of the golden calf (Exod 32:14). </p>
<A NAME="615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=178><b>sn</b> <i>By the sword and by famine and by pestilence</i>. A similar trilogy of punishments is mentioned in Lev 26:25-26. See also Jer 14:12; 21:9; 27:8, 13; 29:18). </p>
<A NAME="616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=179><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the one who is left, the one who is spared.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=180><b>sn</b> By referring to <i>every high hill&#8230;all the mountaintops&#8230;under every green tree and every leafy oak </i>Ezekiel may be expanding on the phraseology of Deut 12:2 (see 1 Kgs 14:23; 2 Kgs 16:4; 17:10; Jer 2:20; 3:6, 13; 2 Chr 28:4).</p>
<A NAME="618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=181><b>sn</b> <i>I will stretch out my hand against them</i> is a common expression in the book of Ezekiel (14:9, 13; 16:27; 25:7; 35:3).</p>
<A NAME="619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=182><b>tc</b> The Vulgate reads the name as &#8220;Riblah,&#8221; a city north of Damascus. The MT reads Diblah, a city otherwise unknown. The letters <i>resh</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;</font>) and <i>dalet</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;</font>) may have been confused in the Hebrew text. The town of Riblah was in the land of Hamath (2 Kgs 23:33) which represented the northern border of Israel (Ezek 47:14).</p>
