<A NAME="3231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1022><b>tc</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;of the uncircumcised.&#8221; The LXX reads, probably correctly, &#8220;from of old&#8221; rather than &#8220;of the uncircumcised.&#8221; The phrases are very similar in spelling. The warriors of Meshech-Tubal are described as uncircumcised, so it would be odd for them to not be buried with the uncircumcised. Verse 28 specifically says that they would lie with the uncircumcised. </p>
