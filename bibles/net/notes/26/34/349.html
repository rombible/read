<A NAME="349"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1088><b>sn</b> The messianic king (&#8220;David&#8221;) is called both &#8220;king&#8221; and &#8220;prince&#8221; in 37:24-25. The use of the term &#8220;prince&#8221; for this king facilitates the contrast between this ideal ruler and the Davidic &#8220;princes&#8221; denounced in earlier prophecies (see 7:27; 12:10, 12; 19:1; 21:25; 22:6, 25). </p>
