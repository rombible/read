<A NAME="2411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=765><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;(with) toil she has wearied.&#8221; The meaning of the statement is unclear in the Hebrew text; some follow the LXX and delete it. The first word in the statement (rendered &#8220;toil&#8221; in the literal translation above) occurs only here in the OT, and the verb &#8220;she has wearied&#8221; lacks a stated object. Elsewhere the Hiphil of the verb refers to wearying someone or trying someone&#8217;s patience. The feminine subject is apparently the symbolic pot. </p>
