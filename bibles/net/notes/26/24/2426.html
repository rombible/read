<A NAME="2426"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=780><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the bread of men.&#8221; The translation follows the suggestion accepted by M. Greenberg (<i>Ezekiel </i>[AB], 2:509) that this refers to a meal brought by comforters to the one mourning. Some repoint the consonantal text to read &#8220;the bread of despair&#8221; (see L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>[WBC], 2:56), while others, with support from the Targum and Vulgate, emend the consonantal text to read &#8220;the bread of mourners&#8221; (see D. I. Block, <i>Ezekiel </i>[NICOT], 1:784). </p>
