<A NAME="2436"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=790><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the uplifting of their soul.&#8221; According to BDB 672 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;</font> 2, the term &#8220;uplifting&#8221; refers to &#8220;that to which they lift up their soul, their heart&#8217;s desire.&#8221; However, this text is the only one listed for this use. It seems more likely that the term has its well-attested nuance of &#8220;burden, load,&#8221; here and refers to that which weighs them down emotionally and is a constant source of concern or worry. </p>
