<A NAME="2437"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=791><b>tn</b> In the Hebrew text there is no conjunction before &#8220;their sons and daughters.&#8221; For this reason one might assume that the preceding descriptive phrases refer to the sons and daughters, but verse 21 suggests otherwise. The descriptive phrases appear to refer to the &#8220;stronghold,&#8221; which parallels &#8220;my sanctuary&#8221; in verse 21. The children constitute a separate category.</p>
