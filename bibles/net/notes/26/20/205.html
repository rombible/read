<A NAME="205"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=528><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;will you judge.&#8221; Here the imperfect form of the verb is probably used with a desiderative nuance. Addressed to the prophet, &#8220;judge&#8221; means to warn of or pronounce God&#8217;s impending judgment. </p>
