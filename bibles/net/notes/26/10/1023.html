<A NAME="1023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=290><b>sn</b> The living creature described here is thus slightly different from the one described in Ezek 1:10, where a bull&#8217;s face appeared instead of a cherub&#8217;s. Note that some English versions harmonize the two descriptions and read the same here as in 1:10 (cf. NAB, NLT &#8220;an ox&#8221;; TEV, CEV &#8220;a bull&#8221;). This may be justified based on v. 22, which states the creatures&#8217; appearance was the same.</p>
