<A NAME="105"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=272><b>tc</b> The LXX, Syriac, Vulgate, and Targum <sc>mss read plural &#8220;cherubim&#8221; while the MT is singular here, &#8220;cherub.&#8221; The plural ending was probably omitted in copying the MT due to the similar beginning of the next word.</p>
