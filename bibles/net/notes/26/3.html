<A NAME="31"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=69><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;eat what you find.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="32"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=70><b>tc</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;I ate,&#8221; a first common singular preterite plus paragogic <i>he</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;</font>). The ancient versions read &#8220;I ate it,&#8221; which is certainly the meaning in the context, and indicates they read the <i>he</i> as a third feminine singular pronominal suffix. The Masoretes typically wrote a <i>mappiq</i> in the <i>he</i> for the pronominal suffix but apparently missed this one.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>I ate it</i>. A similar idea of consuming God&#8217;s word is found in Jer 15:16 and Rev 10:10, where it is also compared to honey and may be specifically reminiscent of this text.</p>
<A NAME="33"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=71><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;deep of lip&#8221; (in the sense of incomprehensible).</p>
<A NAME="34"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=72><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;heavy of tongue.&#8221;<i> </i>Similar language occurs in Exod 4:10; Isa 33:19.</p>
<A NAME="35"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=73><b>tn</b> The conjunction &#8220;but&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but is implied from the context.</p>
<A NAME="36"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=74><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;hear.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="37"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=75><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;if not&#8221; but most ancient versions translate only &#8220;if.&#8221; The expression occurs with this sense in Isa 5:9; 14:24. See also Ezek 34:8; 36:5; 38:19.</p>
<A NAME="38"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=76><b>sn</b> Moses (Exod 3:19) and Isaiah (Isa 6:9-10) were also told that their messages would not be received.</p>
<A NAME="39"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=77><b>sn</b> A similar description of Israel&#8217;s disobedience is given in 1 Sam 8:7.</p>
<A NAME="310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=78><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;hard of forehead and stiff of heart.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=79><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;strong, resolute.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=80><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term translated &#8220;diamond&#8221; is parallel to &#8220;iron&#8221; in Jer 17:1. The Hebrew uses two terms which are both translated at times as &#8220;flint,&#8221; but here one is clearly harder than the other. The translation &#8220;diamond&#8221; attempts to reflect this distinction in English. </p>
<A NAME="313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=81><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;of their faces.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=82><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to the sons of your people.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=83><b>sn</b> See note on &#8220;wind&#8221; in 2:2. </p>
<A NAME="316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=84><b>tc</b> This translation accepts the emendation suggested in BHS of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿrum</font>) for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">barukh</font>). The letters <i>mem</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;</font>) and <i>kaph</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;</font>) were easily confused in the old script while <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (&#8220;blessed be&#8221;) both implies a quotation which is out of place here and also does not fit the later phrase, &#8220;from its place,&#8221; which requires a verb of motion.</p>
<A NAME="317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=85><b>tn</b> The traditional interpretation is that Ezekiel embarked on his mission with bitterness and anger, either reflecting God&#8217;s attitude toward the sinful people or his own feelings about having to carry out such an unpleasant task. L. C. Allen (<i>Ezekiel </i>[WBC], 1:13) takes &#8220;bitterly&#8221; as a misplaced marginal note and understands the following word, normally translated &#8220;anger,&#8221; in the sense of fervor or passion. He translates, &#8220;I was passionately moved&#8221; (p. 4). Another option is to take the word translated &#8220;bitterly&#8221; as a verb meaning &#8220;strengthened&#8221; (attested in Ugaritic). See G. R. Driver, <i>Canaanite Myths and Legends</i>, 152.</p>
<A NAME="318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=86><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the hand of the Lord was on me heavily.&#8221; The &#8220;hand of the Lord&#8221; is a metaphor for his power or influence; the modifier conveys intensity. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In Ezekiel God&#8217;s &#8220;hand&#8221; being on the prophet is regularly associated with communication or a vision from God (1:3; 3:14, 22; 8:1; 37:1; 40:1).</p>
<A NAME="319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=87><b>sn</b> The name &#8220;Tel Abib&#8221; is a transliteration of an Akkadian term meaning &#8220;mound of the flood,&#8221; i.e., an ancient mound. It is not to be confused with the modern city of Tel Aviv in Israel. </p>
<A NAME="320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=88><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;canal.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=89><b>sn</b> A similar response to a divine encounter is found in Acts 9:8-9.</p>
<A NAME="322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=90><b>sn</b> This phrase occurs about fifty times in the book of Ezekiel.</p>
<A NAME="323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=91><b>tn</b> The literal role of a watchman is described in 2 Sam 18:24; 2 Kgs 9:17.</p>
<A NAME="324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=92><b>sn</b> Even though the infinitive absolute is used to emphasize the warning, the warning is still implicitly conditional, as the following context makes clear.</p>
<A NAME="325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=93><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;in his punishment.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;in/for [a person&#8217;s] iniquity&#8221; occurs fourteen times in Ezekiel: here and v. 19; 4:17; 7:13, 16; 18: 17, 18, 19, 20; 24:23; 33:6, 8, 9; 39:23. The Hebrew word for &#8220;iniquity&#8221; may also mean the &#8220;punishment for iniquity.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=94><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his blood I will seek from your hand.&#8221; The expression &#8220;seek blood from the hand&#8221; is equivalent to requiring the death penalty (2 Sam 4:11-12).</p>
<A NAME="327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=95><b>tn</b> Verses 17-19 are repeated in Ezek 33:7-9.</p>
<A NAME="328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=96><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;stumbling block.&#8221; The Hebrew term refers to an obstacle in the road in Lev 19:14.</p>
<A NAME="329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=97><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the righteous man.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=98><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;power.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Hand</i> in the OT can refer metaphorically to power, authority, or influence. In Ezekiel God&#8217;s <i>hand</i> being on the prophet is regularly associated with communication or a vision from God (1:3; 3:14, 22; 8:1; 37:1; 40:1).</p>
<A NAME="331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=99><b>sn</b> Ezekiel had another vision at this location, recounted in Ezek 37.</p>
<A NAME="332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=100><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;canal.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=101><b>tn</b> See the note on &#8220;wind&#8221; in 2:2.</p>
<A NAME="334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=102><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=103><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you will not be to them a reprover.&#8221; In Isa 29:21 and Amos 5:10 &#8220;a reprover&#8221; issued rebuke at the city gate.</p>
<A NAME="336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=104><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;open your mouth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=105><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the listener will listen, the refuser will refuse.&#8221; Because the word for listening can also mean obeying, the nuance may be that the obedient will listen, or that the one who listens will obey. Also, although the verbs are not jussive as pointed in the MT, some translate them with a volitive sense: &#8220;the one who listens &#8211; let that one listen, the one who refuses &#8211; let that one refuse.&#8221;</p>
