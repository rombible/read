<A NAME="4012"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1227><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a measuring stick of six cubits, [each] a cubit and a handbreadth.&#8221; The measuring units here and in the remainder of this section are the Hebrew &#8220;long&#8221; cubit, consisting of a cubit (about 18 inches or 45 cm) and a handbreadth (about 3 inches or 7.5 cm), for a total of 21 inches (52.5 cm). Therefore the measuring stick in the man&#8217;s hand was 10.5 feet (3.15 meters) long. Because modern readers are not familiar with the cubit as a unit of measurement, and due to the additional complication of the &#8220;long&#8221; cubit as opposed to the regular cubit, all measurements have been converted to American standard feet and inches, with the Hebrew measurements and the metric equivalents given in the notes.</p>
