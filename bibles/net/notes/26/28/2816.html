<A NAME="2816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=906><b>tn</b> The exact identification of each gemstone is uncertain. The list should be compared to that of the priest in Exod 28:17-20, which lists twelve stones in rows of three. The LXX apparently imports the Exod 28 list. See reference to the types of stones in L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 2:91.</p>
