<A NAME="2823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=913><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and I expelled you, O guardian cherub.&#8221; The Hebrew text takes the verb as first person and understands &#8220;guardian cherub&#8221; as a vocative, in apposition to the pronominal suffix on the verb. However, if the emendation in verse 14a is accepted (see the note above), then one may follow the LXX here as well and emend the verb to a third person perfect. In this case the subject of the verb is the guardian cherub. See L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 2:91.</p>
