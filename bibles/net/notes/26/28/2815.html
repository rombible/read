<A NAME="2815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=905><b>sn</b> The imagery of the lament appears to draw upon an extrabiblical Eden tradition about the expulsion of the first man (see v. 14 and the note there) from the garden due to his pride. The biblical Eden tradition speaks of cherubs placed as guardians at the garden entrance following the sin of Adam and Eve (Gen 3:24), but no guardian cherub like the one described in verse 14 is depicted or mentioned in the biblical account. Ezekiel&#8217;s imagery also appears to reflect Mesopotamian and Canaanite mythology at certain points. See D. I. Block, <i>Ezekiel </i>(NICOT), 2:119-20. </p>
