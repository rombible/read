<A NAME="285"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=895><b>sn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;Danel&#8221; (so TEV), referring to a ruler known from Canaanite legend. See the note on &#8220;Daniel&#8221;<i> </i>in 14:14. A reference to Danel (preserved in legend at Ugarit, near the northern end of the Phoenician coast) makes more sense here when addressing Tyre than in 14:14.</p>
