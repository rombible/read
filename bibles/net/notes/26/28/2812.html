<A NAME="2812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=902><b>sn</b> The Phoenicians practiced circumcision, so the language here must be figurative, indicating that they would be treated in a disgraceful manner. Uncircumcised peoples were viewed as inferior, unclean, and perhaps even sub-human. See 31:18 and 32:17-32, as well as the discussion in D. I. Block, <i>Ezekiel </i>(NICOT), 2:99. </p>
