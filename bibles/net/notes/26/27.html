<A NAME="271"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=853><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lift up over Tyre a lament.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="272"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=854><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;entrances.&#8221; The plural noun may reflect the fact that Tyre had two main harbors. </p>
<A NAME="273"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=855><b>sn</b> Rome, another economic power, is described in a similar way in Rev 17:1.</p>
<A NAME="274"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=856><b>tn</b> The city of Tyre is described in the following account as a merchant ship. </p>
<A NAME="275"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=857><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;built.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="276"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=858><b>tn</b> Perhaps the hull or deck. The term is dual, so perhaps it refers to a double-decked ship. </p>
<A NAME="277"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=859><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;hull.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="278"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=860><b>tc</b> The Hebrew reads &#8220;Your deck they made ivory, daughter of Assyria.&#8221; The syntactically difficult &#8220;ivory&#8221; is understood here as dittography and omitted, though some construe this to refer to ivory inlays. &#8220;Daughter of Assyria&#8221; is understood here as improper word division and the vowels repointed as &#8220;cypresses.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="279"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=861><b>tn</b> Heb &#8220;from the coastlands (or islands) of Kittim,&#8221; generally understood to be a reference to the island of Cyprus, where the Phoenicians had a trading colony on the southeast coast. Many modern English versions have &#8220;Cyprus&#8221; (CEV, TEV), &#8220;the coastlands of Cyprus&#8221; (NASB), &#8220;the coasts of Cyprus&#8221; (NIV, NRSV), or &#8220;the southern coasts of Cyprus&#8221; (NLT).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The</i> <i>Kittean isles</i> is probably a reference to southeast Cyprus where the Phoenicians had a colony. </p>
<A NAME="2710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=862><b>sn</b> This is probably a reference to Cyprus. </p>
<A NAME="2711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=863><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;the residents of&#8221;; the LXX reads &#8220;your rulers who dwell in.&#8221; With no apparent reason for the LXX to add &#8220;the rulers&#8221; many suppose something has dropped out of the Hebrew text. While more than one may be possible, Allen&#8217;s proposal, positing a word meaning &#8220;elders,&#8221; is the most likely to explain the omission in the MT from a graphic standpoint and also provides a parallel to the beginning of v. 9. See L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 2:81.a parallel to v. 9.</p>
<A NAME="2712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=864><b>map</b> For location see Map1-A1; JP3-F3; JP4-F3.</p>
<A NAME="2713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=865><b>sn</b> <i>Sidon and Arvad</i>, like Tyre, were Phoenician coastal cities. </p>
<A NAME="2714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=866><b>tn</b> Or<i> </i>&#8220;wise.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=867><b>sn</b> Another Phoenician coastal city located between Sidon and Arvad. </p>
<A NAME="2716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=868><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;strengthening damages.&#8221; Here &#8220;to strengthen&#8221; means to repair. The word for &#8220;damages&#8221; occurs several times in 1 Kgs 12 about some type of damage to the temple, which may have referred to or included cracks. Since the context describes Tyre in its glory, we do not expect this reference to damages to be of significant scale, even if there are repairmen. This may refer to using pitch to seal the seams of the ship, which had to be done periodically and could be considered routine maintenance rather than repair of damage. </p>
<A NAME="2717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=869><b>sn</b> The reference to &#8220;all the ships of the sea&#8230;within you&#8221; suggests that the metaphor is changing; previously Tyre had been described as a magnificent ship, but now the description shifts back to an actual city. The &#8220;ships of the sea&#8221; were within Tyre&#8217;s harbor. Verse 11 refers to &#8220;walls&#8221; and &#8220;towers&#8221; of the city.</p>
<A NAME="2718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=870><b>sn</b> See Gen 10:22. </p>
<A NAME="2719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=871><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sons of Arvad.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=872><b>sn</b> The identity of the Gammadites is uncertain. </p>
<A NAME="2721"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=873><b>tn</b> See note on &#8220;quivers&#8221; in Jer 51:11 on the meaning of Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shelet</font>) and also M. Greenberg, <i>Ezekiel </i>(AB), 2:553. </p>
<A NAME="2722"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=874><b>sn</b> <i>Tarshish </i>refers to a distant seaport sometimes believed to be located in southern Spain (others identified it as Carthage in North Africa). In any event it represents here a distant, rich, and exotic port which was a trading partner of Tyre.</p>
<A NAME="2723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=875><b>tn</b> The way in which these horses may have been distinguished from other horses is unknown. Cf. ASV &#8220;war-horses&#8221; (NASB, NIV, NRSV, CEV all similar); NLT &#8220;chariot horses.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=876><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sons of Dedan.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=877><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;they returned as your gift.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2726"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=878><b>tc</b> Many Hebrew <sc>mss, Aquila&#8217;s Greek translation, and the Syriac version read &#8220;Edom.&#8221; The LXX reads &#8220;man,&#8221; a translation which assumes the same consonants as Edom. This reading is supported from the context as the text deals with Damascus, the capital of Syria (Aram), later (in v. 18).</p>
<A NAME="2727"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=879><b>sn</b> The location is mentioned in Judg 11:33. </p>
<A NAME="2728"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=880><b>tc</b> The MT leaves v. 18 as an incomplete sentence and begins v. 19 with &#8220;and Dan and Javan (Ionia) from Uzal.&#8221; The LXX mentions &#8220;wine.&#8221; The translation follows an emendation assuming some confusions of <i>vav</i> and <i>yod</i>. See L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 2:82. </p>
<A NAME="2729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=881><b>sn</b> According to L. C. Allen (<i>Ezekiel </i>[WBC], 2:82), <i>Izal</i> was located between Haran and the Tigris and was famous for its wine. </p>
<A NAME="2730"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=882><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;Large merchant ships.&#8221; The expression &#8220;ships of Tarshish&#8221; may describe a class of vessel, that is, large oceangoing merchant ships.</p>
<A NAME="2731"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=883><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your repairers of damage.&#8221; See v. 9.</p>
<A NAME="2732"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=884><b>tn</b> Compare this phrase to Isa 57:20 and Amos 8:8. See M. Greenberg, <i>Ezekiel </i>(AB), 2:561.</p>
<A NAME="2733"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=885><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;make heard over you with their voice.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2734"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=886><b>tn</b> Note a similar expression to &#8220;roll in the ashes&#8221; in Mic 1:10.</p>
<A NAME="2735"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=887><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and they will weep concerning you with bitterness of soul, (with) bitter mourning.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2736"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=888><b>tn</b> As it stands, the meaning of the Hebrew text is unclear. The translation follows the suggestion of M. Dahood, &#8220;Accadian-Ugaritic <i>dmt</i> in Ezekiel 27:32,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 45 (1964): 83-84. Several other explanations and emendations have been offered. See L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 2:83, and D. I. Block, <i>Ezekiel </i>(NICOT), 2:85-86, for a list of options. </p>
<A NAME="2737"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=889><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;fallen.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2738"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=890><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the midst of you.&#8221;</p>
