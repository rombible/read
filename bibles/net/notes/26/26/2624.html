<A NAME="2624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=847><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;she and her inhabitants who placed their terror to all her inhabitants.&#8221; The relationship of the final prepositional phrase to what precedes is unclear. The preposition probably has a specifying function here, drawing attention to Tyre&#8217;s inhabitants as the source of the terror mentioned prior to this. In this case, one might paraphrase verse 17b: &#8220;she and her inhabitants, who spread their terror; yes, her inhabitants (were the source of this terror).&#8221;</p>
