<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1><b>sn</b> The meaning of the <i>thirtieth year</i> is problematic. Some take it to mean the age of Ezekiel when he prophesied (e.g., Origen). The Aramaic Targum explains the thirtieth year as the thirtieth year dated from the recovery of the book of the Torah in the temple in Jerusalem (2 Kgs 22:3-9). The number seems somehow to be equated with the fifth year of Jehoiachin&#8217;s exile in 1:2, i.e., 593 <span class="smallcaps">b.c</span>.</p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2><b>sn</b> The Assyrians started the tactic of deportation, the large-scale forced displacement of conquered populations, in order to stifle rebellions. The task of uniting groups of deportees, gaining freedom from one&#8217;s overlords and returning to retake one&#8217;s own country would be considerably more complicated than living in one&#8217;s homeland and waiting for an opportune moment to drive out the enemy&#8217;s soldiers. The Babylonians adopted this practice also, after defeating the Assyrians. The Babylonians deported Judeans on three occasions. The practice of deportation was reversed by the Persian conquerors of Babylon, who gained favor from their subjects for allowing them to return to their homeland and, as polytheists, sought the favor of the gods of the various countries which had come under their control. </p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3><b>sn</b> The <i>Kebar River</i> is mentioned in Babylonian texts from the city of Nippur in the fifth century <span class="smallcaps">b.c</span>. It provided artificial irrigation from the Euphrates.</p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4><b>sn</b> For the concept of the <i>heavens opened</i> in later literature, see 3 Macc 6:18; <i>2 Bar.</i> 22:1; <i>T. Levi</i> 5:1; Matt 3:16; Acts 7:56; Rev 19:11. </p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;saw visions from God.&#8221; References to divine visions occur also in Ezek 8:3; 40:2</p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=6><b>sn</b> The prophet&#8217;s name, <i>Ezekiel</i>, means in Hebrew &#8220;May God strengthen.&#8221;</p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=7><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;to Ezekiel son of Buzi the priest.&#8221;</p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=8><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Chaldeans.&#8221; The name of the tribal group ruling Babylon, &#8220;Chaldeans&#8221; is used as metonymy for the whole empire of Babylon. The Babylonians worked with the Medes to destroy the Assyrian Empire near the end of the 7th century <span class="smallcaps">b.c</span>. Then, over the next century, the Babylonians dominated the West Semitic states (such as Phoenicia, Aram, Moab, Edom, and Judah in the modern countries of Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Israel) and made incursions into Egypt.</p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=9><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;power.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Hand</i> in the OT can refer metaphorically to power, authority, or influence. In Ezekiel God&#8217;s &#8220;hand&#8221; being on the prophet is regularly associated with communication or a vision from God (3:14, 22; 8:1; 37:1; 40:1).</p>
<a name="110"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=10><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>, traditionally &#8220;behold&#8221;) indicates becoming aware of something and has been translated here as a verb.</p>
<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>sn</b> Storms are often associated with appearances of God (see Nah 1:3; Ps 18:12). In some passages, the &#8220;storm&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">sÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arah</font>) may be a whirlwind (Job 38:1, 2 Kgs 2:1).</p>
<a name="112"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=12><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;fire taking hold of itself,&#8221; perhaps repeatedly. The phrase occurs elsewhere only in Exod 9:24 in association with a hailstorm. The LXX interprets the phrase as fire flashing like lightning, but it is possibly a self-sustaining blaze of divine origin. The LXX also reverses the order of the descriptors, i.e., &#8220;light went around it and fire flashed like lightning within it.&#8221; </p>
<a name="113"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=13><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;radiance.&#8221; The term also occurs in 1:27b.</p>

<a name="115"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=15><b>tn</b> The LXX translates <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khashmal</font>) with the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7972;&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">hlektron</font>, &#8220;electrum&#8221;; so NAB), an alloy of silver and gold, perhaps envisioning a comparison to the glow of molten metal.</p>
<a name="116"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=16><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from its midst&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;&#1468;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mitokhah</font>).

The translator of the LXX of Ezekiel either read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿtokh</font>, &#8220;within&#8221;) in his Hebrew exemplar or could not imagine how <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1498;&#1456;</font> could make sense and so chose to use <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;</font>. The Hebrew would be understood by adding &#8220;<i>from its midst emerged </i>the forms of four living beings.&#8221; </p>
<a name="117"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=17><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;form, figure, appearance.&#8221; </p>
<a name="118"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=18><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term is feminine plural yet thirty-three of the forty-five pronominal suffixes and verbal references which refer to the living beings in the chapter are masculine plural. The grammatical vacillation between masculine and feminine plurals suggests the difficulty Ezekiel had in penning these words as he was overcome by the vision of God. In ancient Near Eastern sculpture very similar images of part-human, part-animal creatures serve as throne and sky bearers. For a discussion of ancient Near Eastern parallels, see L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 1:26-31. Ezekiel&#8217;s vision is an example of contextualization, where God accommodates his self-revelation to cultural expectations and norms. </p>
<a name="119"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=19><b>sn</b> <i>They had human form</i> may mean they stood erect.</p>
<a name="120"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=20><b>sn</b> The Hebrew verb translated <i>gleamed</i> occurs only here in the OT.</p>
<a name="121"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=21><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;his hand&#8221; while many Hebrew <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> as well as the <i>Qere</i> read &#8220;hands of.&#8221; Two similar Hebrew letters, <i>vav</i> and <i>yod</i>, have been confused.</p>
<a name="122"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=22><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;They each went in the direction of one of his faces.&#8221;</p>
<a name="123"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=23><b>tc</b> The MT has an additional word at the beginning of v. 11, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ufÿnehem</font>, &#8220;and their faces&#8221;), which is missing from the LXX. As the rest of the verse only applies to wings, &#8220;their faces&#8221; would have to somehow be understood in the previous clause. But this would be very awkward and is doubly problematic since &#8220;their faces&#8221; are already introduced as the topic at the beginning of v. 10. The Hebrew scribe appears to have copied the phrase &#8220;and their faces and their wings&#8221; from v. 8, where it introduces the content of 9-11. Only &#8220;and (as for) their wings&#8221; belongs here. </p>
<a name="124"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=24><b>tn</b> See the note on &#8220;straight ahead&#8221; in v. 9.</p>

The LXX reads &#8220;and in the midst of the creatures,&#8221; suggesting an underlying Hebrew text of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1498;&#1456; &#1492;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">umittokh hakhayyot</font>). The subsequent description of something moving among the creatures supports the LXX.</p>
<a name="127"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=27><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;and the form of the creatures &#8211; their appearance was like burning coals of fire.&#8221; The LXX reads &#8220;in the midst of the creatures was a sight like burning coals of fire.&#8221; The MT may have adjusted &#8220;appearance&#8221; to &#8220;their appearance&#8221; to fit their reading of the beginning of the verse (see the <b>tc</b> note on &#8220;in the middle&#8221;). See M. Greenberg, <i>Ezekiel </i>(AB), 1:46. </p>
<a name="128"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=28><b>sn</b> <i>Burning coals of fire</i> are also a part of David&#8217;s poetic description of God&#8217;s appearance (see 2 Sam 22:9, 13; Ps 18:8). </p>
<a name="129"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=29><b>tc</b> The LXX omits v. 14 and may well be correct. The verse may be a later explanatory gloss of the end of v. 13 which was copied into the main text. See M. Greenberg, <i>Ezekiel </i>(AB), 1:46.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> Lit., &#8220;like the appearance of lightning.&#8221; The Hebrew term translated &#8220;lightning&#8221; occurs only here in the OT. In postbiblical Hebrew the term refers to a lightning flash. </p>

<a name="134"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=34><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Tarshish stone.&#8221; The meaning of this term is uncertain. The term has also been translated &#8220;topaz&#8221; (NEB); &#8220;beryl&#8221; (KJV, NASB, NRSV); or &#8220;chrysolite&#8221; (RSV, NIV).</p>
<a name="135"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=35><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;like a wheel at right angles to another wheel.&#8221; Some envision concentric wheels here, while others propose &#8220;a globe-like structure in which two wheels stand at right angles&#8221; (L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>[WBC], 1:33-34). The description given in v. 17 favors the latter idea.</p>
<a name="136"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=36><b>tc</b> The MT reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492; &#1500;&#1464;&#1492;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿyir</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah lahem</font>, &#8220;and fear belonged to them&#8221;). In a similar vision in 10:12 the wheels are described as having spokes (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1491;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yideyhem</font>). That parallel would suggest <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yadot</font>) here (written <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1465;&#1514;</font> without the <i>mater</i>). By positing both a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;</font>/<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dalet</font>/<font face="Scholar">resh</font>) confusion and a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;</font>/<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hey</font>/<font face="Scholar">khet</font>) confusion the form was read as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1512;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿyareh</font>) and was then misunderstood and subsequently written as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿyir</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>) in the MT. The reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font> does not seem to fit the context well, though in English it can be made to sound as if it does. See W. H. Brownlee, <i>Ezekiel 1-19</i> (WBC), 8-9. The LXX reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#940;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai eidon auta</font>, &#8220;and I saw&#8221;), which assumes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1512;&#1462;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">va</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ere</font>&#8217;). The existing consonants of the MT may also be read as &#8220;it was visible to them.&#8221; </p>
<a name="137"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=37><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;wind&#8221;; the same Hebrew word can be translated as either &#8220;wind&#8221; or &#8220;spirit&#8221; depending on the context. </p>
<a name="138"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=38><b>tc</b> The MT adds the additional phrase &#8220;the spirit would go,&#8221; which seems unduly redundant here and may be dittographic.</p>
<a name="139"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=39><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;wind.&#8221; The Hebrew is difficult since the text presents four creatures and then talks about &#8220;the spirit&#8221; (singular) of &#8220;the living being&#8221; (singular). According to M. Greenberg (<i>Ezekiel </i>[AB], 1:45) the Targum interprets this as &#8220;will.&#8221; Greenberg views this as the spirit of the one enthroned above the creatures, but one would not expect the article when the one enthroned has not yet been introduced. </p>
<a name="140"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=40><b>tc</b> The LXX reads &#8220;when it went, they went; when it stood, they stood.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;when they went, they went; when they stood, they stood.&#8221; </p>

On the analogy of v. 11 and the support of the LXX, which reads the same for v. 11 and this verse, one should perhaps read &#8220;each had two wings touching another being and each had two wings covering.&#8221;</p>
<a name="144"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=44><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Shaddai&#8221; (probably meaning &#8220;one of the mountain&#8221;), a title that depicts God as the sovereign ruler of the world who dispenses justice.

<a name="145"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=45><b>tn</b> The only other occurrence of the Hebrew word translated &#8220;tumult&#8221; is in Jer 11:16. It indicates a noise like that of the turmoil of a military camp or the sound of an army on the march.</p>
<a name="146"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=46><b>tc</b> The MT continues &#8220;when they stood still they lowered their wings,&#8221; an apparent dittography from the end of v. 24.

<a name="147"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=47><b>tn</b> See Ezek 1:4.</p>
<a name="148"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=48><b>tc</b> The LXX lacks this phrase.
