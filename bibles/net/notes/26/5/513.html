<A NAME="513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=142><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text uses wordplay here to bring out the appropriate nature of God&#8217;s judgment. &#8220;Execute&#8221; translates the same Hebrew verb translated &#8220;carried out&#8221; (literally meaning &#8220;do&#8221;) in v. 7, while &#8220;judgment&#8221; in v. 8 and &#8220;regulations&#8221; in v. 7 translate the same Hebrew noun (meaning &#8220;regulations&#8221; or in some cases &#8220;judgments&#8221; executed on those who break laws). The point seems to be this: God would &#8220;carry out judgments&#8221; against those who refused to &#8220;carry out&#8221; his &#8220;laws.&#8221;</p>
