<A NAME="523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=152><b>tn</b> The Hebrew noun translated &#8220;jealousy&#8221; is used in the human realm to describe suspicion of adultery (Num 5:14ff.; Prov 6:34). Since Israel&#8217;s relationship with God was often compared to a marriage this term is appropriate here. The term occurs elsewhere in Ezekiel in 8:3, 5; 16:38, 42; 23:25.</p>
