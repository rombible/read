<A NAME="514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=143><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the sight of the nations.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b><sup> </sup>This is one of the ironies of the passage. The Lord set Israel among the nations for honor and praise as they would be holy and obey God&#8217;s law as told in Ezek 5:5 and Deut 26:16-19. The practice of these laws and statutes would make the peoples consider Israel wise. (See Deut 4:5-8, where the words for laws and statutes are the same as those used here). Since Israel did not obey, they are made a different kind of object lesson to the nations, not by their obedience but in their punishment as told in Ezek 5:8 and Deut 29:24-29. Yet Deut 30 goes on to say that when they remember the cursings and blessings of the covenant and repent, God will restore them from the nations to which they have been scattered.</p>
