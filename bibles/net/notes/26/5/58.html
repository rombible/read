<A NAME="58"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=137><b>sn</b> One might conclude that the subject of the plural verbs is the nations/countries, but the context (vv. 5-6a) indicates that the people of Jerusalem are in view. The text shifts from using the feminine singular (referring to personified Jerusalem) to the plural (referring to Jerusalem&#8217;s residents). See L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 1:73.</p>
