<A NAME="2711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=863><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;the residents of&#8221;; the LXX reads &#8220;your rulers who dwell in.&#8221; With no apparent reason for the LXX to add &#8220;the rulers&#8221; many suppose something has dropped out of the Hebrew text. While more than one may be possible, Allen&#8217;s proposal, positing a word meaning &#8220;elders,&#8221; is the most likely to explain the omission in the MT from a graphic standpoint and also provides a parallel to the beginning of v. 9. See L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 2:81.a parallel to v. 9.</p>
