<A NAME="278"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=860><b>tc</b> The Hebrew reads &#8220;Your deck they made ivory, daughter of Assyria.&#8221; The syntactically difficult &#8220;ivory&#8221; is understood here as dittography and omitted, though some construe this to refer to ivory inlays. &#8220;Daughter of Assyria&#8221; is understood here as improper word division and the vowels repointed as &#8220;cypresses.&#8221;</p>
