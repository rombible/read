<A NAME="2716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=868><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;strengthening damages.&#8221; Here &#8220;to strengthen&#8221; means to repair. The word for &#8220;damages&#8221; occurs several times in 1 Kgs 12 about some type of damage to the temple, which may have referred to or included cracks. Since the context describes Tyre in its glory, we do not expect this reference to damages to be of significant scale, even if there are repairmen. This may refer to using pitch to seal the seams of the ship, which had to be done periodically and could be considered routine maintenance rather than repair of damage. </p>
