<A NAME="2717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=869><b>sn</b> The reference to &#8220;all the ships of the sea&#8230;within you&#8221; suggests that the metaphor is changing; previously Tyre had been described as a magnificent ship, but now the description shifts back to an actual city. The &#8220;ships of the sea&#8221; were within Tyre&#8217;s harbor. Verse 11 refers to &#8220;walls&#8221; and &#8220;towers&#8221; of the city.</p>
