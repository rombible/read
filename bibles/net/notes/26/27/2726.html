<A NAME="2726"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=878><b>tc</b> Many Hebrew <sc>mss, Aquila&#8217;s Greek translation, and the Syriac version read &#8220;Edom.&#8221; The LXX reads &#8220;man,&#8221; a translation which assumes the same consonants as Edom. This reading is supported from the context as the text deals with Damascus, the capital of Syria (Aram), later (in v. 18).</p>
