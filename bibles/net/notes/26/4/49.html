<A NAME="49"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=114><b>tc</b> The LXX reads &#8220;190 days.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b><sup> </sup>The significance of the number 390<i> </i>is not clear. The best explanation is that &#8220;days&#8221; are used figuratively for years and the number refers to the years of the sinfulness of Israel during the period of the First Temple. Some understand the number to refer to the length of the division of the northern and southern kingdoms down to the fall of Jerusalem (931-586 <sc>b.c.), but this adds up to only 345 years. </p>
