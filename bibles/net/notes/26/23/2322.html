<A NAME="2322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=710><b>tn</b> Or<i> </i>&#8220;you took note of.&#8221; The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">paqad</font>) in the Qal implies evaluating something and then acting in light of that judgment; here the prophet depicts Judah as approving of her youthful unfaithfulness and then magnifying it at the present time. Some translations assume the verb should be repointed as a Niphal, rendering &#8220;you missed&#8221; or by extension &#8220;you longed for,&#8221; but such an extension of the Niphal &#8220;to be missing&#8221; is otherwise unattested. </p>
