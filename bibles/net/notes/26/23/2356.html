<A NAME="2356"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=744><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb form is feminine singular, indicating that Oholibah (Judah) is specifically addressed here. This address continues through verse 42a (note &#8220;her&#8221;), but then both sisters are described in verse 42b, where the feminine pronouns are again plural.</p>
