<A NAME="2347"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=735><b>tn</b> D. I. Block compares this to the idiom of &#8220;licking the plate&#8221; (<i>Ezekiel </i>[NICOT], 1:754, n. 137). The text is difficult as the word translated &#8220;gnaw&#8221; is rare. The noun is used of the shattered pieces of pottery and so could envision a broken cup. But the Piel verb form is used in only one other place (Num 24:8), where it is a denominative from the noun &#8220;bone&#8221; and seems to mean to &#8220;break (bones).&#8221; Why it would be collocated with &#8220;sherds&#8221; is not clear. For this reason some emend the phrase to read &#8220;consume its dregs&#8221; (see L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>[WBC], 2:44) or emend the verb to read &#8220;swallow,&#8221; as if the intoxicated Oholibah breaks the cup and then eats the very sherds in an effort to get every last drop of the beverage that dampens them. </p>
