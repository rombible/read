<A NAME="2321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=709><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;She lusted after their concubines (?) whose flesh was the flesh of donkeys.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;their concubines&#8221; is extremely problematic here. The pronoun is masculine plural, suggesting that the Egyptian men are in view, but how concubines would fit into the picture envisioned here is not clear. Some suggest that Ezekiel uses the term in an idiomatic sense of &#8220;paramour,&#8221; but this still fails to explain how the pronoun relates to the noun. It is more likely that the term refers here to the Egyptians&#8217; genitals. The relative pronoun that follows introduces a more specific description of their genitals. </p>
