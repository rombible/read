<A NAME="612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=175><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;how I was broken by their adulterous heart.&#8221; The image of God being &#8220;broken&#8221; is startling, but perfectly natural within the metaphorical framework of God as offended husband. The idiom must refer to the intense grief that Israel&#8217;s unfaithfulness caused God. For a discussion of the syntax and semantics of the Hebrew text, see M. Greenberg, <i>Ezekiel </i>(AB), 1:134. </p>
