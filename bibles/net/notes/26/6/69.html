<A NAME="69"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=172><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>you will know that I am the <sc>Lord</></i> concludes over sixty oracles in the book of Ezekiel and indicates the ultimate goal of God&#8217;s action. The phrase is often used in the book of Exodus as well (Exod 7:5; 14:4, 18). By Ezekiel&#8217;s day the people had forgotten that the Lord (Yahweh) was their covenant God and had turned to other gods. They had to be reminded that Yahweh alone deserved to be worshiped because only he possessed the power to meet their needs. Through judgment and eventually deliverance, Israel would be reminded that Yahweh alone held their destiny in his hands. </p>
