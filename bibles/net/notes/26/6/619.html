<A NAME="619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=182><b>tc</b> The Vulgate reads the name as &#8220;Riblah,&#8221; a city north of Damascus. The MT reads Diblah, a city otherwise unknown. The letters <i>resh</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;</font>) and <i>dalet</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;</font>) may have been confused in the Hebrew text. The town of Riblah was in the land of Hamath (2 Kgs 23:33) which represented the northern border of Israel (Ezek 47:14).</p>
