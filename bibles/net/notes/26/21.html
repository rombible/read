<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=600><b>sn</b> Ezek <b>21:1</b> in the English Bible is <b>21:6</b> in the Hebrew text (<i>BHS</i>). See the note at 20:45.</p>
<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=601><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;set your face toward.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=603><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the land of Israel.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=604><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>, traditionally &#8220;behold&#8221;) draws attention to something and has been translated here as a verb.</p>
<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=605><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I challenge you.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;I am against you&#8221; may be a formula for challenging someone to combat or a duel. See D. I. Block, <i>Ezekiel </i>(NICOT), 1:201-2, and P. Humbert, &#8220;Die Herausforderungsformel &#8216;<font face="Hebrewtl">h!nn#n' ?l?K&gt;</font>,&#8217;&#8221; <i>ZAW 45</i> (1933): 101-8.</p>
<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=606><b>sn</b> This is the sword of judgment, see Isa 31:8; 34:6; 66:16.</p>
<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=607><b>sn</b> Ezekiel elsewhere pictures the Lord&#8217;s judgment as discriminating between the righteous and the wicked (9:4-6; 18:1-20; see as well Pss 1 and 11) and speaks of the preservation of a remnant (3:21; 6:8; 12:16). Perhaps here he exaggerates for rhetorical effect in an effort to subdue any false optimism. See L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 2:25-26; D. I. Block, <i>Ezekiel </i>(NICOT), 1:669-70; and W. Zimmerli, <i>Ezekiel </i>(Hermeneia), 1:424-25. </p>

<A NAME="2112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=611><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;every spirit will be dim.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=612><b>sn</b> This expression depicts in a very vivid way how they will be overcome with fear. See the note on the same phrase in 7:17.</p>
<A NAME="2114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=613><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Or shall we rejoice, scepter of my son, it despises every tree.&#8221; The translation understands the subject of the verb &#8220;despises,&#8221; which is a feminine form in the Hebrew text, to be the sword (which is a feminine noun) mentioned just before this. Alternatively, the line may be understood as &#8220;let us not rejoice, O tribe of my son; it despises every tree.&#8221; The same word in Hebrew may be either &#8220;rod,&#8221; &#8220;scepter,&#8221; or &#8220;tribe.&#8221; The word sometimes translated as &#8220;or&#8221; or taken as an interrogative particle may be a negative particle. See D. I. Block, <i>Ezekiel </i>(NICOT), 1:672, n. 79.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The people of Judah should not place false hope in their king, symbolized by his royal scepter, for God&#8217;s judgment (symbolized by fire and then a sword) would destroy every tree (see 20:47), symbolizing the righteous and wicked (see 21:3-4). </p>
<A NAME="2115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=614><b>sn</b> This physical action was part of an expression of grief. Cp. Jer. 31:19.</p>
<A NAME="2116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=615><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;For testing (will come) and what if also a scepter, it despises, will not be?&#8221; The translation understands the subject of the verb &#8220;despises,&#8221; which is a feminine form in the Hebrew text, to be the sword (which is a feminine noun) mentioned in the previous verses. The text is very difficult and any rendering is uncertain. </p>
<A NAME="2117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=616><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Put to.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="2119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=618><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;Judah in fortified Jerusalem,&#8221; a geographic impossibility. The translation follows the LXX, which assumes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿtokhah</font>, &#8220;in it&#8221;) for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿtsurah</font>, &#8220;fortified&#8221;).<sup> </sup></p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> As the Babylonians approached from the north, one road would branch off to the left and lead down the east side of the Jordan River to Ammon. The other road would veer to the right and lead down west of the Jordan to Jerusalem.</p>
<A NAME="2120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=619><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;mother.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=620><b>sn</b> Mesopotamian kings believed that the gods revealed the future through omens. They employed various divination techniques, some of which are included in the list that follows. A particularly popular technique was the examination and interpretation of the livers of animals. See R. R. Wilson, <i>Prophecy and Society in Ancient Israel</i>, 90-110. </p>
<A NAME="2122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=621><b>tn</b> This word refers to personal idols that were apparently used for divination purposes (Gen 31:19; 1 Sam 19:13, 16).</p>

<A NAME="2126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=625><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;to open the mouth&#8221; for slaughter.</p>
<A NAME="2127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=626><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;to raise up a voice in a battle cry.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=627><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;they&#8221;; the referent (the people in Jerusalem) has been specified in the translation for clarity. </p>
<A NAME="2129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=628><b>sn</b> When the people of Judah realized the Babylonians&#8217; intentions, they would object on grounds that they had made a treaty with the Babylonian king (see 17:13). </p>
<A NAME="2130"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=629><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (the king of Babylon) has been specified in the translation for clarity. </p>
<A NAME="2131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=630><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;iniquity.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=631><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and he will remind of guilt for the purpose of being captured.&#8221; The king would counter their objections by pointing out that they had violated their treaty with him (see 17:18). </p>
<A NAME="2133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=632><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;caused to be remembered.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=633><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Because you have brought to remembrance your guilt when your transgressions are uncovered so that your sins are revealed in all your deeds &#8211; because you are remembered, by the hand you will be seized.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2135"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=634><b>tn</b> This probably refers to King Zedekiah. </p>
<A NAME="2136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=635><b>tn</b> Elsewhere in the Bible the turban is worn by priests (Exod 28:4, 37, 39; 29:6; 39:28, 31; Lev 8:9; 16:4), but here a royal crown is in view. </p>
<A NAME="2137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=636><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;This not this.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=637><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the high one.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2139"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=638><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;A ruin, a ruin, a ruin I will make it.&#8221; The threefold repetition of the noun &#8220;ruin&#8221; is for emphasis and draws attention to the degree of ruin that would take place. See <i>IBHS</i> 233 §12.5a and GKC 431-32 §133.<i>k</i>. The pronominal suffix (translated &#8220;it&#8221;) on the verb &#8220;make&#8221; is feminine in Hebrew. The probable antecedent is the &#8220;turban/crown&#8221; (both nouns are feminine in form) mentioned in verse 26. The point is that the king&#8217;s royal splendor would be completely devastated as judgment overtook his realm and brought his reign to a violent end. </p>
<A NAME="2140"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=639><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Also this, he was not, until the coming of the one to whom the judgment belongs and I have given it.&#8221; The Hebrew text, as it stands, is grammatically difficult. The pronoun &#8220;this&#8221; is feminine, while the following negated verb (&#8220;was not&#8221;) is masculine. Some emend the verb to a feminine form (see <i>BHS</i>). In this case the statement refers to the destiny of the king&#8217;s turban/crown (symbolizing his reign). See the previous note. The preposition translated &#8220;when&#8221; normally means &#8220;until,&#8221; but here it seems to refer to the period during which the preceding situation is realized, rather than its termination point. See L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 2:19, 21. The second part of the statement, though awkward, probably refers to the arrival of the Babylonian king, to whom the Lord had assigned the task of judgment (see 23:24). Or the verse may read &#8220;A total ruin I will make, even this. It will not be until the one comes to whom is (the task of) judgment and I have assigned it.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2141"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=640><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;their reproach.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2142"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=641><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;to contain, endure.&#8221; Since the Hebrew text as it stands makes little, if any, sense, most emend the text to read either &#8220;to consume&#8221; or &#8220;for destruction.&#8221; For discussion of options see D. I. Block, <i>Ezekiel </i>(NICOT), 1:693. </p>
<A NAME="2143"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=642><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;in the seeing concerning you falsehood, in divining concerning you a lie.&#8221; This probably refers to the attempts of the Ammonites to ward off judgment through prophetic visions and divination. </p>
<A NAME="2144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=643><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;you&#8221;; the referent (the sword mentioned in v. 28) has been specified in the translation for clarity. </p>
<A NAME="2145"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=644><b>sn</b> The second half of the verse appears to state that the sword of judgment would fall upon the wicked, despite their efforts to prevent it. </p>
<A NAME="2146"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=645><b>sn</b> Once the Babylonian king&#8217;s sword (vv. 19-20) has carried out its assigned task, the Lord commands it to halt and announces that Babylon itself will also experience his judgment. See L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 2:28.</p>
<A NAME="2147"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=646><b>tn</b> In the Hebrew text of vv. 30-32 the second person verbal and pronominal forms are feminine singular. This may indicate that the personified Babylonian sword is being addressed. The Hebrew word for &#8220;sword&#8221; (see v. 28) is feminine. However, it may refer to the Ammonites.</p>
<A NAME="2148"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=647><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;your blood will be in the middle of the land.&#8221; </p>
