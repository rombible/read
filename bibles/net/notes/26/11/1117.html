<A NAME="1117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=318><b>tc</b> The LXX reads this statement as a question. Compare this to the question in 9:8. It is possible that the interrogative particle has been omitted by haplography. However, an exclamatory statement as in the MT also makes sense and the LXX may have simply tried to harmonize this passage with 9:8.</p>
