<A NAME="317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=85><b>tn</b> The traditional interpretation is that Ezekiel embarked on his mission with bitterness and anger, either reflecting God&#8217;s attitude toward the sinful people or his own feelings about having to carry out such an unpleasant task. L. C. Allen (<i>Ezekiel </i>[WBC], 1:13) takes &#8220;bitterly&#8221; as a misplaced marginal note and understands the following word, normally translated &#8220;anger,&#8221; in the sense of fervor or passion. He translates, &#8220;I was passionately moved&#8221; (p. 4). Another option is to take the word translated &#8220;bitterly&#8221; as a verb meaning &#8220;strengthened&#8221; (attested in Ugaritic). See G. R. Driver, <i>Canaanite Myths and Legends</i>, 152.</p>
