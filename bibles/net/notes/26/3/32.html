<A NAME="32"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=70><b>tc</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;I ate,&#8221; a first common singular preterite plus paragogic <i>he</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;</font>). The ancient versions read &#8220;I ate it,&#8221; which is certainly the meaning in the context, and indicates they read the <i>he</i> as a third feminine singular pronominal suffix. The Masoretes typically wrote a <i>mappiq</i> in the <i>he</i> for the pronominal suffix but apparently missed this one.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>I ate it</i>. A similar idea of consuming God&#8217;s word is found in Jer 15:16 and Rev 10:10, where it is also compared to honey and may be specifically reminiscent of this text.</p>
