<A NAME="312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=80><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term translated &#8220;diamond&#8221; is parallel to &#8220;iron&#8221; in Jer 17:1. The Hebrew uses two terms which are both translated at times as &#8220;flint,&#8221; but here one is clearly harder than the other. The translation &#8220;diamond&#8221; attempts to reflect this distinction in English. </p>
