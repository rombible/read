<A NAME="231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=689><b>tn</b> In the Hebrew text the subject is left unstated and must be supplied from the context. </p>
<A NAME="232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=690><b>tn</b> The names Oholah and Oholibah are both derived from the word meaning &#8220;tent.&#8221; The meaning of Oholah is &#8220;her tent,&#8221; while Oholibah means &#8220;my tent is in her.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=691><b>sn</b> In this allegory the Lord is depicted as being the husband of two wives. The OT law prohibited a man from marrying sisters (Lev 18:18), but the practice is attested in the OT (cf. Jacob). The metaphor is utilized here for illustrative purposes and does not mean that the Lord condoned such a practice or bigamy in general. </p>
<A NAME="234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=692><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;while she was under me.&#8221; The expression indicates that Oholah is viewed as the Lord&#8217;s wife. See Num 5:19-20, 29. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Played the harlot</i> refers to alliances with pagan nations in this context. In Ezek 16 harlotry described the sin of idolatry. </p>
<A NAME="235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=693><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Assyria.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=694><b>tn</b> The term apparently refers to Assyrian military officers; it is better construed with the description that follows. See D. I. Block, <i>Ezekiel </i>(NICOT), 1:738. </p>
<A NAME="237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=695><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;lusted after.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=696><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and poured out their harlotry on her.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=697><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;I gave her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the sons of Assyria.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=698><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;name.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=699><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;this&#8221; is not in the original text.</p>
<A NAME="2312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=700><b>tn</b> The only other occurrence of the Hebrew term is in Jer 22:14. </p>
<A NAME="2313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=701><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the sons of Babel.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=702><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;at the appearance of her eyes.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=703><b>sn</b> The Chaldeans were prominent tribal groups of Babylonia. The imagery is reminiscent of events in the reigns of Hezekiah (2 Kgs 20:12-15) and Jehoiakim (2 Kgs 23:34-24:1). </p>
<A NAME="2316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=704><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;The sons of Babel came to her on a bed of love.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=705><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;her soul.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=706><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;She exposed her harlotry and she exposed her nakedness.&#8221; </p>

<A NAME="2320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=708><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;my soul.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=709><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;She lusted after their concubines (?) whose flesh was the flesh of donkeys.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;their concubines&#8221; is extremely problematic here. The pronoun is masculine plural, suggesting that the Egyptian men are in view, but how concubines would fit into the picture envisioned here is not clear. Some suggest that Ezekiel uses the term in an idiomatic sense of &#8220;paramour,&#8221; but this still fails to explain how the pronoun relates to the noun. It is more likely that the term refers here to the Egyptians&#8217; genitals. The relative pronoun that follows introduces a more specific description of their genitals. </p>
<A NAME="2322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=710><b>tn</b> Or<i> </i>&#8220;you took note of.&#8221; The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">paqad</font>) in the Qal implies evaluating something and then acting in light of that judgment; here the prophet depicts Judah as approving of her youthful unfaithfulness and then magnifying it at the present time. Some translations assume the verb should be repointed as a Niphal, rendering &#8220;you missed&#8221; or by extension &#8220;you longed for,&#8221; but such an extension of the Niphal &#8220;to be missing&#8221; is otherwise unattested. </p>
<A NAME="2323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=711><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;when (they) did,&#8221; but the verb makes no sense here and is better emended to &#8220;when (they) fondled,&#8221; a verb used in vv. 3 and 8. See L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 2:43. </p>
<A NAME="2324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=712><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;for the sake of,&#8221; but the expression is awkward and is better emended to read &#8220;to squeeze.&#8221; See L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 2:43.</p>
<A NAME="2325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=713><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>, traditionally &#8220;behold&#8221;) indicates becoming aware of something and has been translated here as a verb.</p>
<A NAME="2326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=714><b>sn</b> <i>Pekod</i> was the name of an Aramean tribe (known as Puqudu in Mesopotamian texts)<i> </i>that lived in the region of the Tigris River. </p>

<A NAME="2340"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=728><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term means &#8220;labor,&#8221; but by extension it can also refer to that for which one works.</p>
<A NAME="2341"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=729><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;The nakedness of your prostitution will be exposed, and your obscene conduct and your harlotry.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2342"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=730><b>tn</b> The infinitive absolute continues the sequence begun in v. 28: &#8220;Look here, I am about to deliver you.&#8221; See Joüon 2:430 §123.w.</p>
<A NAME="2343"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=731><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;her cup.&#8221; A cup of intoxicating strong drink is used, here and elsewhere, as a metaphor for judgment because both leave one confused and reeling. (See Jer 25:15, 17, 28; Hab 2:16.) The cup of wrath is a theme also found in the NT (Mark 14:36). </p>
<A NAME="2344"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=732><b>sn</b> The image of a deep and wide cup suggests the degree of punishment; it will be extensive and leave the victim helpless. </p>
<A NAME="2345"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=733><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;filled with.&#8221; </p>

<A NAME="2347"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=735><b>tn</b> D. I. Block compares this to the idiom of &#8220;licking the plate&#8221; (<i>Ezekiel </i>[NICOT], 1:754, n. 137). The text is difficult as the word translated &#8220;gnaw&#8221; is rare. The noun is used of the shattered pieces of pottery and so could envision a broken cup. But the Piel verb form is used in only one other place (Num 24:8), where it is a denominative from the noun &#8220;bone&#8221; and seems to mean to &#8220;break (bones).&#8221; Why it would be collocated with &#8220;sherds&#8221; is not clear. For this reason some emend the phrase to read &#8220;consume its dregs&#8221; (see L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>[WBC], 2:44) or emend the verb to read &#8220;swallow,&#8221; as if the intoxicated Oholibah breaks the cup and then eats the very sherds in an effort to get every last drop of the beverage that dampens them. </p>
<A NAME="2348"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=736><b>sn</b> The severe action is more extreme than beating the breasts in anguish (Isa 32:12; Nah 2:7). It is also ironic for these are the very breasts she so blatantly offered to her lovers (vv. 3, 21). </p>
<A NAME="2349"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=737><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and you cast me behind your back.&#8221; The expression pictures her rejection of the Lord (see 1 Kgs 14:9).</p>
<A NAME="2350"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=738><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;punishment&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text but is demanded by the context. </p>
<A NAME="2351"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=739><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;will you judge.&#8221; Here the imperfect form of the verb is probably used with a desiderative nuance. Addressed to the prophet, &#8220;judge&#8221; means to warn of or pronounce God&#8217;s impending judgment. See 20:4; 22:2. </p>
<A NAME="2352"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=740><b>sn</b> The Lord speaks here in the role of the husband of the sisters.</p>
<A NAME="2353"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=741><b>tn</b> Heb &#8220;they have passed to them for food.&#8221; The verb is commonly taken to refer to passing children through fire, especially as an offering to the pagan god Molech. See Jer 32:35. </p>
<A NAME="2354"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=742><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in that day.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="2356"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=744><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb form is feminine singular, indicating that Oholibah (Judah) is specifically addressed here. This address continues through verse 42a (note &#8220;her&#8221;), but then both sisters are described in verse 42b, where the feminine pronouns are again plural.</p>
<A NAME="2357"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=745><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;(was) in her.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="2360"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=748><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they&#8221;; the referents (the sisters) have been specified in the translation for the sake of clarity.</p>

<A NAME="2364"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=752><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;give them to.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2365"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=753><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text adds &#8220;with fire.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2366"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=754><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the sins of your idols you will bear.&#8221; By extension it can mean the punishment for the sins.</p>
