<A NAME="4313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1345><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the measurements of the altar by cubits, the cubit being a cubit and a handbreadth.&#8221; The measuring units here and in the remainder of this section are the Hebrew &#8220;long&#8221; cubit, consisting of a cubit (about 18 inches or 45 cm) and a handbreadth (about 3 inches or 7.5 cm), for a total of 21 inches (52.5 cm). Because modern readers are not familiar with the cubit as a unit of measurement, and due to the additional complication of the &#8220;long&#8221; cubit as opposed to the regular cubit, all measurements have been converted to American standard feet and inches, with the Hebrew measurements and the metric equivalents given in the notes. On the altar see Ezek 40:47.</p>
