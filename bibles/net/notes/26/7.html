<A NAME="71"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=183><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;earth.&#8221; Elsewhere the expression &#8220;four corners of the earth&#8221; figuratively refers to the whole earth (Isa 11:12).</p>
<A NAME="72"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=184><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;punish&#8221; (cf. BDB 1047 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1496;</font> 3.c).</p>
<A NAME="73"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=185><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;ways.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="74"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=186><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;I will place on you.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="75"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=187><b>tn</b> The meaning of the Hebrew term is primarily emotional: &#8220;to pity,&#8221; which in context implies an action, as in being moved by pity in order to spare them from the horror of their punishment. </p>
<A NAME="76"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=188><b>tn</b> The pronoun &#8220;you&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but is implied.</p>
<A NAME="77"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=189><b>tn</b> &#8220;I will set your behavior on your head.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="78"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=190><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and your abominable practices will be among you.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="79"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=191><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term often refers to moral evil (see Ezek 6:10; 14:22), but in many contexts it refers to calamity or disaster, sometimes as punishment for evil behavior.</p>
<A NAME="710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=192><b>tc</b> So most Hebrew <sc>mss; many Hebrew <sc>mss read &#8220;disaster after disaster&#8221; (cf. NAB, NCV, NRSV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=193><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;has come.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=194><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;has come.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=195><b>tc</b> With different vowels the verb rendered &#8220;it has awakened&#8221; would be the noun &#8220;the end,&#8221; as in &#8220;the end is upon you.&#8221; The verb would represent a phonetic wordplay. The noun by virtue of repetition would continue to reinforce the idea of the end. Whether verb or noun, this is the only instance to occur with this preposition. </p>
<A NAME="714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=196><b>tc</b> For this entire verse, the LXX has only &#8220;the end is come.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> In each of the three cases of the verb translated with forms of &#8220;to come,&#8221; the form may either be a participle (&#8220;comes/is coming&#8221;) or a perfect (&#8220;has come&#8221;). Either form would indicate that the end is soon to arrive. This last form appears also to be feminine, although &#8220;end&#8221; is masculine. This shift may be looking ahead to the next verse, whose first noun (&#8220;Doom&#8221;) is feminine.</p>
<A NAME="715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=197><b>sn</b> <i>The day</i> refers to the day of the Lord, a concept which, beginning in Amos 5:18-20, became a common theme in the OT prophetic books. It refers to a time when the Lord intervenes in human affairs as warrior and judge.</p>
<A NAME="716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=198><b>tc</b> The LXX reads &#8220;neither tumult nor birth pains.&#8221; The LXX varies at many points from the MT in this chapter. The context suggests that one or both of these would be present on a day of judgment, thus favoring the MT. Perhaps more significant is the absence of &#8220;the mountains&#8221; in the LXX. If the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;</font> (<i>resh</i>) in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">harim</font>, &#8220;the mountains&#8221; not &#8220;on the mountains&#8221;) were a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;</font> (<i>dalet</i>), which is a common letter confusion, then it could be from the same root as the previous word, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1461;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hed</font>), meaning &#8220;the day is near &#8211; with destruction, not joyful shouting.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=199><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;to pour out rage&#8221; also occurs in Ezek 9:8; 14:19; 20:8, 13, 21; 22:31; 30:15; 36:18.</p>
<A NAME="718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=200><b>tn</b> The meaning of the Hebrew term is primarily emotional: &#8220;to pity,&#8221; which in context implies an action, as in being moved by pity in order to spare them from the horror of their punishment. </p>
<A NAME="719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=201><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;According to your behavior I will place on you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=202><b>tn</b> The MT lacks &#8220;you.&#8221; It has been added for clarification.</p>
<A NAME="721"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=203><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the violence.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="722"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=204><b>tc</b> The LXX reads &#8220;he will crush the wicked rod without confusion or haste.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The verb has been supplied for the Hebrew text to clarify the sense. </p>
<A NAME="723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=205><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word occurs only here in the OT. </p>
<A NAME="724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=206><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;wrath.&#8221; Context clarifies that God&#8217;s wrath is in view.</p>
<A NAME="725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=207><b>tc</b> The translation follows the LXX for the first line of the verse, although the LXX has lost the second line due to homoioteleuton (similar endings of the clauses). The MT reads &#8220;The seller will not return to the sale.&#8221; This Hebrew reading has been construed as a reference to land redemption, the temporary sale of the use of property, with property rights returned to the seller in the year of Jubilee. But the context has no other indicator that land redemption is in view. If correct, the LXX evidence suggests that one of the cases of &#8220;the customer&#8221; has been replaced by &#8220;the seller&#8221; in the MT, perhaps due to hoimoioarcton (similar beginnings of the words). </p>
<A NAME="726"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=208><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word refers to the din or noise made by a crowd, and by extension may refer to the crowd itself.</p>
<A NAME="727"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=209><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;in their punishment.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;in/for [a person&#8217;s] iniquity&#8221; occurs fourteen times in Ezekiel: here and in v. 16; 3:18, 19; 4:17; 18:17, 18, 19, 20; 24:23; 33:6, 8, 9; 39:23. The Hebrew word for &#8220;iniquity&#8221; may also mean the &#8220;punishment for iniquity.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="728"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=210><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word refers to the din or noise made by a crowd, and by extension may refer to the crowd itself.</p>
<A NAME="729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=211><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;their knees will run with water.&#8221; The expression probably refers to urination caused by fright, which is how the LXX renders the phrase. More colloquial English would simply be &#8220;they will wet their pants,&#8221; but as D. I. Block (<i>Ezekiel </i>[NICOT], 1:261, n. 98) notes, the men likely wore skirts which were short enough to expose urine on the knees. </p>
<A NAME="730"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=212><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;baldness will be on their heads.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="731"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=213><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term can refer to menstrual impurity. The term also occurs at the end of v. 20.</p>
<A NAME="732"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=214><b>sn</b> Compare Zeph 1:18. </p>
<A NAME="733"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=215><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;it.&#8221; Apparently the subject is the silver and gold mentioned earlier (see L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>[WBC], 1:102).</p>
<A NAME="734"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=216><b>tn</b> The &#8220;stumbling block of their iniquity&#8221; is a unique phrase of the prophet Ezekiel (Ezek 14:3, 4, 7; 18:30; 44:12).</p>
<A NAME="735"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=217><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;he set up the beauty of his ornament as pride.&#8221; The verb may be repointed as plural without changing the consonantal text. The Syriac reads &#8220;their ornaments&#8221; (plural), implying <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1491;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">edyam</font>) rather than <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1491;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">edyo</font>) and meaning &#8220;they were proud of their beautiful ornaments.&#8221; This understands &#8220;ornaments&#8221; in the common sense of women&#8217;s jewelry, which then were used to make idols. The singular suffix &#8220;his ornaments&#8221; would refer to using items from the temple treasury to make idols. D. I. Block points out the foreshadowing of Ezek 16:17 which, with Rashi and the Targum, supports the understanding that this is a reference to temple items. See D. I. Block, <i>Ezekiel </i>(NICOT), 1:265.</p>
<A NAME="736"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=218><b>sn</b> <i>My treasured place</i> probably refers to the temple (however, cf. NLT &#8220;my treasured land&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="737"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=219><b>sn</b> Since the pronouns &#8220;it&#8221; are both feminine, they do not refer to the masculine &#8220;my treasured place&#8221;; instead they probably refer to Jerusalem or the land, both of which are feminine in Hebrew. </p>
<A NAME="738"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=220><b>tc</b> The Hebrew word &#8220;the chain&#8221; occurs only here in the OT. The reading of the LXX (&#8220;and they will make carnage&#8221;) seems to imply a Hebrew text of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1463;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">habbattoq</font>, &#8220;disorder, slaughter&#8221;) instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">haratoq</font>, &#8220;the chain&#8221;). The LXX is also translating the verb as a third person plural future and taking this as the end of the preceding verse. As M. Greenberg (<i>Ezekiel </i>[AB], 1:154) notes, this may refer to a chain for a train of exiles but &#8220;the context does not speak of exile but of the city&#8217;s fall. The versions guess desperately and we can do little better.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="739"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=221><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;judgment for blood,&#8221; i.e., indictment or accountability for bloodshed. The word for &#8220;judgment&#8221; does not appear in the similar phrase in 9:9.</p>
<A NAME="740"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=222><b>sn</b> Or &#8220;their holy places&#8221; (KJV, ASV, NASB, NCV, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="741"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=223><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word occurs only here in the OT. It is interpreted based on a Syriac cognate meaning &#8220;to bristle or stiffen (in terror).&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="742"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=224><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and by their judgments.&#8221; </p>
