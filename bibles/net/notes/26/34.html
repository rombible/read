<A NAME="341"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1080><b>tn</b> The term shepherd is applied to kings in the ancient Near East. In the OT the <sc>Lord is often addressed as shepherd of Israel (Gen 49:24; Ps 8:1). The imagery of shepherds as Israel&#8217;s leaders is also employed (Jer 23:1-2). </p>
<A NAME="342"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1081><b>tn</b> The term translated &#8220;harshness&#8221; is used to describe the oppression the Israelites suffered as slaves in Egypt (Exod 1:13). </p>
<A NAME="343"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1082><b>tn</b> As a case of dittography, the MT repeats &#8220;and they were scattered&#8221; at the end of the verse. </p>
<A NAME="344"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1083><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;I will cause them to cease from feeding sheep.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="345"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1084><b>sn</b> The imagery may reflect the overthrow of the Israelites by the Babylonians in 587/6 <sc>b.c. </p>

<A NAME="347"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1086><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;outside.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="348"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1087><b>sn</b> The messianic king is here called &#8220;David&#8221; (see Jer 30:9 and Hos 3:5, as well as Isa 11:1 and Mic 5:2) because he will fulfill the Davidic royal ideal depicted in the prophets and royal psalms (see Ps 2, 89). </p>
<A NAME="349"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1088><b>sn</b> The messianic king (&#8220;David&#8221;) is called both &#8220;king&#8221; and &#8220;prince&#8221; in 37:24-25. The use of the term &#8220;prince&#8221; for this king facilitates the contrast between this ideal ruler and the Davidic &#8220;princes&#8221; denounced in earlier prophecies (see 7:27; 12:10, 12; 19:1; 21:25; 22:6, 25). </p>
<A NAME="3410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1089><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;live securely&#8221; occurs in Ezek 28:26; 38:8, 11, 14; 39:26 as an expression of freedom from fear. It is a promised blessing resulting from obedience (see Lev 26:5-6). </p>
<A NAME="3411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1090><b>sn</b> <i>The woods</i> were typically considered to be places of danger (Ps 104:20-21; Jer 5:6). </p>
<A NAME="3412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1091><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;showers of blessing.&#8221; Abundant rain, which in turn produces fruit and crops (v. 27), is a covenantal blessing for obedience (Lev 26:4). </p>
<A NAME="3413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1092><b>tc</b> The MT reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿshem</font>, &#8220;for a name&#8221;), meaning perhaps a renowned planting (place). The translation takes this to be a metathesis of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shalom</font>) as was read by the LXX. </p>

The possessive pronoun &#8220;my&#8221; is supplied in the translation to balance &#8220;I am your God&#8221; in the next clause.</p>
