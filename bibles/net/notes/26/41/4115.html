<A NAME="4115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1296><b>tc</b> The Hebrew is difficult here. The Targum envisions a winding ramp or set of stairs, which entails reading the first word as a noun rather than a verb and reading the second word also not as a verb, supposing that an initial <i>mem</i> has been read as <i>vav</i> and <i>nun</i>. See D. I. Block, <i>Ezekiel </i>(NICOT), 2:549. </p>
