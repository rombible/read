<A NAME="21"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=51><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>son of man</i> occurs ninety-three times in the book of Ezekiel. It simply means &#8220;human one,&#8221; and distinguishes the prophet from the nonhuman beings that are present in the world of his vision.</p>
<A NAME="22"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=52><b>tc</b> The phrase &#8220;as he spoke to me&#8221; is absent from the LXX. </p>
<A NAME="23"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=53><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;spirit.&#8221; NIV has &#8220;the Spirit,&#8221; but the absence of the article in the Hebrew text makes this unlikely. Elsewhere in Ezekiel the Lord&#8217;s Spirit is referred to as &#8220;the Spirit of the Lord&#8221; (11:5; 37:1), &#8220;the Spirit of God&#8221; (11:24), or &#8220;my (that is, the Lord&#8217;s) Spirit&#8221; (36:27; 37:14; 39:29). Some identify the &#8220;spirit&#8221; of 2:2 as the spirit that energized the living beings, however, that &#8220;spirit&#8221; is called &#8220;the spirit&#8221; (1:12, 20) or &#8220;the spirit of the living beings&#8221; (1:20-21; 10:17). Still others see the term as referring to an impersonal &#8220;spirit&#8221; of strength or courage, that is, the term may also be understood as a disposition or attitude. The Hebrew word often refers to a wind in Ezekiel (1:4; 5:10, 12; 12:4; 13:11, 13; 17:10, 21; 19:12; 27:26; 37:9). In 37:5-10 a &#8220;breath&#8221; originates in the &#8220;four winds&#8221; and is associated with the Lord&#8217;s life-giving breath (see v. 14). This breath enters into the dry bones and gives them life. In a similar fashion the breath of 2:2 (see also 3:24) energizes paralyzed Ezekiel. Breath and wind are related. On the one hand it is a more normal picture to think of breath rather than wind entering someone, but since wind represents an external force it seems more likely for wind rather than breath to stand someone up (unless we should understand it as a disposition). It may be that one should envision the breath of the speaker moving like a wind to revive Ezekiel, helping him to regain his breath and invigorating him to stand. A wind also transports the prophet from one place to another (3:12, 14; 8:3; 11:1, 24; 43:5). </p>
<A NAME="24"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=54><b>tc</b> The Hebrew reads &#8220;sons of,&#8221; while the LXX reads &#8220;house,&#8221; implying the more common phrase in Ezekiel. Either could be abbreviated with the first letter <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet</font>). In preparation for the characterization &#8220;house of rebellion,&#8221; in vv. 5, 6, and 8, &#8220;house&#8221; is preferred (L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>[WBC], 1:10 and W. Zimmerli, <i>Ezekiel </i>[Hermeneia], 2:564-65). </p>
<A NAME="25"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=55><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to the rebellious nations.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;to the rebellious nations&#8221; is omitted in the LXX. Elsewhere in Ezekiel the singular word &#8220;nation&#8221; is used for Israel (36:13-15; 37:22). Here &#8220;nations&#8221; may have the meaning of &#8220;tribes&#8221; or refer to the two nations of Israel and Judah. </p>
<A NAME="26"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=56><b>tc</b> This word is omitted from the LXX. </p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term used here is the strongest word available for expressing a covenant violation. The word is used in the diplomatic arena to express a treaty violation (2 Kgs 1:1; 3:5, 7).</p>
<A NAME="27"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=57><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sons.&#8221; The word choice may reflect treaty idiom, where the relationship between an overlord and his subjects can be described as that of father and son.</p>
<A NAME="28"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=58><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;stern of face and hard of heart.&#8221; The phrases &#8220;stern of face&#8221; and &#8220;hard of heart&#8221; are lacking in the LXX.</p>
<A NAME="29"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=59><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;thus says [the <sc>Lord]&#8221; occurs 129 times in Ezekiel; the announcement is identical to the way messengers often introduced their messages (Gen 32:5; 45:9; Exod 5:10; Num 20:14; Judg 11:15).</p>
<A NAME="210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=60><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they&#8221;; the phrase &#8220;And as for them&#8221; has been used in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=61><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word implies obedience rather than mere hearing or paying attention.</p>
<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=62><b>tn</b> This Hebrew adjective is also used to describe the Israelites in Num 17:25 and Isa 30:9.</p>
<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=63><b>sn</b> The book of Ezekiel frequently refers to the Israelites as <i>a rebellious house</i> (Ezek 2:5, 6, 8; 3:9, 26-27; 12:2-3, 9, 25; 17:12; 24:3). </p>
<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=64><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term occurs only here in the OT.</p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=65><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term is found elsewhere in the OT only in Ezek 28:24.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Here <i>thorns</i> may be a figure for hostility (Ezek 28:24; Mic 7:4).</p>
<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=66><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;of their faces.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=67><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;on the face.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=68><b>sn</b> <i>Written on the front and back</i>. While it was common for papyrus scrolls to have writing on both sides the same was not true for leather scrolls.</p>
