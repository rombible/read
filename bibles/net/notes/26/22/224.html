<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=651><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;you have brought near your days.&#8221; The expression &#8220;bring near your days&#8221; appears to be an adaptation of the idiom &#8220;days draw near,&#8221; which is used to indicate that an event, such as death, is imminent (see Gen 27:41; 47:29; Deut 31:14; 1 Kgs 2:1; Ezek 12:23). Here &#8220;your days&#8221; probably refers to the days of the personified city&#8217;s life, which was about to come to an end through God&#8217;s judgment. </p>
