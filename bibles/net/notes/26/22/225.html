<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=652><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and you have come to your years.&#8221; This appears to mean that she has arrived at the time when her years (i.e., life) would end, though it may mean that her years of punishment will begin. Because &#8220;day&#8221; and &#8220;time&#8221; are so closely associated in the immediate context (see 21:25, 29) some prefer to emend the text and read &#8220;you have brought near your time.&#8221; See L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 2:31, as well as the translator&#8217;s note on verse 3.</p>
