<A NAME="2214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=661><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the nakedness of a father one uncovers within you.&#8221; The ancient versions read the verb as plural (&#8220;they uncover&#8221;). If the singular is retained, it must be taken as indefinite and representative of the entire group. The idiomatic expression &#8220;uncover the nakedness&#8221; refers here to sexual intercourse (cf. Lev 18:6). To uncover a father&#8217;s nakedness could include sexual relations with one&#8217;s own mother (Lev 18:7), but more likely it refers to having intercourse with another wife of one&#8217;s father, such as a stepmother (Lev 18:8; cf. Gen 35:22; 49:4). </p>
