<A NAME="2232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=679><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;that is not cleansed&#8221;; the LXX reads &#8220;that is not drenched,&#8221; which assumes a different vowel pointing as well as the loss of a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;</font> (<i>mem</i>) due to haplography. In light of the following reference to showers, the reading of the LXX certainly fits the context well. For a defense of the emendation, see L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 2:32. Yet the MT is not an unreasonable reading since uncleanness in the land also fits the context, and a poetic connection between rain and the land being uncleansed may be feasible since washing with water is elsewhere associated with cleansing (Num 8:7; 31:23; Ps 51:7).</p>
