<A NAME="2234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=681><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a conspiracy of her prophets is in her midst.&#8221; The LXX reads &#8220;whose princes&#8221; rather than &#8220;a conspiracy of prophets.&#8221; The prophets are mentioned later in the paragraph (v. 28). If one follows the LXX in verse 25, then five distinct groups are mentioned in vv. 25-29: princes, priests, officials, prophets, and the people of the land. For a defense of the Septuagintal reading, see L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 2:32, and D. I. Block, <i>Ezekiel </i>(NICOT), 1:720, n. 4. </p>
