<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=648><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;will you judge.&#8221; Here the imperfect form of the verb is probably used with a desiderative nuance. Addressed to the prophet, &#8220;judge&#8221; means to warn of or pronounce God&#8217;s impending judgment upon the city. See 20:4. </p>
