<a name="123"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=23><b>tc</b> The MT has an additional word at the beginning of v. 11, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ufÿnehem</font>, &#8220;and their faces&#8221;), which is missing from the LXX. As the rest of the verse only applies to wings, &#8220;their faces&#8221; would have to somehow be understood in the previous clause. But this would be very awkward and is doubly problematic since &#8220;their faces&#8221; are already introduced as the topic at the beginning of v. 10. The Hebrew scribe appears to have copied the phrase &#8220;and their faces and their wings&#8221; from v. 8, where it introduces the content of 9-11. Only &#8220;and (as for) their wings&#8221; belongs here. </p>
