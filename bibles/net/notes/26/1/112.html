<a name="112"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=12><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;fire taking hold of itself,&#8221; perhaps repeatedly. The phrase occurs elsewhere only in Exod 9:24 in association with a hailstorm. The LXX interprets the phrase as fire flashing like lightning, but it is possibly a self-sustaining blaze of divine origin. The LXX also reverses the order of the descriptors, i.e., &#8220;light went around it and fire flashed like lightning within it.&#8221; </p>
