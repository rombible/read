<a name="118"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=18><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term is feminine plural yet thirty-three of the forty-five pronominal suffixes and verbal references which refer to the living beings in the chapter are masculine plural. The grammatical vacillation between masculine and feminine plurals suggests the difficulty Ezekiel had in penning these words as he was overcome by the vision of God. In ancient Near Eastern sculpture very similar images of part-human, part-animal creatures serve as throne and sky bearers. For a discussion of ancient Near Eastern parallels, see L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 1:26-31. Ezekiel&#8217;s vision is an example of contextualization, where God accommodates his self-revelation to cultural expectations and norms. </p>
