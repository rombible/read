<a name="139"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=39><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;wind.&#8221; The Hebrew is difficult since the text presents four creatures and then talks about &#8220;the spirit&#8221; (singular) of &#8220;the living being&#8221; (singular). According to M. Greenberg (<i>Ezekiel </i>[AB], 1:45) the Targum interprets this as &#8220;will.&#8221; Greenberg views this as the spirit of the one enthroned above the creatures, but one would not expect the article when the one enthroned has not yet been introduced. </p>
