The task of uniting groups of deportees, gaining freedom from one&#8217;s overlords and returning to retake one&#8217;s own country would be considerably more complicated than living in one&#8217;s homeland and waiting for an opportune moment to drive out the enemy&#8217;s soldiers. The Babylonians adopted this practice also, after defeating the Assyrians. The Babylonians deported Judeans on three occasions. The practice of deportation was reversed by the Persian conquerors of Babylon, who gained favor from their subjects for allowing them to return to their homeland and, as polytheists, sought the favor of the gods of the various countries which had come under their control. </p>
