<A NAME="384"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1162><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the prince, the chief of Meshech and Tubal.&#8221; Some translate &#8220;the prince of Rosh, Meshech and Tubal,&#8221; but it is more likely that the Hebrew noun in question is a common noun in apposition to &#8220;prince,&#8221; rather than a proper name. See D. I. Block, <i>Ezekiel </i>(NICOT), 2:434-35. As Block demonstrates, attempts by some popular writers to identify these proper names with later geographical sites in Russia are anachronistic. See as well E. Yamauchi, <i>Foes From the Northern Frontier</i>, 19-27. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Meshech </i>and <i>Tubal</i> were two nations in Cappadocia of Asia Minor. They were also sons of Japheth (Gen 10:2; 1 Chr 1:5). </p>
