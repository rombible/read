<A NAME="828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=252><b>tn</b> It is not clear what the practice of &#8220;holding a branch to the nose&#8221; indicates. A possible parallel is the Syrian relief of a king holding a flower to his nose as he worships the stars (<i>ANEP</i> 281). See L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 1:145-46. The LXX glosses the expression as &#8220;Behold, they are like mockers.&#8221; </p>
