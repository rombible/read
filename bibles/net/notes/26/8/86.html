<A NAME="86"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=230><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;what appeared to be his waist and downwards was fire.&#8221; The LXX omits &#8220;what appeared to be,&#8221; reading &#8220;from his waist to below was fire.&#8221; Suggesting that &#8220;like what appeared to be&#8221; belongs before &#8220;fire,&#8221; D. I. Block (<i>Ezekiel </i>[NICOT], 1:277) points out the resulting poetic symmetry of form with the next line as followed in the translation here. </p>
