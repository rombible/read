<A NAME="281"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=891><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;ruler&#8221; (NIV, NCV).</p>
<A NAME="282"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=892><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;lifted up.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> See Prov 16:5. </p>
<A NAME="283"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=893><b>tn</b> Or<i> </i>&#8220;I am divine.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="284"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=894><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and you made your heart (mind) like the heart (mind) of gods.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="285"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=895><b>sn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;Danel&#8221; (so TEV), referring to a ruler known from Canaanite legend. See the note on &#8220;Daniel&#8221;<i> </i>in 14:14. A reference to Danel (preserved in legend at Ugarit, near the northern end of the Phoenician coast) makes more sense here when addressing Tyre than in 14:14.</p>
<A NAME="286"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=896><b>sn</b> The tone here is sarcastic, reflecting the ruler&#8217;s view of himself. </p>
<A NAME="287"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=897><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;wisdom.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="288"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=898><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;because of your making your heart like the heart of gods.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="289"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=899><b>sn</b> This is probably a reference to the Babylonians. </p>
<A NAME="2810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=900><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;they will draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=901><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;you will die the death of the slain.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=902><b>sn</b> The Phoenicians practiced circumcision, so the language here must be figurative, indicating that they would be treated in a disgraceful manner. Uncircumcised peoples were viewed as inferior, unclean, and perhaps even sub-human. See 31:18 and 32:17-32, as well as the discussion in D. I. Block, <i>Ezekiel </i>(NICOT), 2:99. </p>
<A NAME="2813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=903><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lift up.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=904><b>tn</b> For a discussion of possible nuances of this phrase, see M. Greenberg, <i>Ezekiel </i>(AB), 2:580-81.</p>
<A NAME="2815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=905><b>sn</b> The imagery of the lament appears to draw upon an extrabiblical Eden tradition about the expulsion of the first man (see v. 14 and the note there) from the garden due to his pride. The biblical Eden tradition speaks of cherubs placed as guardians at the garden entrance following the sin of Adam and Eve (Gen 3:24), but no guardian cherub like the one described in verse 14 is depicted or mentioned in the biblical account. Ezekiel&#8217;s imagery also appears to reflect Mesopotamian and Canaanite mythology at certain points. See D. I. Block, <i>Ezekiel </i>(NICOT), 2:119-20. </p>
<A NAME="2816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=906><b>tn</b> The exact identification of each gemstone is uncertain. The list should be compared to that of the priest in Exod 28:17-20, which lists twelve stones in rows of three. The LXX apparently imports the Exod 28 list. See reference to the types of stones in L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 2:91.</p>
<A NAME="2817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=907><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;winged&#8221;; see L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 2:91. </p>
<A NAME="2818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=908><b>tn</b> The meaning of this phrase in Hebrew is uncertain. The word translated here &#8220;guards&#8221; occurs in Exod 25:20 in reference to the cherubim &#8220;covering&#8221; the ark. </p>
<A NAME="2819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=909><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;you (were) an anointed cherub that covers and I placed you.&#8221; In the Hebrew text the ruler of Tyre is equated with a cherub, and the verb &#8220;I placed you&#8221; is taken with what follows (&#8220;on the holy mountain of God&#8221;). However, this reading is problematic. The pronoun &#8220;you&#8221; at the beginning of verse 14 is feminine singular in the Hebrew text; elsewhere in this passage the ruler of Tyre is addressed with masculine singular forms. It is possible that the pronoun is a rare (see Deut 5:24; Num 11:15) or defectively written (see 1 Sam 24:19; Neh 9:6; Job 1:10; Ps 6:3; Eccl 7:22) masculine form, but it is more likely that the form should be repointed as the preposition &#8220;with&#8221; (see the LXX). In this case the ruler of Tyre is compared to the first man, not to a cherub. If this emendation is accepted, then the verb &#8220;I placed you&#8221; belongs with what precedes and concludes the first sentence in the verse. It is noteworthy that the verbs in the second and third lines of the verse also appear at the end of the sentence in the Hebrew text. The presence of a conjunction at the beginning of &#8220;I placed you&#8221; is problematic for the proposal, but it may reflect a later misunderstanding of the syntax of the verse. For a defense of the proposed emendation, see L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 2:91.</p>
<A NAME="2820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=910><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;ways.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=911><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;they filled your midst with violence.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=912><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;I defiled you.&#8221; The presence of the preposition &#8220;from&#8221; following the verb indicates that a verb of motion is implied as well. See L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 2:91. </p>
<A NAME="2823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=913><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and I expelled you, O guardian cherub.&#8221; The Hebrew text takes the verb as first person and understands &#8220;guardian cherub&#8221; as a vocative, in apposition to the pronominal suffix on the verb. However, if the emendation in verse 14a is accepted (see the note above), then one may follow the LXX here as well and emend the verb to a third person perfect. In this case the subject of the verb is the guardian cherub. See L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 2:91.</p>
<A NAME="2824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=914><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;set your face against.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=915><b>sn</b> <i>Sidon</i> was located 25 miles north of Tyre.</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map1-A1; JP3-F3; JP4-F3. </p>
<A NAME="2826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=916><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I challenge you.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;I am against you&#8221; may be a formula for challenging someone to combat or a duel. See D. I. Block, <i>Ezekiel </i>(NICOT), 1:201-2, and P. Humbert, &#8220;Die Herausforderungsformel &#8216;<font face="Hebrewtl">h!nn#n' ?l?K&gt;</font>,&#8217;&#8221; <i>ZAW 45</i> (1933): 101-8.</p>
<A NAME="2827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=917><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;reveal my holiness.&#8221; God&#8217;s &#8220;holiness&#8221; is fundamentally his transcendence as sovereign ruler of the world. The revelation of his authority and power through judgment is in view in this context. </p>
<A NAME="2828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=918><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;into it&#8221;; the referent of the feminine pronoun has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=919><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;by a sword against it.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=920><b>sn</b> Similar language is used in reference to Israel&#8217;s adversaries in Num 33:55; Josh 23:13.</p>
<A NAME="2831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=921><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and there will not be for the house of Israel a brier that pricks and a thorn that inflicts pain from all the ones who surround them, the ones who scorn them.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2832"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=922><b>tn</b> Or<i> </i>&#8220;reveal my holiness.&#8221; See verse 22. </p>
<A NAME="2833"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=923><b>sn</b> This promise was given in Lev 25:18-19. </p>
