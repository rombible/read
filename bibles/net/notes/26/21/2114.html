<A NAME="2114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=613><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Or shall we rejoice, scepter of my son, it despises every tree.&#8221; The translation understands the subject of the verb &#8220;despises,&#8221; which is a feminine form in the Hebrew text, to be the sword (which is a feminine noun) mentioned just before this. Alternatively, the line may be understood as &#8220;let us not rejoice, O tribe of my son; it despises every tree.&#8221; The same word in Hebrew may be either &#8220;rod,&#8221; &#8220;scepter,&#8221; or &#8220;tribe.&#8221; The word sometimes translated as &#8220;or&#8221; or taken as an interrogative particle may be a negative particle. See D. I. Block, <i>Ezekiel </i>(NICOT), 1:672, n. 79.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The people of Judah should not place false hope in their king, symbolized by his royal scepter, for God&#8217;s judgment (symbolized by fire and then a sword) would destroy every tree (see 20:47), symbolizing the righteous and wicked (see 21:3-4). </p>
