<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=607><b>sn</b> Ezekiel elsewhere pictures the Lord&#8217;s judgment as discriminating between the righteous and the wicked (9:4-6; 18:1-20; see as well Pss 1 and 11) and speaks of the preservation of a remnant (3:21; 6:8; 12:16). Perhaps here he exaggerates for rhetorical effect in an effort to subdue any false optimism. See L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 2:25-26; D. I. Block, <i>Ezekiel </i>(NICOT), 1:669-70; and W. Zimmerli, <i>Ezekiel </i>(Hermeneia), 1:424-25. </p>
