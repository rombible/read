<A NAME="2139"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=638><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;A ruin, a ruin, a ruin I will make it.&#8221; The threefold repetition of the noun &#8220;ruin&#8221; is for emphasis and draws attention to the degree of ruin that would take place. See <i>IBHS</i> 233 §12.5a and GKC 431-32 §133.<i>k</i>. The pronominal suffix (translated &#8220;it&#8221;) on the verb &#8220;make&#8221; is feminine in Hebrew. The probable antecedent is the &#8220;turban/crown&#8221; (both nouns are feminine in form) mentioned in verse 26. The point is that the king&#8217;s royal splendor would be completely devastated as judgment overtook his realm and brought his reign to a violent end. </p>
