<A NAME="2147"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=646><b>tn</b> In the Hebrew text of vv. 30-32 the second person verbal and pronominal forms are feminine singular. This may indicate that the personified Babylonian sword is being addressed. The Hebrew word for &#8220;sword&#8221; (see v. 28) is feminine. However, it may refer to the Ammonites.</p>
