<A NAME="2140"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=639><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Also this, he was not, until the coming of the one to whom the judgment belongs and I have given it.&#8221; The Hebrew text, as it stands, is grammatically difficult. The pronoun &#8220;this&#8221; is feminine, while the following negated verb (&#8220;was not&#8221;) is masculine. Some emend the verb to a feminine form (see <i>BHS</i>). In this case the statement refers to the destiny of the king&#8217;s turban/crown (symbolizing his reign). See the previous note. The preposition translated &#8220;when&#8221; normally means &#8220;until,&#8221; but here it seems to refer to the period during which the preceding situation is realized, rather than its termination point. See L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>(WBC), 2:19, 21. The second part of the statement, though awkward, probably refers to the arrival of the Babylonian king, to whom the Lord had assigned the task of judgment (see 23:24). Or the verse may read &#8220;A total ruin I will make, even this. It will not be until the one comes to whom is (the task of) judgment and I have assigned it.&#8221; </p>
