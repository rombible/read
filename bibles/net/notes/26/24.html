<A NAME="241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=755><b>tn</b> The date of this oracle was January 15, 588 <sc>b.c.</p>
<A NAME="242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=756><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;lean on, put pressure on.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=757><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="244"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=758><b>sn</b> The book of Ezekiel frequently refers to the Israelites as <i>a rebellious house</i> (Ezek 2:5, 6, 8; 3:9, 26-27; 12:2-3, 9, 25; 17:12; 24:3). </p>
<A NAME="245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=759><b>sn</b> See Ezek 11:3-12. </p>
<A NAME="246"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=760><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;rust.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="247"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=761><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;has not gone out.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=762><b>tn</b> Here &#8220;lot&#8221; may refer to the decision made by casting lots; it is not chosen at all.</p>
<A NAME="249"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=763><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;set it upon its coals, empty.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=764><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;rust&#8221; (so also in v. 12).</p>
<A NAME="2411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=765><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;(with) toil she has wearied.&#8221; The meaning of the statement is unclear in the Hebrew text; some follow the LXX and delete it. The first word in the statement (rendered &#8220;toil&#8221; in the literal translation above) occurs only here in the OT, and the verb &#8220;she has wearied&#8221; lacks a stated object. Elsewhere the Hiphil of the verb refers to wearying someone or trying someone&#8217;s patience. The feminine subject is apparently the symbolic pot. </p>
<A NAME="2412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=766><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;does not go out.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=767><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in fire its rust.&#8221; The meaning of the expression is unclear. The translation understands the statement as a command to burn the rust away. See D. I. Block, <i>Ezekiel </i>(NICOT), 1:768.</p>
<A NAME="2414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=768><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in your uncleanness (is) obscene conduct.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=769><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;because I cleansed you.&#8221; In this context (see especially the very next statement), the statement must refer to divine intention and purpose. Despite God&#8217;s efforts to cleanse his people, they resisted him and remained morally impure.</p>
<A NAME="2416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=770><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text adds the word &#8220;again.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=771><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;it&#8221;; the referent has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=772><b>tn</b> Or perhaps, &#8220;change my mind.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=773><b>tc</b> Some medieval Hebrew <sc>mss and the major ancient versions read a first person verb here. Most Hebrew <sc>mss read have an indefinite subject, &#8220;they will judge you,&#8221; which could be translated, &#8220;you will be judged.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=774><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;ways.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=775><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a strike.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=776><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Groan silently. As to the dead&#8230;.&#8221; Cf. M. Greenberg&#8217;s suggestion that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1465;&#1501; &#1502;&#1461;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dom metim</font>) be taken together and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1465;&#1501;</font> be derived from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1464;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">damam</font>, &#8220;to moan, murmur&#8221;). See M. Greenberg, <i>Ezekiel </i>(AB), 2:508. </p>
<A NAME="2423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=777><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;(For) the dead mourning you shall not conduct.&#8221; In the Hebrew text the word translated &#8220;dead&#8221; is plural, indicating that mourning rites are in view. Such rites would involve outward demonstrations of one&#8217;s sorrow, including wailing and weeping.</p>
<A NAME="2424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=778><b>sn</b> The turban would normally be removed for mourning (Josh 7:6; 1 Sam 4:12). </p>
<A NAME="2425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=779><b>sn</b> Mourning rites included covering the lower part of the face. See Lev 13:45. </p>
<A NAME="2426"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=780><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the bread of men.&#8221; The translation follows the suggestion accepted by M. Greenberg (<i>Ezekiel </i>[AB], 2:509) that this refers to a meal brought by comforters to the one mourning. Some repoint the consonantal text to read &#8220;the bread of despair&#8221; (see L. C. Allen, <i>Ezekiel </i>[WBC], 2:56), while others, with support from the Targum and Vulgate, emend the consonantal text to read &#8220;the bread of mourners&#8221; (see D. I. Block, <i>Ezekiel </i>[NICOT], 1:784). </p>
<A NAME="2427"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=781><b>tn</b> This may refer to the following morning. For a discussion of various interpretive options in understanding the chronology reflected in verse 18, see D. I. Block, <i>Ezekiel </i>(NICOT), 1:790.</p>
<A NAME="2428"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=782><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the pride of your strength&#8221; means &#8220;your strong pride.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2429"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=783><b>sn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the delight of your eyes.&#8221; Just as Ezekiel was deprived of his beloved wife (v. 16, the &#8220;desire&#8221; of his &#8220;eyes&#8221;) so the Lord would be forced to remove the object of his devotion, the temple, which symbolized his close relationship to his covenant people. </p>
<A NAME="2430"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=784><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the object of compassion of your soul.&#8221; The accentuation in the traditional Hebrew text indicates that the descriptive phrases (&#8220;the source of your confident pride, the object in which your eyes delight, and your life&#8217;s passion&#8221;) modify the preceding &#8220;my sanctuary.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2431"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=785><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;fall.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2432"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=786><b>tn</b> See v. 17.</p>
<A NAME="2433"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=787><b>tn</b> The same verb appears in 4:17 and 33:10.</p>
<A NAME="2434"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=788><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;in your punishment.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;in/for [a person&#8217;s] iniquity/punishment&#8221; occurs fourteen times in Ezekiel: here; 3:18, 19; 4:17; 7:13, 16; 18:17, 18, 19, 20; 33:6, 8, 9; 39:23. The Hebrew word for &#8220;iniquity&#8221; may also mean the &#8220;punishment&#8221; for iniquity or &#8220;guilt&#8221; of iniquity.</p>
<A NAME="2435"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=789><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;(Will) it not (be) in the day I take?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2436"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=790><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the uplifting of their soul.&#8221; According to BDB 672 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;</font> 2, the term &#8220;uplifting&#8221; refers to &#8220;that to which they lift up their soul, their heart&#8217;s desire.&#8221; However, this text is the only one listed for this use. It seems more likely that the term has its well-attested nuance of &#8220;burden, load,&#8221; here and refers to that which weighs them down emotionally and is a constant source of concern or worry. </p>
<A NAME="2437"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=791><b>tn</b> In the Hebrew text there is no conjunction before &#8220;their sons and daughters.&#8221; For this reason one might assume that the preceding descriptive phrases refer to the sons and daughters, but verse 21 suggests otherwise. The descriptive phrases appear to refer to the &#8220;stronghold,&#8221; which parallels &#8220;my sanctuary&#8221; in verse 21. The children constitute a separate category.</p>
<A NAME="2438"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=792><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;to make the ears hear.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2439"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=793><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your mouth will open.&#8221;</p>
