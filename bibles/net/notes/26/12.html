<A NAME="121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=334><b>sn</b> The book of Ezekiel frequently refers to the Israelites as a rebellious house (Ezek 2:5, 6, 8; 3:9, 26-27; 12:2-3, 9, 25; 17:12; 24:3). </p>
<A NAME="122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=335><b>sn</b> This verse is very similar to Isa 6:9-10.</p>
<A NAME="123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=336><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;see.&#8221; This plays on the uses of &#8220;see&#8221; in v. 2. They will see his actions with their eyes and perhaps they will &#8220;see&#8221; with their mind, that is, understand or grasp the point. </p>
<A NAME="124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=337><b>tn</b> Apart from this context the Hebrew term occurs only in Gen 15:17 in reference to the darkness after sunset. It may mean twilight.</p>
<A NAME="125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=338><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;land&#8221; (ASV, NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV). </p>
<A NAME="126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=339><b>sn</b> See also Ezek 12:11, 24:24, 27.</p>
<A NAME="127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=340><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;my baggage&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text, but are implied from the context.</p>
<A NAME="128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=341><b>tc</b> The nearly incoherent Hebrew reads &#8220;The prince is this burden (prophetic oracle?) in Jerusalem.&#8221; The Targum, which may only be trying to make sense of a very difficult text, says &#8220;Concerning the prince is this oracle,&#8221; assuming the addition of a preposition. This would be the only case where Ezekiel uses this term for a prophetic oracle. The LXX reads the word for &#8220;burden&#8221; as a synonym for leader, as both words are built on the same root (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nasi</font>&#8217;), but the verse is still incoherent because it is only a phrase with no verb. The current translation assumes that the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yisa</font>&#8217;) from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;</font> has dropped out due to homoioteleuton. If indeed the verb has dropped out (the syntax of the verbless clause being the problem), then context clearly suggests that it be a form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;</font> (see vv. 7 and 12). Placing the verb between the subject and object would result in three consecutive words based on the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;</font> and an environment conducive to an omission in copying: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488; &#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488; &#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488; &#1492;&#1463;&#1494;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hannasi</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> yisha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> hammasa</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> hazzeh</font>, &#8220;the Prince will raise this burden&#8221;). </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The prince in Jerusalem</i> refers to King Zedekiah.</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=342><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;within them.&#8221; Possibly a scribe copied this form from the following verse &#8220;among them,&#8221; but only &#8220;within it&#8221; makes sense in this context.</p>
<A NAME="1210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=343><b>sn</b> <i>The prince</i> is a reference to Zedekiah.</p>
<A NAME="1211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=344><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;his belongings&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text but are implied.</p>
<A NAME="1212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=345><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;they&#8221;; the LXX and Syriac read &#8220;he.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=346><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Babylonians&#8221; (NCV, NLT). </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The</i> <i>Chaldeans</i> were a group of people in the country south of Babylon from which Nebuchadnezzar came. The Chaldean dynasty his father established became the name by which the Babylonians are regularly referred to in the book of Jeremiah, while Jeremiah&#8217;s contemporary, Ezekiel, uses both terms.</p>
<A NAME="1214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=347><b>sn</b> <i>He will not see it</i>. This prediction was fulfilled in 2 Kgs 25:7 and Jer 52:11, which recount how Zedekiah was blinded before being deported to Babylon.</p>
<A NAME="1215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=348><b>sn</b> <i>There he will die</i>. This was fulfilled when King Zedekiah died in exile (Jer 52:11).</p>
<A NAME="1216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=349><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term normally refers to an earthquake (see 1 Kgs 19:11; Amos 1:1).</p>
<A NAME="1217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=350><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the days draw near and the word of every vision (draws near).&#8221;</p>
