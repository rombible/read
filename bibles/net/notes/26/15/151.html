<A NAME="151"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=387><b>tn</b> Most modern translations take the statement as a comparison (&#8220;how is vine wood better than any forest wood?&#8221;) based on the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">min</font>). But a comparison should have a word as an adjective or stative verb designating a quality, i.e., a word for &#8220;good/better&#8221; is lacking. The preposition is translated above in its partitive sense.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Comparing Israel to <i>the wood of the vine</i> may focus on Israel&#8217;s inferiority to the other nations. For the vine imagery in relation to Israel and the people of God, see Ps 80:8-13; John 15:1-7; Rom 11:17-22.</p>
