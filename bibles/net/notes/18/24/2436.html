<A NAME="2436"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1620><b>tn</b> The text reads, &#8220;he does not turn by the way of the vineyards.&#8221; This means that since the land is cursed, he/one does not go there. Bickell emended &#8220;the way of the vineyards&#8221; to &#8220;the treader of the vineyard&#8221; (see RSV, NRSV). This would mean that &#8220;no wine-presser would turn towards&#8221; their vineyards.</p>
