<A NAME="2415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1599><b>tc</b> The MT has a very brief and strange reading: &#8220;they take as a pledge upon the poor.&#8221; This could be taken as &#8220;they take a pledge against the poor&#8221; (ESV). Kamphausen suggested that instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>, &#8220;against&#8221;) one should read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ul</font>, &#8220;suckling&#8221;). This is supported by the parallelism. &#8220;They take as pledge&#8221; is also made passive here. </p>
