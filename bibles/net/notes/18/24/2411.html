<A NAME="2411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1595><b>tn</b> The verbs in this verse are uncertain. In the first line &#8220;reap&#8221; is used, and that would be the work of a hired man (and certainly not done at night). The meaning of this second verb is uncertain; it has been taken to mean &#8220;glean,&#8221; which would be the task of the poor. </p>
