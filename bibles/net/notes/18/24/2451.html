<A NAME="2451"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1635><b>tn</b> The verb is the Hophal of the rare verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">makhakh</font>), which seems to mean &#8220;to bend; to collapse.&#8221; The text would read &#8220;they are made to collapse like all others.&#8221; There is no reason here to change &#8220;like others&#8221; just because the MT is banal. But many do, following the LXX with &#8220;like mallows.&#8221; The LXX was making a translation according to sense. R. Gordis (<i>Job</i>, 271) prefers &#8220;like grass.&#8221;</p>
