<A NAME="2445"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1629><b>tn</b> This line has been given a number of interpretations due to its cryptic form. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yaqum</font>) means &#8220;he rises up.&#8221; It probably is meant to have God as the subject, and be subordinated as a temporal clause to what follows. The words &#8220;against him&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text, but have been supplied in the translation to specify the object and indicate that &#8220;rise up&#8221; is meant in a hostile sense. The following verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;&#1497;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿlo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">-ya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amin</font>), by its very meaning of &#8220;and he does not believe,&#8221; cannot have God as the subject, but must refer to the wicked.</p>
