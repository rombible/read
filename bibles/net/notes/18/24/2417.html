<A NAME="2417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1601><b>tc</b> The Hebrew term is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shurotam</font>), which may be translated &#8220;terraces&#8221; or &#8220;olive rows.&#8221; But that would not be the proper place to have a press to press the olives and make oil. E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 360-61) proposes on the analogy of an Arabic word that this should be read as &#8220;millstones&#8221; (which he would also write in the dual). But the argument does not come from a clean cognate, but from a possible development of words. The meaning of &#8220;olive rows&#8221; works well enough.</p>
