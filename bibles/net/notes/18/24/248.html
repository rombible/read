<A NAME="248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1592><b>tc</b> The MT has &#8220;in the working/labor of them,&#8221; or &#8220;when they labor.&#8221; Some commentators simply omit these words. Dhorme retains them and moves them to go with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1512;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aravah</font>), which he takes to mean &#8220;evening&#8221;; this gives a clause, &#8220;although they work until the evening.&#8221; Then, with many others, he takes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>) to be a negative and finishes the verse with &#8220;no food for the children.&#8221; Others make fewer changes in the text, and as a result do not come out with such a hopeless picture &#8211; there is some food found. The point is that they spend their time foraging for food, and they find just enough to survive, but it is a day-long activity. For Job, this shows how unrighteous the administration of the world actually is.</p>
