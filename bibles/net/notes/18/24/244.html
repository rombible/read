<A NAME="244"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1588><b>tc</b> The LXX reads &#8220;and their shepherd.&#8221; Many commentators accept this reading. But the MT says that they graze the flocks that they have stolen. The difficulty with the MT reading is that there is no suffix on the final verb &#8211; but that is not an insurmountable difference.</p>
