<A NAME="242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1586><b>tc</b> The LXX reads &#8220;Why are times hidden from the Almighty?&#8221; as if to say that God is not interested in the events on the earth. The MT reading is saying that God fails to set the times for judgment and vindication and makes good sense as it stands.</p>
