<A NAME="1265"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=935><b>tn</b> The verb is the same that was in v. 24, &#8220;He makes them [the leaders still] wander&#8221; (the Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ta</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>). But in this passage some commentators emend the text to a Niphal of the verb and put it in the plural, to get the reading &#8220;they reel to and fro.&#8221; But even if the verse closes the chapter and there is no further need for a word of divine causation, the Hiphil sense works well here &#8211; causing people to wander <i>like a drunken man</i> would be the same as making them stagger.</p>
