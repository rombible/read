<A NAME="122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=872><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;you are the people&#8221; is a way of saying that the friends hold the popular opinion &#8211; they represent it. The line is sarcastic. Commentators do not think the parallelism is served well by this, and so offer changes for &#8220;people.&#8221; Some have suggested &#8220;you are complete&#8221; (based on Arabic), &#8220;you are the strong one&#8221; (based on Ugaritic), etc. J. A. Davies tried to solve the difficulty by making the second clause in the verse a paratactic relative clause: &#8220;you are the people with whom wisdom will die&#8221; (&#8220;Note on Job 12:2,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 25 [1975]: 670-71).</p>
