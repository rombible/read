<A NAME="1243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=913><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sholal</font>), from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shalal</font>, &#8220;to plunder; to strip&#8221;), is an adjective expressing the state (and is in the singular, as if to say, &#8220;in the state of one naked&#8221; [GKC 375 §118.<i>o</i>]). The word is found in military contexts (see Mic 1:8). It refers to the carrying away of people in nakedness and shame by enemies who plunder (see also Isa 8:1-4). They will go away as slaves and captives, deprived of their outer garments. Some (cf. NAB) suggest &#8220;barefoot,&#8221; based on the LXX of Mic 1:8; but the meaning of that is uncertain. G. R. Driver wanted to derive the word from an Arabic root &#8220;to be mad; to be giddy,&#8221; forming a better parallel.</p>
