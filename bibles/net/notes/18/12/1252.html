<A NAME="1252"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=922><b>tn</b> The Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1488;&#1457;&#1502;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ne</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">emanim</font>) is the Niphal participle; it is often translated &#8220;the faithful&#8221; in the Bible. The Rabbis rather fancifully took the word from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1488;&#1467;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">um</font>, &#8220;oracle, utterance&#8221;) and so rendered it &#8220;those who are eloquent, fluent in words.&#8221; But that would make this the only place in the Bible where this form came from that root or any other root besides <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aman</font>, &#8220;confirm, support&#8221;). But to say that God takes away the speech of the truthful or the faithful would be very difficult. It has to refer to reliable men, because it is parallel to the elders or old men. The NIV has &#8220;trusted advisers,&#8221; which fits well with kings and judges and priests.</p>
