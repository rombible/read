<A NAME="1231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=901><b>tn</b> The statement in the Hebrew Bible simply has &#8220;among the aged &#8211; wisdom.&#8221; Since this seems to be more the idea of the friends than of Job, scholars have variously tried to rearrange it. Some have proposed that Job is citing his friends: &#8220;With the old men, you say, is wisdom&#8221; (Budde, Gray, Hitzig). Others have simply made it a question (Weiser). But others take <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;) from the previous verse and make it the negative here, to say, &#8220;wisdom is not&#8230;.&#8221; But Job will draw on the wisdom of the aged, only with discernment, for ultimately all wisdom is with God.</p>
