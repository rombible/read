<A NAME="1220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=890><b>tn</b> The word in the MT means &#8220;to complain,&#8221; not simply &#8220;to speak,&#8221; and one would expect animals as the object here in parallel to the last verse. So several commentators have replaced the word with words for animals or reptiles &#8211; totally different words (cf. NAB, &#8220;reptiles&#8221;). The RSV and NRSV have here the word &#8220;plants&#8221; (see 30:4, 7; and Gen 21:15).</p>
