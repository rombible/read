<A NAME="1227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=897><b>tn</b> Human life is made of &#8220;flesh&#8221; and &#8220;spirit.&#8221; So here the line reads &#8220;and the spirit of all flesh of man.&#8221; If the text had simply said &#8220;all flesh,&#8221; that would have applied to all flesh in which there is the breath of life (see Gen 6:17; 7:15). But to limit this to human beings requires the qualification with &#8220;man.&#8221;</p>
