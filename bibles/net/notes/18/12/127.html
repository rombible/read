<A NAME="127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=877><b>tn</b> Some are troubled by the disharmony with &#8220;I am&#8221; and &#8220;to his friend.&#8221; Even though the difficulty is not insurmountable, some have emended the text. Some simply changed the verb to &#8220;he is,&#8221; which was not very compelling. C. D. Isbell argued that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ehyeh</font>, &#8220;I am&#8221;) is an orthographic variant of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yihyeh</font>, &#8220;he will&#8221;) &#8211; &#8220;a person who does not know these things would be a laughingstock&#8221; (<i>JANESCU</i> 37 [1978]: 227-36). G. R. Driver suggests the meaning of the MT is something like &#8220;(One that is) a mockery to his friend I am to be.&#8221;</p>
