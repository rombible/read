<A NAME="1223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=893><b>tc</b> Some commentators have trouble with the name &#8220;Yahweh&#8221; in this verse, which is not the pattern in the poetic section of Job. Three <sc>mss of Kennicott and two of de Rossi have &#8220;God.&#8221; If this is so the reminiscence of Isaiah 41:20 led the copyist to introduce the tetragrammaton. But one could argue equally that the few <sc>mss with &#8220;God&#8221; were the copyists&#8217; attempt to correct the text in accord with usage elsewhere.</p>
