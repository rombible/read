<BODY ><p>
<A NAME="391"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2286><b>tn</b> The text uses the infinitive as the object: &#8220;do you know the giving birth of?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="392"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2287><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;ibex.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="393"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2288><b>tn</b> Here the infinitive is again a substantive: &#8220;the time of their giving birth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="394"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2289><b>tc</b> The Hebrew verb used here means &#8220;to cleave,&#8221; and this would not have the object &#8220;their young.&#8221; Olshausen and others after him change the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khet</font>) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tet</font>) and get a verb &#8220;to drop,&#8221; meaning &#8220;drop [= give birth to] young&#8221; as used in Job 21:10. G. R. Driver holds out for the MT, arguing it is an idiom, &#8220;to breach the womb&#8221; (&#8220;Problems in the Hebrew text of Job,&#8221; VTSup 3 [1955]: 92-93).</p>
<A NAME="395"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2290><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they cast forth their labor pains.&#8221; This word usually means &#8220;birth pangs&#8221; but here can mean what caused the pains (metonymy of effect). This fits better with the parallelism, and the verb (&#8220;cast forth&#8221;). The words &#8220;their offspring&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarity; direct objects were often omitted when clear from the context, although English expects them to be included.</p>
<A NAME="396"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2291><b>tn</b> The idea is that of the open countryside. The Aramaism is found only here.</p>
<A NAME="397"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2292><b>sn</b> The animal is happier in open countryside than in a busy town, and on its own rather than being driven by a herdsman.</p>
<A NAME="398"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2293><b>tn</b> Some commentators think that the addition of the &#8220;wild ox&#8221; here is a copyist&#8217;s error, making the stich too long. They therefore delete it. Also, binding an animal to the furrow with ropes is unusual. So with a slight emendation Kissane came up with &#8220;Will you bind him with a halter of cord?&#8221; While the MT is unusual, the sense is understandable, and no changes, even slight ones, are absolutely necessary.</p>
<A NAME="399"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2294><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;leave.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3910"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2295><b>tn</b> The word is normally translated &#8220;believe&#8221; in the Bible. The idea is that of considering something dependable and acting on it. The idea of reliability is found also in the Niphal stem usages.</p>
<A NAME="3911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2296><b>tc</b> There is a textual problem here: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yashuv</font>) is the <i>Kethib</i>, meaning &#8220;[that] he will return&#8221;; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yashiv</font>) is the <i>Qere</i>, meaning &#8220;that he will bring in.&#8221; This is the preferred reading, since the object follows it. For commentators who think the line too unbalanced for this, the object is moved to the second colon, and the reading &#8220;returns&#8221; is taken for the first. But the MT is perfectly clear as it stands.</p>
<A NAME="3912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2297><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your seed&#8221;; this must be interpreted figuratively for what the seed produces.</p>
<A NAME="3913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2298><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;gather it&#8221;; the referent (the grain) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2299><b>tn</b> Simply, the MT has &#8220;and your threshing floor gather.&#8221; The &#8220;threshing floor&#8221; has to be an adverbial accusative of place.</p>
<A NAME="3915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2300><b>tc</b> This whole section on the ostrich is not included in the LXX. Many feel it is an interpolation and should therefore be deleted. The pattern of the chapter changes from the questions being asked to observations being made.</p>
<A NAME="3916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2301><b>tn</b> The word occurs only here and means &#8220;shrill cries.&#8221; If the MT is correct, this is a poetic name for the ostrich (see Lam 4:3).</p>
<A NAME="3917"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2302><b>tn</b> Many proposals have been made here. The MT has a verb, &#8220;exult.&#8221; Strahan had &#8220;flap joyously,&#8221; a rendering followed by the NIV. The RSV uses &#8220;wave proudly.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2303><b>tn</b> The point of this statement would be that the ostrich cannot compare to the stork. But there are many other proposals for this line &#8211; just about every commentator has a different explanation for it. Of the three words here, the first means &#8220;pinion,&#8221; the third &#8220;plumage,&#8221; and the second probably &#8220;stork,&#8221; although the LXX has &#8220;heron.&#8221; The point of this whole section is that the ostrich is totally lacking in parental care, whereas the stork is characterized by it. The Hebrew word for &#8220;stork&#8221; is the same word for &#8220;love&#8221;: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1458;&#1505;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khasidah</font>), an interpretation followed by the NASB. The most likely reading is &#8220;or are they the pinions and plumage of the stork?&#8221; The ostrich may flap about, but cannot fly and does not care for its young.</p>
<A NAME="3919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2304><b>tn</b> The meaning may have the connotation of &#8220;lays; places,&#8221; rather than simply abandoning (see M. Dahood, &#8220;The Root <i>&#8217;zb </i>II in Job,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 78 [1959]: 307f.).</p>
<A NAME="3920"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2305><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;an animal of the field.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3921"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2306><b>sn</b> This verb, &#8220;to deal harshly; to harden; to treat cruelly,&#8221; is used for hardening the heart elsewhere (see Isa 63:17).</p>
<A NAME="3922"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2307><b>tn</b> The colon poses a slight problem here. The literal meaning of the Hebrew verb translated &#8220;springs up&#8221; (i.e., &#8220;lifts herself on high&#8221;) might suggest flight. But some of the proposals involve a reading about readying herself to run.</p>
<A NAME="3923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2308><b>tn</b> The second half of the verse contains this <i>hapax legomenon</i>, which is usually connected with the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">mah</font>, &#8220;thunder&#8221;). A. B. Davidson thought it referred to the quivering of the neck rather than the mane. Gray thought the sound and not the movement was the point. But without better evidence, a reading that has &#8220;quivering mane&#8221; may not be far off the mark. But it may be simplest to translate it &#8220;mane&#8221; and assume that the idea of &#8220;quivering&#8221; is part of the meaning.</p>
<A NAME="3924"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2309><b>sn</b> The same ideas are found in Joel 2:4. The leaping motion is compared to the galloping of the horse.</p>
<A NAME="3925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2310><b>tn</b> The word could mean &#8220;snorting&#8221; as well (see Jer 8:16). It comes from the root &#8220;to blow.&#8221; If the horse is running and breathing hard, this could be the sense here.</p>
<A NAME="3926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2311><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text has a plural verb, &#8220;they paw.&#8221; For consistency and for stylistic reasons this is translated as a singular.</p>
<A NAME="3927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2312><b>tn</b> The armies would prepare for battles that were usually fought in the valleys, and so the horse was ready to charge. But in Ugaritic the word <i>`mk</i> means &#8220;force&#8221; as well as &#8220;valley.&#8221; The idea of &#8220;force&#8221; would fit the parallelism here well (see M. Dahood, &#8220;Value of Ugaritic for textual criticism,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 40 [1959]: 166).</p>
<A NAME="3928"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2313><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;in strength.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3929"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2314><b>tn</b> This may be the scimitar (see G. Molin, &#8220;What is a kidon?&#8221; <i>JSS</i> 1 [1956]: 334-37).</p>
<A NAME="3930"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2315><b>tn</b> &#8220;Swallow the ground&#8221; is a metaphor for the horse&#8217;s running. Gray renders the line: &#8220;quivering and excited he dashes into the fray.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3931"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2316><b>tn</b> The use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aman</font>) in the Hiphil in this place is unique. Such a form would normally mean &#8220;to believe.&#8221; But its basic etymological meaning comes through here. The verb means &#8220;to be firm; to be reliable; to be dependable.&#8221; The causative here would mean &#8220;to make firm&#8221; or &#8220;to stand firm.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3932"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2317><b>tn</b> This word occurs only here. It is connected to &#8220;pinions&#8221; in v. 13. Dhorme suggests &#8220;clad with feathers,&#8221; but the line suggests more the use of the wings.</p>
<A NAME="3933"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2318><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your mouth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3934"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2319><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;upon the tooth of a rock.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3935"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2320><b>tn</b> The word could be taken as the predicate, but because of the conjunction it seems to be adding another description of the place of its nest.</p>
<A NAME="3936"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2321><b>tn</b> The word means &#8220;search,&#8221; but can be used for a wide range of matters, including spying.</p>
<A NAME="3937"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2322><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;food.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3938"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2323><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1464;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khalalim</font>) designates someone who is fatally wounded, literally the &#8220;pierced one,&#8221; meaning anyone or thing that dies a violent death.</p>
