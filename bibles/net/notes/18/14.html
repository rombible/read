<A NAME="141"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1004><b>tn</b> The first of the threefold apposition for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adam</font>, &#8220;man&#8221;) is &#8220;born of a woman.&#8221; The genitive (&#8220;woman&#8221;) after a passive participle denotes the agent of the action (see GKC 359 §116.<i>l</i>).</p>
<A NAME="142"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1005><b>tn</b> The second description is simply &#8220;[is] short of days.&#8221; The meaning here is that his life is short (&#8220;days&#8221; being put as the understatement for &#8220;years&#8221;). </p>
<A NAME="143"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1006><b>tn</b> The third expression is &#8220;consumed/full/sated &#8211; with/of &#8211; trouble/restlessness.&#8221; The latter word, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1465;&#1490;&#1462;&#1494;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rogez</font>), occurred in Job 3:17; see also the idea in 10:15.</p>
<A NAME="144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1007><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatsa</font>&#8217;, &#8220;comes forth&#8221;). The perfect verb expresses characteristic action and so is translated by the present tense (see GKC 329 §111.<i>s</i>).</p>
<A NAME="145"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1008><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyimmal</font>) is from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">malal</font>, &#8220;to languish; to wither&#8221;) and not from a different root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">malal</font>, &#8220;to cut off&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="146"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1009><b>tn</b> The verb is &#8220;and he does not stand.&#8221; Here the verb means &#8220;to stay fixed; to abide.&#8221; The shadow does not stay fixed, but continues to advance toward darkness.</p>
<A NAME="147"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1010><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;open the eye on,&#8221; an idiom meaning to prepare to judge someone.</p>
<A NAME="148"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1011><b>tn</b> The verse opens with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1507;&#1470;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;&#1494;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">af-</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al-zeh</font>), meaning &#8220;even on such a one!&#8221; It is an exclamation of surprise.</p>
<A NAME="149"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1012><b>tn</b> The text clearly has &#8220;me&#8221; as the accusative; but many wish to emend it to say &#8220;him&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1465;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">oto</font>). But D. J. A. Clines rightly rejects this in view of the way Job is written, often moving back and forth from his own tragedy and others&#8217; tragedies (<i>Job </i>[WBC], 283).</p>
<A NAME="1410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1013><b>tn</b> The expression is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mi-yitten</font>, &#8220;who will give&#8221;; see GKC 477 §151.<i>b</i>). Some commentators (H. H. Rowley and A. B. Davidson) wish to take this as the optative formula: &#8220;O that a clean might come out of an unclean!&#8221; But that does not fit the verse very well, and still requires the addition of a verb. The exclamation here simply implies something impossible &#8211; man is unable to attain purity.</p>
<A NAME="1411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1014><b>sn</b> The point being made is that the entire human race is contaminated by sin, and therefore cannot produce something pure. In this context, since man is born of woman, it is saying that the woman and the man who is brought forth from her are impure. See Ps 51:5; Isa 6:5; and Gen 6:5.</p>
<A NAME="1412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1015><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his days.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1016><b>tn</b> The passive participle is from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kharats</font>), which means &#8220;determined.&#8221; The word literally means &#8220;cut&#8221; (Lev 22:22, &#8220;mutilated&#8221;). E. Dhorme, (<i>Job</i>, 197) takes it to mean &#8220;engraved&#8221; as on stone; from a custom of inscribing decrees on tablets of stone he derives the meaning here of &#8220;decreed.&#8221; This, he argues, is parallel to the way <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khaqaq</font>, &#8220;engrave&#8221;) is used. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khoq</font>) is an &#8220;ordinance&#8221; or &#8220;statute&#8221;; the idea is connected to the verb &#8220;to engrave.&#8221; The LXX has &#8220;if his life should be but one day on the earth, and his months are numbered by him, you have appointed him for a time and he shall by no means exceed it.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1017><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[is] with you.&#8221; This clearly means under God&#8217;s control.</p>
<A NAME="1415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1018><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khoq</font>) has the meanings of &#8220;decree, decision, and limit&#8221; (cf. Job 28:26; 38:10).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Job is saying that God foreordains the number of the days of man. He foreknows the number of the months. He fixes the limit of human life which cannot be passed.</p>
<A NAME="1416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1019><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khadal</font>) means &#8220;to desist; to cease.&#8221; The verb would mean here &#8220;and let him desist,&#8221; which some take to mean &#8220;and let him rest.&#8221; But since this is rather difficult in the line, commentators have suggested other meanings. Several emend the text slightly to make it an imperative rather than an imperfect; this is then translated &#8220;and desist.&#8221; The expression &#8220;from him&#8221; must be added. Another suggestion that is far-fetched is that of P. J. Calderone (&#8220;CHDL-II in poetic texts,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 23 [1961]: 451-60) and D. W. Thomas (VTSup 4 [1957]: 8-16), having a new meaning of &#8220;be fat.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1020><b>tn</b> There are two roots <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ratsah</font>). The first is the common word, meaning &#8220;to delight in; to have pleasure in.&#8221; The second, most likely used here, means &#8220;to pay; to acquit a debt&#8221; (cf. Lev 26:34, 41, 43). Here with the mention of the simile with the hired man, the completing of the job is in view.</p>
<A NAME="1418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1021><b>tn</b> The genitive after the construct is one of advantage &#8211; it is hope for the tree.</p>
<A NAME="1419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1022><b>sn</b> The figure now changes to a tree for the discussion of the finality of death. At least the tree will sprout again when it is cut down. Why, Job wonders, should what has been granted to the tree not also be granted to humans?</p>
<A NAME="1420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1023><b>tn</b> The Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zaqan</font>, &#8220;to be old&#8221;) is here an internal causative, &#8220;to grow old.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1024><b>tn</b> The Hiphil is here classified as an inchoative Hiphil (see GKC 145 §53.<i>e</i>), for the tree only begins to die. In other words, it appears to be dead, but actually is not completely dead.</p>
<A NAME="1422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1025><b>tn</b> The LXX translates &#8220;dust&#8221; [soil] with &#8220;rock,&#8221; probably in light of the earlier illustration of the tree growing in the rocks.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Job is thinking here of a tree that dies or decays because of a drought rather than being uprooted, because the next verse will tell how it can revive with water.</p>
<A NAME="1423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1026><b>tn</b> The personification adds to the comparison with people &#8211; the tree is credited with the sense of smell to detect the water.</p>
<A NAME="1424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1027><b>tn</b> The sense of &#8220;flourish&#8221; for this verb is found in Ps 92:12,13[13,14], and Prov 14:11. It makes an appropriate parallel with &#8220;bring forth boughs&#8221; in the second half.</p>
<A NAME="1425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1028><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and will make.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1426"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1029><b>tn</b> There are two words for &#8220;man&#8221; in this verse. The first (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">gever</font>) can indicate a &#8220;strong&#8221; or &#8220;mature man&#8221; or &#8220;mighty man,&#8221; the hero; and the second (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">adam</font>) simply designates the person as mortal.</p>
<A NAME="1427"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1030><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khalash</font>) in Aramaic and Syriac means &#8220;to be weak&#8221; (interestingly, the Syriac OT translated <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> [<font face="Scholar">khalash</font>] with &#8220;fade away&#8221; here). The derived noun &#8220;the weak&#8221; would be in direct contrast to &#8220;the mighty man.&#8221; In the transitive sense the verb means &#8220;to weaken; to defeat&#8221; (Exod 17:13); here it may have the sense of &#8220;be lifeless, unconscious, inanimate&#8221; (cf. E. Dhorme, <i>Job</i>, 199). Many commentators emend the text to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1465;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yakhalof</font>, &#8220;passes on; passes away&#8221;).<i> </i>A. Guillaume tries to argue that the form is a variant of the other, the letters <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shin</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pe</font>) being interchangeable (&#8220;The Use of <i>halas</i> in Exod 17:13, Isa 14:12, and Job 14:10,&#8221; <i>JTS </i>14 [1963]: 91-92). G. R. Driver connected it to Arabic <i>halasa</i>, &#8220;carry off suddenly&#8221; (&#8220;The Resurrection of Marine and Terrestrial Creatures,&#8221; <i>JSS</i> 7 [1962]: 12-22). But the basic idea of &#8220;be weak, powerless&#8221; is satisfactory in the text. H. H. Rowley (<i>Job</i> [NCBC], 105) says, &#8220;Where words are so carefully chosen, it is gratuitous to substitute less expressive words as some editors do.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1428"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1031><b>tn</b> This break to a question adds a startling touch to the whole verse. The obvious meaning is that he is gone. The LXX weakens it: &#8220;and is no more.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1429"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1032><b>tn</b> The comparative clause may be signaled simply by the context, especially when facts of a moral nature are compared with the physical world (see GKC 499 §161.<i>a</i>).</p>
<A NAME="1430"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1033><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yam</font>) can mean &#8220;sea&#8221; or &#8220;lake.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1431"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1034><b>tc</b> The Hebrew construction is &#8220;until not,&#8221; which is unusual if not impossible; it is found in only one other type of context. In its six other occurrences (Num 21:35; Deut 3:3; Josh 8:22; 10:33; 11:8; 2 Kgs 10:11) the context refers to the absence of survivors. Aquila, Symmachus, Theodotion, Syriac, and Vulgate all have &#8220;till the heavens wear out.&#8221; Most would emend the text just slightly from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ad-bilti</font>, &#8220;are no more&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ad bÿlot</font>, &#8220;until the wearing out of,&#8221; see Ps 102:26 [27]; Isa 51:6). Gray rejects emendation here, finding the unusual form of the MT in its favor. Orlinsky (p. 57) finds a cognate Arabic word meaning &#8220;will not awake&#8221; and translates it &#8220;so long as the heavens are not rent asunder&#8221; (H. M. Orlinsky, &#8220;The Hebrew and Greek Texts of Job 14:12,&#8221; <i>JQR </i>28 [1937/38]: 57-68). He then deletes the last line of the verse as a later gloss.</p>
<A NAME="1432"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1035><b>tn</b> The verb is plural because the subject, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ish</font>), is viewed as a collective: &#8220;mankind.&#8221; The verb means &#8220;to wake up; to awake&#8221;; another root, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">quts</font>, &#8220;to split open&#8221;) cognate to Arabic <i>qada</i> and Akkadian <i>kasu</i>, was put forward by H. M. Orlinsky (&#8220;The Hebrew and Greek Texts of Job 14:12,&#8221; <i>JQR</i> 28 [1937-38]: 57-68) and G. R. Driver (&#8220;Problems in the Hebrew Text of Job,&#8221; VTSup 3 [1955]: 72-93).</p>
<A NAME="1433"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1036><b>tn</b> The optative mood is introduced here again with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497; &#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mi yitten</font>),<i> </i>literally, &#8220;who will give?&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> After arguing that man will die without hope, Job expresses his desire that there be a resurrection, and what that would mean. The ancients all knew that death did not bring existence to an end; rather, they passed into another place, but they continued to exist. Job thinks that death would at least give him some respite from the wrath of God; but this wrath would eventually be appeased, and then God would remember the one he had hidden in Sheol just as he remembered Noah. Once that happened, it would be possible that Job might live again.</p>
<A NAME="1434"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1037><b>sn</b> <i>Sheol</i> in the Bible refers to the place where the dead go. But it can have different categories of meaning: death in general, the grave, or the realm of the departed spirits [hell]. A. Heidel shows that in the Bible when hell is in view the righteous are not there &#8211; it is the realm of the departed spirits of the wicked. When the righteous go to Sheol, the meaning is usually the grave or death. See chapter 3 in A. Heidel, <i>The Gilgamesh Epic and the Old Testament Parallels</i>.</p>
<A NAME="1435"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1038><b>tn</b> The construction used here is the preposition followed by the infinitive construct followed by the subjective genitive, forming an adverbial clause of time.</p>
<A NAME="1436"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1039><b>tn</b> This is the same word used in v. 5 for &#8220;limit.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1437"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1040><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zakhar</font>) means more than simply &#8220;to remember.&#8221; In many cases, including this one, it means &#8220;to act on what is remembered,&#8221; i.e., deliver or rescue (see Gen 8:1, &#8220;and God remembered Noah&#8221;). In this sense, a prayer &#8220;remember me&#8221; is a prayer for God to act upon his covenant promises.</p>
<A NAME="1438"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1041><b>tc</b> The LXX removes the interrogative and makes the statement affirmative, i.e., that man will live again. This reading is taken by D. H. Gard (&#8220;The Concept of the Future Life according to the Greek Translator of the Book of Job,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 73 [1954]: 137-38). D. J. A. Clines follows this, putting both of the expressions in the wish clause: &#8220;if a man dies and could live again&#8230;&#8221; (<i>Job </i>[WBC], 332). If that is the way it is translated, then the verbs in the second half of the verse and in the next verse would all be part of the apodosis, and should be translated &#8220;would.&#8221; The interpretation would not greatly differ; it would be saying that if there was life after death, Job would long for his release &#8211; his death. If the traditional view is taken and the question was raised whether there was life after death (the implication of the question being that there is), then Job would still be longing for his death. The point the line is making is that if there is life after death, that would be all the more reason for Job to eagerly expect, to hope for, his death.</p>
<A NAME="1439"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1042><b>tn</b> See Job 7:1.</p>
<A NAME="1440"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1043><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1497;&#1463;&#1495;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ayakhel</font>) may be rendered &#8220;I will/would wait&#8221; or &#8220;I will/would hope.&#8221; The word describes eager expectation and longing hope.</p>
<A NAME="1441"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1044><b>tn</b> The construction is the same as that found in the last verse: a temporal preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ad</font>) followed by the infinitive construct followed by the subjective genitive &#8220;release/relief.&#8221; Due, in part, to the same verb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1507;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khalaf</font>) having the meaning &#8220;sprout again&#8221; in v. 7, some take &#8220;renewal&#8221; as the meaning here (J. E. Hartley, Alden, NIV, ESV).</p>
<A NAME="1442"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1045><b>sn</b> The idea would be that God would sometime in the future call Job into his fellowship again when he longed for the work of his hands (cf. Job 10:3).</p>
<A NAME="1443"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1046><b>tn</b> The independent personal pronoun is emphatic, as if to say, &#8220;and I on my part will answer.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1444"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1047><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kasaf</font>) originally meant &#8220;to turn pale.&#8221; It expresses the sentiment that causes pallor of face, and so is used for desire ardently, covet. The object of the desire is always introduced with the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lamed</font>) preposition (see E. Dhorme, <i>Job</i>, 202).</p>
<A NAME="1445"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1048><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;long for the work of your hands.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1446"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1049><b>sn</b> The hope for life after death is supported now by a description of the severity with which God deals with people in this life.</p>
<A NAME="1447"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1050><b>tn</b> If v. 16a continues the previous series, the translation here would be &#8220;then&#8221; (as in RSV). Others take it as a new beginning to express God&#8217;s present watch over Job, and interpret the second half of the verse as a question, or emend it to say God does not pass over his sins.</p>
<A NAME="1448"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1051><b>sn</b> Compare Ps 130:3-4, which says, &#8220;If you should mark iniquity O <sc>Lord, Lord, who could stand? But with you there is forgiveness, in order that you might be feared.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1449"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1052><b>tn</b> The second colon of the verse can be contrasted with the first, the first being the present reality and the second the hope looked for in the future. This seems to fit the context well without making any changes at all.</p>
<A NAME="1450"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1053><b>tn</b> The passive participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1514;&#1467;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khatum</font>), from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khatam</font>, &#8220;seal&#8221;),<i> </i>which is used frequently in the Bible, means &#8220;sealed up.&#8221; The image of sealing sins in a bag is another of the many poetic ways of expressing the removal of sin from the individual (see 1 Sam 25:29). Since the term most frequently describes sealed documents, the idea here may be more that of sealing in a bag the record of Job&#8217;s sins (see D. J. A. Clines, <i>Job </i>[WBC], 334).</p>
<A NAME="1451"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1054><b>tn</b> The idea has been presented that the background of putting tally stones in a bag is intended (see A. L. Oppenheim, &#8220;On an Operational Device in Mesopotamian Bureaucracy,&#8221; <i>JNES</i> 18 [1959]: 121-28).</p>
<A NAME="1452"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=1055><b>tn</b> This verb was used in Job 13:4 for &#8220;plasterers of lies.&#8221; The idea is probably that God coats or paints over the sins so that they are forgotten (see Isa 1:18). A. B. Davidson (<i>Job</i>, 105) suggests that the sins are preserved until full punishment is exacted. But the verse still seems to be continuing the thought of how the sins would be forgotten in the next life.</p>
<A NAME="1453"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1056><b>tn</b> The indication that this is a simile is to be obtained from the conjunction beginning 19c (see GKC 499 §161.<i>a</i>).</p>
<A NAME="1454"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1057><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yibbol</font>) usually refers to a flower fading and so seems strange here. The LXX and the Syriac translate &#8220;and will fall&#8221;; most commentators accept this and repoint the preceding word to get &#8220;and will surely fall.&#8221; Duhm retains the MT and applies the image of the flower to the falling mountain. The verb is used of the earth in Isa 24:4, and so NIV, RSV, and NJPS all have the idea of &#8220;crumble away.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1455"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=1058><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the overflowings of it&#8221;; the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1456;&#1508;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1462;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sÿfikheyha</font>) in the text is changed by just about everyone. The idea of &#8220;its overflowings&#8221; or more properly &#8220;its aftergrowths&#8221; (Lev 25:5; 2 Kgs 19:29; etc.) does not fit here at all. Budde suggested reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1508;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sÿkhifah</font>), which is cognate to Arabic <i>sahifeh</i>, &#8220;torrential rain, rainstorm&#8221; &#8211; that which sweeps away&#8221; the soil. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sakhaf</font>) in Hebrew might have a wider usage than the effects of rain.</p>
<A NAME="1456"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=1059><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[the] dust of [the] earth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1457"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=1060><b>sn</b> The meaning for Job is that death shatters all of man&#8217;s hopes for the continuation of life.</p>
<A NAME="1458"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=1061><b>tn</b> D. W. Thomas took <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1461;&#1510;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">netsakh</font>) here to have a superlative meaning: &#8220;You prevail utterly against him&#8221; (&#8220;Use of <i>netsach</i> as a superlative in Hebrew,&#8221; <i>JSS</i> 1 [1956]: 107). Death would be God&#8217;s complete victory over him.</p>
<A NAME="1459"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=1062><b>tn</b> The subject of the participle is most likely God in this context. Some take it to be man, saying &#8220;his face changes.&#8221; Others emend the text to read an imperfect verb, but this is not necessary.</p>
<A NAME="1460"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=1063><b>tn</b> The clause may be interpreted as a conditional clause, with the second clause beginning with the conjunction serving as the apodosis.</p>
<A NAME="1461"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=1064><b>tn</b> There is no expressed subject for the verb &#8220;they honor,&#8221; and so it may be taken as a passive.</p>
<A NAME="1462"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=1065><b>sn</b> Death is separation from the living, from the land of the living. And ignorance of what goes on in this life, good or bad, is part of death. See also Eccl 9:5-6, which makes a similar point.</p>
<A NAME="1463"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=1066><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bin</font>, &#8220;to perceive; to discern&#8221;). The parallelism between &#8220;know&#8221; and &#8220;perceive&#8221; stress the point that in death a man does not realize what is happening here in the present life.</p>
<A NAME="1464"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=1067><b>tn</b> The prepositional phrases using <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alayv</font>, &#8220;for him[self]&#8221;) express the object of the suffering. It is for himself that the dead man &#8220;grieves.&#8221; So this has to be joined with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akh</font>), yielding &#8220;only for himself.&#8221; Then, &#8220;flesh&#8221; and &#8220;soul/person&#8221; form the parallelism for the subjects of the verbs.</p>
<A NAME="1465"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=1068><b>sn</b> In this verse Job is expressing the common view of life beyond death, namely, that in Sheol there is no contact with the living, only separation, but in Sheol there is a conscious awareness of the dreary existence.</p>
