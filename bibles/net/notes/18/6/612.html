<A NAME="612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=416><b>tn</b> Most commentators take &#8220;my spirit&#8221; as the subject of the participle &#8220;drinks&#8221; (except the NEB, which follows the older versions to say that the poison &#8220;drinks up [or &#8220;soaks in&#8221;] the spirit.&#8221;) The image of the poisoned arrow represents the calamity or misfortune from God, which is taken in by Job&#8217;s spirit and enervates him.</p>
