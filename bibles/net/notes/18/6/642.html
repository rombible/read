<A NAME="642"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=446><b>tn</b> The word translated &#8220;my end&#8221; is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qitsi</font>). It refers to the termination of his life. In Ps 39:5 it is parallel to &#8220;the measure of my days.&#8221; In a sense, Job is asking what future he has. To him, the &#8220;end&#8221; of his affliction can only be death.</p>
