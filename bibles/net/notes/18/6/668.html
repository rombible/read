<A NAME="668"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=472><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bosh</font>) basically means &#8220;to be ashamed&#8221;; however, it has a wider range of meaning such as &#8220;disappointed&#8221; or &#8220;distressed.&#8221; The feeling of shame or distress is because of their confidence that they knew what they were doing. The verb is strengthened here with the parallel <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khafar</font>, &#8220;to be confounded, disappointed&#8221;).</p>
