<A NAME="658"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=462><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1494;&#1465;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿzorÿvu</font>, &#8220;burnt, scorched&#8221;) occurs only here. A good number of interpretations take the root as a by-form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsarav</font>) which means in the Niphal &#8220;to be burnt&#8221; (Ezek 21:3). The expression then would mean &#8220;in the time they are burnt,&#8221; a reference to the scorching heat of the summer (&#8220;when the great heat comes&#8221;) and the rivers dry up. Qimchi connected it to the Arabic &#8220;canal,&#8221; and this has led to the suggestion by E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 88) that the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zarav</font>) would mean &#8220;to flow.&#8221; In the Piel it would be &#8220;to cause to flow,&#8221; and in the passive &#8220;to be made to flow,&#8221; or &#8220;melt.&#8221; This is attractive, but it does require the understanding (or supplying) of &#8220;ice/snow&#8221; as the subject. G. R. Driver took the same meaning but translated it &#8220;when they (the streams) pour down in torrents, they (straightway) die down&#8221; (<i>ZAW </i>65 [1953]: 216-17). Both interpretations capture the sense of the brooks drying up.</p>
