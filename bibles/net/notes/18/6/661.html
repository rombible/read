<A NAME="661"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=465><b>tn</b> The verb literally means &#8220;to go up,&#8221; but here no real ascent is intended for the wasteland. It means that they go inland looking for the water. The streams wind out into the desert and dry up in the sand and the heat. A. B. Davidson (<i>Job</i>, 47) notes the difficulty with the interpretation of this verse as a reference to caravans is that Ibn Ezra says that it is not usual for caravans to leave their path and wander inland in search of water.</p>
