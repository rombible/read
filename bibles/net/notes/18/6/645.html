<A NAME="645"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=449><b>tn</b> The word means something like &#8220;recovery,&#8221; or the powers of recovery; it was used in Job 5:12. In 11:6 it applies to a condition of the mind, such as mental resource. Job is thinking not so much of relief or rescue from his troubles, but of strength to bear them.</p>
