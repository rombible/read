<A NAME="651"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=455><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term used here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhal</font>); this word differs from words for rivers or streams in that it describes a brook with an intermittent flow of water. A brook where the waters are not flowing is called a deceitful brook (Jer 15:18; Mic 1:14); one where the waters flow is called faithful (Isa 33:16).</p>
