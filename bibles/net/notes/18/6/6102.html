<A NAME="6102"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">102</span><note=506><b>tn</b> The final word, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1493;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">havvot</font>) is usually understood as &#8220;calamities.&#8221; He would be asking if he could not discern his misfortune. But some argue that the word has to be understood in the parallelism to &#8220;wickedness&#8221; of words (D. J. A. Clines, <i>Job </i>[WBC], 162). Gordis connects it to Mic 7:3 and Ps 5:10 [9] where the meaning &#8220;deceit, falsehood&#8221; is found. The LXX has &#8220;and does not my throat meditate understanding?&#8221;</p>
