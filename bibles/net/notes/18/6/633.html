<A NAME="633"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=437><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and cut me off.&#8221; The LXX reads this verse as &#8220;Let the Lord begin and wound me, but let him not utterly destroy me.&#8221; E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 81) says the LXX is a paraphrase based on a pun with &#8220;free hand.&#8221; Targum Job has, &#8220;God has begun to make me poor; may he free his hand and make me rich,&#8221; apparently basing the reading on a metaphorical interpretation.</p>
