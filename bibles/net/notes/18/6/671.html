<A NAME="671"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=475><b>tn</b> There is a textual problem in this line, an issue of <i>Kethib</i>-<i>Qere</i>. Some read the form with the <i>Qere</i> as the preposition with a suffix referring to &#8220;the river,&#8221; with the idea &#8220;you are like it.&#8221; Others would read the form with the <i>Kethib </i>as the negative &#8220;not,&#8221; meaning &#8220;for now you are nothing.&#8221; The LXX and the Syriac read the word as &#8220;to me.&#8221; RSV follows this and changes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>, &#8220;for&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ken</font>, &#8220;thus&#8221;). However, such an emendation is unnecessary since <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) itself can be legitimately employed as an emphatic particle. In that case, the translation would be, &#8220;Indeed, now you are&#8221; in the sense of &#8220;At this time you certainly are behaving like those streams.&#8221; The simplest reading is &#8220;for now you have become [like] it.&#8221; The meaning seems clear enough in the context that the friends, like the river, proved to be of no use. But D. J. A. Clines (<i>Job </i>[WBC], 161) points out that the difficulty with this is that all references so far to the rivers have been in the plural.</p>
