<A NAME="672"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=476><b>tn</b> The perfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hayah</font>) could be translated as either &#8220;are&#8221; or &#8220;have been&#8221; rather than &#8220;have become&#8221; (cf. Joüon 2:373 §113.<i>p</i> with regard to stative verbs). &#8220;Like it&#8221; refers to the intermittent stream which promises water but does not deliver. The LXX has a paraphrase: &#8220;But you also have come to me without pity.&#8221;</p>
