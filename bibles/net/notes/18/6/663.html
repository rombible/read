<A NAME="663"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=467><b>sn</b> If the term &#8220;paths&#8221; (referring to the brook) is the subject, then this verb would mean it dies in the desert; if caravaneers are intended, then when they find no water they perish. The point in the argument would be the same in either case. Job is saying that his friends are like this water, and he like the caravaneer was looking for refreshment, but found only that the brook had dried up.</p>
