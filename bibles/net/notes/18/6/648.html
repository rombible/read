<A NAME="648"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=452><b>tn</b> The relationship of the second colon to the first is difficult. The line just reads literally &#8220;and the fear of the Almighty he forsakes.&#8221; The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vav</font>) could be interpreted in several different ways: &#8220;else he will forsake&#8230;,&#8221; &#8220;although he forsakes&#8230;,&#8221; &#8220;even the one who forsakes&#8230;,&#8221; or &#8220;even if he forsakes&#8230;&#8221; &#8211; the reading adopted here. If the first colon receives the reading &#8220;His friend has scorned compassion,&#8221; then this clause would be simply coordinated with &#8220;and forsakes the fear of the Almighty.&#8221; The sense of the verse seems to say that kindness/loyalty should be shown to the despairing, even to the one who is forsaking the fear of the <sc>Lord, meaning, saying outrageous things, like Job has been doing. </p>
