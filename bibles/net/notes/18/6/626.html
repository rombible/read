<A NAME="626"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=430><b>tn</b> The second colon of the verse is difficult. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1493;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dÿve</font>) means &#8220;sickness of&#8221; and yields a meaning &#8220;like the sickness of my food.&#8221; This could take the derived sense of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">davah</font>) and mean &#8220;impure&#8221; or &#8220;corrupt&#8221; food. The LXX has &#8220;for I loathe my food as the smell of a lion&#8221; and so some commentators emend &#8220;they&#8221; (which has no clear antecedent) to mean &#8220;I loathe it [like the sickness of my food].&#8221; Others have more freely emended the text to &#8220;my palate loathes my food&#8221; (McNeile) or &#8220;my bowels resound with suffering&#8221; (I. Eitan, &#8220;An unknown meaning of <font face="Scholar">RAHAMIÝM</font>,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 53 [1934]: 271). Pope has &#8220;they are putrid as my flesh [= my meat].&#8221; D. J. A. Clines (<i>Job </i>[WBC], 159) prefers the suggestion in <i>BHS</i>, &#8220;it [my soul] loathes them as my food.&#8221; E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 80) repoints the second word of the colon to get <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1465;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kÿvodi</font>, &#8220;my glory&#8221;): &#8220;my heart [glory] loathes/is sickened by my bread.&#8221;</p>
