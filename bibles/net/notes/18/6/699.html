<A NAME="699"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">99</span><note=503><b>tn</b> The text has simply &#8220;yet my right is in it.&#8221; A. B. Davidson (<i>Job</i>, 49, 50) thinks this means that in his plea against God, Job has right on his side. It may mean this; it simply says &#8220;my righteousness is yet in it.&#8221; If the &#8220;in it&#8221; does not refer to Job&#8217;s cause, then it would simply mean &#8220;is present.&#8221; It would have very little difference either way.</p>
