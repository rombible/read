<A NAME="690"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">90</span><note=494><b>tn</b> This, in the context, is probably the meaning, although the Hebrew simply has the line after the first half of the verse read: &#8220;and as/to wind the words of a despairing man.&#8221; The line could be translated &#8220;and the words of a despairing man, [which are] as wind.&#8221; But this translation follows the same approach as RSV, NIV, and NAB, which take the idiom of the verb (&#8220;think, imagine&#8221;) with the preposition on &#8220;wind&#8221; to mean &#8220;reckon as wind&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;and treat the words of a despairing man as wind.&#8221;</p>
