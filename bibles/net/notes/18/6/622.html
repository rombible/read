<A NAME="622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=426><b>tn</b> Some commentators are not satisfied with the translation &#8220;white of an egg&#8221;; they prefer something connected to &#8220;slime of purslane&#8221; (H. H. Rowley, <i>Job</i> [NCBC], 59; cf. NRSV &#8220;juice of mallows&#8221;). This meaning is based on the Syriac and Arabic version of Sa`adia. The meaning &#8220;white of the egg&#8221; comes from the rabbinic interpretation of &#8220;slime of the yolk.&#8221; Others carry the idea further and interpret it to mean &#8220;saliva of dreams&#8221; or after the LXX &#8220;in dream words.&#8221; H. H. Rowley does not think that the exact edible object can be identified. The idea of the slimy glaring white around the yolk of an egg seems to fit best. This is another illustration of something that is tasteless or insipid.</p>
