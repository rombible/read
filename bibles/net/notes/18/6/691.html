<A NAME="691"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">91</span><note=495><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;lots&#8221; is not in the text; the verb is simply <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tappilu</font>, &#8220;you cast&#8221;). But the word &#8220;lots&#8221; is also omitted in 1 Sam 14:42. Some commentators follow the LXX and repoint the word and divide the object of the preposition to read &#8220;and fall upon the blameless one.&#8221; Fohrer deletes the verse. Peake transfers it to come after v. 23. Even though it does not follow quite as well here, it nonetheless makes sense as a strong invective against their lack of sympathy, and the lack of connection could be the result of emotional speech. He is saying they are the kind of people who would cast lots over the child of a debtor, who, after the death of the father, would be sold to slavery.</p>
