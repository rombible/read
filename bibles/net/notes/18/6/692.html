<A NAME="692"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">92</span><note=496><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tikhru</font>) is from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">karah</font>), which is found in 40:30 with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>), to mean &#8220;to speculate&#8221; on an object. The form is usually taken to mean &#8220;to barter for,&#8221; which would be an expression showing great callousness to a friend (NIV). NEB has &#8220;hurl yourselves,&#8221; perhaps following the LXX &#8220;rush against.&#8221; but G. R. Driver thinks that meaning is very precarious. As for the translation, &#8220;to speculate about [or &#8220;over&#8221;] a friend&#8221; could be understood to mean &#8220;engage in speculation concerning,&#8221; so the translation &#8220;auction off&#8221; has been used instead.</p>
