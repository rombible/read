<A NAME="660"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=464><b>tn</b> This is the usual rendering of the Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">orkhot</font>, &#8220;way, path&#8221;). It would mean that the course of the wadi would wind down and be lost in the sand. Many commentators either repoint the text to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1465;&#1512;&#1456;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">orÿkhot</font>) when in construct (as in Isa 21:13), or simply redefine the existing word to mean &#8220;caravans&#8221; as in the next verse, and translate something like &#8220;caravans deviate from their route.&#8221; D. J. A. Clines (<i>Job </i>[WBC], 160-61) allows that &#8220;caravans&#8221; will be introduced in the next verse, but urges retention of the usual sense here. The two verses together will yield the same idea in either case &#8211; the river dries up and caravans looking for the water deviate from their course looking for it.</p>
