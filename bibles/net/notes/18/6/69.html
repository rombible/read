<A NAME="69"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=413><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">la</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">u</font>) is traced by E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 76) to a root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">la</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>),<i> </i>cognate to an Arabic root meaning &#8220;to chatter.&#8221; He shows how modern Hebrew has a meaning for the word &#8220;to stammer out.&#8221; But that does not really fit Job&#8217;s outbursts. The idea in the context is rather that of speaking wildly, rashly, or charged with grief. This would trace the word to a hollow or geminate word and link it to Arabic &#8220;talk wildly&#8221; (see D. J. A. Clines, <i>Job </i>[WBC], 158). In the older works the verb was taken from a geminate root meaning &#8220;to suck&#8221; or &#8220;to swallow&#8221; (cf. KJV), but that yields a very difficult sense to the line.</p>
