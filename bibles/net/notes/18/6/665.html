<A NAME="665"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=469><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">navat</font>) means &#8220;to gaze intently&#8221;; the looking is more intentional, more of a close scrutiny. It forms a fine parallel to the idea of &#8220;hope&#8221; in the second part. The NIV translates the second verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1460;&#1493;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qivvu</font>) as &#8220;look in hope.&#8221; In the previous verbs the imperfect form was used, expressing what generally happens (so the English present tense was used). Here the verb usage changes to the perfect form. It seems that Job is narrating a typical incident now &#8211; they looked, but were disappointed.</p>
