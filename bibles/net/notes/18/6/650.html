<A NAME="650"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=454><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1490;&#1456;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bagÿdu</font>, &#8220;dealt treacherously) has been translated &#8220;dealt deceitfully,&#8221; but it is a very strong word. It means &#8220;to act treacherously [or deceitfully].&#8221; The deception is the treachery, because the deception is not innocent &#8211; it is in the place of a great need. The imagery will compare it to the brook that may or may not have water. If one finds no water when one expected it and needed it, there is deception and treachery. The LXX softens it considerably: &#8220;have not regarded me.&#8221;</p>
