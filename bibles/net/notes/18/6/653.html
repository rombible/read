<A NAME="653"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=457><b>tn</b> The verb is rather simple &#8211; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1489;&#1465;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avoru</font>). But some translate it &#8220;pass away&#8221; or &#8220;flow away,&#8221; and others &#8220;overflow.&#8221; In the rainy season they are deep and flowing, or &#8220;overflow&#8221; their banks. This is a natural sense to the verb, and since the next verse focuses on this, some follow this interpretation (H. H. Rowley, <i>Job</i> [NCBC], 15). But this idea does not parallel the first part of v. 15. So it makes better sense to render it &#8220;flow away&#8221; and see the reference to the summer dry spells when one wants the water but is disappointed.</p>
