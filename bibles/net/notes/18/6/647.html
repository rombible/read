<A NAME="647"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=451><b>tn</b> The Hebrew of this verse is extremely difficult, and while there are many suggestions, none of them has gained a consensus. The first colon simply has &#8220;to the despairing // from his friend // kindness.&#8221; Several commentators prefer to change the first word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1505;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lammas</font>, &#8220;to the one in despair&#8221;) to some sort of verb; several adopt the reading &#8220;the one who withholds/he withholds mercy from his friend forsakes&#8230;.&#8221; The point of the first half of the verse seems to be that one should expect kindness (or loyalty) from a friend in times of suffering.</p>
