<A NAME="655"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=459><b>tn</b> The participle <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1465;&#1491;&#1456;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;</font> </i>(<font face="Scholar">haqqodÿrim</font>), often rendered &#8220;which are black,&#8221; would better be translated &#8220;dark,&#8221; for it refers to the turbid waters filled with melting ice or melting snow, or to the frozen surface of the water, but not waters that are muddied. The versions failed to note that this referred to the waters introduced in v. 15.</p>
