<A NAME="615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=419><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arakh</font>) means &#8220;to set in battle array.&#8221; The suffix on the verb is dative (see GKC 369 §117.<i>x</i>). Many suggestions have been made for changing this word. These seem unnecessary since the MT pointing yields a good meaning: but for the references to these suggestions, see D. J. A. Clines, <i>Job </i>(WBC), 158. H. H. Rowley (<i>Job</i> [NCBC], 59), nonetheless, follows the suggestion of Driver that connects it to a root meaning &#8220;wear me down.&#8221; This change of meaning requires no change in the Hebrew text. The image is of a beleaguering army; the host is made up of all the terrors from God. The reference is to the terrifying and perplexing thoughts that assail Job (A. B. Davidson, <i>Job</i>, 44).</p>
