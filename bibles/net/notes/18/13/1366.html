<A NAME="1366"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=1001><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">titkhaqqeh</font>) is a Hitpael from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khaqah</font>, parallel to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1511;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khaqaq</font>). The word means &#8220;to engrave&#8221; or &#8220;to carve out.&#8221; This Hitpael would mean &#8220;to imprint something on oneself&#8221; (E. Dhorme [<i>Job</i>, 192] says on one&#8217;s mind, and so derives the meaning &#8220;examine.&#8221;). The object of this is the expression &#8220;on the roots of my feet,&#8221; which would refer to where the feet hit the ground. Since the passage has more to do with God&#8217;s restricting Job&#8217;s movement, the translation &#8220;you set a boundary to the soles of my feet&#8221; would be better than Dhorme&#8217;s view. The image of inscribing or putting marks on the feet is not found elsewhere. It may be, as Pope suggests, a reference to marking the slaves to make tracking them easier. The LXX has &#8220;you have penetrated to my heels.&#8221;</p>
