<A NAME="1331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=966><b>tn</b> The Hebrew has a pregnant construction: &#8220;be silent from me,&#8221; meaning &#8220;stand away from me in silence,&#8221; or &#8220;refrain from talking with me.&#8221; See GKC 384 §119.<i>ff</i>. The LXX omits &#8220;from me,&#8221; as do several commentators.</p>
