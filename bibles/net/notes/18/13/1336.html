<A NAME="1336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=971><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;why do I take my flesh in my teeth?&#8221; This expression occurs nowhere else. It seems to be drawn from animal imagery in which the wild beast seizes the prey and carries it off to a place of security. The idea would then be that Job may be destroying himself. An animal that fights with its flesh (prey) in its mouth risks losing it. Other commentators do not think this is satisfactory, but they are unable to suggest anything better.</p>
