<A NAME="1357"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=992><b>sn</b> Job uses three words for sin here: &#8220;iniquities,&#8221; which means going astray, erring; &#8220;sins,&#8221; which means missing the mark or the way; and &#8220;transgressions,&#8221; which are open rebellions. They all emphasize different kinds of sins and different degrees of willfulness. Job is demanding that any sins be brought up. Both Job and his friends agree that great afflictions would have to indicate great offenses &#8211; he wants to know what they are.</p>
