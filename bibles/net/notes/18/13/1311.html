<A NAME="1311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=946><b>tn</b> The literal rendering of the construct would be &#8220;healers of worthlessness.&#8221; Ewald and Dillmann translated it &#8220;patchers&#8221; based on a meaning in Arabic and Ethiopic; this would give the idea &#8220;botchers.&#8221; But it makes equally good sense to take &#8220;healers&#8221; as the meaning, for Job&#8217;s friends came to minister comfort and restoration to him &#8211; but they failed. See P. Humbert, &#8220;Maladie et medicine dans l&#8217;AT,&#8221; <i>RHPR</i> 44 (1964): 1-29. </p>
