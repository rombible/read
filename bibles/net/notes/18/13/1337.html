<A NAME="1337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=972><b>tn</b> There is a textual difficulty here that factors into the interpretation of the verse. The <i>Kethib</i> is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;, &#8220;not&#8221;), but the <i>Qere</i> is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>, &#8220;to him&#8221;). The RSV takes the former: &#8220;Behold, he will slay me, I have no hope.&#8221; The NIV takes it as &#8220;though he slay me, yet will I hope in him.&#8221; Job is looking ahead to death, which is not an evil thing to him. The point of the verse is that he is willing to challenge God at the risk of his life; and if God slays him, he is still confident that he will be vindicated &#8211; as he says later in this chapter. Other suggestions are not compelling. E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 187) makes a slight change of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1497;&#1463;&#1495;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ayakhel</font>, &#8220;I will hope&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akhil</font>, &#8220;I will [not] tremble&#8221;). A. B. Davidson (<i>Job</i>, 98) retains the MT, but interprets the verb more in line with its use in the book: &#8220;I will not wait&#8221; (cf. NLT).</p>
