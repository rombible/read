<A NAME="1358"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=993><b>sn</b> The anthropomorphism of &#8220;hide the face&#8221; indicates a withdrawal of favor and an outpouring of wrath (see Ps 30:7 [8]; Isa 54:8; Ps 27:9). Sometimes God &#8220;hides his face&#8221; to make himself invisible or aloof (see 34:29). In either case, if God covers his face it is because he considers Job an enemy &#8211; at least this is what Job thinks.</p>
