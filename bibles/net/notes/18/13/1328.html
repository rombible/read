<A NAME="1328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=963><b>tn</b> The parallelism of &#8220;dust&#8221; and &#8220;ashes&#8221; is fairly frequent in scripture. But &#8220;proverbs of ashes&#8221; is difficult. The genitive is certainly describing the proverbs; it could be classified as a genitive of apposition, proverbs that are/have become ashes. Ashes represent something that at one time may have been useful, but now has been reduced to what is worthless.</p>
