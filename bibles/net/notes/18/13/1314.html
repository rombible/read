<A NAME="1314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=949><b>sn</b> Job first will argue with his friends. His cause that he will plead with God begins in v. 13. The same root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yakhakh</font>, &#8220;argue, plead&#8221;) is used here as in v. 3b (see note). Synonymous parallelism between the two halves of this verse supports this translation.</p>
