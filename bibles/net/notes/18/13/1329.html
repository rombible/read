<A NAME="1329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=964><b>tn</b> There is a division of opinion on the source of this word. Some take it from &#8220;answer&#8221;, related to Arabic, Aramaic, and Syriac words for &#8220;answer,&#8221; and so translate it &#8220;responses&#8221; (JB). Others take it from a word for &#8220;back,&#8221; with a derived meaning of the &#8220;boss&#8221; of the shield, and translate it bulwark or &#8220;defenses&#8221; (NEB, RSV, NIV). The idea of &#8220;answers&#8221; may fit the parallelism better, but &#8220;defenses&#8221; can be taken figuratively to refer to verbal defenses.</p>
