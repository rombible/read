<a name="187"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">87</span><note=87><b>tn</b> The last clause is difficult to translate. It simply reads, &#8220;and he did not give unseemliness to God.&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tiflah</font>) means &#8220;unsavoriness&#8221; or &#8220;unseemliness&#8221; in a moral sense. The sense is that Job did not charge God with any moral impropriety in his dealings with him. God did nothing worthless or tasteless. The ancient versions saw the word connected with &#8220;foolishness&#8221; or &#8220;stupidity&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1508;&#1461;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tafel</font>, &#8220;to be tasteless&#8221;). It is possible that &#8220;folly&#8221; would capture some of what Job meant here. See also M. Dahood, &#8220;Hebrew-Ugaritic Lexicography XII,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 55 (1974): 381-93.</p>
