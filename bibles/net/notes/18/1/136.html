<a name="136"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=36><b>sn</b> The word means &#8220;adversary&#8221; or with the article &#8220;the adversary&#8221; &#8211; here the superhuman adversary or Satan. The word with the article means that the meaning of the word should receive prominence. A denominative verb meaning &#8220;to act as adversary&#8221; occurs. Satan is the great accuser of the saints (see Zech 3 where &#8220;Satan was standing there to &#8216;satanize&#8217; Joshua the priest&#8221;; and see Rev 12 which identifies him with the Serpent in Genesis). He came among the angels at this time because he is one of them and has access among them. Even though fallen, Satan has yet to be cast down completely (see Rev 12).</p>
