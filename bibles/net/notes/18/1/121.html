<a name="121"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=21><b>tn</b> Normally cardinal numerals tend to disagree in gender with the numbered noun. In v. 2 &#8220;three daughters&#8221; consists of the masculine numeral followed by the feminine noun. However, here &#8220;three sisters&#8221; consists of the feminine numeral followed by the feminine noun. The distinction appears to be that the normal disagreement between numeral and noun when the intent is merely to fix the number (3 daughters as opposed to 2 or 4 daughters). However, when a particular, previously known group is indicated, the numeral tends to agree with the noun in gender. A similar case occurs in Gen 3:13 (&#8220;three wives&#8221; of Noah&#8217;s sons).</p>
