<a name="182"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">82</span><note=82><b>tn</b> This last verb is the Hishtaphel of the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khavah; </font>BDB 1005 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font>); it means &#8220;to prostrate oneself, to cause oneself to be low to the ground.&#8221; In the OT it is frequently translated &#8220;to worship&#8221; because that is usually why the individual would kneel down and then put his or her forehead to the ground at the knees. But the word essentially means &#8220;to bow down to the ground.&#8221; Here &#8220;worship&#8221; (although employed by several English translations, cf. KJV, NASB, NIV, NRSV, CEV) conveys more than what is taking place &#8211; although Job&#8217;s response is certainly worshipful. See G. I. Davies, &#8220;A Note on the Etymology of <i>histah<sup>a</sup>wah,</i>&#8221; <i>VT</i> 29 (1979): 493-95; and J. A. Emerton, &#8220;The Etymology of <i>histah<sup>a</sup>wah</i>,&#8221; <i>OTS</i> (1977): 41-55.</p>
