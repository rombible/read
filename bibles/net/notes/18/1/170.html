<a name="170"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=70><b>tn</b> The Hebrew expression is literally &#8220;yet/this/speaking/and this/ arrived.&#8221; The sentence uses the two demonstratives as a contrasting pair. It means &#8220;this one was still speaking when that one arrived&#8221; (<i>IBHS</i> 308-9 §17.3c). The word &#8220;messenger&#8221; has been supplied in the translation in vv. 16, 17, and 18 for clarity and for stylistic reasons.</p>
