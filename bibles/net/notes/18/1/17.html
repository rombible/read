<a name="17"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=7><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tam</font>) has been translated &#8220;perfect&#8221; (so KJV, ASV). The verbal root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tamam</font>) means &#8220;to be blameless, complete.&#8221; The word is found in Gen 25:27 where it describes Jacob as &#8220;even-tempered.&#8221; It also occurs in Ps 64:5 (64:4 ET) and Prov 29:10. The meaning is that a person or a thing is complete, perfect, flawless. It does not mean that he was sinless, but that he was wholeheartedly trying to please God, that he had integrity and was blameless before God.</p>
