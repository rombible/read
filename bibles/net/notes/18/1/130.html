<a name="130"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=30><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">barakh</font>), which means &#8220;to bless.&#8221; Here is a case where the writer or a scribe has substituted the word &#8220;curse&#8221; with the word &#8220;bless&#8221; to avoid having the expression &#8220;curse God.&#8221; For similar euphemisms in the ancient world, see K. A. Kitchen, <i>Ancient Orient and Old Testament</i>, 166. It is therefore difficult to know exactly what Job feared they might have done. The opposite of &#8220;bless&#8221; would be &#8220;curse,&#8221; which normally would convey disowning or removing from blessing. Some commentators try to offer a definition of &#8220;curse&#8221; from the root in the text, and noting that &#8220;curse&#8221; is too strong, come to something like &#8220;renounce.&#8221; The idea of blaspheming is probably not meant; rather, in their festivities they may have said things that renounced God or their interest in him. Job feared this momentary turning away from God in their festivities, perhaps as they thought their good life was more important than their religion.</p>
