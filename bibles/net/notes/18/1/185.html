(1) They can be given the nuance of gnomic imperfect, expressing what the sovereign God always does. This is the approach taken in the present translation. Alternatively (2) they could be referring specifically to Job&#8217;s own experience: &#8220;Yahweh gave [definite past, referring to his coming into this good life] and Yahweh has taken away&#8221; [present perfect, referring to his great losses]. Many English versions follow the second alternative.</p>
