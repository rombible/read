<a name="183"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">83</span><note=83><b>tn</b> The adjective &#8220;naked&#8221; is functioning here as an adverbial accusative of state, explicative of the state of the subject. While it does include the literal sense of nakedness at birth, Job is also using it symbolically to mean &#8220;without possessions.&#8221;</p>
