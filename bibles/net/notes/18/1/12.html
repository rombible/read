But it is a different kind of wisdom. Whereas the Book of Proverbs is a collection of the short wisdom sayings, Job is a thorough analysis of the relationship between suffering and divine justice put in a dramatic poetic form. There are a number of treatises on this subject in the ancient Near East, but none of them are as thorough and masterful as Job. See J. Gray, &#8220;The Book of Job in the Context of Near Eastern Literature,&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 82 (1970): 251-69; S. N. Kramer, &#8220;Man and His God, A Sumerian Variation on the &#8216;Job&#8217; Motif,&#8221; VTSup 3 (1953): 170-82. While the book has fascinated readers for ages, it is a difficult book, difficult to translate and difficult to study. Most of it is written in poetic parallelism. But it is often very cryptic, it is written with unusual grammatical constructions, and it makes use of a large number of very rare words. All this has led some scholars to question if it was originally written in Hebrew or some other related Semitic dialect or language first. There is no indication of who the author was. It is even possible that the work may have been refined over the years; but there is no evidence for this either. The book uses a variety of genres (laments, hymns, proverbs, and oracles) in the various speeches of the participants. This all adds to the richness of the material. And while it is a poetic drama using cycles of speeches, there is no reason to doubt that the events represented here do not go back to a real situation and preserve the various arguments. Several indications in the book would place Job&#8217;s dates in the time of the patriarchs. But the composition of the book, or at least its final form, may very well come from the first millennium, maybe in the time of the flowering of wisdom literature with Solomon. We have no way of knowing when the book was written, or when its revision was completed. But dating it late in the intertestamental period is ruled out by the appearance of translations and copies of it, notably bits of a Targum of Job in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Among the general works and commentaries, see A. Hurvitz, &#8220;The Date of the Prose Tale of Job Linguistically Reconsidered,&#8221; <i>HTR</i> 67 (1974): 17-34; R. H. Pfeiffer, &#8220;The Priority of Job over Isaiah 40-55,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 46 (1927): 202ff. The book presents many valuable ideas on the subject of the suffering of the righteous. Ultimately it teaches that one must submit to the wisdom of the Creator. But it also indicates that the shallow answers of Job&#8217;s friends do not do justice to the issue. Their arguments that suffering is due to sin are true to a point, but they did not apply to Job. His protests sound angry and belligerent, but he held tenaciously to his integrity. His experience shows that it is possible to live a pure life and yet still suffer. He finally turns his plea to God, demanding a hearing. This he receives, of course, only to hear that God is sovereignly ruling the universe. Job can only submit to him. In the end God does not abandon his sufferer. For additional material, see G. L. Archer, <i>The Book of Job</i>; H. H. Rowley, &#8220;The Book of Job and Its Meaning,&#8221; <i>BJRL</i> 41 (1958/59): 167-207; J. A. Baker, <i>The Book of Job</i>; C. L. Feinberg, &#8220;The Book of Job,&#8221; <i>BSac</i> 91 (1934): 78-86; R. Polzin and D. Robertson, &#8220;Studies in the Book of Job,&#8221; <i>Semeia</i> 7 (Missoula: Scholars Press, 1977).</p>
