<a name="16"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=6><b>sn</b> The name &#8220;Job&#8221; is mentioned by Ezekiel as one of the greats in the past &#8211; Noah, Job, and Daniel (14:14). The suffering of Job was probably well known in the ancient world, and this name was clearly part of that tradition. There is little reason to try to determine the etymology and meaning of the name, since it may not be Hebrew. If it were Hebrew, it might mean something like &#8220;persecuted,&#8221; although some suggest &#8220;aggressor.&#8221; If Arabic it might have the significance of &#8220;the one who always returns to God.&#8221;</p>
