<a name="171"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=71><b>sn</b> The &#8220;fire of God&#8221; would refer to lightning (1 Kgs 18:38; 2 Kgs 1:12; cf. NAB, NCV, TEV). The LXX simply has &#8220;fire.&#8221; The first blow came from enemies; the second from heaven, which might have confused Job more as to the cause of his troubles. The use of the divine epithet could also be an indication of the superlative degree; see D. W. Thomas, &#8220;A Consideration of Some Unusual Ways of Expressing the Superlative in Hebrew,&#8221; <i>VT </i>3 (1953): 209-24.</p>
