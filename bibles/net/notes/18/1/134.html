They are not actually &#8220;sons&#8221; of <i>Elohim</i>; the idiom is a poetic way of describing their nature and relationship to God. The phrase indicates their supernatural nature, and their submission to God as the sovereign Lord. It may be classified as a genitive that expresses how individuals belong to a certain class or type, i.e., the supernatural (GKC 418 §128.<i>v</i>). In the pagan literature, especially of Ugarit, &#8220;the sons of God&#8221; refers to the lesser gods or deities of the pantheon. See H. W. Robinson, &#8220;The Council of Yahweh,&#8221; <i>JTS</i> 45 (1943): 151-57; G. Cooke, &#8220;The Sons of (the) God(s),&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 76 (1964): 22-47; M. Tsevat, &#8220;God and the Gods in the Assembly,&#8221; <i>HUCA</i> 40-41 (1969/70): 123-37. </p>
