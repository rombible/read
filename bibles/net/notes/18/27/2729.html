<A NAME="2729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1706><b>tn</b> The text simply repeats the verb from the last clause. It could be treated as a separate short clause: &#8220;He may store it up, but the righteous will wear it. But it also could be understood as the object of the following verb, &#8220;[what] he stores up the righteous will wear.&#8221; The LXX simply has, &#8220;All these things shall the righteous gain.&#8221;</p>
