<A NAME="2723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1700><b>tn</b> The text has the noun &#8220;vain thing; breath; vapor,&#8221; and then a denominative verb from the same root: &#8220;to become vain with a vain thing,&#8221; or &#8220;to do in vain a vain thing.&#8221; This is an example of the internal object, or a cognate accusative (see GKC 367 §117.<i>q</i>). The LXX has &#8220;you all know that you are adding vanity to vanity.&#8221;</p>
