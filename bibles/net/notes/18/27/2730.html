<A NAME="2730"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1707><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ash</font>, &#8220;like a moth&#8221;), but this leaves room for clarification. Some commentators wanted to change it to &#8220;bird&#8217;s nest&#8221; or just &#8220;nest&#8221; (cf. NRSV) to make the parallelism; see Job 4:14. But the word is not found. The LXX has a double expression, &#8220;as moths, as a spider.&#8221; So several take it as the spider&#8217;s web, which is certainly unsubstantial (cf. NAB, NASB, NLT; see Job 8:14).</p>
