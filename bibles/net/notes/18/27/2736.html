<A NAME="2736"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1713><b>tn</b> If the same subject is to be carried through here, it is the wind. That would make this a bold personification, perhaps suggesting the force of the wind. Others argue that it is unlikely that the wind claps its hands. They suggest taking the verb with an indefinite subject: &#8220;he claps&#8221; means &#8220;one claps. The idea is that of people rejoicing when the wicked are gone. But the parallelism is against this unless the second line is changed as well. R. Gordis (<i>Job</i>, 296) has &#8220;men will clap their hands&#8230;men will whistle upon him.&#8221;</p>
