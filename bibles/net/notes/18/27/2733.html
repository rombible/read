<A NAME="2733"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1710><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he is not.&#8221; One view is that this must mean that he dies, not that his wealth is gone. R. Gordis (<i>Job</i>, 295) says the first part should be made impersonal: &#8220;when one opens one&#8217;s eyes, the wicked is no longer there.&#8221; E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 396) has it more simply: &#8220;He has opened his eyes, and it is for the last time.&#8221; But the other view is that the wealth goes overnight. In support of this is the introduction into the verse of the wealthy. The RSV, NRSV, ESV, and NLT take it that &#8220;wealth is gone.&#8221;</p>
