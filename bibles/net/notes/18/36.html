<A NAME="361"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2145><b>sn</b> This very lengthy speech can be broken down into the following sections: the discipline of suffering (36:2-25), the work and wisdom of God (36:26&#8211;37:24).</p>
<A NAME="362"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2146><b>tn</b> The use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1505;&#1462;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyosef</font>) is with the hendiadys construction: &#8220;and he added and said,&#8221; meaning &#8220;and he said again, further.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="363"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2147><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kattar</font>) is the Piel imperative; in Hebrew the word means &#8220;to surround&#8221; and is related to the noun for crown. But in Syriac it means &#8220;to wait.&#8221; This section of the book of Job will have a few Aramaic words.</p>
<A NAME="364"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2148><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text simply has &#8220;for yet for God words.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="365"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2149><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will carry my knowledge to-from afar.&#8221; The expression means that he will give a wide range to knowledge, that he will speak comprehensively.</p>
<A NAME="366"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2150><b>tn</b> This line gives the essence of all of Elihu&#8217;s speech &#8211; to give or ascribe righteousness to God against the charges of Job. Dhorme translates this &#8220;I will justify my Maker,&#8221; and that is workable if it carries the meaning of &#8220;declaring to be right.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="367"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2151><b>tn</b> The word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tÿmim</font>), often translated &#8220;perfect.&#8221; It is the same word used of Job in 2:3. Elihu is either a complete stranger to modesty or is confident regarding the knowledge that he believes God has revealed to him for this situation. See the note on the heading before 32:1.</p>
<A NAME="368"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2152><b>tn</b> The object &#8220;people&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text but is implied.</p>
<A NAME="369"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2153><b>tn</b> The text simply repeats &#8220;mighty.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2154><b>tn</b> The last two words are simply <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1495;&#1463; &#1500;&#1461;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">koakh lev</font>, &#8220;strong in heart&#8221;), meaning something like &#8220;strong; firm in his decisions.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2155><b>tc</b> There are several problems in this verse: the repetition of &#8220;mighty,&#8221; the lack of an object for &#8220;despise,&#8221; and the meaning of &#8220;strength of heart.&#8221; Many commentators reduce the verse to a single line, reading something like &#8220;Lo, God does not reject the pure in heart&#8221; (Kissane). Dhorme and Pope follow Nichols with: &#8220;Lo, God is mighty in strength, and rejects not the pure in heart.&#8221; This reading moved &#8220;mighty&#8221; to the first line and took the second to be <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bar</font>, &#8220;pure&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="3612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2156><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;he does not keep the wicked alive.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2157><b>tc</b> Many commentators accept the change of &#8220;his eyes&#8221; to &#8220;his right&#8221; (reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;</font> [<font face="Scholar">dino</font>] for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1497;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">enayv</font>]). There is no compelling reason for the change; it makes the line commonplace.</p>
<A NAME="3614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2158><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;them&#8221;; the referent (the righteous) has been repeated from the first part of the verse for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2159><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he seats them forever and exalts them.&#8221; The last verb can be understood as expressing a logical consequence of the preceding action (cf. GKC 328 §111.<i>l</i> = &#8220;he seats them forever so that he exalts them&#8221;). Or the two verbs can be taken as an adverbial hendiadys whereby the first modifies the second adverbially: &#8220;he exalts them by seating them forever&#8221; or &#8220;when he seats them forever&#8221; (cf. GKC 326 §111.<i>d</i>). Some interpret this verse to say that God seats kings on the throne, making a change in subject in the middle of the verse. But it makes better sense to see the righteous as the subject matter throughout &#8211; they are not only protected, but are exalted.</p>
<A NAME="3616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2160><b>tn</b> Dhorme thinks that the verse is still talking about kings, who may be in captivity. But this diverts attention from Elihu&#8217;s emphasis on the righteous.</p>
<A NAME="3617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2161><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nagad</font>) means &#8220;to declare; to tell.&#8221; Here it is clear that God is making known the sins that caused the enslavement or captivity, so &#8220;reveal&#8221; makes a good interpretive translation.</p>
<A NAME="3618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2162><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;their work.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2163><b>tn</b> The idiom once again is &#8220;he uncovers their ear.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2164><b>tn</b> The revelation is in the preceding verse, and so a pronoun must be added to make the reference clear.</p>
<A NAME="3621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2165><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shuv</font>, &#8220;to turn; to return&#8221;) is one of the two major words in the OT for &#8220;repent&#8221; &#8211; to return from evil. Here the imperfect should be obligatory &#8211; they must do it.</p>
<A NAME="3622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2166><b>tc</b> Some commentators delete this last line for metrical considerations. But there is no textual evidence for the deletion; it is simply the attempt by some to make the meter rigid.</p>
<A NAME="3623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2167><b>tn</b> This is a similar expression to the one in Job 33:18, where the suggestion was made by many that it means crossing over the canal or river of death. Some retain the earlier interpretation of &#8220;perish by the sword&#8221; (cf. NIV).</p>
<A NAME="3624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2168><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;godless [or hypocrite] in heart&#8221; is an intensification of the description. It conveys that they are intentionally godless. See Matt 23:28.</p>
<A NAME="3625"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2169><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they put anger.&#8221; This is usually interpreted to mean they lay up anger, or put anger in their hearts.</p>
<A NAME="3626"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2170><b>tn</b> The text expresses this with &#8220;their soul dies.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3627"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2171><i><b>tn</b> Heb </i>&#8220;among the male prostitutes&#8221; who were at the temple &#8211; the &#8220;holy ones,&#8221; with &#8220;holy&#8221; being used in that sense of &#8220;separated to that form of temple service.&#8221; So uncleanness and shame are some of the connotations of the reference. Some modern translations give the general sense only: &#8220;their life ends in shame&#8221; (NRSV); &#8220;and perish among the reprobate&#8221; (NAB); &#8220;die&#8230;after wasting their lives in immoral living&#8221; (NLT).</p>
<A NAME="3628"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2172><b>tn</b> The preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet</font>) in these two lines is not location but instrument, not &#8220;in&#8221; but &#8220;by means of.&#8221; The affliction and the oppression serve as a warning for sin, and therefore a means of salvation.</p>
<A NAME="3629"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2173><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3630"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2174><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he uncovers their ear.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3631"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2175><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb means &#8220;to entice; to lure; to allure; to seduce,&#8221; but these have negative connotations. The English &#8220;to persuade; to draw&#8221; might work better. The verb is the Hiphil perfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sut</font>). But the nuance of the verb is difficult. It can be equivalent to an English present expressing what God is doing (Peake). But the subject is contested as well. Since the verb usually has an evil connotation, there have been attempts to make the &#8220;plaza&#8221; the subject &#8211; &#8220;the wide place has led you astray&#8221; (Ewald).</p>
<A NAME="3632"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2176><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a broad place where there is no cramping beneath [or under] it.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3633"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2177><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhat</font>) could be translated &#8220;set&#8221; if it is connected with the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nuakh</font>, &#8220;to rest,&#8221; but then &#8220;to lay to rest, to set&#8221;). Kissane translates it &#8220;comfort.&#8221; Dhorme thinks it could come from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nuakh</font>, &#8220;to rest&#8221;) or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhat</font>, &#8220;to descend&#8221;). But his conclusion is that it is a dittography after &#8220;under it&#8221; (p. 545).</p>
<A NAME="3634"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2178><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;filled with fat.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3635"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2179><b>tn</b> The first expression is idiomatic: the text says, &#8220;because wrath lest it entice you&#8221; &#8211; thus, beware.</p>
<A NAME="3636"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2180><b>tn</b> The word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1508;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kofer</font>), often translated &#8220;ransom,&#8221; but frequently in the sense of a bribe.</p>
<A NAME="3637"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2181><b>tn</b> The form in the MT is &#8220;your cry (for help).&#8221; See J. E. Hartley (<i>Job</i> [NICOT], 472-73) and E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 547-48) on the difficulties.</p>
<A NAME="3638"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2182><b>tn</b> This part has only two words <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488; &#1489;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> bÿtsar</font>, &#8220;not in distress&#8221;). The negated phrase serves to explain the first colon.</p>
<A NAME="3639"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2183><b>tc</b> For the many suggestions and the reasoning here, see the commentaries.</p>
<A NAME="3640"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=2184><b>tn</b> The meaning of this line is difficult. There are numerous suggestions for emending the text. Kissane takes the first verb in the sense of &#8220;oppress,&#8221; and for &#8220;the night&#8221; he has &#8220;belonging to you,&#8221; meaning &#8220;your people.&#8221; This reads: &#8220;Oppress not them that belong not to you, that your kinsmen may mount up in their place.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3641"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=2185><b>tn</b> Normally &#8220;tested&#8221; would be the translation for the Niphal of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bakhar</font>). Although the Qal is employed here, the context favors &#8220;tested&#8221; rather than &#8220;chose.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3642"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=2186><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">moreh</font>) is the Hiphil participle from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yarah</font>). It is related to the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">torah</font>, &#8220;what is taught&#8221; i.e., the law).</p>
<A NAME="3643"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2187><b>tn</b> The expression is &#8220;that you extol,&#8221; serving as an object of the verb.</p>
<A NAME="3644"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=2188><b>tn</b> The last part has the verbal construction, &#8220;and we do not know.&#8221; This clause is to be used adverbially: &#8220;beyond our understanding.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3645"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=2189><b>tn</b> The verb means &#8220;to filter; to refine,&#8221; and so a plural subject with the drops of water as the subject will not work. So many read the singular, &#8220;he distills.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3646"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=2190><b>tn</b> This word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1491;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ed</font>) occurs also in Gen 2:6. The suggestion has been that instead of a mist it represents an underground watercourse that wells up to water the ground.</p>
<A NAME="3647"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=2191><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his booth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3648"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=2192><b>tn</b> The word actually means &#8220;to spread,&#8221; but with lightning as the object, &#8220;to scatter&#8221; appears to fit the context better.</p>
<A NAME="3649"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=2193><b>tn</b> The word is &#8220;light,&#8221; but taken to mean &#8220;lightning.&#8221; Theodotion had &#8220;mist&#8221; here, and so most commentators follow that because it is more appropriate to the verb and the context.</p>
<A NAME="3650"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=2194><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;roots.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3651"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=2195><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yadin</font>, &#8220;he judges&#8221;). Houbigant proposed<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yazun</font>, &#8220;he nourishes&#8221;). This has found wide acceptance among commentators (cf. NAB). G. R. Driver retained the MT but gave a meaning &#8220;enriches&#8221; to the verb (&#8220;Problems in the Hebrew text of Job,&#8221; VTSup 3 [1955]: 88ff.).</p>
<A NAME="3652"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=2196><b>tn</b> R. Gordis (<i>Job</i>, 422) prefers to link this word with the later Hebrew word for &#8220;arch,&#8221; not &#8220;hands.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3653"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=2197><b>tn</b> Because the image might mean that God grabs the lightning and hurls it like a javelin (cf. NLT), some commentators want to change &#8220;covers&#8221; to other verbs. Dhorme has &#8220;lifts&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;</font> [<font face="Scholar">nissa</font>&#8217;] for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1505;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">kissah</font>]). This fit the idea of God directing the lightning bolts.</p>
<A NAME="3654"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=2198><b>tn</b> Peake knew of over thirty interpretations for this verse. The MT literally says, &#8220;He declares his purpose [or his shout] concerning it; cattle also concerning what rises.&#8221; Dhorme has it: &#8220;The flock which sniffs the coming storm has warned the shepherd.&#8221; Kissane: &#8220;The thunder declares concerning him, as he excites wrath against iniquity.&#8221; Gordis translates it: &#8220;His thunderclap proclaims his presence, and the storm his mighty wrath.&#8221; Many more could be added to the list.</p>
