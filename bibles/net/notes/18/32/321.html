<A NAME="321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1952><b>sn</b> There are now four speeches from another friend of Job, Elihu. But Job does not reply to any of these, nor does the <sc>Lord. The speeches show a knowledge of the debate that has gone on, but they take a different approach entirely. Elihu&#8217;s approach is that suffering is a discipline from God, to teach his people. In other words, Job was suffering to vindicate God&#8217;s confidence in him. His speeches are an interesting part of the book, but they too are irrelevant to Job&#8217;s actual case. In the first speech, there is a short introduction (32:1-5), and then the speech proper with these sections: Elihu will speak because his youth is wiser (32:6-14), and his friends arguments failed (32:15-22); he calls for Job&#8217;s attention (33:1-7), claims Job&#8217;s case is wrong (33:8-13), and Job&#8217;s argument that God does not answer is false (33:14-28), and then makes an appeal to Job (33:29-33). It becomes evident that Elihu correctly identified Job&#8217;s determination to maintain his integrity at God&#8217;s expense as the primary problem in at least the latter stages of the dialogues (32:1-3; 34:37; 35:16; cf. 38:2; 40:8; 42:3). Elihu was respectful of his elders (32:4), but remained uninfected by their error (32:14). He sought to maintain impartiality (32:21-22) and to offer true wisdom (33:33), believed like Job that a mediator existed (33:23-24), and desired Job&#8217;s vindication (33:32). In addition, Elihu focused on vindicating God&#8217;s actions (34:12; 35:10-11; 36:2-3, 22-26) and announced the coming theophany (37:1-5, 22). It appears that he was not included in the divine condemnation of Job&#8217;s friends (42:7-9) and was excluded from Job&#8217;s prayer of intercession (42:8-10) &#8211; both perhaps implying divine approval of his behavior and words.</p>
