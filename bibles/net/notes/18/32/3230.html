<A NAME="3230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1981><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lest you say.&#8221; R. Gordis (<i>Job</i>, 368) calls this a breviloquence: &#8220;beware lest [you say].&#8221; He then suggests the best reading for their quote to be, &#8220;We have attained wisdom, but only God can refute him, not man.&#8221; H. H. Rowley (<i>Job</i> [NCBC], 209) suggests the meaning is a little different, namely, that they are saying they have found wisdom in Job, and only God can deal with it. Elihu is in effect saying that they do not need God, for he is quite capable for this.</p>
