<A NAME="3229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1980><b>tn</b> The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1499;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mokhiakh</font>) is from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yakhakh</font>) that has been used frequently in the book of Job. It means &#8220;to argue; to contend; to debate; to prove; to dispute.&#8221; The usage of the verb shows that it can focus on the beginning of an argument, the debating itself, or the resolution of the conflict. Here the latter is obviously meant, for they did argue and contend and criticize &#8211; but could not prove Job wrong.</p>
