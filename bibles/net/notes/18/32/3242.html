<A NAME="3242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1993><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1465;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514; &#1495;&#1458;&#1491;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ovot khadashim</font>), traditionally rendered &#8220;like new wineskins.&#8221; But only here does the phrase have this meaning. The LXX has &#8220;smiths&#8221; for &#8220;new,&#8221; thus &#8220;like smith&#8217;s bellows.&#8221; A. Guillaume connects the word with an Arabic word for a wide vessel for wine shaped like a cup (&#8220;Archaeological and philological note on Job 32:19,&#8221; <i>PEQ</i> 93 [1961]: 147-50). Some have been found in archaeological sites. The poor would use skins, the rich would use jars. The key to putting this together is the verb at the end of the line, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1461;&#1506;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yibbaqea</font>&#8217;, &#8220;that are ready to burst&#8221;). The point of the statement is that Elihu is bursting to speak, and until now has not had the opening.</p>
