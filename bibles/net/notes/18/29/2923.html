<A NAME="2923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1784><b>tn</b> The verb here is &#8220;hidden&#8221; as well as in v. 8. But this is a strange expression for voices. Several argue that the word was erroneously inserted from 8a and needs to be emended. But the word &#8220;hide&#8221; can have extended meanings of &#8220;withdraw; be quiet; silent&#8221; (see Gen 31:27). A. Guillaume relates the Arabic <i>habi</i>&#8217;<i>a,</i> &#8220;the fire dies out,&#8221; applying the idea of &#8220;silent&#8221; only to v. 10 (it is a form of repetition of words with different senses, called <i>jinas</i>). The point here is that whatever conversation was going on would become silent or hushed to hear what Job had to say.</p>
