<A NAME="2913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1774><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the days of my ripeness.&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khoref</font>) denotes the time when the harvest is gathered in because the fruit is ripe. Since this is the autumn, many translate that way here &#8211; but &#8220;autumn&#8221; has a different connotation now. The text is pointing to a time when the righteous reaps what he has sown, and can enjoy the benefits. The translation &#8220;most productive time&#8221; seems to capture the point better than &#8220;autumn&#8221; or even &#8220;prime.&#8221;</p>
