<A NAME="2932"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1793><b>tn</b> The word rendered &#8220;fangs&#8221; actually means &#8220;teeth,&#8221; i.e., the molars probably; it is used frequently of the teeth of wild beasts. Of course, the language is here figurative, comparing the oppressing enemy to a preying animal.</p>
