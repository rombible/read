<A NAME="2934"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1795><b>tc</b> The expression in the MT is &#8220;with my nest.&#8221; The figure is satisfactory for the context &#8211; a home with all the young together, a picture of unity and safety. In Isa 16:2 the word can mean &#8220;nestlings,&#8221; and with the preposition &#8220;with&#8221; that might be the meaning here, except that his children had grown up and lived in their own homes. The figure cannot be pushed too far. But the verse apparently has caused enormous problems, because the versions offer a variety of readings and free paraphrases. The LXX has &#8220;My age shall grow old as the stem of a palm tree, I shall live a long time.&#8221; The Vulgate has, &#8220;In my nest I shall die and like the palm tree increase my days.&#8221; G. R. Driver found an Egyptian word meaning &#8220;strength&#8221; (&#8220;Birds in the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>PEQ</i> 87 [1955]: 138-39). Several read &#8220;in a ripe old age&#8221; instead of &#8220;in my nest&#8221; (Pope, Dhorme; see P. P. Saydon, &#8220;Philological and Textual Notes to the Maltese Translation of the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 23 [1961]: 252). This requires the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zaqan</font>, &#8220;be old&#8221;), i.e., <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1494;&#1456;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1463;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bizqunay</font>, &#8220;in my old age&#8221;) instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qinni</font>, &#8220;my nest&#8221;). It has support from the LXX.</p>
