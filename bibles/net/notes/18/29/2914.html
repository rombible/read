<A NAME="2914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1775><b>tc</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sod</font>) in this verse is an infinitive construct, prefixed with the temporal preposition and followed by a subjective genitive. It forms a temporal clause. There is some disagreement about the form and its meaning. The confusion in the versions shows that they were paraphrasing to get the general sense. In the Bible the derived noun (from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yasad</font>) means (a) a circle of close friends; (b) intimacy. Others follow the LXX and the Syriac with a meaning of &#8220;protect,&#8221; based on a change from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dalet</font>) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kaf</font>), and assuming the root was <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sakhakh</font>). This would mean, &#8220;when God protected my tent&#8221; (cf. NAB). D. W. Thomas tries to justify this meaning without changing the text (&#8220;The Interpretation of <font face="Scholar">BSOÝD</font> in Job 29:4,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 65 [1946]: 63-66).</p>
