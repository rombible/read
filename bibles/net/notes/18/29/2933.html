<A NAME="2933"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1794><b>tn</b> &#8220;I made [him] drop.&#8221; The verb means &#8220;to throw; to cast,&#8221; throw in the sense of &#8220;to throw away.&#8221; But in the context with the figure of the beast with prey in its mouth, &#8220;drop&#8221; or &#8220;cast away&#8221; is the idea. Driver finds another cognate meaning &#8220;rescue&#8221; (see <i>AJSL</i> 52 [1935/36]: 163).</p>
