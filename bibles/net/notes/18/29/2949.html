<A NAME="2949"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1810><b>tc</b> Most commentators think this last phrase is odd here, and so they either delete it altogether, or emend it to fit the idea of the verse. Ewald, however, thought it appropriate as a transition to the next section, reminding his friends that unlike him, they were miserable comforters. Herz made the few changes in the text to get the reading &#8220;where I led them, they were willing to go&#8221; (<i>ZAW</i> 20 [1900]: 163). The two key words in the MT are <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1489;&#1461;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; &#1497;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1495;&#1461;&#1501; </font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avelim yÿnakhem</font>, &#8220;he [one who] comforts mourners&#8221;). Following Herz, E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 422) has these changed to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1461;&#1501; &#1497;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ovilem yinnakhu</font>). R. Gordis has &#8220;like one leading a camel train&#8221; (<i>Job</i>, 324). But Kissane also retains the line as a summary of the chapter, noting its presence in the versions.</p>
