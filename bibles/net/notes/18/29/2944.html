<A NAME="2944"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1805><b>tn</b> The connection of this clause with the verse is difficult. The line simply reads: &#8220;[if] I would smile at them, they would not believe.&#8221; Obviously something has to be supplied to make sense out of this. The view adopted here makes the most sense, namely, that when he smiled at people, they could hardly believe their good fortune. Other interpretations are strained, such as Kissane&#8217;s, &#8220;If I laughed at them, they believed not,&#8221; meaning, people rejected the views that Job laughed at.</p>
