<A NAME="291"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1762><b>sn</b> Now that the debate with his friends is over, Job concludes with a soliloquy, just as he had begun with one. Here he does not take into account his friends or their arguments. The speech has three main sections: Job&#8217;s review of his former circumstances (29:1-25); Job&#8217;s present misery (30:1-31); and Job&#8217;s vindication of his life (31:1-40).</p>
