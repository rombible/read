<A NAME="2920"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1781><b>tn</b> The MT reads literally, &#8220;and the rock was poured out [passive participle] for me as streams of oil.&#8221; There are some who delete the word &#8220;rock&#8221; to shorten the line because it seems out of place. But olive trees thrive in rocky soil, and the oil presses are cut into the rock; it is possible that by metonymy all this is intended here (H. H. Rowley, <i>Job</i> [NCBC], 186).</p>
