<A NAME="255"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1643><b>sn</b> The line says that God &#8220;makes peace in his heights.&#8221; The &#8220;heights&#8221; are usually interpreted to mean the highest heaven. There may be a reference here to combat in the spiritual world between angels and Satan. The context will show that God has a heavenly host at his disposal, and nothing in heaven or on earth can shatter his peace. &#8220;Peace&#8221; here could also signify the whole order he establishes.</p>
