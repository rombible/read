<A NAME="403"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2326><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1465;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qalloti</font>) means &#8220;to be light; to be of small account; to be unimportant.&#8221; From this comes the meaning &#8220;contemptible,&#8221; which in the causative stem would mean &#8220;to treat with contempt; to curse.&#8221; Dhorme tries to make the sentence a conditional clause and suggests this meaning: &#8220;If I have been thoughtless.&#8221; There is really no &#8220;if&#8221; in Job&#8217;s mind.</p>
