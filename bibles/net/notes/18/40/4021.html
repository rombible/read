<A NAME="4021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2344><b>sn</b> The next ten verses are devoted to a portrayal of <i>Behemoth</i> (the name means &#8220;beast&#8221; in Hebrew). It does not fit any of the present material very well, and so many think the section is a later addition. Its style is more like that of a textbook. Moreover, if the animal is a real animal (the usual suggestion is the hippopotamus), then the location of such an animal is Egypt and not Palestine. Some have identified these creatures Behemoth and Leviathan as mythological creatures (Gunkel, Pope). Others point out that these creatures could have been dinosaurs (P. J. Maarten, <i>NIDOTTE</i>, 2:780; H. M. Morris, <i>The Remarkable Record of Job</i>, 115-22). Most would say they are real animals, but probably mythologized by the pagans. So the pagan reader would receive an additional impact from this point about God&#8217;s sovereignty over all nature.</p>
