<A NAME="402"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2325><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yissor</font>) is found only here, but comes from a common root meaning &#8220;to correct; to reprove.&#8221; Several suggestions have been made to improve on the MT. Dhorme read it <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yasur</font>) in the sense of &#8220;to turn aside; to yield.&#8221; Ehrlich read this emendation as &#8220;to come to an end.&#8221; But the MT could be read as &#8220;to correct; to instruct.&#8221;</p>
