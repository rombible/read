<A NAME="4025"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2348><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khafats</font>) occurs only here. It may have the meaning &#8220;to make stiff; to make taut&#8221; (Arabic). The LXX and the Syriac versions support this with &#8220;erects.&#8221; But there is another Arabic word that could be cognate, meaning &#8220;arch, bend.&#8221; This would give the idea of the tail swaying. The other reading seems to make better sense here. However, &#8220;stiff&#8221; presents a serious problem with the view that the animal is the hippopotamus.</p>
