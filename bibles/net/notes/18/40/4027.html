<A NAME="4027"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2350><b>tc</b> The literal reading of the MT is &#8220;let the one who made him draw near [with] his sword.&#8221; The sword is apparently a reference to the teeth or tusks of the animal, which cut vegetation like a sword. But the idea of a weapon is easier to see, and so the people who favor the mythological background see here a reference to God&#8217;s slaying the Beast. There are again many suggestions on how to read the line. The RV probably has the safest: &#8220;He that made him has furnished him with his sword&#8221; (the sword being a reference to the sharp tusks with which he can attack).</p>
