<A NAME="289"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1723><b>tc</b> The first part of this verse, &#8220;He cuts a shaft far from the place where people live,&#8221; has received a lot of attention. The word for &#8220;live&#8221; is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gar</font>). Some of the proposals are: &#8220;limestone,&#8221; on the basis of the LXX; &#8220;far from the light,&#8221; reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ner</font>); &#8220;by a foreign people,&#8221; taking the word to means &#8220;foreign people&#8221;; &#8220;a foreign people opening shafts&#8221;; or taking <i>gar</i> as &#8220;crater&#8221; based on Arabic. Driver puts this and the next together: &#8220;a strange people who have been forgotten cut shafts&#8221; (see <i>AJSL</i> 3 [1935]: 162). L. Waterman had &#8220;the people of the lamp&#8221; (&#8220;Note on Job 28:4,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 71 [1952]: 167ff). And there are others. Since there is really no compelling argument in favor of one of these alternative interpretations, the MT should be preserved until shown to be wrong.</p>
