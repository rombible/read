<A NAME="282"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1716><b>tn</b> The poem opens with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>). Some commentators think this should have been &#8220;for,&#8221; and that the poem once stood in another setting. But there are places in the Bible where this word occurs with the sense of &#8220;surely&#8221; and no other meaning (cf. Gen 18:20).</p>
