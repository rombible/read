<A NAME="2847"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1761><b>tc</b> Many commentators delete this verse because (1) many read the divine name Yahweh (translated &#8220;<sc>Lord&#8221;) here, and (2) it is not consistent with the argument that precedes it. But as H. H. Rowley (<i>Job</i> [NCBC], 185) points out, there is inconsistency in this reasoning, for many of the critics have already said that this chapter is an interpolation. Following that line of thought, then, one would not expect it to conform to the rest of the book in this matter of the divine name. And concerning the second difficulty, the point of this chapter is that wisdom is beyond human comprehension and control. It belongs to God alone. So the conclusion that the fear of the <sc>Lord is wisdom is the necessary conclusion. Rowley concludes: &#8220;It is a pity to rob the poem of its climax and turn it into the expression of unrelieved agnosticism.&#8221;</p>
