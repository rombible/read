<A NAME="2839"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1753><b>tn</b> The verb is the Piel perfect, meaning &#8220;to estimate the measure&#8221; of something. In the verse, the perfect verb continues the function of the infinitive preceding it, as if it had a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vav</font>) prefixed to it. Whatever usage that infinitive had, this verb is to continue it (see GKC 352 §114.<i>r</i>).</p>
