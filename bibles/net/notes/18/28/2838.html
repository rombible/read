<A NAME="2838"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1752><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he gave weight to the wind.&#8221; The form is the infinitive construct with the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lamed</font>) preposition. Some have emended it to change the preposition to the temporal <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet</font>) on the basis of some of the versions (e.g., Latin and Syriac) that have &#8220;who made.&#8221; This is workable, for the infinitive would then take on the finite tense of the previous verbs. An infinitive of purpose does not work well, for that would be saying God looked everywhere in order to give wind its proper weight (see R. Gordis, <i>Job</i>, 310).</p>
