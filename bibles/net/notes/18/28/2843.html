<A NAME="2843"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1757><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">safar</font>) in the Piel basically means &#8220;to tell; to declare; to show&#8221; or &#8220;to count; to number.&#8221; Many commentators offer different suggestions for the translation. &#8220;Declared&#8221; (as in the RSV, NASB, and NRSV) would be the simplest &#8211; but to whom did God declare it? Besides &#8220;appraised&#8221; which is the view of Pope, Dhorme and others (cf. NAB, NIV), J. Reider has suggested &#8220;probed&#8221; (&#8220;Etymological studies in biblical Hebrew,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 2 [1952]: 127), Strahan has &#8220;studied,&#8221; and Kissane has &#8220;reckoned.&#8221; The difficulty is that the line has a series of verbs, which seem to build to a climax; but without more details it is hard to know how to translate them when they have such a range of meaning.</p>
