<A NAME="2825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1739><b>sn</b> The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tÿhom</font>) is the &#8220;deep&#8221; of Gen 1:2, the abyss or primordial sea. It was always understood to be a place of darkness and danger. As remote as it is, it asserts that wisdom is not found there (personification). So here we have the abyss and the sea, then death and destruction &#8211; but they are not the places that wisdom resides.</p>
