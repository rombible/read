<A NAME="2845"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1759><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khaqar</font>) means &#8220;to examine; to search out.&#8221; Some of the language used here is anthropomorphic, for the sovereign <sc>Lord did not have to research or investigate wisdom. The point is that it is as if he did this human activity, meaning that as in the results of such a search God knows everything about wisdom.</p>
