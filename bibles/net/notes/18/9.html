<A NAME="91"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=648><b>sn</b> This speech of Job in response to Bildad falls into two large sections, chs. 9 and 10. In ch. 9 he argues that God&#8217;s power and majesty prevent him from establishing his integrity in his complaint to God. And in ch. 10 Job tries to discover in God&#8217;s plan the secret of his afflictions. The speech seems to continue what Job was saying to Eliphaz more than it addresses Bildad. See K. Fullerton, &#8220;On Job 9 and 10,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 53 (1934): 321-49.</p>
<A NAME="92"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=649><b>tn</b> The adverb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">omnam</font>, &#8220;in truth&#8221;) is characteristic of the Book of Job (12:2; 19:4; 34:12; 36:4). The friends make commonplace statements, general truths, and Job responds with &#8220;truly I know this is so.&#8221; Job knows as much about these themes as his friends do.</p>
<A NAME="93"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=650><b>sn</b> The interrogative is used to express what is an impossibility.</p>
<A NAME="94"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=651><b>tn</b> The attempt to define <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">enosh</font>) as &#8220;weak&#8221; or &#8220;mortal&#8221; man is not compelling. Such interpretations are based on etymological links without the clear support of usage (an issue discussed by J. Barr, <i>Comparative Philology and the Text of the Old Testament</i>). This seems to be a poetic word for &#8220;human&#8221; (the only nonpoetic use is in 2 Chr 14:10).</p>
<A NAME="95"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=652><b>tn</b> The preposition is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>, &#8220;with, before, in the presence of&#8221;). This is more specific than <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">min</font>) in 4:17.</p>
<A NAME="96"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=653><b>sn</b> The point of Job&#8217;s rhetorical question is that man cannot be justified as against God, because God is too powerful and too clever &#8211; he controls the universe. He is discussing now the question that Eliphaz raised in 4:17. Peake observes that Job is raising the question of whether something is right because God says it is right, or that God declares it right because it is right.</p>
<A NAME="97"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=654><b>tn</b> Some commentators take God to be the subject of this verb, but it is more likely that it refers to the mortal who tries to challenge God in a controversy. The verb is used of Job in 13:3.</p>
<A NAME="98"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=655><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">riv</font>) is a common one; it has the idea of &#8220;contention; dispute; legal dispute or controversy; go to law.&#8221; With the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>) the idea must be &#8220;to contend with&#8221; or &#8220;to dispute with.&#8221; The preposition reflects the prepositional phrase &#8220;with God&#8221; in v. 2, supporting the view that man is the subject.</p>
<A NAME="99"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=656><b>tn</b> This use of the imperfect as potential imperfect assumes that the human is the subject, that in a dispute with God he could not answer one of God&#8217;s questions (for which see the conclusion of the book when God questions Job). On the other hand, if the interpretation were that God does not answer the demands of mortals, then a simple progressive imperfect would be required. In support of this is the frustration of Job that God does not answer him.</p>
<A NAME="910"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=657><b>tn</b> The genitive phrase translated &#8220;in heart&#8221; would be a genitive of specification, specifying that the wisdom of God is in his intelligent decisions.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The <i>heart</i> is the seat of intelligence and understanding, the faculty of decision making. </p>
<A NAME="911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=658><b>sn</b> The words <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1509;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ammits</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">koakh</font>) are synonyms, the first meaning &#8220;sturdy; mighty; robust,&#8221; and the second &#8220;strength.&#8221; It too can be interpreted as a genitive of specification &#8211; God is mighty with respect to his power. But that comes close to expressing a superlative idea (like &#8220;song of songs&#8221; or &#8220;anger of his wrath&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=659><b>tn</b> The first half of the verse simply has &#8220;wise of heart and mighty of strength.&#8221; The entire line is a <i>casus pendens</i> that will refer to the suffix on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elayv</font>) in the second colon. So the question is &#8220;Who has resisted the one who is wise of heart and mighty of strength?&#8221; Again, the rhetorical question is affirming that no one has done this.</p>
<A NAME="913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=660><b>tn</b> The verb is the Hiphil of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qashah</font>, &#8220;to be hard&#8221;). It frequently is found with the word for &#8220;neck,&#8221; describing people as &#8220;stiff-necked,&#8221; i.e., stubborn, unbending. So the idea of resisting God fits well. The fact that this word occurs in Exodus with the idea of hardening the heart against God may indicate that there is an allusion to Pharaoh here.</p>
<A NAME="914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=661><b>tn</b> The use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1461;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shalem</font>) in the Qal is rare. It has been translated &#8220;remain safe&#8221; by E. Dhorme, &#8220;survived&#8221; by the NEB, &#8220;remained unscathed&#8221; by the NAB and NIV, or &#8220;succeeded&#8221; by KJV, G. R. Driver.</p>
<A NAME="915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=662><b>tn</b> The verb is plural: &#8220;they do not know it.&#8221; This suggests that the mountains would not know it. Some follow the Syriac with a singular verb, i.e., God does not know it, meaning, it is so trifling to God that he can do it without thinking. But the better interpretation may be &#8220;suddenly.&#8221; This would be interpreted from the MT as it stands; it would imply &#8220;before they know anything,&#8221; thus &#8220;suddenly&#8221; (Gray, Dhorme, Buttenwieser, et. al.). D. W. Thomas connects the meaning to another verb based on Arabic and translates it, &#8220; so that they are no longer still&#8221; (&#8220;Additional Notes on the Root <i>yada`</i> in Hebrew,&#8221; <i>JTS</i> 15 [1964]: 54-57). J. A. Emerton works with a possible root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yada</font>&#8217;) meaning &#8220;be still&#8221; (&#8220;A Consideration of Some Alleged Meanings of <i>yada`</i> in Hebrew,&#8221; <i>JSS</i> 15 [1970]: 145-80).</p>
<A NAME="916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=663><b>sn</b> This line beginning with the relative pronoun can either be read as a parallel description of God, or it can be subordinated by the relative pronoun to the first (&#8220;they do not know who overturned them&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="917"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=664><b>sn</b> <i>Shakes the earth out of its place</i> probably refers to earthquakes, although some commentators protest against this in view of the idea of the pillars. In the ancient world the poetical view of the earth is that it was a structure on pillars, with water around it and under it. In an earthquake the pillars were shaken, and the earth moved.</p>
<A NAME="918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=665><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1508;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1510;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hitfallats</font>) is found only here, but the root seems clearly to mean &#8220;to be tossed; to be thrown about,&#8221; and so in the Hitpael &#8220;quiver; shake; tremble.&#8221; One of the three nouns from this root is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pallatsut</font>), the &#8220;shudder&#8221; that comes with terror (see Job 21:6; Isa 21:4; Ezek 7:18; and Ps 55:6). </p>
<A NAME="919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=666><b>tn</b> The form could also be subordinated, &#8220;that it shine not&#8221; (see further GKC 323 §109.<i>g</i>).</p>
<A NAME="920"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=667><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zarakh</font>) means &#8220;rise.&#8221; This is the ordinary word for the sunrise. But here it probably has the idea of &#8220;shine; glisten,&#8221; which is also attested in Hebrew and Aramaic.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> There are various views on the meaning of this line in this verse. Some think it refers to some mysterious darkness like the judgment in Egypt (Exod 10:21-23), or to clouds building (3:5), often in accompaniment of earthquakes (see Joel 2:10, 3:15-16; Isa 13:10-13). It could also refer to an eclipse. All this assumes that the phenomenon here is limited to the morning or the day; but it could simply be saying that God controls light and darkness.</p>
<A NAME="921"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=668><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khatam</font>) with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ad</font>)<i> </i>before its complement, means &#8220;to seal; to wall up; to enclose.&#8221; This is a poetic way of saying that God prevents the stars from showing their light.</p>
<A NAME="922"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=669><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;marches forth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=670><b>tn</b> The reference is probably to the waves of the sea. This is the reading preserved in NIV and NAB, as well as by J. Crenshaw, &#8220;<i>W</i>ÿ<i>dorek `al-bamote </i>&#8216;<i>ares</i>,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 34 (1972): 39-53. But many see here a reference to Canaanite mythology. The marginal note in the RSV has &#8220;the back of the sea dragon.&#8221; The view would also see in &#8220;sea&#8221; the Ugaritic god <i>Yammu</i>.</p>
<A NAME="924"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=671><b>sn</b> The Hebrew has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ash</font>), although in 38:32 it is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ayish</font>). This has been suggested to be Aldebaran, a star in the constellation Taurus, but there have been many other suggestions put forward by the commentaries.</p>
<A NAME="925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=672><b>sn</b> There is more certainty for the understanding of this word as <i>Orion</i>, even though there is some overlap of the usage of the words in the Bible. In classical literature we have the same stereotypical reference to these three (see E. Dhorme, <i>Job</i>, 131). </p>
<A NAME="926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=673><b>sn</b> The identification of this as <i>the Pleiades</i> is accepted by most (the Vulgate has &#8220;Hyades&#8221;). In classical Greek mythology, the seven Pleiades were seven sisters of the Hyades who were pursued by Orion until they were changed into stars by Zeus. The Greek myth is probably derived from an older Semitic myth.</p>
<A NAME="927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=674><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the chambers of the south.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="928"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=675><b>tn</b> Only slight differences exist between this verse and 5:9 which employs the simple <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vav</font>) conjunction before <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eyn</font>) in the first colon and omits the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vav</font>) conjunction before <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nifla</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ot</font>, &#8220;wonderful things&#8221;) in the second colon.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> There is probably great irony in Job&#8217;s using this same verse as in 5:9. But Job&#8217;s meaning here is different than Eliphaz.</p>
<A NAME="929"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=676><b>tn</b> The NIV has &#8220;when&#8221; to form a temporal clause here. For the use of &#8220;if,&#8221; see GKC 497 §159.<i>w</i>.</p>
<A NAME="930"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=677><b>tn</b> The imperfect verbs in this verse are consistent with the clauses. In the conditional clauses a progressive imperfect is used, but in the following clauses the verbs are potential imperfects.</p>
<A NAME="931"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=678><b>tn</b> The pronoun &#8220;him&#8221; is supplied here; it is not in MT, but the Syriac and Vulgate have it (probably for translation purposes as well). </p>
<A NAME="932"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=679><b>sn</b> Like the mountains, Job knows that God has passed by and caused him to shake and tremble, but he cannot understand or perceive the reasons.</p>
<A NAME="933"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=680><b>tn</b> E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 133) surveys the usages and concludes that the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khataf</font>) normally describes the wicked actions of a man, especially by treachery or trickery against another. But a verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khataf</font>) is found nowhere else; a noun &#8220;robber&#8221; is found in Prov 23:28. Dhorme sees no reason to emend the text, because he concludes that the two verbs are synonymous. Job is saying that if God acts like a plunderer, there is no one who can challenge what he does.</p>
<A NAME="934"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=681><b>tn</b> The verb is the Hiphil imperfect (potential again) from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shuv</font>). In this stem it can mean &#8220;turn back, refute, repel&#8221; (BDB 999 s.v. Hiph.5).</p>
<A NAME="935"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=682><b>sn</b> The meaning of the line is that God&#8217;s anger will continue until it has accomplished its purpose (23:13-14).</p>
<A NAME="936"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=683><b>sn</b> &#8220;Rahab&#8221; is not to be confused with the harlot of the same name from Jericho. &#8220;Rahab&#8221; is identified with Tiamat of the Babylonian creation epic, or Leviathan of the Canaanite myths. It is also used in parallelism to the sea (26:12), or the Red Sea (Ps 74:13), and so comes to symbolize Egypt (Isa 30:7). In the Babylonian Creation Epic there is reference to the helpers of Tiamat. In the Bible the reference is only to the raging sea, which the <sc>Lord controlled at creation.</p>
<A NAME="937"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=684><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shakhakh</font>) means &#8220;to be prostrate&#8221; or &#8220;to crouch.&#8221; Here the enemies are prostrate under the feet of God &#8211; they are crushed.</p>
<A NAME="938"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=685><b>tn</b> The construction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1507; &#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1464;&#1504;&#1465;&#1499;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">af ki </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anokhi</font>) is an expression that means either &#8220;how much more&#8221; or &#8220;how much less.&#8221; Here it has to mean &#8220;how much less,&#8221; for if powerful forces like Rahab are crushed beneath God&#8217;s feet, how could Job contend with him?</p>
<A NAME="939"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=686><b>tn</b> The imperfect verb here is to be taken with the nuance of a potential imperfect. The idea of &#8220;answer him&#8221; has a legal context, i.e., answering God in a court of law. If God is relentless in his anger toward greater powers, then Job realizes it is futile for him.</p>
<A NAME="940"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=687><b>sn</b> In a legal controversy with God it would be essential to choose the correct words very carefully (humanly speaking); but the calmness and presence of mind to do that would be shattered by the overwhelming terror of God&#8217;s presence.</p>
<A NAME="941"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=688><b>tn</b> The verb is supplied in this line.</p>
<A NAME="942"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=689><b>tn</b> The preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>, &#8220;with&#8221;) carries the idea of &#8220;in contest with&#8221; in a number of passages (compare vv. 2, 3; 16:21).</p>
<A NAME="943"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=690><b>tn</b> The LXX goes a different way after changing the first person to the third: &#8220;Oh then that he would hearken to me, or judge my cause.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="944"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=691><b>tn</b> The line begins with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asher</font>, &#8220;which&#8221;), which is omitted in the LXX and the Syriac. The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>) can introduce a concessive clause (GKC 498 §160.<i>a</i>) or a conditional clause (GKC 495 §159.<i>n</i>). The idea here seems to be &#8220;even if I were&#8230;I could not&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="945"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=692><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1511;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsadaqti</font>, &#8220;I am right [or &#8220;righteous&#8221;]&#8221;). The term here must be forensic, meaning &#8220;in the right&#8221; or &#8220;innocent&#8221; (see 11:2; 13:18; 33:12; 40:8). Job is claiming to be in the right, but still has difficulty speaking to God.</p>
<A NAME="946"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=693><b>tn</b> The form is the Qal imperfect of the verb &#8220;answer.&#8221; As the text stands, Job is saying that he cannot answer or could not answer (contend with) God if given a chance. Some commentators think a Niphal fits better here: &#8220;I am not answered,&#8221; meaning God does not reply to him. This has the LXX, the Syriac, and Theodotion in support of it. The advantage would be to avoid the repetition of the same word from v. 14. But others rightly reject this, because all Job is saying here is that he would be too overwhelmed by God to answer him in court. The LXX change to a passive is understandable in that it would be seeking a different idea in this verse and without vocalization might have assumed a passive voice here.</p>
<A NAME="947"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=694><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">etkhannan</font>) is the Hitpael of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khanan</font>), meaning &#8220;seek favor,&#8221; make supplication,&#8221; or &#8220;plead for mercy.&#8221; The nuance would again be a modal nuance; if potential, then the translation would be &#8220;I could [only] plead for mercy.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="948"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=695><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1508;&#1456;&#1496;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿshofti</font>) appears to be simply &#8220;my judge.&#8221; But most modern interpretations take the <i>po&#8216;el</i> participle to mean &#8220;my adversary in a court of law.&#8221; Others argue that the form is at least functioning as a noun and means &#8220;judge&#8221; (see 8:5).

The expression can also be used for protection (see Ps 139:5). Job, however, has a problem in that the other party is God, who himself will be arbiter in judgment.</p>
<A NAME="9105"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">105</span><note=752><b>tn</b> The verse probably continues the description from the last verse, and so a relative pronoun may be supplied here as well.</p>
<A NAME="9106"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">106</span><note=753><b>tn</b> According to some, the reference of this suffix would be to God. The arbiter would remove the rod of God from Job. But others take it as a separate sentence with God removing his rod.</p>
<A NAME="9107"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">107</span><note=754><b>sn</b> The &#8220;rod&#8221; is a symbol of the power of God to decree whatever judgments and afflictions fall upon people. </p>
<A NAME="9108"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">108</span><note=755><b>tn</b> &#8220;His terror&#8221; is metonymical; it refers to the awesome majesty of God that overwhelms Job and causes him to be afraid.</p>
<A NAME="9109"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">109</span><note=756><b>tn</b> There is no conjunction with this cohortative; but the implication from the context is that if God&#8217;s rod were withdrawn, if the terror were removed, then Job would speak up without fear. </p>
<A NAME="9110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">110</span><note=757><b>tn</b> The last half of the verse is rather cryptic: &#8220;but not so I with me.&#8221; NIV renders it &#8220;but as it now stands with me, I cannot.&#8221; This is very smooth and interpretive. Others transpose the two halves of the verse to read, &#8220;Since it is not so, I with myself // will commune and not fear him.&#8221; Job would be saying that since he cannot contend with God on equal terms, and since there is no arbiter, he will come on his own terms. English versions have handled this differently: &#8220;for I know I am not what I am thought to be&#8221; (NEB); &#8220;since this is not the case with me&#8221; (NAB); &#8220;I do not see myself like that at all&#8221; (JB). </p>
