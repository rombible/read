<A NAME="41"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=235><b>sn</b> The speech of Eliphaz can be broken down into three main sections. In 4:1-11 he wonders that Job who had comforted so many people in trouble, and who was so pious, should fall into such despair, forgetting the great truth that the righteous never perish under affliction &#8211; calamity only destroys the wicked. Then in 4:12&#8211;5:7 Eliphaz tries to warn Job about complaining against God because only the ungodly resent the dealings of God and by their impatience bring down his wrath upon them. Finally in 5:8-27 Eliphaz appeals to Job to follow a different course, to seek after God, for God only smites to heal or to correct, to draw people to himself and away from evil. See K. Fullerton, &#8220;Double Entendre in the First Speech of Eliphaz,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 49 (1930): 320-74; J. C. L. Gibson, &#8220;Eliphaz the Temanite: A Portrait of a Hebrew Philosopher,&#8221; <i>SJT</i> 28 (1975): 259-72; and J. Lust, &#8220;A Stormy Vision: Some Remarks on Job 4:12-16,&#8221; <i>Bijdr</i> 36 (1975): 308-11.</p>
<A NAME="42"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=236><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;answered and said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="43"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=237><b>tn</b> The verb has no expressed subject, and so may be translated with &#8220;one&#8221; or &#8220;someone.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="44"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=238><b>tn</b> The Piel perfect is difficult here. It would normally be translated &#8220;has one tried (words with you)?&#8221; Most commentaries posit a conditional clause, however.</p>
<A NAME="45"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=239><b>tn</b> The verb means &#8220;to be weary.&#8221; But it can have the extended sense of being either exhausted or impatient (see v. 5). A. B. Davidson (<i>Job</i>, 29) takes it in the sense of &#8220;will it be too much for you?&#8221; There is nothing in the sentence that indicates this should be an interrogative clause; it is simply an imperfect. But in view of the juxtaposition of the first part, this seems to make good sense. E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 42) has &#8220;Shall we address you? You are dejected.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="46"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=240><b>tn</b> The construction uses a noun with the preposition: &#8220;and to refrain with words &#8211; who is able?&#8221; The Aramaic plural of &#8220;words&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">millin</font>) occurs 13 times in Job, with the Hebrew plural ten times. The commentaries show that Eliphaz&#8217;s speech had a distinctly Aramaic coloring to it.</p>
<A NAME="47"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=241><b>tn</b> The deictic particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>, &#8220;behold&#8221;) summons attention; it has the sense of &#8220;consider, look.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="48"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=242><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yasar</font>) in the Piel means &#8220;to correct,&#8221; whether by words with the sense of teach, or by chastening with the sense of punish, discipline. The double meaning of &#8220;teach&#8221; and &#8220;discipline&#8221; is also found with the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">musar</font>).</p>
<A NAME="49"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=243><b>tn</b> The parallelism again uses a perfect verb in the first colon and an imperfect in the second; but since the sense of the line is clearly what Job has done in the past, the second verb may be treated as a preterite, or a customary imperfect &#8211; what Job repeatedly did in the past (GKC 315 §107.<i>e</i>). The words in this verse may have double meanings. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yasar</font>, &#8220;teach, discipline&#8221;) may have the idea of instruction and correction, but also the connotation of strength (see Y. Hoffmann, &#8220;The Use of Equivocal Words in the First Speech of Eliphaz [Job IV&#8211;V],&#8221; <i>VT</i> 30 [1980]: 114-19).</p>
<A NAME="410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=244><b>tn</b> The &#8220;feeble hands&#8221; are literally &#8220;hands hanging down.&#8221; This is a sign of weakness, helplessness, or despondency (see 2 Sam 4:1; Isa 13:7).</p>
<A NAME="411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=245><b>tn</b> Both verbs in this line are imperfects, and probably carry the same nuance as the last verb in v. 3, namely, either customary imperfect or preterite. The customary has the aspect of stressing that this was what Job used to do.</p>
<A NAME="412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=246><b>tn</b> The form is the singular active participle, interpreted here collectively. The verb is used of knees that give way (Isa 35:3; Ps 109:24).</p>
<A NAME="413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=247><b>tn</b> The expression is often translated as &#8220;feeble knees,&#8221; but it literally says &#8220;the bowing [or &#8220;tottering&#8221;] knees.&#8221; The figure is one who may be under a heavy load whose knees begin to shake and buckle (see also Heb 12:12).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Job had been successful at helping others not be crushed by the weight of trouble and misfortune. It is easier to help others than to preserve a proper perspective when one&#8217;s self is afflicted (E. Dhorme, <i>Job</i>, 44).</p>
<A NAME="414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=248><b>tn</b> The sentence has no subject, but the context demands that the subject be the same kind of trouble that has come upon people that Job has helped.</p>
<A NAME="415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=249><b>tn</b> This is the same verb used in v. 2, meaning &#8220;to be exhausted&#8221; or &#8220;impatient.&#8221; Here with the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive the verb describes Job&#8217;s state of mind that is a consequence of the trouble coming on him. In this sentence the form is given a present tense translation (see GKC 329 §111.<i>t</i>).</p>
<A NAME="416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=250><b>tn</b> This final verb in the verse is vivid; it means &#8220;to terrify, dismay&#8221; (here the Niphal preterite). Job will go on to speak about all the terrors that come on him.</p>
<A NAME="417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=251><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yir</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>, &#8220;fear&#8221;) in this passage refers to Job&#8217;s fear of the <sc>Lord, his reverential devotion to God. H. H. Rowley (<i>Job</i> [NCBC], 46) says that on the lips of Eliphaz the word almost means &#8220;your religion.&#8221; He refers to Moffatt&#8217;s translation, &#8220;Let your religion reassure you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=252><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1505;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1514;&#1462;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kislatekha</font>, &#8220;your confidence&#8221;) is rendered in the LXX by &#8220;founded in folly.&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kesel</font>) is &#8220;confidence&#8221; (see 8:14) and elsewhere &#8220;folly.&#8221; Since it is parallel to &#8220;your hope&#8221; it must mean confidence here.</p>
<A NAME="419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=253><b>tn</b> This second half of the verse simply has &#8220;your hope and the integrity of your ways.&#8221; The expression &#8220;the perfection of your ways&#8221; is parallel to &#8220;your fear,&#8221; and &#8220;your hope&#8221; is parallel to &#8220;your confidence.&#8221; This sentence is an example of <i>casus pendens</i> or extraposition: &#8220;as for your hope, it is the integrity of your ways&#8221; (see GKC 458 §143.<i>d</i>).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Eliphaz is not being sarcastic to Job. He knows that Job is a God-fearing man who lives out his faith in life. But he also knows that Job should apply to himself the same things he tells others.</p>
<A NAME="420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=254><b>sn</b> Eliphaz will put his thesis forward first negatively and then positively (vv. 8ff). He will argue that the suffering of the righteous is disciplinary and not for their destruction. He next will argue that it is the wicked who deserve judgment.</p>
<A NAME="421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=255><b>tn</b> The use of the independent personal pronoun is emphatic, almost as an enclitic to emphasize interrogatives: &#8220;who indeed&#8230;.&#8221; (GKC 442 §136.<i>c</i>).</p>
<A NAME="422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=256><b>tn</b> The perfect verb in this line has the nuance of the past tense to express the unique past &#8211; the uniqueness of the action is expressed with &#8220;ever&#8221; (&#8220;who has ever perished&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=257><b>tn</b> The adjective is used here substantivally. Without the article the word stresses the meaning of &#8220;uprightness.&#8221; Job will use &#8220;innocent&#8221; and &#8220;upright&#8221; together in 17:8.</p>
<A NAME="424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=258><b>tn</b> The Niphal<i> </i>means &#8220;to be hidden&#8221; (see the Piel in 6:10; 15:18; and 27:11); the connotation here is &#8220;destroyed&#8221; or &#8220;annihilated.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=259><b>tn</b> The perfect verb here represents the indefinite past. It has no specific sighting in mind, but refers to each time he has seen the wicked do this.</p>
<A NAME="426"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=260><b>sn</b> The figure is an implied metaphor. Plowing suggests the idea of deliberately preparing (or cultivating) life for evil. This describes those who are fundamentally wicked.</p>
<A NAME="427"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=261><b>tn</b> The LXX renders this with a plural &#8220;barren places.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="428"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=262><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;reap it.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="429"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=263><b>tn</b> The LXX in the place of &#8220;breath&#8221; has &#8220;word&#8221; or &#8220;command,&#8221; probably to limit the anthropomorphism. The word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">minnishmat</font>) comprising <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">min</font>) + <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1514;</font> </i>(<font face="Scholar">nishmat</font>, the construct of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">nÿshamah</font>]): &#8220;from/at the breath of.&#8221; The &#8220;breath of God&#8221; occurs frequently in Scripture. In Gen 2:7 it imparts life; but here it destroys it. The figure probably does indicate a divine decree from God (e.g., &#8220;depart from me&#8221;) &#8211; so the LXX may have been simply interpreting.</p>
<A NAME="430"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=264><b>sn</b> The statement is saying that if some die by misfortune it is because divine retribution or anger has come upon them. This is not necessarily the case, as the NT declares (see Luke 13:1-5).</p>
<A NAME="431"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=265><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ruakh</font>) is now parallel to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nÿshamah</font>); both can mean &#8220;breath&#8221; or &#8220;wind.&#8221; To avoid using &#8220;breath&#8221; for both lines, &#8220;blast&#8221; has been employed here. The word is followed by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1508;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">afo</font>) which could be translated &#8220;his anger&#8221; or &#8220;his nostril.&#8221; If &#8220;nostril&#8221; is retained, then it is a very bold anthropomorphism to indicate the fuming wrath of God. It is close to the picture of the hot wind coming off the desert to scorch the plants (see Hos 13:15).</p>
<A NAME="432"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=266><b>tn</b> &#8220;There is&#8221; has been supplied to make a smoother translation out of the clauses.</p>
<A NAME="433"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=267><b>sn</b> Eliphaz takes up a new image here to make the point that the wicked are destroyed &#8211; the breaking up and scattering of a den of lions. There are several words for &#8220;lion&#8221; used in this section. D. J. A. Clines observes that it is probably impossible to distinguish them (<i>Job </i>[WBC], 109, 110, which records some bibliography of those who have tried to work on the etymologies and meanings). The first is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1497;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aryeh</font>) the generic term for &#8220;lion.&#8221; It is followed by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shakhal</font>) which, like <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1508;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kÿfir</font>), is a &#8220;young lion.&#8221; Some have thought that the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shakhal</font>) is a lion-like animal, perhaps a panther or leopard. KBL takes it by metathesis from Arabic &#8220;young one.&#8221; The LXX for this verse has &#8220;the strength of the lion, and the voice of the lioness and the exulting cry of serpents are quenched.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="434"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=268><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;voice.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="435"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=269><b>tn</b> The verb belongs to the subject &#8220;teeth&#8221; in this last colon; but it is used by zeugma (a figure of speech in which one word is made to refer to two or more other words, but has to be understood differently in the different contexts) of the three subjects (see H. H. Rowley, <i>Job</i> [NCBC], 46-47).</p>
<A NAME="436"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=270><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">layish</font>) traditionally rendered &#8220;strong lion,&#8221; occurs only here and in Prov 30:30 and Isa 30:6. It has cognates in several of the Semitic languages, and so seems to indicate lion as king of the beasts.</p>
<A NAME="437"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=271><b>tn</b> The form of the verb is the Qal active participle; it stresses the characteristic action of the verb as if a standard universal truth.</p>
<A NAME="438"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=272><b>tn</b> The text literally has &#8220;sons of the lioness.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="439"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=273><b>tn</b> The LXX of this verse offers special problems. It reads, &#8220;But if there had been any truth in your words, none of these evils would have fallen upon you; shall not my ear receive excellent [information] from him?&#8221; The major error involves a dittography from the word for &#8220;secret,&#8221; yielding &#8220;truth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="440"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=274><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ganav</font>) means &#8220;to steal.&#8221; The Pual form in this verse is probably to be taken as a preterite since it requires a past tense translation: &#8220;it was stolen for me&#8221; meaning it was brought to me stealthily (see 2 Sam 19:3).</p>
<A NAME="441"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=275><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;received.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="442"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=276><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1502;&#1462;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shemets</font>, &#8220;whisper&#8221;) is found only here and in Job 26:14. A cognate form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shimtsah</font>) is found in Exod 32:25 with the sense of &#8220;a whisper.&#8221; In postbiblical Hebrew the word comes to mean &#8220;a little.&#8221; The point is that Eliphaz caught just a bit, just a whisper of it, and will recount it to Job.</p>
<A NAME="443"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=277><b>tn</b> Here too the word is rare. The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1506;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ippim</font>, &#8220;disquietings&#8221;) occurs only here and in 20:2. The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sar</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">appim</font>, &#8220;disquieting thoughts&#8221;), possibly related by dissimilation, occurs in Pss 94:19 and 139:23. There seems to be a connection with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1456;&#1506;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ippim</font>) in 1 Kgs 18:21 with the meaning &#8220;divided opinion&#8221;; this is related to the idea of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1456;&#1506;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ippah</font>, &#8220;bough&#8221;). H. H. Rowley (<i>Job</i> [NCBC], 47) concludes that the point is that like branches the thoughts lead off into different and bewildering places. E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 50) links the word to an Arabic root (&#8220;to be passionately smitten&#8221;) for the idea of &#8220;intimate thoughts.&#8221; The idea here and in Ps 139 has more to do with anxious, troubling, disquieting thoughts, as in a nightmare.</p>
<A NAME="444"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=278><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;visions&#8221; of the night.</p>
<A NAME="445"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=279><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1461;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tardemah</font>) is a &#8220;deep sleep.&#8221; It is used in the creation account when the <sc>Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam; and it is used in the story of Jonah when the prophet was asleep during the storm. The LXX interprets it to mean &#8220;fear,&#8221; rendering the whole verse &#8220;but terror falls upon men with dread and a sound in the night.&#8221;</p>

The cognate verb intensifies and applies the meaning of the noun. BDB 808 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1491;</font> Hiph translates it &#8220;fill my bones with dread.&#8221; In that sense &#8220;bones&#8221; would have to be a metonymy of subject representing the framework of the body, so that the meaning is that his whole being was filled with trembling.</p>

The commentators are divided on whether this is an apparition, a spirit, or a breath. The word can be used in either the masculine or the feminine, and so the gender of the verb does not favor the meaning &#8220;spirit.&#8221; In fact, in Isa 21:1 the same verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khalaf</font>, &#8220;pass on, through&#8221;) is used with the subject being a strong wind or hurricane &#8220;blowing across.&#8221; It may be that such a wind has caused Eliphaz&#8217;s hair to stand on end here. D. J. A. Clines (<i>Job </i>[WBC], 111) also concludes it means &#8220;wind,&#8221; noting that in Job a spirit or spirits would be called <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1456;&#1508;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rÿfa</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>), <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font></i> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohim</font>) or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ov</font>).</p>

Joined with the true object of the verb, &#8220;voice,&#8221; it probably means something like stillness or murmuring or whispering here. It is joined to &#8220;voice&#8221; with a conjunction, indicating that it is a hendiadys, &#8220;murmur and a voice&#8221; or a &#8220;murmuring voice.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="454"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=288><b>tn</b> The imperfect verbs in this verse express obvious truths known at all times (GKC 315 §107.<i>f</i>).</p>

This is paralleled with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gever</font>), a word that would stress more of the strength or might of man. The verse is not making a great contrast between the two, but it is rhetorical question merely stating that no human being of any kind is righteous or pure before God the Creator. See H. Kosmala, &#8220;The Term <i>geber</i> in the OT and in the Scrolls,&#8221; VTSup 17 (1969): 159-69; and E. Jacob, <i>Theology of the Old Testament</i>, 156-57.</p>
<A NAME="456"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=290><b>tn</b> The imperfect verb in this interrogative sentence could also be interpreted with a potential nuance: &#8220;Can a man be righteous?&#8221;</p>

The idea of someone being more righteous than God is too strong to be reasonable. Job will not do that &#8211; but he will imply that God is unjust. In addition, Eliphaz had this vision before hearing of Job&#8217;s trouble and so is not addressing the idea that Job is making himself more righteous than God. He is stating that no man is righteous before God. Verses 18-21 will show that no one can claim righteousness before God. In 9:2 and 25:4 the preposition &#8220;with&#8221; is used. See also Jer 51:5 where the preposition should be rendered &#8220;before&#8221; [the Holy One].</p>

<A NAME="463"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=297><b>sn</b> The servants here must be angels in view of the parallelism.

It seems to mean &#8220;error; folly.&#8221; The word is translated &#8220;perverseness&#8221; in the LXX; but Symmachus connects it with the word for &#8220;madness.&#8221; &#8220;Some commentators have repointed the word to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tÿhillah</font>, &#8220;praise&#8221;) making the line read: &#8220;he finds no [cause for] praise in his angels.&#8221; Others suggest <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tiflah</font>, &#8220;offensiveness, silliness&#8221;) a bigger change; this matches the idiom in Job 24:12. But if the etymology of the word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">halal</font>, &#8220;to be mad&#8221;) then that change is not necessary. The feminine noun &#8220;madness&#8221; still leaves the meaning of the line a little uncertain: &#8220;[if] he does not impute madness to his angels.&#8221; The point of the verse is that God finds flaws in his angels and does not put his trust in them.</p>
<A NAME="466"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=300><b>sn</b> <i>Those who live in houses of clay</i> are human beings, for the human body was made of clay (Job 10:9; 33:6; and Isa 64:7). In 2 Cor 4:7 the body is an &#8220;earthen vessel&#8221; &#8211; a clay pot. The verse continues the analogy: houses have foundations, and the house of clay is founded on dust, and will return to dust (Gen 3:19; Ps 103:14). The reasoning is that if God finds defects in angels, he will surely find them in humans who are inferior to the angels because they are but dust. In fact, they are easily crushed like the moth.</p>
<A NAME="467"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=301><b>tn</b> The imperfect verb is in the plural, suggesting &#8220;they crush.&#8221; But since there is no subject expressed, the verb may be given an impersonal subject, or more simply, treated as a passive (see GKC 460 §144.<i>g</i>).</p>
<A NAME="468"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=302><b>tn</b> The prepositional compound <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lifne</font>) normally has the sense of &#8220;before,&#8221; but it has been used already in 3:24 in the sense of &#8220;like.&#8221; That is the most natural meaning of this line. Otherwise, the interpretation must offer some explanation of a comparison between how quickly a moth and a human can be crushed. There are suggestions for different readings here; see for example G. R. Driver, &#8220;Linguistic and Textual Problems: Jeremiah,&#8221; <i>JQR</i> 28 (1937/38): 97-129 for a change to &#8220;bird&#8217;s nest&#8221;; and J. A.

One suggested emendation does have the LXX in its favor, namely, a reading of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1506;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">moshia</font>&#8217;, &#8220;one who saves&#8221;) in place of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mesim</font>, &#8220;one who sets&#8221;).

This would indicate that their life was compared to a tent &#8211; perfectly reasonable in a passage that has already used the image &#8220;houses of clay.&#8221; The difficulty is that the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nasa</font>&#8217;) means more properly &#8220;to tear up; to uproot.&#8221; and not &#8220;to cut off.&#8221; A similar idea is found in Isa 38:12, but there the image is explicitly that of cutting the life off from the loom. Some have posited that the original must have said their tent peg was pulled up&#8221; as in Isa 33:20 (A. B. Davidson, <i>Job</i>, 34; cf. NAB). But perhaps the idea of &#8220;what remains&#8221; would be easier to defend here. Besides, it is used in 22:20. The wealth of an individual is what has been acquired and usually is left over when he dies. Here it would mean that the superfluous wealth would be snatched away. The preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet</font>) would carry the meaning &#8220;from&#8221; with this verb.</p>
