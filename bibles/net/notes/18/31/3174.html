<A NAME="3174"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=1947><b>sn</b> Some commentators have suggested that the meaning behind this is that Job might not have kept the year of release (Deut 15:1), and the law against mixing seed (Lev 19:19). But the context will make clear that the case considered is obtaining the land without paying for it and causing the death of its lawful owner (see H. H. Rowley, <i>Job</i> [NCBC], 206). Similar to this would be the case of Naboth&#8217;s vineyard.</p>
