<A NAME="3146"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1919><b>sn</b> The law required people to help their enemies if they could (Exod 23:4; also Prov 20:22). But often in the difficulties that ensued, they did exult over their enemies&#8217; misfortune (Pss 54:7; 59:10 [11], etc.). But Job lived on a level of purity that few ever reach. Duhm said, &#8220;If chapter 31 is the crown of all ethical developments of the O.T., verse 29 is the jewel in that crown.&#8221;</p>
