<A NAME="3131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1904><b>tn</b> The MT has simply &#8220;if his loins did not bless me.&#8221; In the conditional clause this is another protasis. It means, &#8220;if I saw someone dying and if he did not thank me for clothing them.&#8221; It is Job&#8217;s way of saying that whenever he saw a need he met it, and he received his share of thanks &#8211; which prove his kindness. G. R. Driver has it &#8220;without his loins having blessed me,&#8221; taking &#8220;If&#8230;not&#8221; as an Aramaism, meaning &#8220;except&#8221; (<i>AJSL</i> 52 [1935/36]: 164f.).</p>
