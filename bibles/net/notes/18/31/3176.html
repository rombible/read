<A NAME="3176"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">76</span><note=1949><b>tc</b> The versions have the verb &#8220;grieved&#8221; here. The Hebrew verb means &#8220;to breathe,&#8221; but the form is Hiphil. This verb in that stem could mean something of a contemptuous gesture, like &#8220;sniff&#8221; in Mal 1:13. But with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>) in Job 11:20 it means &#8220;to cause death,&#8221; i.e., &#8220;to cause to breathe out; to expire.&#8221;<i> </i>This is likely the meaning here, although it is possible that it only meant &#8220;to cause suffering&#8221; to the people.</p>
