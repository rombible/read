<A NAME="3167"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=1940><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;here is my &#8216;<font face="Scholar">tav</font>&#8217;&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1461;&#1503; &#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hen tavi</font>). The letter <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tav</font>) is the last letter of the alphabet in Hebrew. In paleo-Hebrew the letter was in the form of a cross or an &#8220;X,&#8221; and so used for one making a mark or a signature. In this case Job has signed his statement and delivered it to the court &#8211; but he has yet to be charged. Kissane thought that this being the last letter of the alphabet, Job was saying, &#8220;This is my last word.&#8221; Others take the word to mean &#8220;desire&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;this is my desire, that God would answer me&#8221; (see E. F. Sutcliffe, &#8220;Notes on Job, textual and exegetical,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 30 [1949]: 71-72; G. R. Driver, <i>AJSL</i> 3 [1935/36]: 166; P. P. Saydon, &#8220;Philological and Textual Notes to the Maltese Translation of the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 23 [1961]: 252). R. Gordis (<i>Job</i>, 355) also argues strongly for this view.</p>
