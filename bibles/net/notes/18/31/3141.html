<A NAME="3141"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1914><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and my hand kissed my mouth.&#8221; The idea should be that of &#8220;my mouth kissed my hand.&#8221; H. H. Rowley suggests that the hand was important in waving or throwing the kisses of homage to the sun and the moon, and so it receives the focus. This is the only place in the OT that refers to such a custom. Outside the Bible it was known, however.</p>
