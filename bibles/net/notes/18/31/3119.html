<A NAME="3119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1892><b>tc</b> Some have deleted this verse as being short and irrelevant, not to mention problematic. But the difficulties are not insurmountable, and there is no reason to delete it. There is a <i>Kethib</i>-<i>Qere</i> reading in each half verse; in the first the <i>Kethib</i> is masculine for the subject but the <i>Qere</i> is feminine going with &#8220;shameless deed.&#8221; In the second colon the <i>Kethib</i> is the feminine agreeing with the preceding noun, but the <i>Qere</i> is masculine agreeing with &#8220;iniquity.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503; &#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avon pÿlilim</font>) means &#8220;an iniquity of the judges.&#8221; The first word is not spelled as a construct noun, and so this has led some to treat the second word as an adjective (with enclitic <font face="Scholar">mem</font> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1501;</font>]). The sense is similar in either case, for the adjective occurs in Job 31:28 meaning &#8220;calling for judgment&#8221; (See GKC 427 §131.<i>s</i>).</p>
