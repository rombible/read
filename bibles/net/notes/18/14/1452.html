<A NAME="1452"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=1055><b>tn</b> This verb was used in Job 13:4 for &#8220;plasterers of lies.&#8221; The idea is probably that God coats or paints over the sins so that they are forgotten (see Isa 1:18). A. B. Davidson (<i>Job</i>, 105) suggests that the sins are preserved until full punishment is exacted. But the verse still seems to be continuing the thought of how the sins would be forgotten in the next life.</p>
