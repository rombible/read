<A NAME="1438"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1041><b>tc</b> The LXX removes the interrogative and makes the statement affirmative, i.e., that man will live again. This reading is taken by D. H. Gard (&#8220;The Concept of the Future Life according to the Greek Translator of the Book of Job,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 73 [1954]: 137-38). D. J. A. Clines follows this, putting both of the expressions in the wish clause: &#8220;if a man dies and could live again&#8230;&#8221; (<i>Job </i>[WBC], 332). If that is the way it is translated, then the verbs in the second half of the verse and in the next verse would all be part of the apodosis, and should be translated &#8220;would.&#8221; The interpretation would not greatly differ; it would be saying that if there was life after death, Job would long for his release &#8211; his death. If the traditional view is taken and the question was raised whether there was life after death (the implication of the question being that there is), then Job would still be longing for his death. The point the line is making is that if there is life after death, that would be all the more reason for Job to eagerly expect, to hope for, his death.</p>
