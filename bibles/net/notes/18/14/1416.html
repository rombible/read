<A NAME="1416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1019><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khadal</font>) means &#8220;to desist; to cease.&#8221; The verb would mean here &#8220;and let him desist,&#8221; which some take to mean &#8220;and let him rest.&#8221; But since this is rather difficult in the line, commentators have suggested other meanings. Several emend the text slightly to make it an imperative rather than an imperfect; this is then translated &#8220;and desist.&#8221; The expression &#8220;from him&#8221; must be added. Another suggestion that is far-fetched is that of P. J. Calderone (&#8220;CHDL-II in poetic texts,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 23 [1961]: 451-60) and D. W. Thomas (VTSup 4 [1957]: 8-16), having a new meaning of &#8220;be fat.&#8221;</p>
