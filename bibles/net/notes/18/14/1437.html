<A NAME="1437"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1040><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zakhar</font>) means more than simply &#8220;to remember.&#8221; In many cases, including this one, it means &#8220;to act on what is remembered,&#8221; i.e., deliver or rescue (see Gen 8:1, &#8220;and God remembered Noah&#8221;). In this sense, a prayer &#8220;remember me&#8221; is a prayer for God to act upon his covenant promises.</p>
