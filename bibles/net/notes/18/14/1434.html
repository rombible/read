<A NAME="1434"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1037><b>sn</b> <i>Sheol</i> in the Bible refers to the place where the dead go. But it can have different categories of meaning: death in general, the grave, or the realm of the departed spirits [hell]. A. Heidel shows that in the Bible when hell is in view the righteous are not there &#8211; it is the realm of the departed spirits of the wicked. When the righteous go to Sheol, the meaning is usually the grave or death. See chapter 3 in A. Heidel, <i>The Gilgamesh Epic and the Old Testament Parallels</i>.</p>
