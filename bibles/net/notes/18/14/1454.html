<A NAME="1454"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1057><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yibbol</font>) usually refers to a flower fading and so seems strange here. The LXX and the Syriac translate &#8220;and will fall&#8221;; most commentators accept this and repoint the preceding word to get &#8220;and will surely fall.&#8221; Duhm retains the MT and applies the image of the flower to the falling mountain. The verb is used of the earth in Isa 24:4, and so NIV, RSV, and NJPS all have the idea of &#8220;crumble away.&#8221;</p>
