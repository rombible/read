<A NAME="1413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1016><b>tn</b> The passive participle is from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kharats</font>), which means &#8220;determined.&#8221; The word literally means &#8220;cut&#8221; (Lev 22:22, &#8220;mutilated&#8221;). E. Dhorme, (<i>Job</i>, 197) takes it to mean &#8220;engraved&#8221; as on stone; from a custom of inscribing decrees on tablets of stone he derives the meaning here of &#8220;decreed.&#8221; This, he argues, is parallel to the way <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khaqaq</font>, &#8220;engrave&#8221;) is used. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khoq</font>) is an &#8220;ordinance&#8221; or &#8220;statute&#8221;; the idea is connected to the verb &#8220;to engrave.&#8221; The LXX has &#8220;if his life should be but one day on the earth, and his months are numbered by him, you have appointed him for a time and he shall by no means exceed it.&#8221;</p>
