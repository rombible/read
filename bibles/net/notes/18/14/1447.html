<A NAME="1447"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1050><b>tn</b> If v. 16a continues the previous series, the translation here would be &#8220;then&#8221; (as in RSV). Others take it as a new beginning to express God&#8217;s present watch over Job, and interpret the second half of the verse as a question, or emend it to say God does not pass over his sins.</p>
