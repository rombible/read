<A NAME="61"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=405><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;answered and said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="62"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=406><b>tn</b> The conjunction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lu</font>, &#8220;if, if only&#8221;) introduces the wish &#8211; an unrealizable wish &#8211; with the Niphal imperfect.</p>
<A NAME="63"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=407><b>tn</b> Job pairs <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1505;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ka</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">si</font>, &#8220;my grief&#8221;) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hayyati</font>, &#8220;my misfortune&#8221;). The first word, used in Job 4:2, refers to Job&#8217;s whole demeanor that he shows his friends &#8211; the impatient and vexed expression of his grief. The second word expresses his misfortune, the cause of his grief. Job wants these placed together in the balances so that his friends could see the misfortune is greater than the grief. The word for &#8220;misfortune&#8221; is a <i>Kethib</i>-<i>Qere </i>reading. The two words have essentially the same meaning; they derive from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1493;&#1463;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">havah</font>, &#8220;to fall&#8221;) and so mean a misfortune.</p>
<A NAME="64"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=408><b>tn</b> The Qal infinitive absolute is here used to intensify the Niphal imperfect (see GKC 344-45 §113.<i>w</i>). The infinitive absolute intensifies the wish as well as the idea of weighing.</p>
<A NAME="65"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=409><b>tn</b> The third person plural verb is used here; it expresses an indefinite subject and is treated as a passive (see GKC 460 §144.<i>g</i>).</p>
<A NAME="66"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=410><b>tn</b> The adverb normally means &#8220;together,&#8221; but it can also mean &#8220;similarly, too.&#8221; In this verse it may not mean that the two things are to be weighed together, but that the <i>whole</i> calamity should be put on the scales (see A. B. Davidson, <i>Job</i>, 43).</p>
<A NAME="67"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=411><b>tn</b> E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 76) notes that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">attah</font>) has no more force than &#8220;but&#8221;; and that the construction is the same as in 17:4; 20:19-21; 23:14-15. The initial clause is causative, and the second half of the verse gives the consequence (&#8220;because&#8221;&#8230;&#8220;that is why&#8221;). Others take 3a as the apodosis of v. 2, and translate it &#8220;for now it would be heavier&#8230;&#8221; (see A. B. Davidson, <i>Job</i>, 43).</p>
<A NAME="68"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=412><b>sn</b> The point of the comparison with <i>the sand of the sea</i> is that the sand is immeasurable. So the grief of Job cannot be measured.</p>
<A NAME="69"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=413><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">la</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">u</font>) is traced by E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 76) to a root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">la</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>),<i> </i>cognate to an Arabic root meaning &#8220;to chatter.&#8221; He shows how modern Hebrew has a meaning for the word &#8220;to stammer out.&#8221; But that does not really fit Job&#8217;s outbursts. The idea in the context is rather that of speaking wildly, rashly, or charged with grief. This would trace the word to a hollow or geminate word and link it to Arabic &#8220;talk wildly&#8221; (see D. J. A. Clines, <i>Job </i>[WBC], 158). In the older works the verb was taken from a geminate root meaning &#8220;to suck&#8221; or &#8220;to swallow&#8221; (cf. KJV), but that yields a very difficult sense to the line.</p>
<A NAME="610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=414><b>sn</b> Job uses an implied comparison here to describe his misfortune &#8211; it is as if God had shot poisoned arrows into him (see E. Dhorme, <i>Job</i>, 76-77 for a treatment of poisoned arrows in the ancient world).</p>
<A NAME="611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=415><b>sn</b> Job here clearly states that his problems have come from the Almighty, which is what Eliphaz said. But whereas Eliphaz said Job provoked the trouble by his sin, Job is perplexed because he does not think he did.</p>
<A NAME="612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=416><b>tn</b> Most commentators take &#8220;my spirit&#8221; as the subject of the participle &#8220;drinks&#8221; (except the NEB, which follows the older versions to say that the poison &#8220;drinks up [or &#8220;soaks in&#8221;] the spirit.&#8221;) The image of the poisoned arrow represents the calamity or misfortune from God, which is taken in by Job&#8217;s spirit and enervates him.</p>
<A NAME="613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=417><b>tn</b> The LXX translators knew that a liquid should be used with the verb &#8220;drink&#8221;; but they took the line to be &#8220;whose violence drinks up my blood.&#8221; For the rest of the verse they came up with, &#8220;whenever I am going to speak they pierce me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=418><b>tn</b> The word translated &#8220;sudden terrors&#8221; is found only here and in Ps 88:16 [17]. G. R. Driver notes that the idea of suddenness is present in the root, and so renders this word as &#8220;sudden assaults&#8221; (&#8220;Problems in the Hebrew text of Job,&#8221; VTSup 3 [1955]: 73).</p>
<A NAME="615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=419><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arakh</font>) means &#8220;to set in battle array.&#8221; The suffix on the verb is dative (see GKC 369 §117.<i>x</i>). Many suggestions have been made for changing this word. These seem unnecessary since the MT pointing yields a good meaning: but for the references to these suggestions, see D. J. A. Clines, <i>Job </i>(WBC), 158. H. H. Rowley (<i>Job</i> [NCBC], 59), nonetheless, follows the suggestion of Driver that connects it to a root meaning &#8220;wear me down.&#8221; This change of meaning requires no change in the Hebrew text. The image is of a beleaguering army; the host is made up of all the terrors from God. The reference is to the terrifying and perplexing thoughts that assail Job (A. B. Davidson, <i>Job</i>, 44).</p>
<A NAME="616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=420><b>tn</b> There have been suggestions to identify this animal as something other than a wild donkey, but the traditional interpretation has been confirmed (see P. Humbert, &#8220;En marge du dictionnaire hébraïque,&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 62 [1950]: 199-207).</p>
<A NAME="617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=421><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nahaq</font>, &#8220;bray&#8221;) occurs in Arabic and Aramaic and only in Job 30:7 in Hebrew, where it refers to unfortunate people in the wilderness who utter cries like the hungry wild donkey.</p>
<A NAME="618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=422><b>sn</b> In this brief section Job indicates that it would be wiser to seek the reason for the crying than to complain of the cry. The wild donkey will bray when it finds no food (see Jer 14:6).</p>
<A NAME="619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=423><b>tn</b> The construction forms a double question (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font>...<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1458;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ha</font>&#8230;&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>) but not to express mutually exclusive questions in this instance. Instead, it is used to repeat the same question in different words (see GKC 475 §150.<i>h</i>).</p>
<A NAME="620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=424><b>tc</b> The LXX captures the meaning of the verse, but renders it in a more expansive way.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> This word occurs here and in Isa 30:24. In contrast to the grass that grows on the fields for the wild donkey, this is fodder prepared for the domesticated animals.</p>
<A NAME="621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=425><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a tasteless thing&#8221;; the word &#8220;food&#8221; is supplied from the context.</p>
<A NAME="622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=426><b>tn</b> Some commentators are not satisfied with the translation &#8220;white of an egg&#8221;; they prefer something connected to &#8220;slime of purslane&#8221; (H. H. Rowley, <i>Job</i> [NCBC], 59; cf. NRSV &#8220;juice of mallows&#8221;). This meaning is based on the Syriac and Arabic version of Sa`adia. The meaning &#8220;white of the egg&#8221; comes from the rabbinic interpretation of &#8220;slime of the yolk.&#8221; Others carry the idea further and interpret it to mean &#8220;saliva of dreams&#8221; or after the LXX &#8220;in dream words.&#8221; H. H. Rowley does not think that the exact edible object can be identified. The idea of the slimy glaring white around the yolk of an egg seems to fit best. This is another illustration of something that is tasteless or insipid.</p>
<A NAME="623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=427><b>tn</b> The traditional rendering of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nafshi</font>) is &#8220;my soul.&#8221; But since <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>) means the whole person, body and soul, it is best to translate it with its suffix simply as an emphatic pronoun.</p>
<A NAME="624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=428><b>tn</b> For the explanation of the perfect verb with its completed action in the past and its remaining effects, see GKC 311 §106.<i>g</i>.</p>
<A NAME="625"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=429><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;such things&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text but has been supplied.</p>
<A NAME="626"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=430><b>tn</b> The second colon of the verse is difficult. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1493;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dÿve</font>) means &#8220;sickness of&#8221; and yields a meaning &#8220;like the sickness of my food.&#8221; This could take the derived sense of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">davah</font>) and mean &#8220;impure&#8221; or &#8220;corrupt&#8221; food. The LXX has &#8220;for I loathe my food as the smell of a lion&#8221; and so some commentators emend &#8220;they&#8221; (which has no clear antecedent) to mean &#8220;I loathe it [like the sickness of my food].&#8221; Others have more freely emended the text to &#8220;my palate loathes my food&#8221; (McNeile) or &#8220;my bowels resound with suffering&#8221; (I. Eitan, &#8220;An unknown meaning of <font face="Scholar">RAHAMIÝM</font>,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 53 [1934]: 271). Pope has &#8220;they are putrid as my flesh [= my meat].&#8221; D. J. A. Clines (<i>Job </i>[WBC], 159) prefers the suggestion in <i>BHS</i>, &#8220;it [my soul] loathes them as my food.&#8221; E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 80) repoints the second word of the colon to get <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1465;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kÿvodi</font>, &#8220;my glory&#8221;): &#8220;my heart [glory] loathes/is sickened by my bread.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="627"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=431><b>tn</b> The Hebrew expresses the desire (desiderative clause) with &#8220;who will give?&#8221; (see GKC 477 §151.<i>d</i>).</p>
<A NAME="628"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=432><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bo</font>&#8217;, &#8220;go&#8221;) has the sense of &#8220;to be realized; to come to pass; to be fulfilled.&#8221; The optative &#8220;Who will give [that] my request be realized?&#8221; is &#8220;O that my request would be realized.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="629"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=433><b>tn</b> The text has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1493;&#1464;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tiqvati</font>, &#8220;hope&#8221;). There is no reason to change the text to &#8220;my desire&#8221; (as Driver and others do) if the word is interpreted metonymically &#8211; it means &#8220;what I hope for.&#8221; What Job hopes for and asks for is death.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> See further W. Riggans, &#8220;Job 6:8-10: Short Comments,&#8221; <i>ExpTim</i> 99 (1987): 45-46.</p>
<A NAME="630"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=434><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) in the Hiphil means &#8220;to be willing, to consent, to decide.&#8221; It is here the jussive followed by the dependent verb with a (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) <font face="Scholar">vav</font>: &#8220;that God would be willing and would crush me&#8221; means &#8220;to crush me.&#8221; Gesenius, however, says that the conjunction introduces coordination rather than subordination; he says the principal idea is introduced in the second verb, the first verb containing the definition of the manner of the action (see GKC 386 §120.<i>d</i>).</p>
<A NAME="631"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=435><b>tn</b> The verb is used for loosening shoe straps in Isa 58:6, and of setting prisoners free in Pss 105:20 and 146:7. Job thinks that God&#8217;s hand has been restrained for some reason, and so desires that God be free to destroy him.</p>
<A NAME="632"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=436><b>tn</b> The final verb is an imperfect (or jussive) following the jussive (of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">natar</font>); it thus expresses the result (&#8220;and then&#8221; or &#8220;so that&#8221;) or the purpose (&#8220;in order that&#8221;). Job longs for death, but it must come from God.</p>
<A NAME="633"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=437><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and cut me off.&#8221; The LXX reads this verse as &#8220;Let the Lord begin and wound me, but let him not utterly destroy me.&#8221; E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 81) says the LXX is a paraphrase based on a pun with &#8220;free hand.&#8221; Targum Job has, &#8220;God has begun to make me poor; may he free his hand and make me rich,&#8221; apparently basing the reading on a metaphorical interpretation.</p>
<A NAME="634"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=438><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and it will/may be yet my comfort.&#8221; The comfort or consolation that he seeks, that he wishes for, is death. The next colon in the verse simply intensifies this thought, for he affirms if that should happen he would rejoice, in spite of what death involves. The LXX, apparently confusing letters (reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ir</font>, &#8220;city&#8221;] instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">od</font>, &#8220;yet&#8221;], which then led to the mistake in the next colon, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1461;&#1497;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">khelah</font>, &#8220;its wall&#8221;] for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">khilah</font>, &#8220;suffering&#8221;]), has &#8220;Let the grave be my city, upon the walls of which I have leaped.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="635"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=439><b>tn</b> In the apodosis of conditional clauses (which must be supplied from the context preceding), the cohortative expresses the consequence (see GKC 320 §108.<i>d</i>).</p>
<A NAME="636"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=440><b>tn</b> The Piel verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">silled</font>) is a <i>hapax legomenon</i>. BDB 698 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1491;</font> gives the meaning &#8220;to spring [i.e., jump] for joy,&#8221; which would certainly fit the passage. Others have emended the text, but unnecessarily. The LXX &#8220;I jumped&#8221; and Targum Job&#8217;s &#8220;exult&#8221; support the sense in the dictionaries, although the jumping is for joy and not over a wall (as the LXX has). D. J. A. Clines (<i>Job </i>[WBC], 159) follows Driver in thinking this is untenable, choosing a meaning &#8220;recoiled in pain&#8221; for the line.</p>
<A NAME="637"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=441><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khilah</font>) also occurs only here, but is connected to the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;</font> / <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khil</font> / <font face="Scholar">khul</font>, &#8220;to writhe in pain&#8221;). E. Dhorme says that by extension the meaning denotes the cause of this trembling or writhing &#8211; terrifying pain. The final clause, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488; &#1497;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> yakhmol</font>, &#8220;it has no pity&#8221;), serves as a kind of epithet, modifying &#8220;pain&#8221; in general. If that pain has no pity or compassion, it is a ruthless pain (E. Dhorme, <i>Job</i>, 82).</p>
<A NAME="638"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=442><b>tn</b> The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>, &#8220;for&#8221;) functions here to explain &#8220;my comfort&#8221; in the first colon; the second colon simply strengthens the first.</p>
<A NAME="639"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=443><b>sn</b> The &#8220;words&#8221; are the divine decrees of God&#8217;s providence, the decisions that he makes in his dealings with people. Job cannot conceal these &#8211; he knows what they are. What Job seems to mean by this clause in this verse is that there is nothing that would hinder his joy of dying for he has not denied or disobeyed God&#8217;s plan.</p>
<A NAME="640"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=444><b>tn</b> Several commentators delete the colon as having no meaning in the verse, and because (in their view) it is probably the addition of an interpolator who wants to make Job sound more pious. But Job is at least consoling himself that he is innocent, and at the most anticipating a worth-while afterlife (see H. H. Rowley, <i>Job</i> [NCBC], 60).</p>
<A NAME="641"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=445><b>sn</b> Now, in vv. 11-13, Job proceeds to describe his hopeless condition. In so doing, he is continuing his defense of his despair and lament. The section begins with these rhetorical questions in which Job affirms that he does not have the strength to wait for the blessings that Eliphaz is talking about.</p>
<A NAME="642"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=446><b>tn</b> The word translated &#8220;my end&#8221; is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qitsi</font>). It refers to the termination of his life. In Ps 39:5 it is parallel to &#8220;the measure of my days.&#8221; In a sense, Job is asking what future he has. To him, the &#8220;end&#8221; of his affliction can only be death.</p>
<A NAME="643"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=447><b>sn</b> The questions imply negative answers. Job is saying that it would take great strength to hold up under these afflictions, but he is only flesh and bone. The sufferings have almost completely overwhelmed him. To endure all of this to the end he would need a strength he does not have.</p>
<A NAME="644"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=448><b>tn</b> For the use of the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>) in this kind of interrogative clause, see GKC 475 §150.<i>g</i>, note.</p>

<A NAME="647"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=451><b>tn</b> The Hebrew of this verse is extremely difficult, and while there are many suggestions, none of them has gained a consensus.

If the first colon receives the reading &#8220;His friend has scorned compassion,&#8221; then this clause would be simply coordinated with &#8220;and forsakes the fear of the Almighty.&#8221; The sense of the verse seems to say that kindness/loyalty should be shown to the despairing, even to the one who is forsaking the fear of the <sc>Lord, meaning, saying outrageous things, like Job has been doing. </p>

It means &#8220;to act treacherously [or deceitfully].&#8221; The deception is the treachery, because the deception is not innocent &#8211; it is in the place of a great need. The imagery will compare it to the brook that may or may not have water. If one finds no water when one expected it and needed it, there is deception and treachery. The LXX softens it considerably: &#8220;have not regarded me.&#8221;</p>

A brook where the waters are not flowing is called a deceitful brook (Jer 15:18; Mic 1:14); one where the waters flow is called faithful (Isa 33:16).</p>
<A NAME="652"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=456><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and as a stream bed of brooks/torrents.&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1508;&#1460;&#1497;&#1511;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">afiq</font>) is the river bed or stream bed where the water flows.

But some translate it &#8220;pass away&#8221; or &#8220;flow away,&#8221; and others &#8220;overflow.&#8221; In the rainy season they are deep and flowing, or &#8220;overflow&#8221; their banks. This is a natural sense to the verb, and since the next verse focuses on this, some follow this interpretation (H. H. Rowley, <i>Job</i> [NCBC], 15). But this idea does not parallel the first part of v. 15. So it makes better sense to render it &#8220;flow away&#8221; and see the reference to the summer dry spells when one wants the water but is disappointed.</p>

A good number of interpretations take the root as a by-form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsarav</font>) which means in the Niphal &#8220;to be burnt&#8221; (Ezek 21:3). The expression then would mean &#8220;in the time they are burnt,&#8221; a reference to the scorching heat of the summer (&#8220;when the great heat comes&#8221;) and the rivers dry up. Qimchi connected it to the Arabic &#8220;canal,&#8221; and this has led to the suggestion by E.

G. R. Driver took the same meaning but translated it &#8220;when they (the streams) pour down in torrents, they (straightway) die down&#8221; (<i>ZAW </i>65 [1953]: 216-17).

The LXX, perhaps confusing the word with the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yada</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to know&#8221;) has &#8220;and it is not known what it was.&#8221;</p>

J. A. Clines (<i>Job </i>[WBC], 160-61) allows that &#8220;caravans&#8221; will be introduced in the next verse, but urges retention of the usual sense here.

<A NAME="661"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=465><b>tn</b> The verb literally means &#8220;to go up,&#8221; but here no real ascent is intended for the wasteland.

<A NAME="686"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">86</span><note=490><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1456;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nimrÿtsu</font>, &#8220;[they] painful are&#8221;) may be connected to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">marats</font>, &#8220;to be ill&#8221;). This would give the idea of &#8220;how distressing,&#8221; or &#8220;painful&#8221; in this stem. G. R. Driver (<i>JTS</i> 29 [1927/28]: 390-96) connected it to an Akkadian cognate &#8220;to be ill&#8221; and rendered it &#8220;bitter.&#8221; It has also been linked with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1505;</font> (<font face="Scholar">maras</font>), meaning &#8220;to be hard, strong,&#8221; giving the idea of &#8220;how persuasive&#8221; (see N. S. Doniach and W. E. Barnes, &#8220;Job 4:25: The Root <i>Maras</i>,&#8221; <i>JTS</i> [1929/30]: 291-92). There seems more support for the meaning &#8220;to be ill&#8221; (cf. Mal 2:10). Others follow Targum Job &#8220;how pleasant [to my palate are your words]&#8221;; E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 92) follows this without changing the text but noting that the word has an interchange of letter with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">malats</font>) for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">marats</font>).</p>
<A NAME="687"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">87</span><note=491><b>tn</b> The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vav</font>) here introduces the antithesis (GKC 484-85 §154.<i>a</i>).</p>
<A NAME="688"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">88</span><note=492><b>tn</b> The infinitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1499;&#1461;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hokheakh</font>, &#8220;reproof,&#8221; from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1495;</font> [<font face="Scholar">yakhakh</font>, &#8220;prove&#8221;]) becomes the subject of the verb from the same root, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1499;&#1460;&#1497;&#1492;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yokhiakh</font>), and so serves as a noun (see GKC 340 §113.<i>b</i>). This verb means &#8220;to dispute, quarrel, argue, contend&#8221; (see BDB 406-7 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1495;</font>). Job is saying, &#8220;What does reproof from you prove?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="689"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">89</span><note=493><b>tn</b> The LXX again paraphrases this line: &#8220;But as it seems, the words of a true man are vain, because I do not ask strength of you.&#8221; But the rest of the versions are equally divided on the verse.</p>
<A NAME="690"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">90</span><note=494><b>tn</b> This, in the context, is probably the meaning, although the Hebrew simply has the line after the first half of the verse read: &#8220;and as/to wind the words of a despairing man.&#8221; The line could be translated &#8220;and the words of a despairing man, [which are] as wind.&#8221; But this translation follows the same approach as RSV, NIV, and NAB, which take the idiom of the verb (&#8220;think, imagine&#8221;) with the preposition on &#8220;wind&#8221; to mean &#8220;reckon as wind&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;and treat the words of a despairing man as wind.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="691"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">91</span><note=495><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;lots&#8221; is not in the text; the verb is simply <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tappilu</font>, &#8220;you cast&#8221;). But the word &#8220;lots&#8221; is also omitted in 1 Sam 14:42. Some commentators follow the LXX and repoint the word and divide the object of the preposition to read &#8220;and fall upon the blameless one.&#8221; Fohrer deletes the verse. Peake transfers it to come after v. 23. Even though it does not follow quite as well here, it nonetheless makes sense as a strong invective against their lack of sympathy, and the lack of connection could be the result of emotional speech. He is saying they are the kind of people who would cast lots over the child of a debtor, who, after the death of the father, would be sold to slavery.</p>
<A NAME="692"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">92</span><note=496><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tikhru</font>) is from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">karah</font>), which is found in 40:30 with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>), to mean &#8220;to speculate&#8221; on an object. The form is usually taken to mean &#8220;to barter for,&#8221; which would be an expression showing great callousness to a friend (NIV). NEB has &#8220;hurl yourselves,&#8221; perhaps following the LXX &#8220;rush against.&#8221; but G. R. Driver thinks that meaning is very precarious. As for the translation, &#8220;to speculate about [or &#8220;over&#8221;] a friend&#8221; could be understood to mean &#8220;engage in speculation concerning,&#8221; so the translation &#8220;auction off&#8221; has been used instead.</p>
<A NAME="693"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">93</span><note=497><b>tn</b> The second verb, the imperative &#8220;turn,&#8221; is subordinated to the first imperative even though there is no <i>vav</i> present (see GKC 385-87 §120.<i>a</i>, <i>g</i>).</p>
<A NAME="694"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">94</span><note=498><b>tn</b> The line has &#8220;and now, be pleased, turn to me [i.e., face me].&#8221; The LXX reverses the idea, &#8220;And now, having looked upon your countenances, I will not lie.&#8221; The expression &#8220;turn to me&#8221; means essentially to turn the eyes toward someone to look at him.</p>
<A NAME="695"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">95</span><note=499><b>tn</b> The construction uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>) as in a negative oath to mark the strong negative. He is underscoring his sincerity here. See M. R. Lehmann, &#8220;Biblical Oaths,&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 81 (1969): 74-92.</p>
<A NAME="696"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">96</span><note=500><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shuvu</font>) would literally be &#8220;return.&#8221; It has here the sense of &#8220;to begin again; to adopt another course,&#8221; that is, proceed on another supposition other than my guilt (A. B. Davidson, <i>Job</i>, 49). The LXX takes the word from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yashav</font>, &#8220;sit, dwell&#8221;) reading &#8220;sit down now.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="697"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">97</span><note=501><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avlah</font>) is sometimes translated &#8220;iniquity.&#8221; The word can mean &#8220;perversion, wickedness, injustice&#8221; (cf. 16:11). But here he means in regard to words. Unjust or wicked words would be words that are false and destroy.</p>
<A NAME="698"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">98</span><note=502><b>tn</b> The verb here is also <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shuvu</font>), although there is a <i>Kethib</i>-<i>Qere</i> reading. See R. Gordis, &#8220;Some Unrecognized Meanings of the Root <i>Shub,</i>&#8221;<i> JBL</i> 52 (1933): 153-62.</p>
<A NAME="699"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">99</span><note=503><b>tn</b> The text has simply &#8220;yet my right is in it.&#8221; A. B. Davidson (<i>Job</i>, 49, 50) thinks this means that in his plea against God, Job has right on his side. It may mean this; it simply says &#8220;my righteousness is yet in it.&#8221; If the &#8220;in it&#8221; does not refer to Job&#8217;s cause, then it would simply mean &#8220;is present.&#8221; It would have very little difference either way.</p>
<A NAME="6100"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">100</span><note=504><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avlah</font>) is repeated from the last verse. Here the focus is clearly on wickedness or injustice spoken.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> These words make a fitting transition to ch. 7, which forms a renewed cry of despair from Job. Job still feels himself innocent, but in the hands of cruel fate which is out to destroy him.</p>
<A NAME="6101"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">101</span><note=505><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my palate.&#8221; Here &#8220;palate&#8221; is used not so much for the organ of speech (by metonymy) as of discernment. In other words, what he says indicates what he thinks.</p>
<A NAME="6102"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">102</span><note=506><b>tn</b> The final word, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1493;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">havvot</font>) is usually understood as &#8220;calamities.&#8221; He would be asking if he could not discern his misfortune. But some argue that the word has to be understood in the parallelism to &#8220;wickedness&#8221; of words (D. J. A. Clines, <i>Job </i>[WBC], 162). Gordis connects it to Mic 7:3 and Ps 5:10 [9] where the meaning &#8220;deceit, falsehood&#8221; is found. The LXX has &#8220;and does not my throat meditate understanding?&#8221;</p>
