<A NAME="51"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=311><b>tn</b> Some commentators transpose this verse with the following paragraph, placing it after v. 7 (see E. Dhorme, <i>Job</i>, 62). But the reasons for this are based on the perceived development of the argument and are not that compelling.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The imperative is here a challenge for Job. If he makes his appeal against God, who is there who will listen? The rhetorical questions are intended to indicate that no one will respond, not even the angels. Job would do better to realize that he is guilty and his only hope is in God.</p>
<A NAME="52"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=312><b>tn</b> The participle with the suffix could be given a more immediate translation to accompany the imperative: &#8220;Call now! Is anyone listening to you?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="53"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=313><b>tn</b> The LXX has rendered &#8220;holy ones&#8221; as &#8220;holy angels&#8221; (cf. TEV, CEV, NLT). The LXX has interpreted the verb in the colon too freely: &#8220;if you will see.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="54"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=314><b>sn</b> The point being made is that the angels do not represent the cries of people to God as if mediating for them. But if Job appealed to any of them to take his case against God, there would be no response whatsoever for that.</p>
<A NAME="55"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=315><b>tn</b> One of the reasons that commentators transpose v. 1 is that the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>, &#8220;for&#8221;) here seems to follow 4:21 better. If people die without wisdom, it is folly that kills them. But the verse also makes sense after 5:1. He is saying that complaining against God will not bring deliverance (v. 1), but rather, by such impatience the fool will bring greater calamity on himself.</p>
<A NAME="56"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=316><b>tn</b> The two words for &#8220;foolish person&#8221; are common in wisdom literature. The first, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1493;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">evil</font>), is the fool who is a senseless person; the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1465;&#1514;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">poteh</font>) is the naive and silly person, the simpleton, the one who is easily led astray. The direct object is introduced with the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lamed</font>) in this verse (see GKC 366 §117.<i>n</i>).</p>
<A NAME="57"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=317><b>tn</b> The two parallel nouns are similar; their related verbs are also paralleled in Deut 32:16 with the idea of &#8220;vex&#8221; and &#8220;irritate.&#8221; The first word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ka</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">as</font>) refers to the inner irritation and anger one feels, whereas the second word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qin</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>) refers to the outward expression of the anger. In Job 6:2, Job will respond &#8220;O that my impatience [<font face="Scholar">ka</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">as</font>] were weighed&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="58"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=318><b>tn</b> The use of the pronoun here adds emphasis to the subject of the sentence (see GKC 437 §135.<i>a</i>).</p>
<A NAME="59"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=319><b>tn</b> This word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1493;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">evil</font>), the same word for the &#8220;senseless man&#8221; in the preceding verse. Eliphaz is citing an example of his principle just given &#8211; he saw such a fool for a brief while appearing to prosper (i.e., taking root).</p>
<A NAME="510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=320><b>tn</b> A. B. Davidson argues that the verse does not mean that Eliphaz cursed his place during his prosperity. This line is metonymical (giving the effect). God judged the fool and his place was ruined; consequently, Eliphaz pronounced it accursed of God (see A. B. Davidson, <i>Job</i>, 36). Many emend the verb slightly to read &#8220;and it was suddenly cursed&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1467;&#1499;&#1463;&#1489;</font> [<font face="Scholar">vayyukhav</font>] instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;</font> [<font face="Scholar">va</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eqqov</font>]; see H. H. Rowley, <i>Job</i> [NCBC], 51).</p>
<A NAME="511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=321><b>tn</b> The imperfect verbs in this verse describe the condition of the accursed situation. Some commentators follow the LXX and take these as jussives, making this verse the curse that the man pronounced upon the fool. Rashi adds &#8220;This is the malediction with which I have cursed him.&#8221; That would make the speaker the one calling down the judgment on the fool rather than responding by observation how God destroyed the habitation of the fool.</p>
<A NAME="512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=322><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yiddakkÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">u</font>) could be taken as the passive voice, or in the reciprocal sense (&#8220;crush one another&#8221;) or reflexive (&#8220;crush themselves&#8221;). The context favors the idea that the children of the foolish person will be destroyed because there is no one who will deliver them.</p>
<A NAME="513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=323><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the gate.&#8221; The city gate was the place of both business and justice. The sense here seems to fit the usage of gates as the place of legal disputes, so the phrase &#8220;at the place of judgment&#8221; has been used in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=324><b>tn</b> The text simply says &#8220;and there is no deliverer.&#8221; The entire clause could be subordinated to the preceding clause, and rendered simply &#8220;without a deliverer.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=325><b>sn</b> <i>The hungry</i> are other people, possibly the hungry poor to whom the wealthy have refused to give bread (22:7). The sons are so helpless that even the poor take their property.</p>
<A NAME="516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=326><b>tn</b> The MT reads &#8220;whose harvest the hungry eat up.&#8221; Some commentators want to follow the LXX and repoint <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1456;&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qÿtsiro</font>, &#8220;his harvest&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1510;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qatsÿru</font>, &#8220;[what] they have reaped&#8221;; cf. NAB). The reference as it stands in the MT seems to be to the image of taking root in v. 3; whatever took root &#8211; the prosperity of his life &#8211; will not belong to him or his sons to enjoy. If the emendation is accepted, then the reference would be immediately to the &#8220;sons&#8221; in the preceding verse.</p>
<A NAME="517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=327><b>tn</b> The line is difficult; the Hebrew text reads literally &#8220;and unto from thorns he takes it.&#8221; The idea seems to be that even from within an enclosed hedge of thorns other people will take the harvest. Many commentators either delete the line altogether or try to repoint it to make more sense out of it. G. R. Driver had taken the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>, &#8220;towards&#8221;) as the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>, &#8220;strong man&#8221;) and the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsinnim</font>, &#8220;thorns&#8221;) connected to Aramaic <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsinnah</font>, &#8220;basket&#8221;); he read it as &#8220;a strong man snatches it from the baskets&#8221; (G. R. Driver, &#8220;on Job 5:5,&#8221; <i>TZ</i> 12 [1956]: 485-86). E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 60) changed the word slightly to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1510;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1467;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">matspunim</font>, &#8220;hiding places&#8221;), instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mitsinnim</font>, &#8220;out of the thorns&#8221;), to get the translation &#8220;and unto hiding places he carries it.&#8221; This fits the use of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">laqakh</font>, &#8220;to take&#8221;) with the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>, &#8220;towards&#8221;) meaning &#8220;carry to&#8221; someplace. There seems to be no easy solution to the difficulty of the line.</p>
<A NAME="518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=328><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsammim</font>) has been traditionally rendered &#8220;robbers.&#8221; But it has been connected by some of the ancient versions to the word for &#8220;thirst,&#8221; making a nice parallel with &#8220;hungry.&#8221; This would likely be pointed <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1456;&#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsÿme</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>).</p>
<A NAME="519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=329><b>tn</b> The verb has been given many different renderings, some more radical than others: &#8220;engulf,&#8221; &#8220;draws,&#8221; &#8220;gather,&#8221; &#8220;swallow&#8221; (see H. H. Rowley, <i>Job</i> [NCBC], 53). The idea of &#8220;swallow&#8221; is found in Job 20:15. The general sense of the line is clear, in spite of the difficulties of determining the exact meaning of the verb.</p>
<A NAME="520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=330><b>tn</b> The LXX has several variations for the line. It reads something like the following: &#8220;for what they have collected the just shall eat, but they shall not be delivered out of calamities; let their strength be utterly exhausted.&#8221; The LXX may have gotten the idea of the &#8220;righteous&#8221; as those who suffer from hunger. Instead of &#8220;thorns&#8221; the LXX has the idea of &#8220;trouble.&#8221; The Targum to Job interprets it with &#8220;shield&#8221; and adds &#8220;warriors&#8221; as the subject.</p>
<A NAME="521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=331><b>sn</b> The previous discussion shows how trouble rises, namely, from the rebelliousness of the fool. Here Eliphaz simply summarizes the points made with this general principle &#8211; trouble does not come from outside man, nor does it come as a part of the natural order, but rather it comes from the evil nature of man.</p>
<A NAME="522"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=332><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;man [is].&#8221; Because &#8220;man&#8221; is used in a generic sense for humanity here, the generic &#8220;people&#8221; has been used in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=333><b>tn</b> There is a slight difficulty here in that vv. 6 and 7 seem to be saying the opposite thing. Many commentators, therefore, emend the the Niphal <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yullad</font>, &#8220;is born&#8221;) to an active participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1461;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yoled</font>, &#8220;begets&#8221;) to place the source of trouble in man himself. But the LXX seems to retain the passive idea: &#8220;man is born to trouble.&#8221; The contrast between the two verses does not seem too difficult, for it still could imply that trouble&#8217;s source is within the man.</p>
<A NAME="524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=334><b>tn</b> For the Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;&#1512;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿne reshef</font>, &#8220;sons of the flame&#8221;) the present translation has the rendering &#8220;sparks.&#8221; E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 62) thinks it refers to some kind of bird, but renders it &#8220;sons of the lightning&#8221; because the eagle was associated with lightning in ancient interpretations. Sparks, he argues, do not soar high above the earth. Other suggestions include Resheph, the Phoenician god of lightning (Pope), the fire of passion (Buttenwieser), angels (Peake), or demons (Targum Job). None of these are convincing; the idea of sparks flying upward fits the translation well and makes clear sense in the passage.</p>
<A NAME="525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=335><b>tn</b> The simple translation of the last two words is &#8220;fly high&#8221; or &#8220;soar aloft&#8221; which would suit the idea of an eagle. But, as H. H. Rowley (<i>Job</i> [NCBC], 53) concludes, the argument to identify the expression preceding this with eagles is far-fetched.</p>
<A NAME="526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=336><b>tn</b> The LXX has the name of a bird here: &#8220;the vulture&#8217;s young seek the high places.&#8221; The Targum to Job has &#8220;sons of demons&#8221; or &#8220;the sparks which shoot from coals of fire.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="527"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=337><b>sn</b> Eliphaz affirms that if he were in Job&#8217;s place he would take refuge in God, but Job has to acknowledge that he has offended God and accept this suffering as his chastisement. Job eventually will submit to God in the end, but not in the way that Eliphaz advises here, for Job does not agree that the sufferings are judgments from God.</p>
<A NAME="528"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=338><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ulam</font>) is a strong adversative &#8220;but.&#8221; This forms the contrast with what has been said previously and so marks a new section.</p>
<A NAME="529"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=339><b>tn</b> The independent personal pronoun here adds emphasis to the subject of the verb, again strengthening the contrast with what Job is doing (see R. J. Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 22, §106).</p>
<A NAME="530"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=340><b>tn</b> The imperfect verbs in this verse express not so much what Eliphaz does as what he would do if he were in Job&#8217;s place (even though in 13:3 we have the affirmation). The use fits the category of the imperfect used in conditional clauses (see GKC 319 §107.<i>x</i>).</p>
<A NAME="531"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=341><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">darash</font>, &#8220;to seek&#8221;) followed by the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>, &#8220;towards&#8221;) has the meaning of addressing oneself to (God). See 8:19 and 40:10.</p>
<A NAME="532"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=342><b>tn</b> The Hebrew employs <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>) in the first line and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohim</font>) in the second for &#8220;God&#8221;, but the LXX uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kurio&quot;</font>, &#8220;Lord&#8221;) in both places in this verse. However, in the second colon it also has &#8220;Lord of all.&#8221; This is replaced in the Greek version of Aquila by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#961;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pantokratwr</font>, traditionally translated &#8220;Almighty&#8221;). On the basis of this information, H. M. Orlinsky suggests that the second name for God in the verses should be &#8220;Shaddai&#8221; (<i>JQR </i>25 [1934/35]: 271).</p>
<A NAME="533"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=343><b>tn</b> The Hebrew simply has &#8220;my word&#8221;; but in this expression that uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sim</font>) with the meaning of &#8220;lay before&#8221; or &#8220;expound a cause&#8221; in a legal sense, &#8220;case&#8221; or &#8220;cause&#8221; would be a better translation.</p>
<A NAME="534"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=344><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;who does.&#8221; It is common for such doxologies to begin with participles; they follow the pattern of the psalms in this style. Because of the length of the sentence in Hebrew and the conventions of English style, a new sentence was started here in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="535"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=345><b>tn</b> The Hebrew has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1503; &#1495;&#1461;&#1511;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">en kheqer</font>), literally, &#8220;and no investigation.&#8221; The use of the conjunction on the expression follows a form of the circumstantial clause construction, and so the entire expression describes the great works as &#8220;unsearchable.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="536"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=346><b>tn</b> The preposition in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;&#1470;&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ad </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">en</font>, &#8220;until there was no&#8221;) is stereotypical; it conveys the sense of having no number (see Job 9:10; Ps 40:13).</p>
<A NAME="537"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=347><b>sn</b> H. H. Rowley (<i>Job</i> [NCBC], 54) notes that the verse fits Eliphaz&#8217;s approach very well, for he has good understanding of the truth, but has difficulty in making the correct conclusions from it.</p>
<A NAME="538"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=348><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;who gives.&#8221; The participle continues the doxology here. But the article is necessary because of the distance between this verse and the reference to God.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>He gives rain</i>. The use of the verb &#8220;gives&#8221; underscores the idea that rain is a gift from God. This would be more keenly felt in the Middle East where water is scarce.</p>
<A NAME="539"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=349><b>tn</b> In both halves of the verse the literal rendering would be &#8220;upon the face of the earth&#8221; and &#8220;upon the face of the fields.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="540"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=350><b>tn</b> The second participle is simply coordinated to the first and therefore does not need the definite article repeated (see GKC 404 §126.<i>b</i>).</p>
<A NAME="541"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=351><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khutsot</font>) basically means &#8220;outside,&#8221; or what is outside. It could refer to streets if what is meant is outside the house; but it refers to fields here (parallel to the more general word) because it is outside the village. See Ps 144:13 for the use of the expression for &#8220;countryside.&#8221; The LXX gives a much wider interpretation: &#8220;what is under heaven.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="542"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=352><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;setting.&#8221; The infinitive construct clause is here taken as explaining the nature of God, and so parallel to the preceding descriptions. If read simply as a purpose clause after the previous verse, it would suggest that the purpose of watering the earth was to raise the humble (cf. NASB, &#8220;And sends water on the fields, // So that He sets on high those who are lowly&#8221;). A. B. Davidson (<i>Job</i>, 39) makes a case for this interpretation, saying that God&#8217;s gifts in nature have the wider purpose of blessing man, but he prefers to see the line as another benevolence, parallel to v. 10, and so suggests a translation &#8220;setting up&#8221; rather than &#8220;to set up.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="543"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=353><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1464;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿfalim</font>) refers to &#8220;those who are down.&#8221; This refers to the lowly and despised of the earth. They are the opposite of the &#8220;proud&#8221; (see Ps 138:6). Here there is a deliberate contrast between &#8220;lowly&#8221; and &#8220;on high.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="544"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=354><b>tn</b> The meaning of the word is &#8220;to be dark, dirty&#8221;; therefore, it refers to the ash-sprinkled head of the mourner (H.

It continues the doxological descriptions of God; but because of the numerous verses in this section, it may be clearer to start a new sentence with this form (rather than translating it &#8220;who&#8230;&#8221;). </p>
<A NAME="547"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=357><b>tn</b> The word is related to the verb &#8220;to think; to plan; to devise,&#8221; and so can mean &#8220;thoughts; plans; imagination.&#8221; Here it refers to the plan of the crafty that must be frustrated (see also Isa 44:25 for the contrast).</p>
<A NAME="548"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=358><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arumim</font>) means &#8220;crafty&#8221; or &#8220;shrewd.&#8221; It describes the shrewdness of some to achieve their ends (see Gen 3:1, where the serpent is more cunning than all the creatures, that is, he knows where the dangers are and will attempt to bring down the innocent). In the next verse it describes the clever plans of the wise &#8211; those who are wise in their own sight.</p>
<A NAME="549"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=359><b>tn</b> The consecutive clause showing result or purpose is simply introduced with the <i>vav</i> and the imperfect/jussive (see GKC 504-5 §166.<i>a</i>).</p>

It has either the idea of the faculty of foresight, or of prudence in general (see 12:6; 26:3). It can be parallel in the texts to &#8220;wisdom,&#8221; &#8220;counsel,&#8221; &#8220;help,&#8221; or &#8220;strength.&#8221; Here it refers to what has been planned ahead of time.</p>
<A NAME="551"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=361><b>tn</b> The participles continue the description of God.

See Gen 30:8; Ps 18:26 [27].</p>
<A NAME="554"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=364><b>tn</b> The Niphal of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mahar</font>) means &#8220;to be hasty; to be irresponsible.&#8221; The meaning in the line may be understood in this sense: The counsel of the wily is hastened, that is, precipitated before it is ripe, i.e., frustrated (A. B. Davidson, <i>Job</i>, 39).</p>
<A NAME="555"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=365><b>sn</b> God so confuses the crafty that they are unable to fulfill their plans &#8211; it is as if they encounter darkness in broad daylight. This is like the Syrians in 2 Kgs 6:18-23.</p>
<A NAME="556"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=366><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mashash</font>) expresses the idea of groping about in the darkness. This is part of the fulfillment of Deut 28:29, which says, &#8220;and you shall grope at noonday as the blind grope in darkness.&#8221; This image is also in Isa 59:10.</p>
<A NAME="557"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=367><b>sn</b> The verse provides a picture of the frustration and bewilderment in the crafty who cannot accomplish their ends because God thwarts them.</p>
<A NAME="558"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=368><b>tn</b> The verb, the Hiphil preterite of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yasha</font>&#8217;, &#8220;and he saves&#8221;) indicates that by frustrating the plans of the wicked God saves the poor. So the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive shows the result in the sequence of the verses.</p>
<A NAME="559"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=369><b>tn</b> The juxtaposition of &#8220;from the sword from their mouth&#8221; poses translation difficulties. Some <sc>mss do not have the preposition on &#8220;their mouth,&#8221; but render the expression as a construct: &#8220;from the sword of their mouth.&#8221; This would mean their tongue, and by metonymy, what they say. The expression &#8220;from their mouth&#8221; corresponds well with &#8220;from the hand&#8221; in the next colon. And as E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 67) notes, what is missing is a parallel in the first part with &#8220;the poor&#8221; in the second. So he follows Cappel in repointing &#8220;from the sword&#8221; as a Hophal participle, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1465;&#1495;&#1459;&#1512;&#1464;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mokhorav</font>), meaning &#8220;the ruined.&#8221; If a change is required, this has the benefit of only changing the pointing. The difficulty with this is that the word &#8220;desolate, ruined&#8221; is not used for people, but only to cities, lands, or mountains. The sense of the verse can be supported from the present pointing: &#8220;from the sword [which comes] from their mouth&#8221;; the second phrase could also be in apposition, meaning, &#8220;from the sword, i.e., from their mouth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="560"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=370><b>tn</b> If the word &#8220;poor&#8221; is to do double duty, i.e., serving as the object of the verb &#8220;saves&#8221; in the first colon as well as the second, then the conjunction should be explanatory.</p>
<A NAME="561"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=371><b>tn</b> Other translations render this &#8220;injustice&#8221; (NIV, NRSV, CEV) or &#8220;unrighteousness&#8221; (NASB).</p>
<A NAME="562"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=372><b>tn</b> The verse summarizes the result of God&#8217;s intervention in human affairs, according to Eliphaz&#8217; idea that even-handed justice prevails. Ps 107:42 parallels v. 16b.</p>
<A NAME="563"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=373><b>tn</b> The particle &#8220;therefore&#8221; links this section to the preceding; it points this out as the logical consequence of the previous discussion, and more generally, as the essence of Job&#8217;s suffering.</p>
<A NAME="564"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=374><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ashre</font>, &#8220;blessed&#8221;) is often rendered &#8220;happy.&#8221; But &#8220;happy&#8221; relates to what happens. &#8220;Blessed&#8221; is a reference to the heavenly bliss of the one who is right with God.</p>
<A NAME="565"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=375><b>tn</b> The construction is an implied relative clause. The literal rendering would simply be &#8220;the man God corrects him.&#8221; The suffix on the verb is a resumptive pronoun, completing the use of the relative clause. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yakhakh</font>) is a legal term; it always has some sense of a charge, dispute, or conflict. Its usages show that it may describe a strife breaking out, a charge or quarrel in progress, or the settling of a dispute (Isa 1:18). The derived noun can mean &#8220;reproach; recrimination; charge&#8221; (13:6; 23:4). Here the emphasis is on the consequence of the charge brought, namely, the correction. </p>
<A NAME="566"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=376><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">musar</font>) is parallel to the idea of the first colon.

<A NAME="567"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=377><b>sn</b> The name Shaddai occurs 31 times in the book. This is its first occurrence.

<A NAME="568"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=378><b>sn</b> Verses 18-23 give the reasons why someone should accept the chastening of God &#8211; the hand that wounds is the same hand that heals.

<A NAME="569"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=379><b>tn</b> The addition of the independent pronoun here makes the subject emphatic, as if to say, &#8220;For it is he who makes&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="570"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=380><b>tn</b> The imperfect verbs in this verse describe the characteristic activities of God; the classification as habitual imperfect fits the idea and is to be rendered with the English present tense.</p>

These verbs might have been treated as habitual imperfects if it were not for the use of the numerical images &#8211; &#8220;six calamities&#8230;in seven.&#8221; So the nuance is specific future instead.</p>
<A NAME="572"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=382><b>tn</b> The use of a numerical ladder as we have here &#8211; &#8220;six // seven&#8221; is frequent in wisdom literature to show completeness. See Prov 6:16; Amos 1:3, Mic 5:5. A number that seems to be sufficient for the point is increased by one, as if to say there is always one more. By using this Eliphaz simply means &#8220;in all troubles&#8221; (see H. H. Rowley, <i>Job</i> [NCBC], 56).</p>
<A NAME="573"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=383><b>sn</b> Targum Job here sees an allusion to the famine of Egypt and the war with Amalek.</p>

<A NAME="575"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">75</span><note=385><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb essentially means &#8220;you will be hidden.&#8221; In the Niphal the verb means &#8220;to be hidden, to be in a hiding place,&#8221; and protected (Ps 31:20).</p>
<A NAME="576"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">76</span><note=386><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from the lash [i.e., whip] of the tongue.&#8221; Sir 26:9 and 51:2 show usages of these kinds of expressions: &#8220;the lash of the tongue&#8221; or &#8220;the blow of the tongue.&#8221; The expression indicates that a malicious gossip is more painful than a blow.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Targum saw here a reference to Balaam and the devastation brought on by the Midianites.</p>

One argument for maintaining <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shod</font>) is that it fits the assonance within the verse <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</font> &#8230; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> &#8230; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1465;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shot</font>&#8230;<font face="Scholar">lashon</font>&#8230;<font face="Scholar">shod</font>).</p>

E.

Compare Isa 11:6-9 and Ps 91:13. The verb form is the perfect; here it is the perfect consecutive following a noun clause (see GKC 494 §159.<i>g</i>).</p>
<A NAME="583"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">83</span><note=393><b>sn</b> Verses 19-23 described the immunity from evil and trouble that Job would enjoy &#8211; if he were restored to peace with God.

<A NAME="584"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">84</span><note=394><b>tn</b> The verb is again the perfect, but in sequence to the previous structure so that it is rendered as a future. This would be the case if Job were right with God.</p>

The verb is the perfect with the <i>vav</i> consecutive; it may be subordinated to the imperfect verb that follows to form a temporal clause.</p>
<A NAME="588"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">88</span><note=398><b>tn</b> The verb is usually rendered &#8220;to sin&#8221;; but in this context the more specific primary meaning of &#8220;to miss the mark&#8221; or &#8220;to fail to find something.&#8221; Neither Job&#8217;s tent nor his possessions will be lost.</p>

<A NAME="591"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">91</span><note=401><b>tn</b> The word translated &#8220;in a full age&#8221; has been given an array of meanings: &#8220;health; integrity&#8221;; &#8220;like a new blade of corn&#8221;; &#8220;in your strength [or vigor].&#8221; The numerical value of the letters in the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1456;&#1499;&#1462;&#1500;&#1464;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿkhelakh</font>, &#8220;in old age&#8221;) was 2, 20, 30, and 8, or 60.
