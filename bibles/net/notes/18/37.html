<BODY ><p>
<A NAME="371"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2199><b>tn</b> The imperative is followed by the infinitive absolute from the same root to express the intensity of the verb.</p>
<A NAME="372"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2200><b>tn</b> The word is the usual word for &#8220;to meditate; to murmur; to groan&#8221;; here it refers to the low building of the thunder as it rumbles in the sky. The thunder is the voice of God (see Ps 29).</p>
<A NAME="373"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2201><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;wings,&#8221; and then figuratively for the extremities of garments, of land, etc.</p>
<A NAME="374"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2202><b>tn</b> The verb simply has the pronominal suffix, &#8220;them.&#8221; The idea must be that when God brings in all the thunderings he does not hold back his lightning bolts either.</p>
<A NAME="375"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2203><b>tn</b> The form is the Niphal<i> </i>participle, &#8220;wonders,&#8221; from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pala</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to be wonderful; to be extraordinary&#8221;). Some commentators suppress the repeated verb &#8220;thunders,&#8221; and supply other verbs like &#8220;shows&#8221; or &#8220;works,&#8221; enabling them to make &#8220;wonders&#8221; the object of the verb rather than leaving it in an adverbial role. But as H. H. Rowley (<i>Job</i> [NCBC], 236) notes, no change is needed, for one is not surprised to find repetition in Elihu&#8217;s words.</p>
<A NAME="376"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2204><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and we do not know.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="377"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2205><b>tn</b> The verb actually means &#8220;be&#8221; (found here in the Aramaic form). The verb &#8220;to be&#8221; can mean &#8220;to happen, to fall, to come about.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="378"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2206><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and [to the] shower of rain and shower of rains, be strong.&#8221; Many think the repetition grew up by variant readings; several Hebrew <sc>mss delete the second pair, and so many editors do. But the repetition may have served to stress the idea that the rains were heavy.</p>
<A NAME="379"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2207><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Be strong.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2208><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;by the hand of every man he seals.&#8221; This line is intended to mean with the heavy rains God suspends all agricultural activity.</p>
<A NAME="3711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2209><b>tc</b> This reading involves a change in the text, for in MT &#8220;men&#8221; is in the construct. It would be translated, &#8220;all men whom he made&#8221; (i.e., all men of his making&#8221;). This is the translation followed by the NIV and NRSV. Olshausen suggested that the word should have been <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anashim</font>) with the final <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mem</font>) being lost to haplography.</p>
<A NAME="3712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2210><b>tn</b> D. W. Thomas suggested a meaning of &#8220;rest&#8221; for the verb, based on Arabic. He then reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">enosh</font>) for man, and supplies a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mem</font>) to &#8220;his work&#8221; to get &#8220;that every man might rest from his work [in the fields].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2211><b>tn</b> The &#8220;driving winds&#8221; reflects the Hebrew &#8220;from the scatterers.&#8221; This refers to the north winds that bring the cold air and the ice and snow and hard rains.</p>
<A NAME="3714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2212><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;moisture&#8221; is drawn from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ri</font>) as a contraction for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1456;&#1493;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rÿvi</font>). Others emended the text to get &#8220;hail&#8221; (NAB) or &#8220;lightning,&#8221; or even &#8220;the Creator.&#8221; For these, see the various commentaries. There is no reason to change the reading of the MT when it makes perfectly good sense.</p>
<A NAME="3715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2213><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;the clouds&#8221; are supplied from v. 11; the sentence itself actually starts: &#8220;and it goes round,&#8221; referring to the cloud.</p>
<A NAME="3716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2214><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;that it may do.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2215><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;rod,&#8221; i.e., a rod used for punishment.</p>
<A NAME="3718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2216><b>tn</b> This is interpretive; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he makes find it.&#8221; The lightning could be what is intended here, for it finds its mark. But R. Gordis (<i>Job</i>, 429) suggests man is the subject &#8211; let him find what it is for, i.e., the fate appropriate for him.</p>
<A NAME="3719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2217><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿsum</font>, from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> [<font face="Scholar">sim</font>, &#8220;set&#8221;]), so the idea is how God lays [or sets] [a command] for them. The suffix is proleptic, to be clarified in the second colon.</p>
<A NAME="3720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2218><b>tn</b> Dhorme reads this &#8220;and how his stormcloud makes lightning to flash forth?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3721"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2219><b>tn</b> As indicated by <i>HALOT</i> 618 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;</font>, the concept of &#8220;balancing&#8221; probably refers to &#8220;floating&#8221; or &#8220;suspension&#8221; (cf. NIV&#8217;s &#8220;how the clouds hang poised&#8221; and J. E. Hartley, <i>Job</i> [NICOT], 481-82, n. 2).</p>
<A NAME="3722"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2220><b>tn</b> The verb means &#8220;to beat out; to flatten,&#8221; and the analogy in the next line will use molten metal. From this verb is derived the word for the &#8220;firmament&#8221; in Gen 1:6-8, that canopy-like pressure area separating water above and water below.</p>
<A NAME="3723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2221><b>tn</b> The imperfect verb here carries the obligatory nuance, &#8220;what we should say?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2222><b>tn</b> The verb means &#8220;to arrange; to set in order.&#8221; From the context the idea of a legal case is included.</p>
<A NAME="3725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2223><b>tn</b> This imperfect works well as a desiderative imperfect.</p>
<A NAME="3726"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2224><b>tn</b> The light here must refer to the sun in the skies that had been veiled by the storm. Then, when the winds blew the clouds away, it could not be looked at because it was so dazzling. Elihu&#8217;s analogy will be that God is the same &#8211; in his glory one cannot look at him or challenge him.</p>
<A NAME="3727"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2225><b>tn</b> The verb has an indefinite subject, and so should be a passive here.</p>
<A NAME="3728"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2226><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and cleaned them.&#8221; The referent is the clouds (v. 18), which has been supplied in the translation for clarity. There is another way of reading this verse: the word translated &#8220;bright&#8221; means &#8220;dark; obscured&#8221; in Syriac. In this interpretation the first line would mean that they could not see the sun, because it was darkened by the clouds, but then the wind came and blew the clouds away. Dhorme, Gray, and several others take it this way, as does the NAB.</p>
<A NAME="3729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2227><b>tn</b> The MT has &#8220;out of the north comes gold.&#8221; Left in that sense the line seems irrelevant. The translation &#8220;golden splendor&#8221; (with RV, RSV, NRSV, NIV) depends upon the context of theophany. Others suggest &#8220;golden rays&#8221; (Dhorme), the aurora borealis (Graetz, Gray), or some mythological allusion (Pope), such as Baal&#8217;s palace. Golden rays or splendor is what is intended, although the reference is not to a natural phenomenon &#8211; it is something that would suggest the glory of God. </p>
<A NAME="3730"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2228><b>tn</b> The name &#8220;Almighty&#8221; is here a <i>casus pendens</i>, isolating the name at the front of the sentence and resuming it with a pronoun.</p>
<A NAME="3731"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2229><b>tn</b> The MT places the major disjunctive accent (the <font face="Scholar">atnach</font>) under &#8220;power,&#8221; indicating that &#8220;and justice&#8221; as a disjunctive clause starting the second half of the verse (with ESV, NASB, NIV, NLT). Ignoring the Masoretic accent, NRSV has &#8220;he is great in power and justice.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3732"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2230><b>sn</b> The phrase &#8220;wise of heart&#8221; was used in Job 9:4 in a negative sense.</p>
