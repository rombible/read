<A NAME="401"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2324><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1465;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rov</font>) is the infinitive absolute from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">riv</font>, &#8220;contend&#8221;). Dhorme wishes to repoint it to make it the active participle, the &#8220;one who argues with the Almighty.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="402"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2325><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yissor</font>) is found only here, but comes from a common root meaning &#8220;to correct; to reprove.&#8221; Several suggestions have been made to improve on the MT. Dhorme read it <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yasur</font>) in the sense of &#8220;to turn aside; to yield.&#8221; Ehrlich read this emendation as &#8220;to come to an end.&#8221; But the MT could be read as &#8220;to correct; to instruct.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="403"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2326><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1465;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qalloti</font>) means &#8220;to be light; to be of small account; to be unimportant.&#8221; From this comes the meaning &#8220;contemptible,&#8221; which in the causative stem would mean &#8220;to treat with contempt; to curse.&#8221; Dhorme tries to make the sentence a conditional clause and suggests this meaning: &#8220;If I have been thoughtless.&#8221; There is really no &#8220;if&#8221; in Job&#8217;s mind.</p>
<A NAME="404"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2327><b>tn</b> The perfect verb here should be classified as an instantaneous perfect; the action is simultaneous with the words.</p>
<A NAME="405"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2328><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;to silence myself&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="406"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2329><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will not add.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="407"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2330><b>sn</b> The speech can be divided into three parts: the invitation to Job to assume the throne and rule the world (40:7-14), the description of Behemoth (40:15-24), and the description of Leviathan (41:1-34).</p>
<A NAME="408"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2331><b>tn</b> See note on &#8220;task&#8221; in 38:3.</p>
<A NAME="409"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2332><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">parar</font>) means &#8220;to annul; to break; to frustrate.&#8221; It was one thing for Job to claim his own integrity, but it was another matter altogether to nullify God&#8217;s righteousness in the process.</p>
<A NAME="4010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2333><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;do you have an arm like God?&#8221; The words &#8220;as powerful as&#8221; have been supplied in the translation to clarify the metaphor.</p>
<A NAME="4011"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2334><b>tn</b> The verb was used for scattering lightning (Job 37:11). God is challenging Job to unleash his power and judge wickedness in the world.</p>
<A NAME="4012"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2335><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the overflowings.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4013"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2336><b>tn</b> The word was just used in the positive sense of excellence or majesty; now the exalted nature of the person refers to self-exaltation, or pride.</p>
<A NAME="4014"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2337><b>tn</b> The expression translated &#8220;on the spot&#8221; is the prepositional phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">takhtam</font>, &#8220;under them&#8221;). &#8220;Under them&#8221; means in their place. But it can also mean &#8220;where someone stands, on the spot&#8221; (see Exod 16:29; Jos 6:5; Judg 7:21, etc.).</p>
<A NAME="4015"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2338><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;dust&#8221; can mean &#8220;ground&#8221; here, or more likely, &#8220;grave.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2339><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khavash</font>) means &#8220;to bind.&#8221; In Arabic the word means &#8220;to bind&#8221; in the sense of &#8220;to imprison,&#8221; and that fits here.</p>
<A NAME="4017"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2340><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;their faces.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4018"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2341><b>tn</b> The word is &#8220;secret place,&#8221; the place where he is to hide them, i.e., the grave. The text uses the word &#8220;secret place&#8221; as a metonymy for the grave.</p>
<A NAME="4019"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2342><b>tn</b> The verb is usually translated &#8220;praise,&#8221; but with the sense of a public declaration or acknowledgment. It is from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yadah</font>, in the Hiphil, as here, &#8220;give thanks, laud&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="4020"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2343><b>tn</b> The imperfect verb has the nuance of potential imperfect: &#8220;can save; is able to save.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2344><b>sn</b> The next ten verses are devoted to a portrayal of <i>Behemoth</i> (the name means &#8220;beast&#8221; in Hebrew). It does not fit any of the present material very well, and so many think the section is a later addition. Its style is more like that of a textbook. Moreover, if the animal is a real animal (the usual suggestion is the hippopotamus), then the location of such an animal is Egypt and not Palestine. Some have identified these creatures Behemoth and Leviathan as mythological creatures (Gunkel, Pope). Others point out that these creatures could have been dinosaurs (P. J. Maarten, <i>NIDOTTE</i>, 2:780; H. M. Morris, <i>The Remarkable Record of Job</i>, 115-22). Most would say they are real animals, but probably mythologized by the pagans. So the pagan reader would receive an additional impact from this point about God&#8217;s sovereignty over all nature.</p>
<A NAME="4022"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2345><b>sn</b> By form the word is the feminine plural of the Hebrew word for &#8220;beast.&#8221; Here it is an abstract word &#8211; a title.</p>
<A NAME="4023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2346><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;with you.&#8221; The meaning could be temporal (&#8220;when I made you&#8221;) &#8211; perhaps a reference to the sixth day of creation (Gen 1:24).</p>
<A NAME="4024"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2347><b>tn</b> In both of these verses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>, &#8220;behold&#8221;) has the deictic force (the word is from Greek <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#949;&#8055;&#954;&#957;&#965;&#956;&#953;</font>, <font face="Greektl">deiknumi</font><i>,</i> &#8220;to show&#8221;). It calls attention to something by pointing it out. The expression goes with the sudden look, the raised eye, the pointing hand &#8211; &#8220;O look!&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4025"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2348><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khafats</font>) occurs only here. It may have the meaning &#8220;to make stiff; to make taut&#8221; (Arabic). The LXX and the Syriac versions support this with &#8220;erects.&#8221; But there is another Arabic word that could be cognate, meaning &#8220;arch, bend.&#8221; This would give the idea of the tail swaying. The other reading seems to make better sense here. However, &#8220;stiff&#8221; presents a serious problem with the view that the animal is the hippopotamus.</p>
<A NAME="4026"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2349><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the ways of God.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This may be a reference to Gen 1:24, where the first of the animal creation was the cattle &#8211; <font face="Scholar">bÿhemah</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1461;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font>).</p>
<A NAME="4027"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2350><b>tc</b> The literal reading of the MT is &#8220;let the one who made him draw near [with] his sword.&#8221; The sword is apparently a reference to the teeth or tusks of the animal, which cut vegetation like a sword. But the idea of a weapon is easier to see, and so the people who favor the mythological background see here a reference to God&#8217;s slaying the Beast. There are again many suggestions on how to read the line. The RV probably has the safest: &#8220;He that made him has furnished him with his sword&#8221; (the sword being a reference to the sharp tusks with which he can attack).</p>
<A NAME="4028"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2351><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bul</font>) probably refers to food. Many take it as an abbreviated form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿvul</font>, &#8220;produce of the field&#8221;). The vegetation that is produced on the low hills is what is meant.</p>
<A NAME="4029"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2352><b>tn</b> The suffix is singular, but must refer to the trees&#8217; shade.</p>
<A NAME="4030"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2353><b>tn</b> The word ordinarily means &#8220;to oppress.&#8221; So many commentators have proposed suitable changes: &#8220;overflows&#8221; (Beer), &#8220;gushes&#8221; (Duhm), &#8220;swells violently&#8221; (Dhorme, from a word that means &#8220;be strong&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="4031"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2354><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;he remains calm.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4032"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2355><b>tn</b> The idea would be either (1) catch it while it is watching, or (2) in some way disabling its eyes before the attack. But others change the reading; Ball suggested &#8220;with hooks&#8221; and this has been adopted by some modern English versions (e.g., NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="4033"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2356><b>tn</b> Ehrlich altered the MT slightly to get &#8220;with thorns,&#8221; a view accepted by Driver, Dhorme and Pope.</p>
