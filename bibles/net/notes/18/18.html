<A NAME="181"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1243><b>sn</b> Bildad attacks Job with less subtlety than Eliphaz. He describes the miserable existence of the wicked, indicating that it is the proof of sin. His speech falls into two main parts: why is Job so contemptuous toward his friends (Job 18:2-4), and the fate of the wicked (18:5-21). On this chapter see N. M. Sarna, &#8220;The Mythological Background of Job 18,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 82 (1963): 315-18; and W. A. Irwin, &#8220;Job&#8217;s Redeemer,&#8221; <i>JBL </i>81 (1962): 217-29.</p>
<A NAME="182"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1244><b>tn</b> The verb is plural, and so most commentators make it singular. But it seems from the context that Bildad is addressing all of them, and not just Job.</p>
<A NAME="183"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1245><b>tn</b> The construction is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1510;&#1461;&#1497; &#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qintse lÿmillin</font>), which is often taken to be &#8220;end of words,&#8221; as if the word was from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1461;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qets</font>, &#8220;end&#8221;). But a plural of &#8220;end&#8221; is not found in the OT. Some will link the word to Arabic <i>qanasa</i>, &#8220;to hunt; to give chase,&#8221; to get an interpretation of &#8220;snares for words.&#8221; But E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 257) objects that this does not fit the speech of Bildad (as well as it might Job&#8217;s). He finds a cognate <i>qinsu</i>, &#8220;fetters, shackles,&#8221; and reads &#8220;how long will you put shackles on words.&#8221; But G. R. Driver had pointed out that this cognate does not exist (&#8220;Problems in the Hebrew text of Job,&#8221; VTSup 3 [1955]: 72-93). So it would be preferable to take the reading &#8220;ends&#8221; and explain the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nun</font>) as from a Aramaizing by-form. This is supported by 11QtgJob that uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1493;&#1465;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sof</font>, &#8220;end&#8221;). On the construction, GKC 421 §130.<i>a</i> explains this as a use of the construct in rapid narrative to connect the words; in such cases a preposition is on the following noun. </p>
<A NAME="184"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1246><b>tn</b> The imperfect verb, again plural, would be here taken in the nuance of instruction, or a modal nuance of obligation. So Bildad is telling his listeners to be intelligent. This would be rather cutting in the discourse.</p>
<A NAME="185"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1247><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;afterward.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="186"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1248><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1496;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nitminu</font>) has been explained from different roots. Some take it from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1461;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tame</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to be unclean&#8221;), and translate it &#8220;Why should we be unclean in your eyes?&#8221; Most would connect it to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tamam</font>, &#8220;to stop up&#8221;), meaning &#8220;to be stupid&#8221; in the Niphal<i>.</i> Another suggestion is to follow the LXX and read from <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1501;</font></i> (<font face="Scholar">damam</font>, &#8220;to be reduced to silence&#8221;). Others take it from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">damah</font>) with a meaning &#8220;to be like.&#8221; But what is missing is the term of comparison &#8211; like what? Various suggestions have been made, but all are simply conjectures.</p>
<A NAME="187"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1249><b>tn</b> The construction uses the participle and then 3rd person suffixes: &#8220;O tearer of himself in his anger.&#8221; But it is clearly referring to Job, and so the direct second person pronouns should be used to make that clear. The LXX is an approximation or paraphrase here: &#8220;Anger has possessed you, for what if you should die &#8211; would under heaven be desolate, or shall the mountains be overthrown from their foundations?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="188"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1250><b>tn</b> There is a good deal of study on this word in this passage, and in Job in general. M. Dahood suggested a root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">azav</font>) meaning &#8220;to arrange; to rearrange&#8221; (&#8220;The Root <i>&#8217;zb</i> II in Job,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 78 [1959]: 303-9). But this is refuted by H. G. M. Williamson, &#8220;A Reconsideration of <i>&#8217;zb</i> II in Biblical Hebrew,&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 97 (1985): 74-85.</p>
<A NAME="189"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1251><b>sn</b> Bildad is asking if Job thinks the whole moral order of the world should be interrupted for his sake, that he may escape the punishment for wickedness.</p>
<A NAME="1810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1252><b>tn</b> Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gam</font>, &#8220;also; moreover&#8221;), in view of what has just been said.</p>
<A NAME="1811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1253><b>sn</b> The lamp or the light can have a number of uses in the Bible. Here it is probably an implied metaphor for prosperity and happiness, for the good life itself.</p>
<A NAME="1812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1254><b>tn</b> The expression is literally &#8220;the flame of his fire,&#8221; but the pronominal suffix qualifies the entire bound construction. The two words together intensify the idea of the flame.</p>
<A NAME="1813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1255><b>tn</b> The LXX interprets a little more precisely: &#8220;his lamp shall be put out with him.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This thesis of Bildad will be questioned by Job in 21:17 &#8211; how often is the lamp of the wicked snuffed out?</p>
<A NAME="1814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1256><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the steps of his vigor,&#8221; the genitive being the attribute.</p>
<A NAME="1815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1257><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsarar</font>) means &#8220;to be cramped; to be straitened; to be hemmed in.&#8221; The trouble has hemmed him in, so that he cannot walk with the full, vigorous steps he had before. The LXX has &#8220;Let the meanest of men spoil his goods.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1258><b>tn</b> The LXX has &#8220;causes him to stumble,&#8221; which many commentators accept; but this involves the transposition of the three letters. The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shalakh</font>, &#8220;throw&#8221;) not <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kashal</font>, &#8220;stumble&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1259><b>tn</b> See Ps 25:15.</p>
<A NAME="1818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1260><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sÿvakhah</font>) is used in scripture for the lattice window (2 Kgs 1:2). The Arabic cognate means &#8220;to be intertwined.&#8221; So the term could describe a net, matting, grating, or lattice. Here it would be the netting stretched over a pit.</p>
<A NAME="1819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1261><b>tn</b> This word <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;</font> </i>(<font face="Scholar">pakh</font>) specifically refers to the snare of the fowler &#8211; thus a bird trap. But its plural seems to refer to nets in general (see Job 22:10).</p>
<A NAME="1820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1262><b>tn</b> This word does not occur elsewhere. But another word from the same root means &#8220;plait of hair,&#8221; and so this term has something to do with a net like a trellis or lattice.</p>
<A NAME="1821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1263><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his rope.&#8221; The suffix must be a genitive expressing that the trap was for him, to trap him, and so an objective genitive.</p>
<A NAME="1822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1264><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his trap.&#8221; The pronominal suffix is objective genitive here as well.</p>
<A NAME="1823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1265><b>sn</b> Bildad is referring here to all the things that afflict a person and cause terror. It would then be a metonymy of effect, the cause being the afflictions.</p>
<A NAME="1824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1266><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">puts</font>) in the Hiphil has the meaning &#8220;to pursue&#8221; and &#8220;to scatter.&#8221; It is followed by the expression &#8220;at his feet.&#8221; So the idea is easily derived: they chase him at his feet. But some commentators have other proposals. The most far-fetched is that of Ehrlich and Driver (<i>ZAW </i>24 [1953]: 259-60) which has &#8220;and compel him to urinate on his feet,&#8221; one of many similar readings the NEB accepted from Driver.</p>
<A NAME="1825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1267><b>tn</b> The jussive is occasionally used without its normal sense and only as an imperfect (see GKC 323 §109.<i>k</i>).</p>
<A NAME="1826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1268><b>tn</b> There are a number of suggestions for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1465;&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ono</font>). Some take it as &#8220;vigor&#8221;: thus &#8220;his strength is hungry.&#8221; Others take it as &#8220;iniquity&#8221;: thus &#8220;his iniquity/trouble is hungry.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1269><b>tn</b> The expression means that misfortune is right there to destroy him whenever there is the opportunity.</p>
<A NAME="1828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1270><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;the limbs of his skin&#8221; makes no sense, unless a poetic meaning of &#8220;parts&#8221; (or perhaps &#8220;layers&#8221;) is taken. The parallelism has &#8220;his skin&#8221; in the first colon, and &#8220;his limbs&#8221; in the second. One plausible suggestion is to take <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">badde</font>, &#8220;limbs of&#8221;) in the first part to be <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1493;&#1464;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bidvay</font>, &#8220;by a disease&#8221;; Dhorme, Wright, RSV). The verb has to be made passive, however. The versions have different things: The LXX has &#8220;let the branches of his feet be eaten&#8221;; the Syriac has &#8220;his cities will be swallowed up by force&#8221;; the Vulgate reads &#8220;let it devour the beauty of his skin&#8221;; and Targum Job has &#8220;it will devour the linen garments that cover his skin.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1271><b>tn</b> The &#8220;firstborn of death&#8221; is the strongest child of death (Gen 49:3), or the deadliest death (like the &#8220;firstborn of the poor, the poorest). The phrase means the most terrible death (A. B. Davidson, <i>Job</i>, 134).</p>
<A NAME="1830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1272><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from his tent, his security.&#8221; The apposition serves to modify the tent as his security.</p>
<A NAME="1831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1273><b>tn</b> The verb is the Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsa</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ad</font>, &#8220;to lead away&#8221;). The problem is that the form is either a third feminine (Rashi thought it was referring to Job&#8217;s wife) or the second person. There is a good deal of debate over the possibility of the prefix <i>t-</i> being a variant for the third masculine form. The evidence in Ugaritic and Akkadian is mixed, stronger for the plural than the singular. Gesenius has some samples where the third feminine form might also be used for the passive if there is no expressed subject (see GKC 459 §144.<i>b</i>), but the evidence is not strong. The simplest choices are to change the prefix to a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yod</font>), or argue that the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tav</font>) can be masculine, or follow Gesenius.</p>
<A NAME="1832"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1274><b>sn</b> This is a reference to death, the king of all terrors. Other identifications are made in the commentaries: Mot, the Ugaritic god of death; Nergal of the Babylonians; Molech of the Canaanites, the one to whom people sent emissaries.</p>
<A NAME="1833"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1275><b>tn</b> This line is difficult as well. The verb, again a third feminine form, says &#8220;it dwells in his tent.&#8221; But the next part (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497; &#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mibbÿli lo</font>) means something like &#8220;things of what are not his.&#8221; The best that can be made of the MT is &#8220;There shall live in his tent they that are not his&#8221; (referring to persons and animals; see J. E. Hartley, <i>Job</i> [NICOT], 279). G. R. Driver and G. B. Gray (<i>Job</i> [ICC], 2:161) refer &#8220;that which is naught of his&#8221; to weeds and wild animals. M. Dahood suggested a reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mabbel</font>) and a connection to Akkadian <i>nablu</i>, &#8220;fire&#8221; (cf. Ugaritic <i>nbl</i>). The interchange of <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> is not a problem, and the parallelism with the next line makes good sense (&#8220;Some Northwest Semitic words in Job,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 38 [1957]: 312ff.). Others suggest an emendation to get &#8220;night-hag&#8221; or vampire. This suggestion, as well as Driver&#8217;s &#8220;mixed herbs,&#8221; are linked to the idea of exorcism. But if a change is to be made, Dahood&#8217;s is the most compelling.</p>
<A NAME="1834"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1276><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;outside.&#8221; Cf. ESV, &#8220;in the street,&#8221; referring to absence from his community&#8217;s memory.</p>
<A NAME="1835"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1277><b>tn</b> The verbs in this verse are plural; without the expressed subject they should be taken in the passive sense.</p>
<A NAME="1836"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1278><b>tn</b> The two words <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nin</font>, &#8220;offspring&#8221;) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1499;&#1462;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nekhed</font>, &#8220;posterity&#8221;) are always together and form an alliteration. This is hard to capture in English, but some have tried: Moffatt had &#8220;son and scion,&#8221; and Tur-Sinai had &#8220;breed or brood.&#8221; But the words are best simply translated as &#8220;lineage and posterity&#8221; or as in the NIV &#8220;offspring or descendants.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1837"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1279><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in his sojournings.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gur</font>) means &#8220;to reside; to sojourn&#8221; temporarily, without land rights. Even this word has been selected to stress the temporary nature of his stay on earth.</p>
<A NAME="1838"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1280><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akharonim</font>) means &#8220;those [men] coming after.&#8221; And the next word, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1502;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qadmonim</font>), means &#8220;those [men] coming before.&#8221; Some commentators have tried to see here references to people who lived before and people who lived after, but that does not explain their being appalled at the fate of the wicked. So the normal way this is taken is in connection to the geography, notably the seas &#8211; &#8220;the hinder sea&#8221; refers to the Mediterranean, the West, and &#8220;the front sea&#8221; refers to the Dead Sea (Zech 14:8), namely, the East. The versions understood this as temporal: &#8220;the last groaned for him, and wonder seized the first&#8221; (LXX).</p>
<A NAME="1839"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1281><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his day.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1840"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1282><b>tn</b> The expression has &#8220;they seize horror.&#8221; The RSV renders this &#8220;horror seizes them.&#8221; The same idiom is found in Job 21:6: &#8220;laid hold on shuddering.&#8221; The idiom would solve the grammatical problem, and not change the meaning greatly; but it would change the parallelism.</p>
<A NAME="1841"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1283><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;saying&#8221; is supplied in the translation to mark and introduce the following as a quotation of these people who are seized with horror. The alternative is to take v. 21 as Bildad&#8217;s own summary statement (cf. G. R. Driver and G. B. Gray, <i>Job</i> [ICC], 2:162; J. E. Hartley, <i>Job</i> [NICOT], 280).</p>
<A NAME="1842"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1284><b>tn</b> The term is in the plural, &#8220;the tabernacles&#8221;; it should be taken as a plural of local extension (see GKC 397 §124.<i>b</i>).</p>
<A NAME="1843"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1285><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;place&#8221; is in construct; the clause following it replaces the genitive: &#8220;this is the place of &#8211; he has not known God.&#8221;</p>
