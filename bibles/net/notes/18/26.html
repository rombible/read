<A NAME="261"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1649><b>sn</b> These two chapters will be taken together under this title, although most commentators would assign Job 26:5-14 to Bildad and Job 27:7-23 to Zophar. Those sections will be noted as they emerge. For the sake of outlining, the following sections will be marked off: Job&#8217;s scorn for Bildad (26:2-4); a better picture of God&#8217;s greatness (26:5-14); Job&#8217;s protestation of innocence (27:2-6); and a picture of the condition of the wicked (27:7-23).</p>
<A NAME="262"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1650><b>tn</b> The interrogative clause is used here as an exclamation, and sarcastic at that. Job is saying &#8220;you have in no way helped the powerless.&#8221; The verb uses the singular form, for Job is replying to Bildad.</p>
<A NAME="263"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1651><b>tn</b> The &#8220;powerless&#8221; is expressed here by the negative before the word for &#8220;strength; power&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;him who has no power&#8221; (see GKC 482 §152.<i>u</i>, <i>v</i>).</p>
<A NAME="264"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1652><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the arm [with] no strength.&#8221; Here too the negative expression is serving as a relative clause to modify &#8220;arm,&#8221; the symbol of strength and power, which by metonymy stands for the whole person. &#8220;Man of arm&#8221; denoted the strong in 22:8.</p>
<A NAME="265"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1653><b>tc</b> The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1512;&#1465;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">larov</font>) means &#8220;to abundance&#8221; or &#8220;in a large quantity.&#8221; It is also used ironically like all these expressions. This makes very good sense, but some wish to see a closer parallel and so offer emendations. Reiske and Kissane thought &#8220;to the tender&#8221; for the word. But the timid are not the same as the ignorant and unwise. So Graetz supplied &#8220;to the boorish&#8221; by reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ar</font>). G. R. Driver did the same with less of a change: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">labbor</font>; <i>HTR</i> 29 [1936]: 172).</p>
<A NAME="266"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1654><b>tn</b> The verse begins with the preposition and the interrogative: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et-mi</font>, &#8220;with who[se help]?&#8221;). Others take it as the accusative particle introducing the indirect object: &#8220;for whom did you utter&#8230;&#8221; (see GKC 371 §117.<i>gg</i>). Both are possible.</p>
<A NAME="267"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1655><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;has gone out from you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="268"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1656><b>sn</b> This is the section, Job 26:5-14, that many conclude makes better sense coming from the friend. But if it is attributed to Job, then he is showing he can surpass them in his treatise of the greatness of God.</p>
<A NAME="269"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1657><b>tn</b> The text has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1508;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">harÿfa</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>, &#8220;the shades&#8221;), referring to the &#8220;dead,&#8221; or the elite among the dead (see Isa 14:9; 26:14; Ps 88:10 [11]). For further discussion, start with A. R. Johnson, <i>The Vitality of the Individual</i>, 88ff.</p>
<A NAME="2610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1658><b>tn</b> The verb is a Polal from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khil</font>) which means &#8220;to tremble.&#8221; It shows that even these spirits cannot escape the terror.</p>
<A NAME="2611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1659><b>tc</b> Most commentators wish to lengthen the verse and make it more parallel, but nothing is gained by doing this.</p>
<A NAME="2612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1660><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Sheol.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1661><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;before him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1662><b>tn</b> The line has &#8220;and there is no covering for destruction.&#8221; &#8220;Destruction&#8221; here is another name for Sheol: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1489;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avaddon</font>, &#8220;Abaddon&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="2615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1663><b>sn</b> The Hebrew word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1508;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsafon</font>). Some see here a reference to Mount Zaphon of the Ugaritic texts, the mountain that Baal made his home. The Hebrew writers often equate and contrast Mount Zion with this proud mountain of the north. Of course, the word just means north, and so in addition to any connotations for pagan mythology, it may just represent the northern skies &#8211; the stars. Since the parallel line speaks of the earth, that is probably all that was intended in this particular context.</p>
<A NAME="2616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1664><b>sn</b> There is an allusion to the creation account, for this word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tohu</font>), translated &#8220;without form&#8221; in Gen 1:2.</p>
<A NAME="2617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1665><b>sn</b> Buttenwieser suggests that Job had outgrown the idea of the earth on pillars, and was beginning to see it was suspended in space. But in v. 11 he will still refer to the pillars.</p>
<A NAME="2618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1666><b>tn</b> The verb means &#8220;to hold; to seize,&#8221; here in the sense of shutting up, enshrouding, or concealing.</p>
<A NAME="2619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1667><b>tc</b> The MT has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1460;&#1505;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khisseh</font>), which is a problematic vocalization. Most certainly <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1505;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">keseh</font>), alternative for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kese</font>&#8217;, &#8220;full moon&#8221;) is intended here. The MT is close to the form of &#8220;throne,&#8221; which would be <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1505;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kisse</font>&#8217;, cf. NLT &#8220;he shrouds his throne with his clouds&#8221;). But here God is covering the face of the moon by hiding it behind clouds.</p>
<A NAME="2620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1668><b>tn</b> The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1511;&#1470;&#1495;&#1464;&#1490;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khoq-khag</font>) means &#8220;he has drawn a limit as a circle.&#8221; According to some the form should have been <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1511;&#1470;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khaq-khug</font>, &#8220;He has traced a circle&#8221;). But others argues that the text is acceptable as is, and can be interpreted as &#8220;a limit he has circled.&#8221; The Hebrew verbal roots are <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khaqaq</font>, &#8220;to engrave; to sketch out; to trace&#8221;) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khug</font>, &#8220;describe a circle&#8221;) respectively.</p>
<A NAME="2621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1669><b>sn</b> H. H. Rowley (<i>Job</i> [NCBC], 173) says these are the great mountains, perceived to hold up the sky.</p>
<A NAME="2622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1670><b>sn</b> The idea here is that when the earth quakes, or when there is thunder in the heavens, these all represent God&#8217;s rebuke, for they create terror.</p>
<A NAME="2623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1671><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">raga</font>&#8217;) has developed a Semitic polarity, i.e., having totally opposite meanings. It can mean &#8220;to disturb; to stir up&#8221; or &#8220;to calm; to still.&#8221; Gordis thinks both meanings have been invoked here. But it seems more likely that &#8220;calm&#8221; fits the context better.</p>
<A NAME="2624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1672><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Rahab&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;</font>), the mythical sea monster that represents the forces of chaos in ancient Near Eastern literature. In the translation the words &#8220;the great sea monster&#8221; have been supplied appositionally in order to clarify &#8220;Rahab.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2625"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1673><b>sn</b> Here again there are possible mythological allusions or polemics. The god Yam, &#8220;Sea,&#8221; was important in Ugaritic as a god of chaos. And Rahab is another name for the monster of the deep (see Job 9:13).</p>
<A NAME="2626"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1674><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;wind&#8221;; or perhaps &#8220;Spirit.&#8221; The same Hebrew word, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ruakh</font>), may be translated as &#8220;wind,&#8221; &#8220;breath,&#8221; or &#8220;spirit/Spirit&#8221; depending on the context.</p>
<A NAME="2627"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1675><b>sn</b> Here too is a reference to pagan views indirectly. The fleeing serpent was a designation for Leviathan, whom the book will simply describe as an animal, but the pagans thought to be a monster of the deep. God&#8217;s power over nature is associated with defeat of pagan gods (see further W. F. Albright, <i>Yahweh and the Gods of Canaan</i>; idem, <i>BASOR</i> 53 [1941]: 39).</p>
<A NAME="2628"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1676><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the ends of his ways,&#8221; meaning &#8220;the fringes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2629"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1677><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;how little is the word.&#8221; Here &#8220;little&#8221; means a &#8220;fraction&#8221; or an &#8220;echo.&#8221;</p>
