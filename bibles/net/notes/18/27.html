<A NAME="271"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1678><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mashal</font>) is characteristically &#8220;proverb; by-word.&#8221; It normally refers to a brief saying, but can be used for a discourse (see A. R. Johnson, &#8220;<font face="Scholar">Mas&#338;al</font>,&#8221; VTSup 3 [1955]: 162ff.).</p>
<A NAME="272"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1679><b>tn</b> The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khay-</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>) is the oath formula: &#8220;as God lives.&#8221; In other words, the speaker is staking God&#8217;s life on the credibility of the words. It is like saying, &#8220;As truly as God is alive.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="273"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1680><b>tn</b> &#8220;My judgment&#8221; would here, as before, be &#8220;my right.&#8221; God has taken this away by afflicting Job unjustly (A. B. Davidson, <i>Job</i>, 187).</p>
<A NAME="274"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1681><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1461;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hemar</font>) is the Hiphil perfect from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">marar</font>, &#8220;to be bitter&#8221;) and hence, &#8220;to make bitter.&#8221; The object of the verb is &#8220;my soul,&#8221; which is better translated as &#8220;me&#8221; or &#8220;my life.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="275"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1682><b>tn</b> The adverb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">od</font>) was originally a noun, and so here it could be rendered &#8220;all the existence of my spirit.&#8221; The word comes between the noun in construct and its actual genitive (see GKC 415 §128.<i>e</i>).</p>
<A NAME="276"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1683><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nÿshamah</font>) is the &#8220;breath&#8221; that was breathed into Adam in Gen 2:7. Its usage includes the animating breath, the spiritual understanding, and the functioning conscience &#8211; so the whole spirit of the person. The other word in this verse, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ruakh</font>), may be translated as &#8220;wind,&#8221; &#8220;breath,&#8221; or &#8220;spirit/Spirit&#8221; depending on the context. Here, since it talks about the nostrils, it should be translated &#8220;breath.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="277"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1684><b>tn</b> The verse begins with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>), the formula used for the content of the oath (&#8220;God lives&#8230;if I do/do not&#8230;&#8221;). Thus, the content of the oath proper is here in v. 4.</p>
<A NAME="278"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1685><b>tn</b> The verb means &#8220;to utter; to mumble; to meditate.&#8221; The implication is that he will not communicate deceitful things, no matter how quiet or subtle.</p>
<A NAME="279"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1686><b>tn</b> The text uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492; &#1500;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khalilah li</font>) meaning &#8220;far be it from me,&#8221; or more strongly, something akin to &#8220;sacrilege.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1687><b>tn</b> In the Hebrew text &#8220;you&#8221; is plural &#8211; a reference to Eliphaz, Zophar, and Bildad. To make this clear, &#8220;three&#8221; is supplied in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="2711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1688><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my heart.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1689><b>tn</b> The prepositional phrase &#8220;from my days&#8221; probably means &#8220;from the days of my birth,&#8221; or &#8220;all my life.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1690><b>sn</b> Of course, he means like his enemy when he is judged, not when he is thriving in prosperity and luxury.</p>
<A NAME="2714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1691><b>tn</b> The form is the Hitpolel participle from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qum</font>): &#8220;those who are rising up against me,&#8221; or &#8220;my adversary.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1692><b>tc</b> The LXX made a free paraphrase: &#8220;No, but let my enemies be as the overthrow of the ungodly, and they that rise up against me as the destruction of transgressors.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1693><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yivtsa</font>&#8217;) means &#8220;to cut off.&#8221; It could be translated transitively or intransitively &#8211; the latter is better here (&#8220;when he is cut off&#8221;). Since the next line speaks of prayer, some have thought this verse should be about prayer. Mandelkern, in his concordance (p. 228b), suggested the verb should be &#8220;when he prays&#8221; (reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;</font> [<font face="Scholar">yifga</font>&#8217;] in place of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1506;</font> [<font face="Scholar">yivtsa</font>&#8217;]).</p>
<A NAME="2717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1694><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yeshel</font>) is found only here. It has been related spoils [or sheaves]&#8221;); <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>, &#8220;to ask&#8221;); <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nasa</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to lift up&#8221; [i.e., pray]); and a host of others.</p>
<A NAME="2718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1695><b>tn</b> See the note on 22:26 where the same verb is employed.</p>
<A NAME="2719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1696><b>tn</b> The object suffix is in the plural, which gives some support to the idea Job is speaking to them.</p>
<A NAME="2720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1697><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the hand of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2721"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1698><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[what is] with Shaddai.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2722"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1699><b>tn</b> The interrogative uses the demonstrative pronoun in its emphatic position: &#8220;Why in the world&#8230;?&#8221; (<i>IBHS</i> 312-13 §17.4.3c).</p>
<A NAME="2723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1700><b>tn</b> The text has the noun &#8220;vain thing; breath; vapor,&#8221; and then a denominative verb from the same root: &#8220;to become vain with a vain thing,&#8221; or &#8220;to do in vain a vain thing.&#8221; This is an example of the internal object, or a cognate accusative (see GKC 367 §117.<i>q</i>). The LXX has &#8220;you all know that you are adding vanity to vanity.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1701><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;allotted by God&#8221; interprets the simple prepositional phrase in the text: &#8220;with/from God.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1702><b>tn</b> R. Gordis (<i>Job</i>, 294) identifies this as a breviloquence. Compare Ps 92:8 where the last two words also constitute the apodosis.</p>
<A NAME="2726"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1703><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;will not be satisfied with bread/food.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2727"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1704><b>tn</b> The text says &#8220;will be buried in/by death.&#8221; A number of passages in the Bible use &#8220;death&#8221; to mean the plague that kills (see Jer 15:2; Isa 28:3; and BDB 89 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font> 2.a). In this sense it is like the English expression for the plague, &#8220;the Black Death.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2728"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1705><b>tc</b> The LXX has &#8220;their widows&#8221; to match the plural, and most commentators harmonize in the same way.</p>
<A NAME="2729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1706><b>tn</b> The text simply repeats the verb from the last clause. It could be treated as a separate short clause: &#8220;He may store it up, but the righteous will wear it. But it also could be understood as the object of the following verb, &#8220;[what] he stores up the righteous will wear.&#8221; The LXX simply has, &#8220;All these things shall the righteous gain.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2730"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1707><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ash</font>, &#8220;like a moth&#8221;), but this leaves room for clarification. Some commentators wanted to change it to &#8220;bird&#8217;s nest&#8221; or just &#8220;nest&#8221; (cf. NRSV) to make the parallelism; see Job 4:14. But the word is not found. The LXX has a double expression, &#8220;as moths, as a spider.&#8221; So several take it as the spider&#8217;s web, which is certainly unsubstantial (cf. NAB, NASB, NLT; see Job 8:14).</p>
<A NAME="2731"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1708><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word is the word for &#8220;booth,&#8221; as in the Feast of Booths. The word describes something that is flimsy; it is not substantial at all.</p>
<A NAME="2732"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1709><b>tc</b> The verb is the Niphal <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1461;&#1488;&#1464;&#1505;&#1461;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ye</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asef</font>), from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asaf</font>, &#8220;to gather&#8221;). So, &#8220;he lies down rich, but he is not gathered.&#8221; This does not make much sense. It would mean &#8220;he will not be gathered for burial,&#8221; but that does not belong here. Many commentators accept the variant <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1465;&#1488;&#1505;&#1460;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">sif</font>) stood for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1505;&#1460;&#1497;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yosif</font>, &#8220;will [not] add&#8221;). This is what the LXX and the Syriac have. This leads to the interpretive translation that &#8220;he will do so no longer.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2733"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1710><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he is not.&#8221; One view is that this must mean that he dies, not that his wealth is gone. R. Gordis (<i>Job</i>, 295) says the first part should be made impersonal: &#8220;when one opens one&#8217;s eyes, the wicked is no longer there.&#8221; E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 396) has it more simply: &#8220;He has opened his eyes, and it is for the last time.&#8221; But the other view is that the wealth goes overnight. In support of this is the introduction into the verse of the wealthy. The RSV, NRSV, ESV, and NLT take it that &#8220;wealth is gone.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2734"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1711><b>tn</b> Many commentators want a word parallel to &#8220;in the night.&#8221; And so we are offered <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bayyom</font>, &#8220;in the day&#8221;) for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khammayim</font>, &#8220;like waters&#8221;) as well as a number of others. But &#8220;waters&#8221; sometimes stand for major calamities, and so may be retained here. Besides, not all parallel structures are synonymous.</p>
<A NAME="2735"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1712><b>tn</b> The verb is once again functioning in an adverbial sense. The text has &#8220;it hurls itself against him and shows no mercy.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2736"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1713><b>tn</b> If the same subject is to be carried through here, it is the wind. That would make this a bold personification, perhaps suggesting the force of the wind. Others argue that it is unlikely that the wind claps its hands. They suggest taking the verb with an indefinite subject: &#8220;he claps&#8221; means &#8220;one claps. The idea is that of people rejoicing when the wicked are gone. But the parallelism is against this unless the second line is changed as well. R. Gordis (<i>Job</i>, 296) has &#8220;men will clap their hands&#8230;men will whistle upon him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2737"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1714><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;hisses at him from its place&#8221; (ESV).</p>
