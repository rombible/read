<A NAME="3335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2034><b>sn</b> The verse is describing the way God can preserve someone from dying by sending a messenger (translated here as &#8220;angel&#8221;), who could be human or angelic. This messenger will interpret/mediate God&#8217;s will. By &#8220;one &#8230; out of a thousand&#8221; Elihu could have meant either that one of the thousands of messengers at God&#8217;s disposal might be sent or that the messenger would be unique (see Eccl 7:28; and cp. Job 9:3).</p>
