<A NAME="3324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2023><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and seals their bonds.&#8221; The form of the present translation, &#8220;and terrifies them with warnings,&#8221; is derived only by emending the text. Aquila, the Vulgate, Syriac, and Targum Job have &#8220;their correction&#8221; for &#8220;their bond,&#8221; which is what the KJV used. But the LXX, Aquila, and the Syriac have &#8220;terrifies&#8221; for the verb. This involves a change in pointing from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1495;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yakhtom</font>) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿkhittem</font>). The LXX has &#8220;appearances of fear&#8221; instead of &#8220;bonds.&#8221; The point of the verse seems to be that by terrifying dreams God makes people aware of their ways.</p>
