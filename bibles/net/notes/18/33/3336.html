<A NAME="3336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2035><b>tn</b> This is a smoother reading. The MT has &#8220;to tell to a man his uprightness,&#8221; to reveal what is right for him. The LXX translated this word &#8220;duty&#8221;; the choice is adopted by some commentaries. However, that is too far from the text, which indicates that the angel/messenger is to call the person to uprightness.</p>
