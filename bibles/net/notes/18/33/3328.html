<A NAME="3328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2027><b>tc</b> Here is another difficult line. The verb normally means &#8220;to pass through; to pass over,&#8221; and so this word would normally mean &#8220;from passing through [or over].&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shelakh</font>) does at times refer to a weapon, but most commentators look for a parallel with &#8220;the pit [or corruption].&#8221; One suggestion is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">olah</font>, &#8220;to Sheol&#8221;), proposed by Duhm. Dhorme thought it was <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shalakh</font>) and referred to the passageway to the underworld (see M. Tsevat, <i>VT</i> 4 [1954]: 43; and Svi Rin, <i>BZ</i> 7 [1963]: 25). See discussion of options in <i>HALOT</i> 1517-18 s.v. IV <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;</font>. The idea of crossing the river of death fits the idea of the passage well, although the reading &#8220;to perish by the sword&#8221; makes sense and was followed by the NIV.</p>
