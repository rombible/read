<A NAME="3329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2028><b>tc</b> The MT has the passive form, and so a subject has to be added: &#8220;[a man] is chastened.&#8221; The LXX has the active form, indicating &#8220;[God] chastens,&#8221; but the object &#8220;a man&#8221; has to be added. It is understandable why the LXX thought this was active, within this sequence of verbs; and that is why it is the inferior reading.</p>
