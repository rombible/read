<A NAME="335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2004><b>tc</b> This expression is unusual; R. Gordis (<i>Job</i>, 371) says it can be translated, &#8220;the purity of my heart [is reflected] in my words,&#8221; but that is far-fetched and awkward. So there have been suggestions for emending <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yosher</font>, &#8220;uprightness&#8221;). Kissane&#8217;s makes the most sense if a change is desired: &#8220;shall reveal&#8221; (an Arabic sense of <font face="Scholar">yasher</font>), although Holscher interpreted &#8220;shall affirm&#8221; (<font face="Scholar">yasher</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>with a Syriac sense). Dhorme has &#8220;my heart will repeat&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yashur</font>), but this is doubtful. If Kissane&#8217;s view is taken, it would say, &#8220;my heart will reveal my words.&#8221; Some commentators would join &#8220;and knowledge&#8221; to this colon, and read &#8220;words of knowledge&#8221; &#8211; but that requires even more emendations.</p>
