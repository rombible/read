<A NAME="236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1559><b>tn</b> The form in Hebrew is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1502;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">emtsa</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ehu</font>), simply &#8220;and I will find him.&#8221; But in the optative clause this verb is subordinated to the preceding verb: &#8220;O that I knew where [and] I might find him.&#8221; It is not unusual to have the perfect verb followed by the imperfect in such coordinate clauses (see GKC 386 §120.<i>e</i>). This could also be translated making the second verb a complementary infinitive: &#8220;knew how to find him.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> H. H. Rowley (<i>Job</i> [NCBC], 159) quotes Strahan without reference: &#8220;It is the chief distinction between Job and his friends that he desires to meet God and they do not.&#8221;</p>
