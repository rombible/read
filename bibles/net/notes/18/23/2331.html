<A NAME="2331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1584><b>tn</b> This is a very difficult verse. The Hebrew text literally says: &#8220;for I have not been destroyed because of darkness, and because of my face [which] gloom has covered.&#8221; Most commentators omit the negative adverb, which gives the meaning that Job is enveloped in darkness and reduced to terror. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nitsmatti</font>) means &#8220;I have been silent&#8221; (as in Arabic and Aramaic), and so obviously the negative must be retained &#8211; he has not been silent.</p>
