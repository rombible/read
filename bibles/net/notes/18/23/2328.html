<A NAME="2328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1581><b>tn</b> The text has &#8220;my decree,&#8221; which means &#8220;the decree [plan] for/against me.&#8221; The suffix is objective, equivalent to a dative of disadvantage. The Syriac and the Vulgate actually have &#8220;his decree.&#8221; R. Gordis (<i>Job</i>, 262) suggests taking it in the same sense as in Job 14:5: &#8220;my limit.&#8221;.</p>
