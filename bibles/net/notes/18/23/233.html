<A NAME="233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1556><b>tc</b> The MT (followed by the Vulgate and Targum) has &#8220;my hand is heavy on my groaning.&#8221; This would mean &#8220;my stroke is heavier than my groaning&#8221; (an improbable view from Targum Job). A better suggestion is that the meaning would be that Job tries to suppress his groans but the hand with which he suppresses them is too heavy (H. H. Rowley, <i>Job</i> [NCBC], 159). Budde, E. Dhorme, J. E. Hartley, and F. I. Andersen all maintain the MT as the more difficult reading. F. I. Andersen (<i>Job </i>[TOTC], 208) indicates that the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew"> &#1460;&#1497;</font>(<font face="Scholar">i</font>) suffix could be an example of an unusual third masculine singular. Both the LXX and the Syriac versions have &#8220;his hand,&#8221; and many modern commentators follow this, along with the present translation. In this case the referent of &#8220;his&#8221; would be God, whose hand is heavy upon Job in spite of Job&#8217;s groaning.</p>
