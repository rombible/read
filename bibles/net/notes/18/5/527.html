<A NAME="527"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=337><b>sn</b> Eliphaz affirms that if he were in Job&#8217;s place he would take refuge in God, but Job has to acknowledge that he has offended God and accept this suffering as his chastisement. Job eventually will submit to God in the end, but not in the way that Eliphaz advises here, for Job does not agree that the sufferings are judgments from God.</p>
