<A NAME="565"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=375><b>tn</b> The construction is an implied relative clause. The literal rendering would simply be &#8220;the man God corrects him.&#8221; The suffix on the verb is a resumptive pronoun, completing the use of the relative clause. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yakhakh</font>) is a legal term; it always has some sense of a charge, dispute, or conflict. Its usages show that it may describe a strife breaking out, a charge or quarrel in progress, or the settling of a dispute (Isa 1:18). The derived noun can mean &#8220;reproach; recrimination; charge&#8221; (13:6; 23:4). Here the emphasis is on the consequence of the charge brought, namely, the correction. </p>
