<A NAME="580"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">80</span><note=390><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your covenant is with the stones of the field.&#8221; The line has been variously interpreted and translated. It is omitted in the LXX. It seems to mean there is a deep sympathy between man and nature. Some think it means that the boundaries will not be violated by enemies; Rashi thought it represented some species of beings, like genii of the field, and so read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adone</font>,<i> </i>&#8220;lords&#8221;) for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avne</font>, &#8220;stones&#8221;). Ball takes the word as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿne</font>, &#8220;sons&#8221;), as in &#8220;sons of the field,&#8221; to get the idea that the reference is to the beasts. E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 71) rejects these ideas as too contrived; he says to have a pact with the stones of the field simply means the stones will not come and spoil the ground, making it less fertile.</p>
