<A NAME="567"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=377><b>sn</b> The name Shaddai occurs 31 times in the book. This is its first occurrence. It is often rendered &#8220;Almighty&#8221; because of the LXX and some of the early fathers. The etymology and meaning of the word otherwise remains uncertain, in spite of attempts to connect it to &#8220;mountains&#8221; or &#8220;breasts.&#8221;</p>
