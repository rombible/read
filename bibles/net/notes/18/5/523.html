<A NAME="523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=333><b>tn</b> There is a slight difficulty here in that vv. 6 and 7 seem to be saying the opposite thing. Many commentators, therefore, emend the the Niphal <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yullad</font>, &#8220;is born&#8221;) to an active participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1461;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yoled</font>, &#8220;begets&#8221;) to place the source of trouble in man himself. But the LXX seems to retain the passive idea: &#8220;man is born to trouble.&#8221; The contrast between the two verses does not seem too difficult, for it still could imply that trouble&#8217;s source is within the man.</p>
