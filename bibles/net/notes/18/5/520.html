<A NAME="520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=330><b>tn</b> The LXX has several variations for the line. It reads something like the following: &#8220;for what they have collected the just shall eat, but they shall not be delivered out of calamities; let their strength be utterly exhausted.&#8221; The LXX may have gotten the idea of the &#8220;righteous&#8221; as those who suffer from hunger. Instead of &#8220;thorns&#8221; the LXX has the idea of &#8220;trouble.&#8221; The Targum to Job interprets it with &#8220;shield&#8221; and adds &#8220;warriors&#8221; as the subject.</p>
