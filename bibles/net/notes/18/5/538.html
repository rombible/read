<A NAME="538"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=348><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;who gives.&#8221; The participle continues the doxology here. But the article is necessary because of the distance between this verse and the reference to God.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>He gives rain</i>. The use of the verb &#8220;gives&#8221; underscores the idea that rain is a gift from God. This would be more keenly felt in the Middle East where water is scarce.</p>
