<A NAME="542"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=352><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;setting.&#8221; The infinitive construct clause is here taken as explaining the nature of God, and so parallel to the preceding descriptions. If read simply as a purpose clause after the previous verse, it would suggest that the purpose of watering the earth was to raise the humble (cf. NASB, &#8220;And sends water on the fields, // So that He sets on high those who are lowly&#8221;). A. B. Davidson (<i>Job</i>, 39) makes a case for this interpretation, saying that God&#8217;s gifts in nature have the wider purpose of blessing man, but he prefers to see the line as another benevolence, parallel to v. 10, and so suggests a translation &#8220;setting up&#8221; rather than &#8220;to set up.&#8221;</p>
