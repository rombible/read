<A NAME="545"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=355><b>tn</b> The perfect verb may be translated &#8220;be set on high; be raised up.&#8221; E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 64) notes that the perfect is parallel to the infinitive of the first colon, and so he renders it in the same way as the infinitive, comparing the construction to that of 28:25.</p>
