<A NAME="519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=329><b>tn</b> The verb has been given many different renderings, some more radical than others: &#8220;engulf,&#8221; &#8220;draws,&#8221; &#8220;gather,&#8221; &#8220;swallow&#8221; (see H. H. Rowley, <i>Job</i> [NCBC], 53). The idea of &#8220;swallow&#8221; is found in Job 20:15. The general sense of the line is clear, in spite of the difficulties of determining the exact meaning of the verb.</p>
