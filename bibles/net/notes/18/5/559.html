<A NAME="559"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=369><b>tn</b> The juxtaposition of &#8220;from the sword from their mouth&#8221; poses translation difficulties. Some <sc>mss do not have the preposition on &#8220;their mouth,&#8221; but render the expression as a construct: &#8220;from the sword of their mouth.&#8221; This would mean their tongue, and by metonymy, what they say. The expression &#8220;from their mouth&#8221; corresponds well with &#8220;from the hand&#8221; in the next colon. And as E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 67) notes, what is missing is a parallel in the first part with &#8220;the poor&#8221; in the second. So he follows Cappel in repointing &#8220;from the sword&#8221; as a Hophal participle, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1465;&#1495;&#1459;&#1512;&#1464;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mokhorav</font>), meaning &#8220;the ruined.&#8221; If a change is required, this has the benefit of only changing the pointing. The difficulty with this is that the word &#8220;desolate, ruined&#8221; is not used for people, but only to cities, lands, or mountains. The sense of the verse can be supported from the present pointing: &#8220;from the sword [which comes] from their mouth&#8221;; the second phrase could also be in apposition, meaning, &#8220;from the sword, i.e., from their mouth.&#8221;</p>
