<A NAME="578"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=388><b>tc</b> The repetition of &#8220;destruction&#8221; and &#8220;famine&#8221; here has prompted some scholars to delete the whole verse. Others try to emend the text. The LXX renders them as &#8220;the unrighteous and the lawless.&#8221; But there is no difficulty in having the repetition of the words as found in the MT.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The word for &#8220;famine&#8221; is an Aramaic word found again in 30:3. The book of Job has a number of Aramaisms that are used to form an alternative parallel expression (see notes on &#8220;witness&#8221; in 16:19).</p>
