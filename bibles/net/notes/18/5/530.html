<A NAME="530"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=340><b>tn</b> The imperfect verbs in this verse express not so much what Eliphaz does as what he would do if he were in Job&#8217;s place (even though in 13:3 we have the affirmation). The use fits the category of the imperfect used in conditional clauses (see GKC 319 §107.<i>x</i>).</p>
