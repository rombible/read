<A NAME="516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=326><b>tn</b> The MT reads &#8220;whose harvest the hungry eat up.&#8221; Some commentators want to follow the LXX and repoint <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1456;&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qÿtsiro</font>, &#8220;his harvest&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1510;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qatsÿru</font>, &#8220;[what] they have reaped&#8221;; cf. NAB). The reference as it stands in the MT seems to be to the image of taking root in v. 3; whatever took root &#8211; the prosperity of his life &#8211; will not belong to him or his sons to enjoy. If the emendation is accepted, then the reference would be immediately to the &#8220;sons&#8221; in the preceding verse.</p>
