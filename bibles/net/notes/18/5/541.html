<A NAME="541"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=351><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khutsot</font>) basically means &#8220;outside,&#8221; or what is outside. It could refer to streets if what is meant is outside the house; but it refers to fields here (parallel to the more general word) because it is outside the village. See Ps 144:13 for the use of the expression for &#8220;countryside.&#8221; The LXX gives a much wider interpretation: &#8220;what is under heaven.&#8221;</p>
