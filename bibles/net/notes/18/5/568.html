<A NAME="568"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=378><b>sn</b> Verses 18-23 give the reasons why someone should accept the chastening of God &#8211; the hand that wounds is the same hand that heals. But, of course, the lines do not apply to Job because his suffering is not due to divine chastening.</p>
