<A NAME="511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=321><b>tn</b> The imperfect verbs in this verse describe the condition of the accursed situation. Some commentators follow the LXX and take these as jussives, making this verse the curse that the man pronounced upon the fool. Rashi adds &#8220;This is the malediction with which I have cursed him.&#8221; That would make the speaker the one calling down the judgment on the fool rather than responding by observation how God destroyed the habitation of the fool.</p>
