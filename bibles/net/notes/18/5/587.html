<A NAME="587"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">87</span><note=397><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">paqad</font>, &#8220;to visit&#8221;). The idea here is &#8220;to gather together; to look over; to investigate,&#8221; or possibly even &#8220;to number&#8221; as it is used in the book of Numbers. The verb is the perfect with the <i>vav</i> consecutive; it may be subordinated to the imperfect verb that follows to form a temporal clause.</p>
