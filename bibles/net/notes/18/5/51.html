<A NAME="51"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=311><b>tn</b> Some commentators transpose this verse with the following paragraph, placing it after v. 7 (see E. Dhorme, <i>Job</i>, 62). But the reasons for this are based on the perceived development of the argument and are not that compelling.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The imperative is here a challenge for Job. If he makes his appeal against God, who is there who will listen? The rhetorical questions are intended to indicate that no one will respond, not even the angels. Job would do better to realize that he is guilty and his only hope is in God.</p>
