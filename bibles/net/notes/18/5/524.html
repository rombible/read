<A NAME="524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=334><b>tn</b> For the Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;&#1512;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿne reshef</font>, &#8220;sons of the flame&#8221;) the present translation has the rendering &#8220;sparks.&#8221; E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 62) thinks it refers to some kind of bird, but renders it &#8220;sons of the lightning&#8221; because the eagle was associated with lightning in ancient interpretations. Sparks, he argues, do not soar high above the earth. Other suggestions include Resheph, the Phoenician god of lightning (Pope), the fire of passion (Buttenwieser), angels (Peake), or demons (Targum Job). None of these are convincing; the idea of sparks flying upward fits the translation well and makes clear sense in the passage.</p>
