<A NAME="3654"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=2198><b>tn</b> Peake knew of over thirty interpretations for this verse. The MT literally says, &#8220;He declares his purpose [or his shout] concerning it; cattle also concerning what rises.&#8221; Dhorme has it: &#8220;The flock which sniffs the coming storm has warned the shepherd.&#8221; Kissane: &#8220;The thunder declares concerning him, as he excites wrath against iniquity.&#8221; Gordis translates it: &#8220;His thunderclap proclaims his presence, and the storm his mighty wrath.&#8221; Many more could be added to the list.</p>
