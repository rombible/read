<A NAME="3615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2159><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he seats them forever and exalts them.&#8221; The last verb can be understood as expressing a logical consequence of the preceding action (cf. GKC 328 §111.<i>l</i> = &#8220;he seats them forever so that he exalts them&#8221;). Or the two verbs can be taken as an adverbial hendiadys whereby the first modifies the second adverbially: &#8220;he exalts them by seating them forever&#8221; or &#8220;when he seats them forever&#8221; (cf. GKC 326 §111.<i>d</i>). Some interpret this verse to say that God seats kings on the throne, making a change in subject in the middle of the verse. But it makes better sense to see the righteous as the subject matter throughout &#8211; they are not only protected, but are exalted.</p>
