<A NAME="372"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=207><b>sn</b> Since he has survived birth, Job wonders why he could not have died a premature death. He wonders why God gives light and life to those who are in misery.

He closes his initial complaint with some depictions of his suffering that afflicts him and gives him no rest (24-26).</p>
