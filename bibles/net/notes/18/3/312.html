<A NAME="312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=147><b>sn</b> This expression by Job is the negation of the divine decree at creation &#8211; &#8220;Let there be light,&#8221; and that was the first day. Job wishes that his first day be darkness: &#8220;As for that day, let there be darkness.&#8221; Since only God has this prerogative, Job adds the wish that God on high would not regard that day.</p>
