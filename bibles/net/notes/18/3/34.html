<A NAME="34"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=139><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his day&#8221; (so KJV, ASV, NAB). The Syriac has &#8220;the day on which he was born.&#8221; The context makes it clear that Job meant the day of his birth. But some have tried to offer a different interpretation, such as his destiny or his predicament. For this reason the Syriac clarified the meaning for their readers in much the same way as the present translation does by rendering &#8220;his day&#8221; as &#8220;the day he was born.&#8221; On the Syriac translation of the book of Job, see Heidi M. Szpek, <i>Translation Technique in the Peshitta to Job</i> (SBLDS).</p>
