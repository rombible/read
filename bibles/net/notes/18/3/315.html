<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=150><b>sn</b> The translation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1493;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsalmavet</font>, &#8220;shadow of death&#8221;) has been traditionally understood to indicate a dark, death shadow (supported in the LXX), but many scholars think it may not represent the best etymological analysis of the word. The word may be connected to an Arabic word which means &#8220;to be dark,&#8221; and an Akkadian word meaning &#8220;black.&#8221; It would then have to be repointed throughout its uses to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsalmut</font>) forming an abstract ending. It would then simply mean &#8220;darkness&#8221; rather than &#8220;shadow of death.&#8221; Or the word can be understood as an idiomatic expression meaning &#8220;gloom&#8221; that is deeper than <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khoshekh</font>; see <i>HALOT</i> 1029 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1493;&#1462;&#1514;</font>). Since &#8220;darkness&#8221; has already been used in the line, the two together could possibly form a nominal hendiadys: &#8220;Let the deepest darkness&#8230;.&#8221; There is a significant amount of literature on this; one may begin with W. L. Michel, &#8220;SLMWT, &#8216;Deep Darkness&#8217; or &#8216;Shadow of Death&#8217;?&#8221; <i>BR</i> 29 (1984): 5-20.</p>
