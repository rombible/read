<A NAME="340"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=175><b>tn</b> The translation &#8220;at birth&#8221; is very smooth, but catches the meaning and avoids the tautology in the verse. The line literally reads &#8220;from the womb.&#8221; The second half of the verse has the verb &#8220;I came out/forth&#8221; which does double duty for both parallel lines. The second half uses &#8220;belly&#8221; for the womb. </p>
