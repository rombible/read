<A NAME="387"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">87</span><note=222><b>sn</b> After speaking of people in general (in the plural in vv. 21 and 22), Job returns to himself specifically (in the singular, using the same word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1512;</font> [<font face="Scholar">gever</font>, &#8220;a man&#8221;] that he employed of himself in v. 3). He is the man whose way is hidden. The clear path of his former life has been broken off, or as the next clause says, hedged in so that he is confined to a life of suffering. The statement includes the spiritual perplexities that this involves. It is like saying that God is leading him in darkness and he can no longer see where he is going.</p>
