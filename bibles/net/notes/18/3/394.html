<A NAME="394"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">94</span><note=229><b>tn</b> The construction uses the cognate accusative with the verb: &#8220;the fear I feared,&#8221; or &#8220;the dread thing I dreaded&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1491; &#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">pakhad pakhadti</font>). The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pakhad</font>) has the sense of &#8220;dread&#8221; and the noun the meaning &#8220;thing dreaded.&#8221; The structure of the sentence with the perfect verb followed by the preterite indicates that the first action preceded the second &#8211; he feared something but then it happened. Some commentaries suggest reading this as a conditional clause followed by the present tense translation: &#8220;If I fear a thing it happens to me&#8221; (see A. B. Davidson, <i>Job</i>, 24). The reason for this change is that it is hard for some to think that in his prime Job had such fears. He did have a pure trust and confidence in the <sc>Lord (16:19, 29:18ff). But on the other hand, he did make sacrifices for his sons because he thought they might sin. There is evidence to suggest that he was aware that calamity could strike, and this is not necessarily incompatible with trust.</p>
