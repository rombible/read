<A NAME="374"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=209><b>tn</b> The verb is the simple imperfect, expressing the progressive imperfect nuance. But there is no formal subject to the verb, prompting some translations to make it passive in view of the indefinite subject (so, e.g., NAB, NIV, NRSV). Such a passive could be taken as a so-called &#8220;divine passive&#8221; by which God is the implied agent. Job clearly means God here, but he stops short of naming him (see also the note on &#8220;God&#8221; earlier in this verse).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In vv. 11, 12, and 16 there was the first series of questions in which Job himself was in question. Now the questions are more general for all mankind &#8211; why should the sufferers in general have been afflicted with life?</p>
