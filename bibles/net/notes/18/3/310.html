<A NAME="310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=145><b>sn</b> The announcement at birth is to the fact that a male was conceived. The same parallelism between &#8220;brought forth/born&#8221; and &#8220;conceived&#8221; may be found in Ps 51:7 HT (51:5 ET). The motifs of the night of conception and the day of birth will be developed by Job. For the entire verse, which is more a wish or malediction than a curse, see S. H. Blank, &#8220;&#8216;Perish the Day!&#8217; A Misdirected Curse (Job 3:3),&#8221; <i>Prophetic Thought</i>, 61-63.</p>
