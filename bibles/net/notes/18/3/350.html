<A NAME="350"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=185><b>tn</b> The difficult term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1459;&#1512;&#1464;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khoravot</font>) is translated &#8220;desolate [places]&#8221;. The LXX confused the word and translated it &#8220;who gloried in their swords.&#8221; One would expect a word for monuments, or tombs (T. K. Cheyne emended it to &#8220;everlasting tombs&#8221; [&#8220;More Critical Gleanings in Job,&#8221; <i>ExpTim </i>10 (1898/99): 380-83]). But this difficult word is of uncertain etymology and therefore cannot simply be made to mean &#8220;royal tombs.&#8221; The verb means &#8220;be desolate, solitary.&#8221; In Isa 48:21 there is the clear sense of a desert. That is the meaning of Assyrian <font face="Scholar">huribtu</font><i>.</i> It may be that like the pyramids of Egypt these tombs would have been built in the desert regions. Or it may describe how they rebuilt ruins for themselves. He would be saying then that instead of lying here in pain and shame if he had died he would be with the great ones of the earth. Otherwise, the word could be interpreted as a metonymy of effect, indicating that the once glorious tomb now is desolate. But this does not fit the context &#8211; the verse is talking about the state of the great ones after their death.</p>
