<A NAME="396"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">96</span><note=231><b>tn</b> The final verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yavo</font>&#8217;, &#8220;has come&#8221;). It appears to be an imperfect, but since it is parallel to the preterite of the first colon it should be given that nuance here. Of course, if the other view of the verse is taken, then this would simply be translated as &#8220;comes,&#8221; and the preceding preterite also given an English present tense translation.</p>
