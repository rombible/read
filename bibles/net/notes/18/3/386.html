<A NAME="386"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">86</span><note=221><b>tn</b> This first part of the verse, &#8220;Why is light given,&#8221; is supplied from the context. In the Hebrew text the verse simply begins with &#8220;to a man&#8230;.&#8221; It is also in apposition to the construction in v. 20. But after so many qualifying clauses and phrases, a restatement of the subject (light, from v. 20) is required.</p>
