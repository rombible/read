<A NAME="389"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">89</span><note=224><b>tn</b> The verb is the Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sakhakh</font>,&#8220;to hedge in&#8221;). The key parallel passage is Job 19:8, which says, &#8220;He has blocked [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">gadar</font>] my way so I cannot pass, and has set darkness over my paths.&#8221; To be hedged in is an implied metaphor, indicating that the pathway is concealed and enclosed. There is an irony in Job&#8217;s choice of words in light of Satan&#8217;s accusation in 1:10. It is heightened further when the same verb is employed by God in 38:8 (see F. I. Andersen, <i>Job </i>[TOTC], 109).</p>
