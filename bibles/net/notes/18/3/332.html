<A NAME="332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=167><b>sn</b> The expression is literally &#8220;the eyelids of the morning.&#8221; This means the very first rays of dawn (see also Job 41:18). There is some debate whether it refers to &#8220;eyelids&#8221; or &#8220;eyelashes&#8221; or &#8220;eyeballs.&#8221; If the latter, it would signify the flashing eyes of a person. See for the Ugaritic background H. L. Ginsberg, <i>The Legend of King Keret </i>(BASORSup), 39; see also J. M. Steadman, &#8220;&#8216;Eyelids of Morn&#8217;: A Biblical Convention,&#8221; <i>HTR</i> 56 (1963): 159-67.</p>
