<A NAME="35"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=140><b>tn</b> The text has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">an</font>), literally, &#8220;and he answered.&#8221; The LXX simply has &#8220;saying&#8221; for the entire verse. The Syriac, Targum, and Greek A have what the MT has. &#8220;[Someone] answered and said&#8221; is phraseology characteristic of all the speeches in Job beginning with Satan in 1:9. Only in 40:1 is it employed when God is speaking. No other portion of the OT employs this phraseology as often or as consistently.</p>
