<A NAME="38"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=143><b>tn</b> The MT simply has &#8220;and the night &#8211; it said&#8230;.&#8221; By simple juxtaposition with the parallel construction (&#8220;on which I was born&#8221;) the verb &#8220;it said&#8221; must be a relative clause explaining &#8220;the night.&#8221; Rather than supply &#8220;in which&#8221; and make the verb passive (which is possible since no specific subject is provided, but leaves open the question of who said it), it is preferable to take the verse as a personification. First Job cursed the day; now he cursed the night that spoke about what it witnessed. See A. Ehrman, &#8220;A Note on the Verb &#8216;<i>amar</i>,&#8221; <i>JQR</i> 55 (1964/65): 166-67.</p>
