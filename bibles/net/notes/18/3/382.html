<A NAME="382"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">82</span><note=217><b>tn</b> The Syriac has &#8220;and gather themselves together,&#8221; possibly reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gil</font>, &#8220;rejoicing&#8221;) as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gal</font>, &#8220;heap&#8221;). Some have tried to emend the text to make the word mean &#8220;heap&#8221; or &#8220;mound,&#8221; as in a funerary mound. While one could argue for a heap of stones as a funerary mound, the passage has already spoken of digging a grave, which would be quite different. And while such a change would make a neater parallelism in the verse, there is no reason to force such; the idea of &#8220;jubilation&#8221; fits the tenor of the whole verse easily enough and there is no reason to change it. A similar expression is found in Hos 9:1, which says, &#8220;rejoice not, O Israel, with jubilation.&#8221; Here the idea then is that these sufferers would rejoice &#8220;to the point of jubilation&#8221; at death.</p>
