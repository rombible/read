<A NAME="325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=160><b>tn</b> Not everyone is satisfied with the reading of the MT. Gordis thought &#8220;day&#8221; should be &#8220;sea,&#8221; and &#8220;cursers&#8221; should be &#8220;rousers&#8221; (changing &#8217;<font face="Scholar">alef</font> to &#8217;<font face="Scholar">ayin</font>; cf. NRSV). This is an unnecessary change, for there is no textual problem in the line (D. J. A. Clines, <i>Job </i>[WBC], 71). Others have taken the reading &#8220;sea&#8221; as a personification and accepted the rest of the text, gaining the sense of &#8220;those whose magic binds even the sea monster of the deep&#8221; (e.g., NEB).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Those who curse the day</i> are probably the professional enchanters and magicians who were thought to cast spells on days and overwhelm them with darkness and misfortune. The myths explained eclipses as the dragon throwing its folds around the sun and the moon, thus engulfing or swallowing the day and the night. This interpretation matches the parallelism better than the interpretation that says these are merely professional mourners.</p>
