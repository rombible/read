One may recall the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">marah</font>, &#8220;bitter&#8221;) by Naomi to describe her pained experience as a poor widow in Ruth 1:20, or the use of the word to describe the bitter oppression inflicted on Israel by the Egyptians (Exod 1:14).
