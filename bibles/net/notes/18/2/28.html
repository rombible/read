<A NAME="28"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=95><b>sn</b> Once again the adverb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khinnam</font>, &#8220;gratis&#8221;) is used. It means &#8220;graciously, gratis, free, without cause, for no reason.&#8221; Here the sense has to be gratuitously, for no reason.&#8221; The point of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khanan</font>, &#8220;to be gracious&#8221;) and its derivatives is that the action is undeserved. In fact, they would deserve the opposite. Sinners seeking grace deserve punishment. Here, Job deserves reward, not suffering.</p>
