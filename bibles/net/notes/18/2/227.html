<A NAME="227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=114><b>tn</b> The versions have some information here that is interesting, albeit fanciful. The Targum calls her &#8220;Dinah.&#8221; The LXX has &#8220;when a long time had passed.&#8221; But the whole rendering of the LXX is paraphrastic: &#8220;How long will you hold out, saying, &#8216;Behold, I wait yet a little while, expecting the hope of my deliverance?&#8217; for behold, your memorial is abolished from the earth, even your sons and daughters, the pangs and pains of my womb which I bore in vain with sorrows, and you yourself sit down to spend the night in the open air among the corruption of worms, and I am a wanderer and a servant from place to place and house to house, waiting for the setting sun, that I may rest from my labors and pains that now beset me, but say some word against the Lord and die.&#8221;</p>
