<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=113><b>sn</b> <i>Among the ashes</i>. It is likely that the &#8220;ashes&#8221; refers to the place outside the city where the rubbish was collected and burnt, i.e., the ash-heap (cf. CEV). This is the understanding of the LXX, which reads &#8220;dung-hill outside the city.&#8221;</p>
