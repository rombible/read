<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=108><b>sn</b> The general consensus is that Job was afflicted with a leprosy known as elephantiasis, named because the rough skin and the swollen limbs are animal-like. The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿkhin</font>, &#8220;boil&#8221;) can indicate an ulcer as well. Leprosy begins with such, but so do other diseases. Leprosy normally begins in the limbs and spreads, but Job was afflicted everywhere at once. It may be some other disease also characterized by such a malignant ulcer. D. J. A. Clines has a thorough bibliography on all the possible diseases linked to this description (<i>Job </i>[WBC], 48). See also <i>HALOT</i> 1460 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font>.</p>
