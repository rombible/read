<A NAME="229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=116><b>tn</b> The verb is literally <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font>, (<font face="Scholar">barakh</font>, &#8220;bless&#8221;). As in the earlier uses, the meaning probably has more to do with renouncing God than of speaking a curse. The actual word may be taken as a theological euphemism for the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qillel</font>, &#8220;curse&#8221;). If Job&#8217;s wife had meant that he was trying to justify himself rather than God, &#8220;bless God&#8221; might be translated &#8220;speak well of God,&#8221; the resolution accepted by God in 42:7-8 following Job&#8217;s double confession of having spoken wrongly of God (40:3-5; 42:1-6). </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The church fathers were quick to see here again the role of the wife in the temptation &#8211; she acts as the intermediary between Satan and Job, pressing the cause for him. However, Job&#8217;s wife has been demonized falsely. Job did not say that she <i>was</i> a foolish woman, only that she was speaking <i>like</i> one of them (2:10). Also, Job did not exclude her from sharing in his suffering (&#8220;should we receive&#8221;). He evidently recognized that her words were the result of her personal loss and pain as well as the desire to see her husband&#8217;s suffering ended. When God gave instructions for the restoration of Job&#8217;s friends because of their foolish words (42:7-9), no mention is made of any need for Job&#8217;s wife to be restored.</p>
