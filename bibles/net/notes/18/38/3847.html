<A NAME="3847"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=2277><b>tn</b> This word is found here and in 1 Sam 15:32. Dhorme suggests, with others, that there has been a metathesis (a reversal of consonants), and it is the same word found in Job 31:36 (&#8220;bind&#8221;). G. R. Driver takes it as &#8220;cluster&#8221; without changing the text (&#8220;Two astronomical passages in the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>JTS </i>7 [1956] :3).</p>
