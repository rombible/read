<A NAME="3839"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2269><b>tn</b> The same Hebrew term (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1510;&#1464;&#1512;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">otsar</font>), has been translated &#8220;storehouse&#8221; in the first line and &#8220;armory&#8221; in the second. This has been done for stylistic variation, but also because &#8220;hail,&#8221; as one of God&#8217;s &#8220;weapons&#8221; (cf. the following verse) suggests military imagery; in this context the word refers to God&#8217;s &#8220;ammunition dump&#8221; where he stockpiles hail.</p>
