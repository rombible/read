<A NAME="3811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2241><b>sn</b> The expression &#8220;morning stars&#8221; (<i>Heb </i>&#8220;stars of the morning&#8221;) is here placed in parallelism to the angels, &#8220;the sons of God.&#8221; It may refer to the angels under the imagery of the stars, or, as some prefer, it may poetically include all creation. There is a parallel also with the foundation of the temple which was accompanied by song (see Ezra 3:10,11). But then the account of the building of the original tabernacle was designed to mirror creation (see M. Fishbane, <i>Biblical Text and Texture</i>).</p>
