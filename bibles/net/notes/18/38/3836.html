<A NAME="3836"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2266><b>tn</b> The suffixes are singular (&#8220;that you may take it to its border&#8230;to its home&#8221;), referring to either the light or the darkness. Because either is referred to, the translation has employed plurals, since singulars would imply that only the second item, &#8220;darkness,&#8221; was the referent. Plurals are also employed by NAB and NIV.</p>
