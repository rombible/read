<A NAME="381"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2231><b>sn</b> This is the culmination of it all, the revelation of the <sc>Lord to Job. Most interpreters see here the style and content of the author of the book, a return to the beginning of the book. Here the <sc>Lord speaks to Job and displays his sovereign power and glory. Job has lived through the suffering &#8211; without cursing God. He has held to his integrity, and nowhere regretted it. But he was unaware of the real reason for the suffering, and will remain unaware throughout these speeches. God intervenes to resolve the spiritual issues that surfaced. Job was not punished for sin. And Job&#8217;s suffering had not cut him off from God. In the end the point is that Job cannot have the knowledge to make the assessments he made. It is wiser to bow in submission and adoration of God than to try to judge him. The first speech of God has these sections: the challenge (38:1-3), the surpassing mysteries of earth and sky beyond Job&#8217;s understanding (4-38), and the mysteries of animal and bird life that surpassed his understanding (38:39&#8211;39:30).</p>
