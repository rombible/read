<A NAME="3823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2253><b>tn</b> The MT literally says, &#8220;here he will put on the pride of your waves.&#8221; The verb has no expressed subject and so is made a passive voice. But there has to be some object for the verb &#8220;put,&#8221; such as &#8220;limit&#8221; or &#8220;boundary&#8221;; the translations &#8220;confined; halted; stopped&#8221; all serve to paraphrase such an idea. The LXX has &#8220;broken&#8221; at this point, suggesting the verse might have been confused &#8211; but &#8220;breaking the pride&#8221; of the waves would mean controlling them. Some commentators have followed this, exchanging the verb in v. 11 with this one.</p>
