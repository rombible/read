<A NAME="3819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2249><b>tc</b> The MT has &#8220;and I broke,&#8221; which cannot mean &#8220;set, prescribed&#8221; or the like. The LXX and the Vulgate have such a meaning, suggesting a verb<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew"> &#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ashiyt</font>, &#8220;plan, prescribe&#8221;). A. Guillaume finds an Arabic word with a meaning &#8220;measured it by span by my decree.&#8221; Would God give himself a decree? R. Gordis simply argues that the basic meaning &#8220;break&#8221; develops the connotation of &#8220;decide, determine&#8221; (2 Sam 5:24; Job 14:3; Dan 11:36).</p>
