<A NAME="3829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2259><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;they stand up like a garment&#8221; (NASB, NIV) or &#8220;its features stand out like a garment&#8221; (ESV). The reference could be either to embroidered decoration on a garment or to the folds of a garment (REB: &#8220;until all things stand out like the folds of a cloak&#8221;; cf. J. E. Hartley, <i>Job</i> [NICOT], 497, &#8220;the early light of day makes the earth appear as a beautiful <i>garment, </i>exquisite in design and glorious in color&#8221;). Since this is thought to be an odd statement, some suggest with Ehrlich that the text be changed to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">titsabba</font>&#8217;, &#8220;is dyed [like a garment]&#8221;). This reference would be to the colors appearing on the earth&#8217;s surface under daylight. The present translation follows the emendation.</p>
