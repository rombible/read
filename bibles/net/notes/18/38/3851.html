<A NAME="3851"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=2281><b>tn</b> This verse is difficult because of the two words, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1467;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tukhot</font>, rendered here &#8220;heart&#8221;) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1499;&#1456;&#1493;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sekhvi</font>, here &#8220;mind&#8221;). They have been translated a number of ways: &#8220;meteor&#8221; and &#8220;celestial appearance&#8221;; the stars &#8220;Procyon&#8221; and &#8220;Sirius&#8221;; &#8220;inward part&#8221; and &#8220;mind&#8221;; even as birds, &#8220;ibis&#8221; and &#8220;cock.&#8221; One expects them to have something to do with nature &#8211; clouds and the like. The RSV accordingly took them to mean &#8220;meteor&#8221; (from a verb &#8220;to wander&#8221;) and &#8220;a celestial appearance.&#8221; But these meanings are not well-attested.</p>
