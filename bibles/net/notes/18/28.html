<A NAME="281"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1715><b>sn</b> As the book is now arranged, this chapter forms an additional speech by Job, although some argue that it comes from the writer of the book. The mood of the chapter is not despair, but wisdom; it anticipates the divine speeches in the end of the book. This poem, like many psalms in the Bible, has a refrain (vv. 12 and 20). These refrains outline the chapter, giving three sections: there is no known road to wisdom (1-11); no price can buy it (12-19); and only God has it, and only by revelation can man posses it (20-28).</p>
<A NAME="282"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1716><b>tn</b> The poem opens with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>). Some commentators think this should have been &#8220;for,&#8221; and that the poem once stood in another setting. But there are places in the Bible where this word occurs with the sense of &#8220;surely&#8221; and no other meaning (cf. Gen 18:20).</p>
<A NAME="283"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1717><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">motsa</font>&#8217;, from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font> [<font face="Scholar">yatsa</font>&#8217;, &#8220;go out&#8221;]) is the word for &#8220;mine,&#8221; or more simply, &#8220;source.&#8221; Mining was not an enormous industry in the land of Canaan or Israel; mined products were imported. Some editors have suggested alternative readings: Dahood found in the word the root for &#8220;shine&#8221; and translated the MT as &#8220;smelter.&#8221; But that is going too far. P. Joüon suggested &#8220;place of finding,&#8221; reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mimtsa</font>&#8217;) for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">motsa</font>&#8217;; see <i>Bib</i> 11 [1930]: 323).</p>
<A NAME="284"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1718><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1494;&#1465;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yazoqqu</font>) translated &#8220;refined,&#8221; comes from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zaqaq</font>), a word that basically means &#8220;to blow.&#8221; From the meaning &#8220;to blow; to distend; to inflate&#8221; derives the meaning for refining.</p>
<A NAME="285"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1719><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from dust.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="286"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1720><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatsuq</font>) is usually translated as a passive participle &#8220;is smelted&#8221; (from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1511;</font> [<font face="Scholar">yatsaq</font>, &#8220;to melt&#8221;]): &#8220;copper is smelted from the ore&#8221; (ESV) or &#8220;from the stone, copper is poured out&#8221; (as an imperfect from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;</font> [<font face="Scholar">tsuq</font>]). But the rock becomes the metal in the process. So according to R. Gordis (<i>Job</i>, 304) the translation should be: &#8220;the rock is poured out as copper.&#8221; E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 400), however, defines the form in the text as &#8220;hard,&#8221; and simply has it &#8220;hard stone becomes copper.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="287"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1721><b>sn</b> The text appears at first to be saying that by opening up a mine shaft, or by taking lights down below, the miner dispels the darkness. But the clause might be more general, meaning that man goes deep into the earth as if it were day.</p>
<A NAME="288"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1722><b>tn</b> The verse ends with &#8220;the stone of darkness and deep darkness.&#8221; The genitive would be location, describing the place where the stones are found.</p>
<A NAME="289"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1723><b>tc</b> The first part of this verse, &#8220;He cuts a shaft far from the place where people live,&#8221; has received a lot of attention. The word for &#8220;live&#8221; is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gar</font>). Some of the proposals are: &#8220;limestone,&#8221; on the basis of the LXX; &#8220;far from the light,&#8221; reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ner</font>); &#8220;by a foreign people,&#8221; taking the word to means &#8220;foreign people&#8221;; &#8220;a foreign people opening shafts&#8221;; or taking <i>gar</i> as &#8220;crater&#8221; based on Arabic. Driver puts this and the next together: &#8220;a strange people who have been forgotten cut shafts&#8221; (see <i>AJSL</i> 3 [1935]: 162). L. Waterman had &#8220;the people of the lamp&#8221; (&#8220;Note on Job 28:4,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 71 [1952]: 167ff). And there are others. Since there is really no compelling argument in favor of one of these alternative interpretations, the MT should be preserved until shown to be wrong.</p>
<A NAME="2810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1724><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;forgotten by the foot.&#8221; This means that there are people walking above on the ground, and the places below, these mines, are not noticed by the pedestrians above.</p>
<A NAME="2811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1725><b>sn</b> This is a description of the mining procedures. Dangling suspended from a rope would be a necessary part of the job of going up and down the shafts.</p>
<A NAME="2812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1726><b>sn</b> The verse has been properly understood, on the whole, as comparing the earth above and all its produce with the upheaval down below.</p>
<A NAME="2813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1727><b>tn</b> It is probably best to take &#8220;place&#8221; in construct to the rest of the colon, with an understood relative clause: &#8220;a place, the rocks of which are sapphires.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The modern stone known as sapphire is thought not to have been used until Roman times, and so some other stone is probably meant here, perhaps lapis lazuli.</p>
<A NAME="2814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1728><b>sn</b> H. H. Rowley (<i>Job</i> [NCBC], 181) suggests that if it is lapis lazuli, then the dust of gold would refer to the particles of iron pyrite found in lapis lazuli which glitter like gold.</p>
<A NAME="2815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1729><b>tn</b> The &#8220;path&#8221; could refer to the mine shaft or it could refer to wisdom. The former seems more likely in the present context; the word &#8220;hidden is supplied in the translation to indicate the mines are &#8220;hidden&#8221; from sharp-eyed birds of prey above.</p>
<A NAME="2816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1730><b>sn</b> The kind of bird mentioned here is debated. The LXX has &#8220;vulture,&#8221; and so some commentaries follow that. The emphasis on the sight favors the view that it is the falcon.</p>
<A NAME="2817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1731><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the sons of pride.&#8221; In Job 41:26 the expression refers to carnivorous wild beasts.</p>
<A NAME="2818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1732><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb is simply &#8220;to stretch out; to send&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1495;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shalakh</font>). With <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yado</font>, &#8220;his hand&#8221;) the idea is that of laying one&#8217;s hand on the rock, i.e., getting to work on the hardest of rocks.</p>
<A NAME="2819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1733><b>tn</b> The Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mishoresh</font>) means &#8220;from/at [their] root [or base].&#8221; In mining, people have gone below ground, under the mountains, and overturned rock and dirt. It is also interesting that here in a small way humans do what God does &#8211; overturn mountains (cf. 9:5).</p>
<A NAME="2820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1734><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;tunnels.&#8221; The word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1488;&#1465;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">orim</font>), the word for &#8220;rivers&#8221; and in the singular, the Nile River. Here it refers to tunnels or channels through the rocks.</p>
<A NAME="2821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1735><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his eye sees.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1736><b>tc</b> The translation &#8220;searched&#8221; follows the LXX and Vulgate; the MT reads &#8220;binds up&#8221; or &#8220;dams up.&#8221; This latter translation might refer to the damming of water that might seep into a mine (<i>HALOT </i>289 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;</font>; cf. ESV, NJPS, NASB, REB, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="2823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1737><b>tc</b> The older translations had &#8220;he binds the streams from weeping,&#8221; i.e., from trickling (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mibbÿkhi</font>). But the Ugaritic parallel has changed the understanding, reading &#8220;toward the spring of the rivers&#8221; (<i>`m mbk nhrm</i>). Earlier than that discovery, the versions had taken the word as a noun as well. Some commentators had suggested repointing the Hebrew. Some chose <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mabbÿkhe</font>, &#8220;sources&#8221;). Now there is much Ugaritic support for the reading (see G. M. Landes, <i>BASOR</i> 144 [1956]: 32f.; and H. L. Ginsberg, &#8220;The Ugaritic texts and textual criticism,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 62 [1943]: 111).</p>
<A NAME="2824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1738><b>tc</b> The LXX has &#8220;its way, apparently reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">darkhah</font>) in place of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1512;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1468;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">erkah</font>, &#8220;place&#8221;). This is adopted by most modern commentators. But R. Gordis (<i>Job</i>, 308) shows that this change is not necessary, for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">erekh</font>) in the Bible means &#8220;order; row; disposition,&#8221; and here &#8220;place.&#8221; An alternate meaning would be &#8220;worth&#8221; (NIV, ESV).</p>
<A NAME="2825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1739><b>sn</b> The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tÿhom</font>) is the &#8220;deep&#8221; of Gen 1:2, the abyss or primordial sea. It was always understood to be a place of darkness and danger. As remote as it is, it asserts that wisdom is not found there (personification). So here we have the abyss and the sea, then death and destruction &#8211; but they are not the places that wisdom resides.</p>
<A NAME="2826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1740><b>tn</b> The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet</font>) preposition is taken here to mean &#8220;with&#8221; in the light of the parallel preposition.</p>
<A NAME="2827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1741><b>tn</b> The word actually means &#8220;weighed,&#8221; that is, lifted up on the scale and weighed, in order to purchase.</p>
<A NAME="2828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1742><b>tn</b> The exact identification of these stones is uncertain. Many recent English translations, however, have &#8220;onyx&#8221; and &#8220;sapphires.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1743><b>tn</b> The word is from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zakhakh</font>, &#8220;clear&#8221;). It describes a transparent substance, and so &#8220;glass&#8221; is an appropriate translation. In the ancient world it was precious and so expensive.</p>
<A NAME="2830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1744><b>tc</b> The MT has &#8220;vase&#8221;; but the versions have a plural here, suggesting jewels of gold.</p>
<A NAME="2831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1745><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">meshekh</font>) comes from a root meaning &#8220;to grasp; to seize; to hold,&#8221; and so the derived noun means &#8220;grasping; acquiring; taking possession,&#8221; and therefore, &#8220;price&#8221; (see the discussion in R. Gordis, <i>Job</i>, 309). Gray renders it &#8220;acquisition&#8221; (so A. Cohen, <i>AJSL</i> 40 [1923/24]: 175).</p>
<A NAME="2832"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1746><b>tn</b> In Lam 4:7 these are described as red, and so have been identified as rubies (so NIV) or corals.</p>
<A NAME="2833"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1747><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Ethiopia.&#8221; In ancient times this referred to the region of the upper Nile, rather than modern Ethiopia (formerly known as Abyssinia).</p>
<A NAME="2834"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1748><b>tn</b> The refrain is repeated, except now the verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tavo</font>&#8217;, &#8220;come&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="2835"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1749><b>tn</b> The <i>vav</i> on the verb is unexpressed in the LXX. It should not be overlooked, for it introduces a subordinate clause of condition (R. Gordis, <i>Job</i>, 310).</p>
<A NAME="2836"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1750><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Abaddon.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2837"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1751><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;heard a report of it,&#8221; which means a report of its location, thus &#8220;where it can be found.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2838"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1752><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he gave weight to the wind.&#8221; The form is the infinitive construct with the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lamed</font>) preposition. Some have emended it to change the preposition to the temporal <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet</font>) on the basis of some of the versions (e.g., Latin and Syriac) that have &#8220;who made.&#8221; This is workable, for the infinitive would then take on the finite tense of the previous verbs. An infinitive of purpose does not work well, for that would be saying God looked everywhere in order to give wind its proper weight (see R. Gordis, <i>Job</i>, 310).</p>
<A NAME="2839"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1753><b>tn</b> The verb is the Piel perfect, meaning &#8220;to estimate the measure&#8221; of something. In the verse, the perfect verb continues the function of the infinitive preceding it, as if it had a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vav</font>) prefixed to it. Whatever usage that infinitive had, this verb is to continue it (see GKC 352 §114.<i>r</i>).</p>
<A NAME="2840"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1754><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;decree.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2841"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1755><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;thunderbolt,&#8221; i.e., lightning. <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the roaring of voices/sounds,&#8221; which describes the nature of the storm.</p>
<A NAME="2842"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1756><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;it&#8221;; the referent (wisdom) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2843"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1757><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">safar</font>) in the Piel basically means &#8220;to tell; to declare; to show&#8221; or &#8220;to count; to number.&#8221; Many commentators offer different suggestions for the translation. &#8220;Declared&#8221; (as in the RSV, NASB, and NRSV) would be the simplest &#8211; but to whom did God declare it? Besides &#8220;appraised&#8221; which is the view of Pope, Dhorme and others (cf. NAB, NIV), J. Reider has suggested &#8220;probed&#8221; (&#8220;Etymological studies in biblical Hebrew,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 2 [1952]: 127), Strahan has &#8220;studied,&#8221; and Kissane has &#8220;reckoned.&#8221; The difficulty is that the line has a series of verbs, which seem to build to a climax; but without more details it is hard to know how to translate them when they have such a range of meaning.</p>
<A NAME="2844"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1758><b>tc</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kun</font>) means &#8220;to establish; to prepare&#8221; in this stem. There are several <sc>mss that have the form from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bin</font>, &#8220;discern&#8221;), giving &#8220;he discerned it,&#8221; making more of a parallel with the first colon. But the weight of the evidence supports the traditional MT reading.</p>
<A NAME="2845"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1759><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khaqar</font>) means &#8220;to examine; to search out.&#8221; Some of the language used here is anthropomorphic, for the sovereign <sc>Lord did not have to research or investigate wisdom. The point is that it is as if he did this human activity, meaning that as in the results of such a search God knows everything about wisdom.</p>
<A NAME="2846"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1760><b>tc</b> A number of medieval Hebrew manuscripts have YHWH (&#8220;<sc>Lord&#8221;); <i>BHS</i> has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adonay</font>, &#8220;Lord&#8221;). As J. E. Hartley (<i>Job</i> [NICOT], 383) points out, this is the only occurrence of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adonay</font>, &#8220;Lord&#8221;) in the book of Job, creating doubt for retaining it. Normally, YHWH is avoided in the book. &#8220;Fear of&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yir</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">at</font>) is followed by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shadday</font>, &#8220;Almighty&#8221;) in 6:14 &#8211; the only other occurrence of this term for &#8220;fear&#8221; in construct with a divine title.</p>
<A NAME="2847"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1761><b>tc</b> Many commentators delete this verse because (1) many read the divine name Yahweh (translated &#8220;<sc>Lord&#8221;) here, and (2) it is not consistent with the argument that precedes it. But as H. H. Rowley (<i>Job</i> [NCBC], 185) points out, there is inconsistency in this reasoning, for many of the critics have already said that this chapter is an interpolation. Following that line of thought, then, one would not expect it to conform to the rest of the book in this matter of the divine name. And concerning the second difficulty, the point of this chapter is that wisdom is beyond human comprehension and control. It belongs to God alone. So the conclusion that the fear of the <sc>Lord is wisdom is the necessary conclusion. Rowley concludes: &#8220;It is a pity to rob the poem of its climax and turn it into the expression of unrelieved agnosticism.&#8221;</p>
