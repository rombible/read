<BODY ><p>
<A NAME="351"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2118><b>sn</b> This short speech falls into two sections: Elihu refutes Job&#8217;s claim that goodness avails nothing (35:2-8), asserting that when the cry of the afflicted goes unanswered they have not learned their lesson (35:9-16).</p>
<A NAME="352"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2119><b>tn</b> The line could be read as &#8220;do you reckon this for justice? Here &#8220;to be&#8221; is understood.</p>
<A NAME="353"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2120><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;when&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but is implied.</p>
<A NAME="354"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2121><b>tn</b> The brief line could be interpreted in a number of ways. The MT simply has &#8220;my right from God.&#8221; It could be &#8220;I am right before God,&#8221; &#8220;I am more just/right than God&#8221; (identifying the preposition as a comparative <font face="Scholar">min </font>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font>); cf. J. E. Hartley, <i>Job</i> [NICOT], 463), &#8220;I will be right before God,&#8221; or &#8220;My just cause against God.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="355"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2122><b>tn</b> The referent of &#8220;you&#8221; is usually understood to be God.</p>
<A NAME="356"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2123><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text merely says, &#8220;What do I gain from my sin?&#8221; But Job has claimed that he has not sinned, and so this has to be elliptical: &#8220;more than if I had sinned&#8221; (H. H. Rowley, <i>Job</i> [NCBC], 224). It could also be, &#8220;What do I gain without sin?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="357"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2124><b>tn</b> The emphatic pronoun calls attention to Elihu who will answer these questions.</p>
<A NAME="358"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2125><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text adds, &#8220;with words,&#8221; but since this is obvious, for stylistic reasons it has not been included in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="359"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2126><b>tn</b> The preposition is taken here as a comparative <font face="Scholar">min </font>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font>). The line could also read &#8220;that are high above you.&#8221; This idea has appeared in the speech of Eliphaz (22:12), Zophar (11:7ff.), and even Job (9:8ff.).</p>
<A NAME="3510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2127><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;him&#8221; (also in v. 7); the referent (God) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2128><b>tn</b> See Job 7:20.</p>
<A NAME="3512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2129><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;affects only&#8221; is supplied in the translation of this nominal sentence.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> According to Strahan, &#8220;Elihu exalts God&#8217;s greatness at the cost of His grace, His transcendence at the expense of His immanence. He sets up a material instead of a spiritual stand of profit and loss. He does not realize that God does gain what He desires most by the goodness of men, and loses what He most loves by their evil.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2130><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and to [or for] a son of man, your righteousness.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2131><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;people&#8221; is supplied, because the sentence only has the masculine plural verb.</p>
<A NAME="3515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2132><b>tn</b> The final noun is an abstract plural, &#8220;oppression.&#8221; There is no reason to change it to &#8220;oppressors&#8221; to fit the early versions. The expression is literally &#8220;multitude of oppression.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2133><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the arm,&#8221; a metaphor for strength or power.</p>
<A NAME="3517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2134><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;of the many&#8221; (see <i>HALOT</i> 1172 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;</font> 6.a).</p>
<A NAME="3518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2135><b>tn</b> There have been several attempts to emend the line, none of which are particularly helpful or interesting. H. H. Rowley (<i>Job</i> [NCBC], 225) says, &#8220;It is a pity to rob Elihu of a poetic line when he creates one.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2136><b>tn</b> The form in the text, the Piel participle from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alaf</font>, &#8220;teach&#8221;) is written in a contracted form; the full form is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1456;&#1508;&#1461;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">allÿfenu</font>).</p>
<A NAME="3520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2137><b>tn</b> Some would render this &#8220;teaches us <i>by</i> the beasts.&#8221; But Elihu is stressing the unique privilege humans have.</p>
<A NAME="3521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2138><b>tn</b> The adverb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sham</font>, &#8220;there&#8221;) connects this verse to v. 11. &#8220;There&#8221; can be locative or temporal &#8211; and here it is temporal (= &#8220;then&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="3522"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2139><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;surely &#8211; vanity, he does not hear.&#8221; The cry is an empty cry, not a prayer to God. Dhorme translates it, &#8220;It is a pure waste of words.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2140><b>sn</b> The point is that if God does not listen to those who do not turn to him, how much less likely is he to turn to one who complains against him.</p>
<A NAME="3524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2141><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;and now&#8221; introduces a new complaint of Elihu &#8211; in addition to the preceding. Here the verb of v. 14, &#8220;you say,&#8221; is understood after the temporal <font face="Scholar">ki</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font>).</p>
<A NAME="3525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2142><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">paqad</font>) means &#8220;to visit&#8221; (also &#8220;to appoint; to muster; to number&#8221;). When God visits, it means that he intervenes in one&#8217;s life for blessing or cursing (punishing, destroying).</p>
<A NAME="3526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2143><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pash</font>) is a <i>hapax legomenon</i>. K&amp;D 12:275 derived it from an Arabic word meaning &#8220;belch,&#8221; leading to the idea of &#8220;overflow.&#8221; BDB 832 s.v. defines it as &#8220;folly.&#8221; Several define it as &#8220;transgression&#8221; on the basis of the versions (Theodotion, Symmachus, Vulgate). The RSV took it as &#8220;greatly heed,&#8221; but that is not exactly &#8220;greatly know,&#8221; when the text beyond that requires &#8220;not know at all.&#8221; The NIV has &#8220;he does not take the least notice of wickedness.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3527"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2144><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hevel</font>) means &#8220;vanity; futility; to no purpose.&#8221;</p>
