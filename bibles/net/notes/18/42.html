<A NAME="421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2403><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;you asked&#8221; is added here to clarify the presence of the line to follow. Many commentators delete it as a gloss from Job 38:2. If it is retained, then Job has to be recalling God&#8217;s question before he answers it.</p>
<A NAME="422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2404><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lakhen</font>) is simply &#8220;but,&#8221; as in Job 31:37.</p>
<A NAME="423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2405><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and I do not understand.&#8221; The expression serves here in an adverbial capacity. It also could be subordinated as a complement: &#8220;I have declared [things that] I do not understand.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2406><b>tn</b> The last clause is &#8220;and I do not know.&#8221; This is also subordinated to become a dependent clause.</p>
<A NAME="425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2407><b>tn</b> This phrase, &#8220;you said,&#8221; is supplied in the translation to introduce the recollection of God&#8217;s words.</p>
<A NAME="426"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2408><b>sn</b> This statement does not imply there was a vision. He is simply saying that this experience of God was real and personal. In the past his knowledge of God was what he had heard &#8211; hearsay. This was real.</p>
<A NAME="427"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2409><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;despise what I said.&#8221; There is no object on the verb; Job could be despising himself or the things he said (see L. J. Kuyper, &#8220;Repentance of Job,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 9 [1959]: 91-94).</p>
<A NAME="428"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2410><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The title has been replaced by the pronoun (&#8220;he&#8221;) in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="429"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2411><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;is kindled.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2412><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1499;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nÿkhonah</font>) is from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kun</font>, &#8220;to be firm; to be fixed; to be established&#8221;). Here it means &#8220;the right thing&#8221; or &#8220;truth.&#8221; The Akkadian word <i>kenu</i> (from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kun</font>) connotes justice and truth.</p>
<A NAME="4211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2413><b>tn</b> The imperatives in this verse are plural, so all three had to do this together.</p>
<A NAME="4212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2414><b>tn</b> The verb &#8220;pray&#8221; is the Hitpael from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">palal</font>). That root has the main idea of arbitration; so in this stem it means &#8220;to seek arbitration [for oneself],&#8221; or &#8220;to pray,&#8221; or &#8220;to intercede.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2415><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will lift up his face,&#8221; meaning, &#8220;I will regard him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2416><b>tn</b> This clause is a result clause, using the negated infinitive construct.</p>
<A NAME="4215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2417><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;folly&#8221; can also be taken in the sense of &#8220;disgrace.&#8221; If the latter is chosen, the word serves as the direct object. If the former, then it is an adverbial accusative.</p>
<A NAME="4216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2418><b>sn</b> The difference between what they said and what Job said, therefore, has to do with truth. Job was honest, spoke the truth, poured out his complaints, but never blasphemed God. For his words God said he told the truth. He did so with incomplete understanding, and with all the impatience and frustration one might expect. Now the friends, however, did not tell what was right about God. They were not honest; rather, they were self-righteous and condescending. They were saying what they thought should be said, but it was wrong.</p>
<A NAME="4217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2419><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;had respect for Job&#8221; means God answered his prayer.</p>
<A NAME="4218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2420><b>tn</b> The paragraph begins with the disjunctive <i>vav</i>, &#8220;Now as for the <sc>Lord, he&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2421><b>sn</b> The expression here is interesting: &#8220;he returned the captivity of Job,&#8221; a clause used elsewhere in the Bible of Israel (see e.g., Ps 126). Here it must mean &#8220;the fortunes of Job,&#8221; i.e., what he had lost. There is a good deal of literature on this; for example, see R. Borger, &#8220;Zu sub sb(i)t,&#8221; <i>ZAW </i>25 (1954): 315-16; and E. Baumann, <i>ZAW </i>6 (1929): 17ff.</p>
<A NAME="4220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2422><b>tn</b> This is a temporal clause, using the infinitive construct with the subject genitive suffix. By this it seems that this act of Job was also something of a prerequisite for restoration &#8211; to pray for them.</p>
<A NAME="4221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2423><b>tn</b> The construction uses the verb &#8220;and he added&#8221; with the word &#8220;repeat&#8221; (or &#8220;twice&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="4222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2424><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;ate bread.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2425><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qÿsitah</font>) is generally understood to refer to a unit of money, but the value is unknown.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Hebrew word refers to a piece of silver, yet uncoined. It is the kind used in Gen 33:19 and Josh 24:32. It is what would be expected of a story set in the patriarchal age.</p>
<A NAME="4224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2426><b>sn</b> This <i>gold ring </i>was worn by women in the nose, or men and women in the ear.</p>
<A NAME="4225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2427><b>tn</b> The word for &#8220;seven&#8221; is spelled in an unusual way. From this some have thought it means &#8220;twice seven,&#8221; or fourteen sons. Several commentators take this view; but it is probably not warranted.</p>
<A NAME="4226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2428><b>sn</b> The Hebrew name <i>Jemimah</i> means &#8220;dove.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2429><b>sn</b> The Hebrew name <i>Keziah</i> means &#8220;cassia.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2430><b>sn</b> The Hebrew name <i>Keren-Happuch</i> means &#8220;horn of eye-paint.&#8221;</p>
