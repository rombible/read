<A NAME="301"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1811><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;smaller than I for days.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="302"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1812><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;who I disdained their fathers to set&#8230;,&#8221; meaning &#8220;whose fathers I disdained to set.&#8221; The relative clause modifies the young fellows who mock; it explains that Job did not think highly enough of them to put them with the dogs. The next verse will explain why.</p>
<A NAME="303"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1813><b>sn</b> Job is mocked by young fellows who come from low extraction. They mocked their elders and their betters. The scorn is strong here &#8211; dogs were despised as scavengers.</p>
<A NAME="304"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1814><b>tn</b> The reference is to the fathers of the scorners, who are here regarded as weak and worthless.</p>
<A NAME="305"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1815><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kelakh</font>) only occurs in Job 5:26; but the Arabic cognate gives this meaning &#8220;strength.&#8221; Others suggest <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kalakh</font>, &#8220;old age&#8221;), <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1465;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kol-khayil</font>, &#8220;all vigor&#8221;), <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1500;&#1470;&#1500;&#1461;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kol-leakh</font>, &#8220;all freshness&#8221;), and the like. But there is no reason for such emendation.</p>
<A NAME="306"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1816><b>tn</b> This word, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">galmud</font>), describes something as lowly, desolate, bare, gaunt like a rock.</p>
<A NAME="307"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1817><b>tn</b> The form is the plural participle with the definite article &#8211; &#8220;who gnaw.&#8221; The article, joined to the participle, joins on a new statement concerning a preceding noun (see GKC 404 §126.<i>b</i>).</p>
<A NAME="308"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1818><b>tn</b> The MT has &#8220;yesterday desolate and waste.&#8221; The word &#8220;yesterday&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1502;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">emesh</font>) is strange here. Among the proposals for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1502;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">emesh</font>), Duhm suggested <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿmashÿshu</font>, &#8220;they grope&#8221;), which would require darkness; Pope renders &#8220;by night,&#8221; instead of &#8220;yesterday,&#8221; which evades the difficulty; and Fohrer suggested with more reason <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">erets</font>), &#8220;a desolate and waste land.&#8221; R. Gordis (<i>Job</i>, 331) suggests <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;</font> / <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1502;&#1467;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yamishu/yamushu</font>), &#8220;they wander off.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="309"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1819><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the leaves of bushes&#8221; (ESV), a possibility dating back to Saadia and discussed by G. R. Driver and G. B. Gray (<i>Job</i> [ICC], 2:209) in their philological notes.</p>
<A NAME="3010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1820><b>tn</b> Here too the form is the participle with the article.</p>
<A NAME="3011"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1821><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;gather mallow,&#8221; a plant which grows in salt marshes.</p>
<A NAME="3012"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1822><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1461;&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gev</font>) is an Aramaic term meaning &#8220;midst,&#8221; indicating &#8220;midst [of society].&#8221; But there is also a Phoenician word that means &#8220;community&#8221; (<i>DISO </i>48).</p>
<A NAME="3013"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1823><b>tn</b> The form simply is the plural verb, but it means those who drove them from society.</p>
<A NAME="3014"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1824><b>tn</b> The text merely says &#8220;as thieves,&#8221; but it obviously compares the poor to the thieves.</p>
<A NAME="3015"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1825><b>tn</b> This use of the infinitive construct expresses that they were compelled to do something (see GKC 348-49 §114.<i>h</i>, <i>k</i>).</p>
<A NAME="3016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1826><b>tn</b> The adjectives followed by a partitive genitive take on the emphasis of a superlative: &#8220;in the most horrible of valleys&#8221; (see GKC 431 §133.<i>h</i>).</p>
<A NAME="3017"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1827><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nahaq</font>) means &#8220;to bray.&#8221; It has cognates in Arabic, Aramaic, and Ugaritic, so there is no need for emendation here. It is the sign of an animal&#8217;s hunger. In the translation the words &#8220;like animals&#8221; are supplied to clarify the metaphor for the modern reader.</p>
<A NAME="3018"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1828><b>tn</b> The Pual of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">safakh</font>, &#8220;to join&#8221;) also brings out the passivity of these people &#8211; &#8220;they were huddled together&#8221; (E. Dhorme, <i>Job</i>, 434).</p>
<A NAME="3019"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1829><b>tn</b> The &#8220;sons of the senseless&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">naval</font>) means they were mentally and morally base and defective; and &#8220;sons of no-name&#8221; means without honor and respect, worthless (because not named).</p>
<A NAME="3020"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1830><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they were whipped from the land&#8221; (cf. ESV) or &#8220;they were cast out from the land&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 697 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1499;&#1488;</font>). J. E. Hartley (<i>Job</i> [NICOT], 397) follows Gordis suggests that the meaning is &#8220;brought lower than the ground.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1831><b>tn</b> The idea is that Job has become proverbial, people think of misfortune and sin when they think of him. The statement uses the ordinary word for &#8220;word&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">millah</font>), but in this context it means more: &#8220;proverb; byword.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3022"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1832><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they are far from me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1833><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">patakh</font>) means &#8220;to untie [or undo]&#8221; a rope or bonds. In this verse <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yitro</font>, the <i>Kethib</i>, LXX, and Vulgate) would mean &#8220;his rope&#8221; (see <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</font> [<font face="Scholar">yeter</font>] in Judg 16:7-9). The <i>Qere</i> would be <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yitri</font>, &#8220;my rope [or cord]&#8221;), meaning &#8220;me.&#8221; The word could mean &#8220;rope,&#8221; &#8220;cord,&#8221; or &#8220;bowstring.&#8221; If the reading &#8220;my cord&#8221; is accepted, the cord would be something like &#8220;my tent cord&#8221; (as in Job 29:20), more than K&amp;D 12:147 &#8220;cord of life.&#8221; This has been followed in the present translation. If it were &#8220;my bowstring,&#8221; it would give the sense of disablement. If &#8220;his cord&#8221; is taken, it would signify that the restraint that God had in afflicting Job was loosened &#8211; nothing was held back.</p>
<A NAME="3024"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1834><b>sn</b> <i>People throw off all restraint in my presence</i> means that when people saw how God afflicted Job, robbing him of his influence and power, then they turned on him with unrestrained insolence (H. H. Rowley, <i>Job</i> [NCBC], 193).</p>
<A NAME="3025"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1835><b>tn</b> This Hebrew word occurs only here. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pirkhakh</font>, &#8220;young rabble&#8221;) is a quadriliteral, from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">parakh</font>, &#8220;to bud&#8221;) The derivative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1508;&#1456;&#1512;&#1465;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">efroakh</font>) in the Bible refers to a young bird. In Arabic <i>farhun</i> means both &#8220;young bird&#8221; and &#8220;base man.&#8221; Perhaps &#8220;young rabble&#8221; is the best meaning here (see R. Gordis, <i>Job</i>, 333).</p>
<A NAME="3026"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1836><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they cast off my feet&#8221; or &#8220;they send my feet away.&#8221; Many delete the line as troubling and superfluous. E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 438) forces the lines to say &#8220;they draw my feet into a net.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3027"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1837><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;paths of their destruction&#8221; or &#8220;their destructive paths.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3028"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1838><b>sn</b> See Job 19:12.</p>
<A NAME="3029"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1839><b>tn</b> This verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1456;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">natÿsu</font>) is found nowhere else. It is probably a variant of the verb in Job 19:10. R. Gordis (<i>Job</i>, 333-34) notes the Arabic noun <i>natsun</i> (&#8220;thorns&#8221;), suggesting a denominative idea &#8220;they have placed thorns in my path.&#8221; Most take it to mean they ruin the way of escape.</p>
<A NAME="3030"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1840><b>tc</b> The MT has &#8220;they further my misfortune.&#8221; The line is difficult, with slight textual problems. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1465;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ilu</font>) means &#8220;to profit,&#8221; and so &#8220;to succeed&#8221; or &#8220;to set forward.&#8221; Good sense can be made from the MT as it stands, and many suggested changes are suspect.</p>
<A NAME="3031"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1841><b>tn</b> The sense of &#8220;restraining&#8221; for &#8220;helping&#8221; was proposed by Dillmann and supported by G. R. Driver (see <i>AJSL</i> 52 [1935/36]: 163).</p>
<A NAME="3032"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1842><b>tn</b> The MT has &#8220;under the crash,&#8221; with the idea that they rush in while the stones are falling around them (which is continuing the figure of the military attack). G. R. Driver took the expression to mean in a temporal sense &#8220;at the moment of the crash&#8221; (<i>AJSL</i> 52 [1935/36]: 163-64). Guillaume, drawing from Arabic, has &#8220;where the gap is made.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3033"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1843><b>tn</b> The verb, the Hitpalpel of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">galal</font>), means &#8220;they roll themselves.&#8221; This could mean &#8220;they roll themselves under the ruins&#8221; (Dhorme), &#8220;they roll on like a storm&#8221; (Gordis), or &#8220;they roll on&#8221; as in waves of enemy attackers (see H. H. Rowley). This particular verb form is found only here (but see Amos 5:24).</p>
<A NAME="3034"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1844><b>tn</b> The passive singular verb (Hophal) is used with a plural subject (see GKC 388 §121.<i>b</i>).</p>
<A NAME="3035"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1845><b>tc</b> This translation assumes that &#8220;terrors&#8221; (in the plural) is the subject. Others emend the text in accordance with the LXX, which has, &#8220;my hope is gone like the wind.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3036"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1846><b>tn</b> This line can either mean that Job is wasting away (i.e., his life is being poured out), or it can mean that he is grieving. The second half of the verse gives the subordinate clause of condition for this.</p>
<A NAME="3037"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1847><b>tn</b> The subject of the verb &#8220;pierces&#8221; can be the night (personified), or it could be God (understood), leaving &#8220;night&#8221; to be an adverbial accusative of time &#8211; &#8220;at night he pierces.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3038"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1848><b>tc</b> The MT concludes this half-verse with &#8220;upon me.&#8221; That phrase is not in the LXX, and so many commentators delete it as making the line too long.</p>
<A NAME="3039"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1849><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my gnawers,&#8221; which is open to several interpretations. The NASB and NIV take it as &#8220;gnawing pains&#8221;; cf. NRSV &#8220;the pain that gnaws me.&#8221; Some suggest worms in the sores (7:5). The LXX has &#8220;my nerves,&#8221; a view accepted by many commentators.</p>
<A NAME="3040"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1850><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (God) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3041"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1851><b>tc</b> This whole verse is difficult. The first problem is that this verb in the MT means &#8220;is disguised [or disfigured],&#8221; indicating that Job&#8217;s clothes hang loose on him. But many take the view that the verb is a phonetic variant of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khavash</font>, &#8220;to bind; to seize&#8221;) and that the Hitpael form is a conflation of the third and second person because of the interchange between them in the passage (R. Gordis, <i>Job</i>, 335). The commentaries list a number of conjectural emendations, but the image in the verse is probably that God seizes Job by the garment and throws him down.</p>
<A NAME="3042"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1852><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;like the collar&#8221; is difficult, primarily because their tunics did not have collars. A translation of &#8220;neck&#8221; would suit better. Some change the preposition to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet</font>), getting a translation &#8220;by the neck of my tunic.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3043"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1853><b>sn</b> The implication from the sentence is that this is a cry to God for help. The sudden change from third person (v. 19) to second person (v. 20) is indicative of the intense emotion of the sufferer.</p>
<A NAME="3044"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1854><b>sn</b> The verb is simple, but the interpretation difficult. In this verse it probably means he stands up in prayer (Jer 15:1), but it could mean that he makes his case to God. Others suggest a more figurative sense, like the English expression &#8220;stand pat,&#8221; meaning &#8220;remain silent&#8221; (see Job 29:8).</p>
<A NAME="3045"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1855><b>tn</b> If the idea of prayer is meant, then a pejorative sense to the verb is required. Some supply a negative and translate &#8220;you do not pay heed to me.&#8221; This is supported by one Hebrew <sc>ms and the Vulgate. The Syriac has the whole colon read with God as the subject, &#8220;you stand and look at me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3046"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1856><b>tn</b> The idiom uses the Niphal verb &#8220;you are turned&#8221; with &#8220;to cruelty.&#8221; See Job 41:20b, as well as Isa 63:10.</p>
<A NAME="3047"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1857><b>tc</b> The LXX reads this verb as &#8220;you scourged/whipped me.&#8221; But there is no reason to adopt this change.</p>
<A NAME="3048"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1858><b>sn</b> Here Job changes the metaphor again, to the driving storm. God has sent his storms, and Job is blown away.</p>
<A NAME="3049"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1859><b>tn</b> The verb means &#8220;to melt.&#8221; The imagery would suggest softening the ground with the showers (see Ps 65:10 [11]). The translation &#8220;toss&#8230;about&#8221; comes from the Arabic cognate that is used for the surging of the sea.</p>
<A NAME="3050"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1860><b>tc</b> The <i>Qere</i> is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tushiyyah</font>, &#8220;counsel&#8221;), which makes no sense here. The <i>Kethib</i> is a variant orthography for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tÿshu</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>, &#8220;storm&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="3051"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1861><b>tn</b> The imperfect verb would be a progressive imperfect, it is future, but it is also already underway.</p>
<A NAME="3052"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=1862><b>tc</b> Here is another very difficult verse, as is attested by the differences among commentaries and translations. The MT has &#8220;surely not against a ruinous heap will he [God] put forth his [God&#8217;s] hand.&#8221; But A. B. Davidson takes Job as the subject, reading &#8220;does not one stretch out his hand in his fall?&#8221; The RSV suggests a man walking in the ruins and using his hand for support. Dillmann changed it to &#8220;drowning man&#8221; to say &#8220;does not a drowning man stretch out his hand?&#8221; Beer has &#8220;have I not given a helping hand to the poor?&#8221; Dhorme has, &#8220;I did not strike the poor man with my hand.&#8221; Kissane follows this but retains the verb form, &#8220;one does not strike the poor man with his hand.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3053"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1863><b>tc</b> The second colon is also difficult; it reads, &#8220;if in his destruction to them he cries.&#8221; E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 425-26) explains how he thinks &#8220;to them&#8221; came about, and he restores &#8220;to me.&#8221; This is the major difficulty in the line, and Dhorme&#8217;s suggestion is the simplest resolution.</p>
<A NAME="3054"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1864><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for the hard of day.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3055"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=1865><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my loins,&#8221; &#8220;my bowels&#8221; (archaic), &#8220;my innermost being.&#8221; The latter option is reflected in the translation; some translations take the inner turmoil to be literal (NIV: &#8220;The churning inside me never stops&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="3056"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=1866><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;boils.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3057"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=1867><b>tn</b> The last clause reads &#8220;and they [it] are not quiet&#8221; or &#8220;do not cease.&#8221; The clause then serves adverbially for the sentence &#8211; &#8220;unceasingly.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3058"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=1868><b>tn</b> The construction uses the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1465;&#1491;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qoder</font>) followed by the Piel perfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">halakh</font>, &#8220;I go about&#8221;). The adjective &#8220;blackened&#8221; refers to Job&#8217;s skin that has been marred by the disease. Adjectives are often used before verbs to describe some bodily condition (see GKC 374-75 §118.<i>n</i>).</p>
<A NAME="3059"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=1869><b>sn</b> The point of this figure is that Job&#8217;s cries of lament are like the howls and screeches of these animals, not that he lives with them. In Job 39:13 the female ostrich is called &#8220;the wailer.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3060"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=1870><b>tn</b> The MT has &#8220;become dark from upon me,&#8221; prompting some editions to supply the verb &#8220;falls from me&#8221; (RSV, NRSV), or &#8220;peels&#8221; (NIV).</p>
<A NAME="3061"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=1871><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;my bones&#8221; may be taken as a metonymy of subject, the bony framework indicating the whole body.</p>
<A NAME="3062"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=1872><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khorev</font>) also means &#8220;heat.&#8221; The heat in this line is not that of the sun, but obviously a fever.</p>
<A NAME="3063"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=1873><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hayah</font>, &#8220;to be&#8221;) followed by the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lamed</font>) means &#8220;to serve the purpose of&#8221; (see Gen 1:14ff., 17:7, etc.).</p>
