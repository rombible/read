<A NAME="2050"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1407><b>tn</b> D. J. A. Clines observes that to do justice to the three jussives in the verse, one would have to translate &#8220;May it be, to fill his belly to the full, that God should send&#8230;and rain&#8221; (<i>Job </i>[WBC], 477). The jussive form of the verb at the beginning of the verse could also simply introduce a protasis of a conditional clause (see GKC 323 §109.<i>h</i>, <i>i</i>). This would mean, &#8220;if he [God] is about to fill his [the wicked&#8217;s] belly to the full, he will send&#8230;.&#8221; The NIV reads &#8220;when he has filled his belly.&#8221; These fit better, because the context is talking about the wicked in his evil pursuit being cut down.</p>
