<A NAME="2035"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1392><b>tn</b> The construct nouns here have caused a certain amount of revision. It says &#8220;rivers of, torrents of.&#8221; The first has been emended by Klostermann to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yitshar</font>, &#8220;oil&#8221;) and connected to the first colon. Older editors argued for a <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;</font></i> (<font face="Scholar">nahar</font>) that meant &#8220;oil&#8221; but that was not convincing. On the other hand, there is support for having more than one construct together serving as apposition (see GKC 422 §130.<i>e</i>). If the word &#8220;streams&#8221; in the last colon is a construct, that would mean three of them; but that one need not be construct. The reading would be &#8220;He will not see the streams, [that is] the rivers [which are] the torrents of honey and butter.&#8221; It is unusual, but workable.</p>
