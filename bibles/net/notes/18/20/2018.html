<A NAME="2018"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1375><b>tn</b> The early versions confused the root of this verb, taking it from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ratsats</font>, &#8220;mistreat&#8221;) and not from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ratsah</font>, &#8220;be please with&#8221;). So it was taken to mean, &#8220;Let inferiors destroy his children.&#8221; But the verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ratsah</font>). This has been taken to mean &#8220;his sons will seek the favor of the poor.&#8221; This would mean that they would be reduced to poverty and need help from even the poor. Some commentators see this as another root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ratsah</font>) meaning &#8220;to compensate; to restore&#8221; wealth their father had gained by impoverishing others. This fits the parallelism well, but not the whole context that well. </p>
