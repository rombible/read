<A NAME="2044"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1401><b>tn</b> The verb is difficult to translate in this line. It basically means &#8220;to cause to escape; to rescue.&#8221; Some translate this verb as &#8220;it is impossible to escape&#8221;; this may work, but is uncertain. Others translate the verb in the sense of saving something else: N. Sarna says, &#8220;Of his most cherished possessions he shall save nothing&#8221; (&#8220;The Interchange of the Preposition <i>bet</i> and <i>min</i> in Biblical Hebrew,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 78 [1959]: 315-16). The RSV has &#8220;he will save nothing in which he delights&#8221;; NIV has &#8220;he cannot save himself by his treasure.&#8221;</p>
