<A NAME="2034"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1391><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pÿlaggot</font>) simply means &#8220;streams&#8221; or &#8220;channels.&#8221; Because the word is used elsewhere for &#8220;streams of oil&#8221; (cf. 29:6), and that makes a good parallelism here, some supply &#8220;oil&#8221; (cf. NAB, NLT). But the second colon of the verse is probably in apposition to the first. The verb &#8220;see&#8221; followed by the preposition <i>bet</i>, &#8220;to look on; to look over,&#8221; means &#8220;to enjoy as a possession,&#8221; an activity of the victor.</p>
