<A NAME="2040"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1397><b>tc</b> The verb indicates that after he oppressed the poor he abandoned them to their fate. But there have been several attempts to improve on the text. Several have repointed the text to get a word parallel to &#8220;house.&#8221; Ehrlich came up with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1465;&#1494;&#1461;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ozev</font>, &#8220;mud hut&#8221;), Kissane had &#8220;hovel&#8221; (similar to Neh 3:8). M. Dahood did the same (&#8220;The Root <i>&#8217;zb </i>II in Job,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 78 [1959]: 306-7). J. Reider came up with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1494;&#1462;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ezev</font>, the &#8220;leavings&#8221;), what the rich were to leave for the poor (&#8220;Contributions to the Scriptural text,&#8221; <i>HUCA</i> 24 [1952/53]: 103-6). But an additional root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">azav</font>) is questionable. And while the text as it stands is general and not very striking, there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. Dhorme reverses the letters to gain <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1494;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">oz</font>, &#8220;with force [or violence]&#8221;). </p>
