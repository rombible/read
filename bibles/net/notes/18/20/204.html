<A NAME="204"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1361><b>tn</b> The word is normally taken from the root &#8220;to hasten,&#8221; and rendered &#8220;because of my haste within me.&#8221; But K&amp;D 11:374 proposed another root, and similarly, but closer to the text, E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 289-90) found an Arabic word with the meaning &#8220;feeling, sensation.&#8221; He argues that from this idea developed the meanings in the cognates of &#8220;thoughts&#8221; as well. Similarly, Gordis translates it &#8220;my feeling pain.&#8221; See also Eccl 2:25.</p>
