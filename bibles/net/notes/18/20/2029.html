<A NAME="2029"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1386><b>tn</b> The choice of words is excellent. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yarash</font>) means either &#8220;to inherit&#8221; or &#8220;to disinherit; to dispossess.&#8221; The context makes the figure clear that God is administering the emetic to make the wicked throw up the wealth (thus, &#8220;God will make him throw it out&#8230;&#8221;); but since wealth is the subject there is a disinheritance meant here. </p>
