<A NAME="2033"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1390><b>tn</b> Some have thought this verse is a gloss on v. 14 and should be deleted. But the word for &#8220;viper&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1508;&#1456;&#1506;&#1462;&#1492;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">ef</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eh</font>) is a rare word, occurring only here and in Isa 30:6 and 59:5. It is unlikely that a rarer word would be used in a gloss. But the point is similar to v. 14 &#8211; the wealth that was greedily sucked in by the wicked proves to be their undoing. Either this is totally irrelevant to Job&#8217;s case, a general discussion, or the man is raising questions about how Job got his wealth.</p>
