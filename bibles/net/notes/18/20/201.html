<A NAME="201"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1358><b>sn</b> Zophar breaks in with an impassioned argument about the brevity and prosperity of the life of the wicked. But every statement that he makes is completely irrelevant to the case at hand. The speech has four sections: after a short preface (2-3) he portrays the brevity of the triumph of the wicked (4-11), retribution for sin (12-22), and God&#8217;s swift judgment (23-29). See further B. H. Kelly, &#8220;Truth in Contradiction, A Study of Job 20 and 21,&#8221; <i>Int</i> 15 (1961): 147-56.</p>
