<A NAME="187"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1249><b>tn</b> The construction uses the participle and then 3rd person suffixes: &#8220;O tearer of himself in his anger.&#8221; But it is clearly referring to Job, and so the direct second person pronouns should be used to make that clear. The LXX is an approximation or paraphrase here: &#8220;Anger has possessed you, for what if you should die &#8211; would under heaven be desolate, or shall the mountains be overthrown from their foundations?&#8221;</p>
