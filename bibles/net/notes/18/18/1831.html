<A NAME="1831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1273><b>tn</b> The verb is the Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsa</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ad</font>, &#8220;to lead away&#8221;). The problem is that the form is either a third feminine (Rashi thought it was referring to Job&#8217;s wife) or the second person. There is a good deal of debate over the possibility of the prefix <i>t-</i> being a variant for the third masculine form. The evidence in Ugaritic and Akkadian is mixed, stronger for the plural than the singular. Gesenius has some samples where the third feminine form might also be used for the passive if there is no expressed subject (see GKC 459 §144.<i>b</i>), but the evidence is not strong. The simplest choices are to change the prefix to a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yod</font>), or argue that the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tav</font>) can be masculine, or follow Gesenius.</p>
