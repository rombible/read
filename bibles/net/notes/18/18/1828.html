<A NAME="1828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1270><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;the limbs of his skin&#8221; makes no sense, unless a poetic meaning of &#8220;parts&#8221; (or perhaps &#8220;layers&#8221;) is taken. The parallelism has &#8220;his skin&#8221; in the first colon, and &#8220;his limbs&#8221; in the second. One plausible suggestion is to take <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">badde</font>, &#8220;limbs of&#8221;) in the first part to be <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1493;&#1464;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bidvay</font>, &#8220;by a disease&#8221;; Dhorme, Wright, RSV). The verb has to be made passive, however. The versions have different things: The LXX has &#8220;let the branches of his feet be eaten&#8221;; the Syriac has &#8220;his cities will be swallowed up by force&#8221;; the Vulgate reads &#8220;let it devour the beauty of his skin&#8221;; and Targum Job has &#8220;it will devour the linen garments that cover his skin.&#8221;</p>
