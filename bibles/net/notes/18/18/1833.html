<A NAME="1833"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1275><b>tn</b> This line is difficult as well. The verb, again a third feminine form, says &#8220;it dwells in his tent.&#8221; But the next part (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497; &#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mibbÿli lo</font>) means something like &#8220;things of what are not his.&#8221; The best that can be made of the MT is &#8220;There shall live in his tent they that are not his&#8221; (referring to persons and animals; see J. E. Hartley, <i>Job</i> [NICOT], 279). G. R. Driver and G. B. Gray (<i>Job</i> [ICC], 2:161) refer &#8220;that which is naught of his&#8221; to weeds and wild animals. M. Dahood suggested a reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mabbel</font>) and a connection to Akkadian <i>nablu</i>, &#8220;fire&#8221; (cf. Ugaritic <i>nbl</i>). The interchange of <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> is not a problem, and the parallelism with the next line makes good sense (&#8220;Some Northwest Semitic words in Job,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 38 [1957]: 312ff.). Others suggest an emendation to get &#8220;night-hag&#8221; or vampire. This suggestion, as well as Driver&#8217;s &#8220;mixed herbs,&#8221; are linked to the idea of exorcism. But if a change is to be made, Dahood&#8217;s is the most compelling.</p>
