<A NAME="183"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1245><b>tn</b> The construction is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1510;&#1461;&#1497; &#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qintse lÿmillin</font>), which is often taken to be &#8220;end of words,&#8221; as if the word was from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1461;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qets</font>, &#8220;end&#8221;). But a plural of &#8220;end&#8221; is not found in the OT. Some will link the word to Arabic <i>qanasa</i>, &#8220;to hunt; to give chase,&#8221; to get an interpretation of &#8220;snares for words.&#8221; But E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 257) objects that this does not fit the speech of Bildad (as well as it might Job&#8217;s). He finds a cognate <i>qinsu</i>, &#8220;fetters, shackles,&#8221; and reads &#8220;how long will you put shackles on words.&#8221; But G. R. Driver had pointed out that this cognate does not exist (&#8220;Problems in the Hebrew text of Job,&#8221; VTSup 3 [1955]: 72-93). So it would be preferable to take the reading &#8220;ends&#8221; and explain the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nun</font>) as from a Aramaizing by-form. This is supported by 11QtgJob that uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1493;&#1465;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sof</font>, &#8220;end&#8221;). On the construction, GKC 421 §130.<i>a</i> explains this as a use of the construct in rapid narrative to connect the words; in such cases a preposition is on the following noun. </p>
