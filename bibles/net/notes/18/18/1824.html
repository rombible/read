<A NAME="1824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1266><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">puts</font>) in the Hiphil has the meaning &#8220;to pursue&#8221; and &#8220;to scatter.&#8221; It is followed by the expression &#8220;at his feet.&#8221; So the idea is easily derived: they chase him at his feet. But some commentators have other proposals. The most far-fetched is that of Ehrlich and Driver (<i>ZAW </i>24 [1953]: 259-60) which has &#8220;and compel him to urinate on his feet,&#8221; one of many similar readings the NEB accepted from Driver.</p>
