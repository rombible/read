<A NAME="181"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1243><b>sn</b> Bildad attacks Job with less subtlety than Eliphaz. He describes the miserable existence of the wicked, indicating that it is the proof of sin. His speech falls into two main parts: why is Job so contemptuous toward his friends (Job 18:2-4), and the fate of the wicked (18:5-21). On this chapter see N. M. Sarna, &#8220;The Mythological Background of Job 18,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 82 (1963): 315-18; and W. A. Irwin, &#8220;Job&#8217;s Redeemer,&#8221; <i>JBL </i>81 (1962): 217-29.</p>
