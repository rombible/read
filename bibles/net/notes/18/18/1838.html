<A NAME="1838"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1280><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akharonim</font>) means &#8220;those [men] coming after.&#8221; And the next word, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1502;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qadmonim</font>), means &#8220;those [men] coming before.&#8221; Some commentators have tried to see here references to people who lived before and people who lived after, but that does not explain their being appalled at the fate of the wicked. So the normal way this is taken is in connection to the geography, notably the seas &#8211; &#8220;the hinder sea&#8221; refers to the Mediterranean, the West, and &#8220;the front sea&#8221; refers to the Dead Sea (Zech 14:8), namely, the East. The versions understood this as temporal: &#8220;the last groaned for him, and wonder seized the first&#8221; (LXX).</p>
