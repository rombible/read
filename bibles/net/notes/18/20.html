<A NAME="201"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1358><b>sn</b> Zophar breaks in with an impassioned argument about the brevity and prosperity of the life of the wicked. But every statement that he makes is completely irrelevant to the case at hand. The speech has four sections: after a short preface (2-3) he portrays the brevity of the triumph of the wicked (4-11), retribution for sin (12-22), and God&#8217;s swift judgment (23-29). See further B. H. Kelly, &#8220;Truth in Contradiction, A Study of Job 20 and 21,&#8221; <i>Int</i> 15 (1961): 147-56.</p>
<A NAME="202"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1359><b>tn</b> The ordinary meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lakhen</font>) is &#8220;therefore,&#8221; coming after an argument. But at the beginning of a speech it is an allusion to what follows.</p>
<A NAME="203"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1360><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shuv</font>, &#8220;to return&#8221;), but in the Hiphil<i>, </i>&#8220;bring me back,&#8221; i.e., prompt me to make another speech. The text makes good sense as it is, and there is no reason to change the reading to make a closer parallel with the second half &#8211; indeed, the second part explains the first.</p>
<A NAME="204"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1361><b>tn</b> The word is normally taken from the root &#8220;to hasten,&#8221; and rendered &#8220;because of my haste within me.&#8221; But K&amp;D 11:374 proposed another root, and similarly, but closer to the text, E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 289-90) found an Arabic word with the meaning &#8220;feeling, sensation.&#8221; He argues that from this idea developed the meanings in the cognates of &#8220;thoughts&#8221; as well. Similarly, Gordis translates it &#8220;my feeling pain.&#8221; See also Eccl 2:25.</p>
<A NAME="205"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1362><b>tn</b> There is no indication that this clause is to be subordinated to the next, other than the logical connection, and the use of the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vav</font>)<font face="Scholar"> </font>in the second half.</p>
<A NAME="206"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1363><b>tn</b> See Job 19:3.</p>
<A NAME="207"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1364><b>tn</b> The phrase actually has <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463; &#1502;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font></i> (<font face="Scholar">ruakh mibbinati</font>, &#8220;a spirit/wind/breath/impulse from my understanding&#8221;). Some translate it &#8220;out of my understanding a spirit answers me.&#8221; The idea is not that difficult, and so the many proposals to rewrite the text can be rejected. The spirit of his understanding prompts the reply.</p>
<A NAME="208"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1365><b>tn</b> To take this verb as a simple Qal and read it &#8220;answers me,&#8221; does not provide a clear idea. The form can just as easily be taken as a Hiphil, with the sense &#8220;causes me to answer.&#8221; It is Zophar who will &#8220;return&#8221; and who will &#8220;answer.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="209"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1366><b>tn</b> The MT has &#8220;Do you not know?&#8221; The question can be interpreted as a rhetorical question affirming that Job must know this. The question serves to express the conviction that the contents are well-known to the audience (see GKC 474 §150.<i>e</i>).</p>
<A NAME="2010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1367><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from the putting of man on earth.&#8221; The infinitive is the object of the preposition, which is here temporal. If &#8220;man&#8221; is taken as the subjective genitive, then the verb would be given a passive translation. Here &#8220;man&#8221; is a generic, referring to &#8220;mankind&#8221; or &#8220;the human race.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2011"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1368><b>tn</b> The expression in the text is &#8220;quite near.&#8221; This indicates that it is easily attained, and that its end is near.</p>
<A NAME="2012"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1369><b>tn</b> For the discussion of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1504;&#1461;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khanef</font>, &#8220;godless&#8221;) see Job 8:13.</p>
<A NAME="2013"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1370><b>tn</b> The phrase is &#8220;until a moment,&#8221; meaning it is short-lived. But see J. Barr, &#8220;Hebrew <i>&#8217;ad</i>, especially at Job 1:18 and Neh 7:3,&#8221; <i>JSS </i>27 (1982): 177-88.</p>
<A NAME="2014"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1371><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">si</font>&#8217;) has been connected with the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nasa</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to lift up&#8221;), and so interpreted here as &#8220;pride.&#8221; The form is parallel to &#8220;head&#8221; in the next part, and so here it refers to his stature, the part that rises up and is crowned. But the verse does describe the pride of such a person, with his head in the heavens.</p>
<A NAME="2015"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1372><b>tn</b> There have been attempts to change the word here to &#8220;like a whirlwind,&#8221; or something similar. But many argue that there is no reason to remove a coarse expression from Zophar.</p>
<A NAME="2016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1373><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they do not find him.&#8221; The verb has no expressed subject, and so here is equivalent to a passive. The clause itself is taken adverbially in the sentence.</p>
<A NAME="2017"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1374><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the eye that had seen him.&#8221; Here a part of the person (the eye, the instrument of vision) is put by metonymy for the entire person.</p>
<A NAME="2018"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1375><b>tn</b> The early versions confused the root of this verb, taking it from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ratsats</font>, &#8220;mistreat&#8221;) and not from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ratsah</font>, &#8220;be please with&#8221;). So it was taken to mean, &#8220;Let inferiors destroy his children.&#8221; But the verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ratsah</font>). This has been taken to mean &#8220;his sons will seek the favor of the poor.&#8221; This would mean that they would be reduced to poverty and need help from even the poor. Some commentators see this as another root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ratsah</font>) meaning &#8220;to compensate; to restore&#8221; wealth their father had gained by impoverishing others. This fits the parallelism well, but not the whole context that well. </p>
<A NAME="2019"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1376><b>tn</b> Some commentators are surprised to see &#8220;his hands&#8221; here, thinking the passage talks about his death. Budde changed it to &#8220;his children,&#8221; by altering one letter. R. Gordis argued that &#8220;hand&#8221; can mean offspring, and so translated it that way without changing anything in the text (&#8220;A note on YAD,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 62 [1943]: 343).</p>
<A NAME="2020"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1377><b>tn</b> &#8220;Bones&#8221; is often used metonymically for the whole person, the bones being the framework, meaning everything inside, as well as the body itself.</p>
<A NAME="2021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1378><b>sn</b> This line means that he dies prematurely &#8211; at the height of his youthful vigor.</p>
<A NAME="2022"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1379><b>tn</b> The conjunction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>) introduces clauses that are conditional or concessive. With the imperfect verb in the protasis it indicates what is possible in the present or future. See GKC 496 §159.<i>q</i>).</p>
<A NAME="2023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1380><b>sn</b> The wicked person holds on to evil as long as he can, savoring the taste or the pleasure of it.</p>
<A NAME="2024"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1381><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the middle of his palate.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2025"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1382><b>tn</b> The perfect verb in the apodosis might express the suddenness of the change (see S. R. Driver, <i>Tenses in Hebrew</i>, 204), or it might be a constative perfect looking at the action as a whole without reference to inception, progress, or completion (see <i>IBHS</i> 480-81 §30.1d). The Niphal perfect simply means &#8220;is turned&#8221; or &#8220;turns&#8221;; &#8220;sour is supplied in the translation to clarify what is meant.</p>
<A NAME="2026"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1383><b>tn</b> The word is &#8220;in his loins&#8221; or &#8220;within him.&#8221; Some translate more specifically &#8220;bowels.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2027"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1384><b>sn</b> Some commentators suggest that the ancients believed that serpents secreted poison in the gall bladder, or that the poison came from the gall bladder of serpents. In any case, there is poison (from the root &#8220;bitter&#8221;) in the system of the wicked person; it may simply be saying it is that type of poison.</p>
<A NAME="2028"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1385><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;swallowed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2029"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1386><b>tn</b> The choice of words is excellent. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yarash</font>) means either &#8220;to inherit&#8221; or &#8220;to disinherit; to dispossess.&#8221; The context makes the figure clear that God is administering the emetic to make the wicked throw up the wealth (thus, &#8220;God will make him throw it out&#8230;&#8221;); but since wealth is the subject there is a disinheritance meant here. </p>
<A NAME="2030"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1387><b>tn</b> The word is a homonym for the word for &#8220;head,&#8221; which has led to some confusion in the early versions.</p>
<A NAME="2031"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1388><b>sn</b> To take the possessions of another person is hereby compared to sucking poison from a serpent &#8211; it will kill eventually.</p>
<A NAME="2032"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1389><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;tongue.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2033"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1390><b>tn</b> Some have thought this verse is a gloss on v. 14 and should be deleted. But the word for &#8220;viper&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1508;&#1456;&#1506;&#1462;&#1492;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">ef</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eh</font>) is a rare word, occurring only here and in Isa 30:6 and 59:5. It is unlikely that a rarer word would be used in a gloss. But the point is similar to v. 14 &#8211; the wealth that was greedily sucked in by the wicked proves to be their undoing. Either this is totally irrelevant to Job&#8217;s case, a general discussion, or the man is raising questions about how Job got his wealth.</p>
<A NAME="2034"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1391><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pÿlaggot</font>) simply means &#8220;streams&#8221; or &#8220;channels.&#8221; Because the word is used elsewhere for &#8220;streams of oil&#8221; (cf. 29:6), and that makes a good parallelism here, some supply &#8220;oil&#8221; (cf. NAB, NLT). But the second colon of the verse is probably in apposition to the first. The verb &#8220;see&#8221; followed by the preposition <i>bet</i>, &#8220;to look on; to look over,&#8221; means &#8220;to enjoy as a possession,&#8221; an activity of the victor.</p>
<A NAME="2035"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1392><b>tn</b> The construct nouns here have caused a certain amount of revision. It says &#8220;rivers of, torrents of.&#8221; The first has been emended by Klostermann to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yitshar</font>, &#8220;oil&#8221;) and connected to the first colon. Older editors argued for a <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;</font></i> (<font face="Scholar">nahar</font>) that meant &#8220;oil&#8221; but that was not convincing. On the other hand, there is support for having more than one construct together serving as apposition (see GKC 422 §130.<i>e</i>). If the word &#8220;streams&#8221; in the last colon is a construct, that would mean three of them; but that one need not be construct. The reading would be &#8220;He will not see the streams, [that is] the rivers [which are] the torrents of honey and butter.&#8221; It is unusual, but workable.</p>
<A NAME="2036"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1393><b>sn</b> This word is often translated &#8220;curds.&#8221; It is curdled milk, possibly a type of butter.</p>
<A NAME="2037"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1394><b>tn</b> The idea is the fruit of his evil work. The word <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1490;&#1464;&#1506;</font></i> (<font face="Scholar">yaga</font>&#8217;) occurs only here; it must mean ill-gotten gains. The verb is in 10:3.</p>
<A NAME="2038"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1395><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he does not swallow.&#8221; In the context this means &#8220;consume&#8221; for his own pleasure and prosperity. The verbal clause is here taken adverbially.</p>
<A NAME="2039"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1396><b>sn</b> The expression is &#8220;according to the wealth of his exchange.&#8221; This means he cannot enjoy whatever he gained in his business deals. Some <sc>mss have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet</font>) preposition, making the translation easier; but this is evidence of a scribal correction.</p>
<A NAME="2040"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1397><b>tc</b> The verb indicates that after he oppressed the poor he abandoned them to their fate. But there have been several attempts to improve on the text. Several have repointed the text to get a word parallel to &#8220;house.&#8221; Ehrlich came up with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1465;&#1494;&#1461;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ozev</font>, &#8220;mud hut&#8221;), Kissane had &#8220;hovel&#8221; (similar to Neh 3:8). M. Dahood did the same (&#8220;The Root <i>&#8217;zb </i>II in Job,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 78 [1959]: 306-7). J. Reider came up with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1494;&#1462;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ezev</font>, the &#8220;leavings&#8221;), what the rich were to leave for the poor (&#8220;Contributions to the Scriptural text,&#8221; <i>HUCA</i> 24 [1952/53]: 103-6). But an additional root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">azav</font>) is questionable. And while the text as it stands is general and not very striking, there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. Dhorme reverses the letters to gain <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1494;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">oz</font>, &#8220;with force [or violence]&#8221;). </p>
<A NAME="2041"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1398><b>tn</b> The last clause says, &#8220;and he did not build it.&#8221; This can be understood in an adverbial sense, supplying the relative pronoun to the translation.</p>
<A NAME="2042"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1399><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;belly,&#8221; which represents his cravings, his desires and appetites. The &#8220;satisfaction&#8221; is actually the word for &#8220;quiet; peace; calmness; ease.&#8221; He was driven by greedy desires, or he felt and displayed an insatiable greed.</p>
<A NAME="2043"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1400><b>tn</b> The verb is the passive participle of the verb <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1491;</font></i> (<font face="Scholar">khamad</font>) which is one of the words for &#8220;covet; desire.&#8221; This person is controlled by his desires; there is no escape. He is a slave.</p>
<A NAME="2044"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1401><b>tn</b> The verb is difficult to translate in this line. It basically means &#8220;to cause to escape; to rescue.&#8221; Some translate this verb as &#8220;it is impossible to escape&#8221;; this may work, but is uncertain. Others translate the verb in the sense of saving something else: N. Sarna says, &#8220;Of his most cherished possessions he shall save nothing&#8221; (&#8220;The Interchange of the Preposition <i>bet</i> and <i>min</i> in Biblical Hebrew,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 78 [1959]: 315-16). The RSV has &#8220;he will save nothing in which he delights&#8221;; NIV has &#8220;he cannot save himself by his treasure.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2045"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1402><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for his eating,&#8221; which is frequently rendered &#8220;for his gluttony.&#8221; It refers, of course, to all the desires he has to take things from other people.</p>
<A NAME="2046"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1403><b>sn</b> The point throughout is that insatiable greed and ruthless plundering to satisfy it will be recompensed with utter and complete loss.</p>
<A NAME="2047"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1404><b>tn</b> The word <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1511;</font></i> (<font face="Scholar">safaq</font>) occurs only here; it means &#8220;sufficiency; wealth; abundance (see D. W. Thomas, &#8220;The Text of Jesaia 2:6 and the Word <i>sapaq,</i>&#8221;<i> ZAW </i>75 [1963]: 88-90).</p>
<A NAME="2048"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1405><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;there is straightness for him.&#8221; The root <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1512;</font></i> (<font face="Scholar">tsarar</font>) means &#8220;to be narrowed in straits, to be in a bind.&#8221; The word here would have the idea of pressure, stress, trouble. One could say he is in a bind.</p>
<A NAME="2049"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1406><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;every hand of trouble comes to him.&#8221; The pointing of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1502;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amel</font>) indicates it would refer to one who brings trouble; LXX and Latin read an abstract noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amal</font>, &#8220;trouble&#8221;) here. </p>
<A NAME="2050"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1407><b>tn</b> D. J. A. Clines observes that to do justice to the three jussives in the verse, one would have to translate &#8220;May it be, to fill his belly to the full, that God should send&#8230;and rain&#8221; (<i>Job </i>[WBC], 477). The jussive form of the verb at the beginning of the verse could also simply introduce a protasis of a conditional clause (see GKC 323 §109.<i>h</i>, <i>i</i>). This would mean, &#8220;if he [God] is about to fill his [the wicked&#8217;s] belly to the full, he will send&#8230;.&#8221; The NIV reads &#8220;when he has filled his belly.&#8221; These fit better, because the context is talking about the wicked in his evil pursuit being cut down.</p>
