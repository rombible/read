<A NAME="3526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2143><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pash</font>) is a <i>hapax legomenon</i>. K&amp;D 12:275 derived it from an Arabic word meaning &#8220;belch,&#8221; leading to the idea of &#8220;overflow.&#8221; BDB 832 s.v. defines it as &#8220;folly.&#8221; Several define it as &#8220;transgression&#8221; on the basis of the versions (Theodotion, Symmachus, Vulgate). The RSV took it as &#8220;greatly heed,&#8221; but that is not exactly &#8220;greatly know,&#8221; when the text beyond that requires &#8220;not know at all.&#8221; The NIV has &#8220;he does not take the least notice of wickedness.&#8221;</p>
