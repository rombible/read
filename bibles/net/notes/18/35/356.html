<A NAME="356"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2123><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text merely says, &#8220;What do I gain from my sin?&#8221; But Job has claimed that he has not sinned, and so this has to be elliptical: &#8220;more than if I had sinned&#8221; (H. H. Rowley, <i>Job</i> [NCBC], 224). It could also be, &#8220;What do I gain without sin?&#8221;</p>
