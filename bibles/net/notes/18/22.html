<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1496><b>sn</b> The third and final cycle of speeches now begins with Eliphaz&#8217; final speech. Eliphaz will here underscore the argument that man&#8217;s ills are brought about by sin; he will then deduce from Job&#8217;s sufferings the sins he must have committed and the sinful attitude he has about God. The speech has four parts: Job&#8217;s suffering is proof of his sin (2-5), Job&#8217;s sufferings demonstrate the kinds of sin Job committed (6-11), Job&#8217;s attitude about God (12-20), and the final appeal and promise to Job (21-30).</p>
<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1497><b>tn</b> Some do not take this to be parallel to the first colon, taking this line as a statement, but the parallel expressions here suggest the question is repeated.</p>
<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1498><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1461;&#1508;&#1462;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khefets</font>) in this passage has the nuance of &#8220;special benefit; favor.&#8221; It does not just express the desire for something or the interest in it, but the profit one derives from it.</p>
<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1499><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tattem</font>) is the Hiphil imperfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tamam</font>, &#8220;be complete, finished&#8221;), following the Aramaic form of the geminate verb with a doubling of the first letter.</p>
<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1500><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;your fear&#8221; or &#8220;your piety&#8221; refers to Job&#8217;s reverence &#8211; it is his fear of God (thus a subjective genitive). When &#8220;fear&#8221; is used of religion, it includes faith and adoration on the positive side, fear and obedience on the negative.</p>
<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1501><b>sn</b> Of course the point is that God does not charge Job because he is righteous; the point is he must be unrighteous.</p>
<A NAME="227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1502><b>tn</b> The adjective <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rabbah</font>) normally has the idea of &#8220;great&#8221; in quantity (&#8220;abundant,&#8221; ESV) rather than &#8220;great&#8221; in quality.</p>
<A NAME="228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1503><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khaval</font>) means &#8220;to take pledges.&#8221; In this verse Eliphaz says that Job not only took as pledge things the poor need, like clothing, but he did it for no reason.</p>
<A NAME="229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1504><b>tn</b> The &#8220;naked&#8221; here refers to people who are poorly clothed. Otherwise, a reading like the NIV would be necessary: &#8220;you stripped the clothes&#8230;[leaving them] naked.&#8221; So either he made them naked by stripping their garments off, or they were already in rags.</p>
<A NAME="2210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1505><b>tn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1497;&#1461;&#1507;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ayef</font>) can be translated &#8220;weary,&#8221; &#8220;faint,&#8221; &#8220;exhausted,&#8221; or &#8220;tired.&#8221; Here it may refer to the fainting because of thirst &#8211; that would make a good parallel to the second part.</p>
<A NAME="2211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1506><b>tn</b> The idiom is &#8220;a man of arm&#8221; (= &#8220;powerful&#8221;; see Ps 10:15). This is in comparison to the next line, &#8220;man of face&#8221; (= &#8220;dignity; high rank&#8221;; see Isa 3:5).</p>
<A NAME="2212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1507><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and a man of arm, to whom [was] land.&#8221; The line is in contrast to the preceding one, and so the <i>vav </i>here introduces a concessive clause.</p>
<A NAME="2213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1508><b>tn</b> The expression is unusual: &#8220;the one lifted up of face.&#8221; This is the &#8220;honored one,&#8221; the one to whom the dignity will be given.</p>
<A NAME="2214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1509><b>tn</b> Many commentators simply delete the verse or move it elsewhere. Most take it as a general reference to Job, perhaps in apposition to the preceding verse.</p>
<A NAME="2215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1510><b>tn</b> The &#8220;arms of the orphans&#8221; are their helps or rights on which they depended for support.</p>
<A NAME="2216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1511><b>tn</b> The verb in the text is Pual: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1491;&#1467;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿdukka</font>&#8217;, &#8220;was [were] crushed&#8221;). GKC 388 §121.<i>b</i> would explain &#8220;arms&#8221; as the complement of a passive imperfect. But if that is too difficult, then a change to Piel imperfect, second person, will solve the difficulty. In its favor is the parallelism, the use of the second person all throughout the section, and the reading in all the versions. The versions may have simply assumed the easier reading, however.</p>
<A NAME="2217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1512><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;or dark you cannot see.&#8221; Some commentators and the RSV follow the LXX in reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">o</font>, &#8220;or&#8221;) as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">or</font>, &#8220;light&#8221;) and translate it &#8220;The light has become dark&#8221; or &#8220;Your light has become dark.&#8221; A. B. Davidson suggests the reading &#8220;Or seest thou not the darkness.&#8221; This would mean Job does not understand the true meaning of the darkness and the calamities.</p>
<A NAME="2218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1513><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shif</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">at</font>) means &#8220;multitude of.&#8221; It is used of men, camels, horses, and here of waters in the heavens.</p>
<A NAME="2219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1514><b>tn</b> This reading preserves the text as it is. The nouns &#8220;high&#8221; and &#8220;heavens&#8221; would then be taken as adverbial accusatives of place (see GKC 373-74 §118.<i>g</i>).</p>
<A NAME="2220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1515><b>tn</b> The parallel passage in Isa 40:26-27, as well as the context here, shows that the imperative is to be retained here. The LXX has &#8220;he sees.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1516><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;head of the stars.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1517><b>sn</b> Eliphaz is giving to Job the thoughts and words of the pagans, for they say, &#8220;How does God know, and is there knowledge in the Most High?&#8221; (see Ps 73:11; 94:11).</p>
<A NAME="2223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1518><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he does not see.&#8221; The implied object is &#8220;us.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1519><b>sn</b> The word is &#8220;circle; dome&#8221;; here it is the dome that covers the earth, beyond which God sits enthroned. A. B. Davidson (<i>Job</i>, 165) suggests &#8220;on the arch of heaven&#8221; that covers the earth.</p>
<A NAME="2225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1520><b>sn</b> The idea suggested here is that God is not only far off, but he is unconcerned as he strolls around heaven &#8211; this is what Eliphaz says Job means.</p>
<A NAME="2226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1521><b>tn</b> The &#8220;old path&#8221; here is the way of defiance to God. The text in these two verses is no doubt making reference to the flood in Genesis, one of the perennial examples of divine judgment.</p>
<A NAME="2227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1522><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;men&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but has been supplied to clarify the relative pronoun &#8220;who.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1523><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qamat</font>) basically means &#8220;to seize; to tie together to make a bundle.&#8221; So the Pual will mean &#8220;to be bundled away; to be carried off.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1524><b>tn</b> The clause has &#8220;and [it was] not the time.&#8221; It may be used adverbially here.</p>
<A NAME="2230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1525><b>tn</b> The word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nahar</font>, &#8220;river&#8221; or &#8220;current&#8221;); it is taken here in its broadest sense of the waters on the earth that formed the current of the flood (Gen 7:6, 10).</p>
<A NAME="2231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1526><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatsaq</font>) means &#8220;to pour out; to shed; to spill; to flow.&#8221; The Pual means &#8220;to be poured out&#8221; (as in Lev 21:10 and Ps 45:3).</p>
<A NAME="2232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1527><b>tn</b> This word is then to be taken as an adverbial accusative of place. Another way to look at this verse is what A. B. Davidson (<i>Job</i>, 165) proposes &#8220;whose foundation was poured away and became a flood.&#8221; This would mean that that on which they stood sank away.</p>
<A NAME="2233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1528><b>tn</b> The form in the text is &#8220;to them.&#8221; The LXX and the Syriac versions have &#8220;to us.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1529><b>tn</b> The pronoun is added for this emphasis; it has &#8220;but he&#8221; before the verb.</p>
<A NAME="2235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1530><b>tn</b> See Job 10:3.</p>
<A NAME="2236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1531><b>tc</b> The LXX has &#8220;from him,&#8221; and this is followed by several commentators. But the MT is to be retained, for Eliphaz is recalling the words of Job. Verses 17 and 18 are deleted by a number of commentators as a gloss because they have many similarities to 21:14-16. But Eliphaz is recalling what Job said, in order to say that the prosperity to which Job alluded was only the prelude to a disaster he denied (H. H. Rowley, <i>Job</i> [NCBC], 156).</p>
<A NAME="2237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1532><b>tn</b> The line is talking about the rejoicing of the righteous when judgment falls on the wicked. An object (&#8220;destruction&#8221;) has to be supplied here to clarify this (see Pss 52:6 [8]; 69:32 [33]; 107:42).</p>
<A NAME="2238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1533><b>sn</b> In Ps 2:4 it was God who mocked the wicked by judging them.</p>
<A NAME="2239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1534><b>tc</b> The word translated &#8220;our enemies&#8221; is found only here. The word means &#8220;hostility,&#8221; but used here as a collective for those who are hostile &#8211; &#8220;enemies.&#8221; Some commentators follow the LXX and read &#8220;possessions,&#8221; explaining its meaning and derivation in different ways. Gordis simply takes the word in the text and affirms that this is the meaning. On the other hand, to get this, E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 336) repoints <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1502;&#1464;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qimanu</font>) of the MT to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿqumam</font>), arguing that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿqum</font>) means &#8220;what exists [or has substance]&#8221; (although that is used of animals). He translates: &#8220;have not their possessions been destroyed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1535><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sakhan</font>) meant &#8220;to be useful; to be profitable&#8221; in v. 2. Now, in the Hiphil it means &#8220;to be accustomed to&#8221; or &#8220;to have experience with.&#8221; Joined by the preposition &#8220;with&#8221; it means &#8220;to be reconciled with him.&#8221; W. B. Bishai cites Arabic and Ugaritic words to support a meaning &#8220;acquiesce&#8221; (&#8220;Notes on <i>hskn</i> in Job 22:21,&#8221; <i>JNES</i> 20 [1961]: 258-59).</p>
<A NAME="2241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1536><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;him&#8221;; the referent (God) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1537><b>tn</b> The two imperatives in this verse imply a relationship of succession and not consequence.</p>
<A NAME="2243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1538><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">torah</font>), its only occurrence in the book of Job.</p>
<A NAME="2244"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1539><b>tc</b> M. Dahood has &#8220;write his words&#8221; (&#8220;Metaphor in Job 22:22,&#8221; <i>Bib </i>47 [1966]: 108-9).</p>
<A NAME="2245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1540><b>tc</b> The MT has &#8220;you will be built up&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1462;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tibbaneh</font>). But the LXX has &#8220;humble yourself&#8221; (reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">tÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anneh</font>] apparently). Many commentators read this; Dahood has &#8220;you will be healed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2246"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1541><b>tc</b> The form is the imperative. Eliphaz is telling Job to get rid of his gold as evidence of his repentance. Many commentators think that this is too improbable for Eliphaz to have said, and that Job has lost everything anyway, and so they make proposals for the text. Most would follow Theodotion and the Syriac to read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿshatta</font>, &#8220;and you will esteem&#8230;.&#8221;).<i> </i>This would mean that he is promising Job restoration of his wealth.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;place.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2247"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1542><b>tn</b> The word for &#8220;gold&#8221; is the rare <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1510;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">betser</font>), which may be derived from a cognate of Arabic <i>basara</i>, &#8220;to see; to examine.&#8221; If this is the case, the word here would refer to refined gold. The word also forms a fine wordplay with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1456;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿtsur</font>, &#8220;in the rock&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="2248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1543><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text simply has &#8220;Ophir,&#8221; a metonymy for the gold that comes from there.</p>
<A NAME="2249"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1544><b>tn</b> The form for &#8220;gold&#8221; here is plural, which could be a plural of extension. The LXX and Latin versions have &#8220;The Almighty will be your helper against your enemies.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2250"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1545><b>tn</b> E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 339) connects this word with an Arabic root meaning &#8220;to be elevated, steep.&#8221; From that he gets &#8220;heaps of silver.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2251"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1546><b>tc</b> This is the same verb as in Ps 37:4. G. R. Driver suggests the word comes from another root that means &#8220;abandon oneself to, depend on&#8221; (&#8220;Problems in the Hebrew text of Job,&#8221; VTSup 3 [1955]: 84).</p>
<A NAME="2252"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=1547><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;to him&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text, but are implied.</p>
<A NAME="2253"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1548><b>tn</b> The word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gazar</font>, &#8220;to cut&#8221;), in the sense of deciding a matter.</p>
<A NAME="2254"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1549><b>tn</b> There is no expressed subject here, and so the verb is taken as a passive voice again.</p>
<A NAME="2255"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=1550><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1461;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gevah</font>) means &#8220;loftiness; pride.&#8221; Here it simply says &#8220;up,&#8221; or &#8220;pride.&#8221; The rest is paraphrased. Of the many suggestions, the following provide a sampling: &#8220;It is because of pride&#8221; (ESV), &#8220;he abases pride&#8221; (H. H. Rowley); &#8220;[he abases] the lofty and the proud&#8221; (Beer); &#8220;[he abases] the word of pride&#8221; [Duhm]; &#8220;[he abases] the haughtiness of pride&#8221; [Fohrer and others]; &#8220;[he abases] the one who speaks proudly&#8221; [Weiser]; &#8220;[he abases] the one who boasts in pride&#8221; [Kissane]; and &#8220;God [abases] pride&#8221; [Budde, Gray].</p>
<A NAME="2256"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=1551><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;humble&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the lowly of eyes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2257"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=1552><b>tc</b> The Hebrew has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;&#1504;&#1464;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">i naqi</font>), which could be taken as &#8220;island of the innocent&#8221; (so Ibn-Ezra), or &#8220;him that is not innocent&#8221; (so Rashi). But some have changed <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">i</font>) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ish</font>, &#8220;the innocent man&#8221;). Others differ: A. Guillaume links <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">i</font>) to Arabic &#8216;<i>ayya</i> &#8220;whosoever,&#8221; and so leaves the text alone. M. Dahood secures the same idea from Ugaritic, but reads it <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">e</font>).</p>
<A NAME="2258"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=1553><b>tc</b> The MT has &#8220;he will escape [or be delivered].&#8221; Theodotion has the second person, &#8220;you will be delivered.&#8221;</p>
