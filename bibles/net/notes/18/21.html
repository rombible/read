<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1417><b>sn</b> In this chapter Job actually answers the ideas of all three of his friends. Here Job finds the flaw in their argument &#8211; he can point to wicked people who prosper. But whereas in the last speech, when he looked on his suffering from the perspective of his innocence, he found great faith and hope, in this chapter when he surveys the divine government of the world, he sinks to despair. The speech can be divided into five parts: he appeals for a hearing (2-6), he points out the prosperity of the wicked (7-16), he wonders exactly when the godless suffer (17-22), he shows how death levels everything (23-26), and he reveals how experience contradicts his friends&#8217; argument (27-34).</p>
<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1418><b>tn</b> The intensity of the appeal is again expressed by the imperative followed by the infinitive absolute for emphasis. See note on &#8220;listen carefully&#8221; in 13:17.</p>
<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1419><b>tc</b> The LXX negates the sentence, &#8220;that I may not have this consolation from you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1420><b>tn</b> The word <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1504;&#1456;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1465;&#1514;&#1461;&#1497;&#1499;&#1462;&#1501;</font></i> (<font face="Scholar">tankhumotekhem</font>) is literally &#8220;your consolations,&#8221; the suffix being a subjective genitive. The friends had thought they were offering Job consolation (Job 14:11), but the consolation he wants from them is that they listen to him and respond accordingly.</p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1421><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nasa</font>&#8217;) means &#8220;to lift up; to raise up&#8221;; but in this context it means &#8220;to endure; to tolerate&#8221; (see Job 7:21).</p>
<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1422><b>tn</b> The conjunction and the independent personal pronoun draw emphatic attention to the subject of the verb: &#8220;and I on my part will speak.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1423><b>tn</b> The adverbial clauses are constructed of the preposition &#8220;after&#8221; and the Piel<i> </i>infinitive construct with the subjective genitive suffix: &#8220;my speaking,&#8221; or &#8220;I speak.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1424><b>tn</b> The verb is the imperfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1490;</font> (<font face="Scholar">la</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ag</font>). The Hiphil has the same basic sense as the Qal, &#8220;to mock; to deride.&#8221; The imperfect here would be modal, expressing permission. The verb is in the singular, suggesting that Job is addressing Zophar; however, most of the versions put it into the plural. Note the singular in 16:3 between the plural in 16:1 and 16:4.</p>
<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1425><b>tn</b> The addition of the independent pronoun at the beginning of the sentence (&#8220;Is it I / against a man / my complaint&#8221;) strengthens the pronominal suffix on &#8220;complaint&#8221; (see GKC 438 §135.<i>f</i>).</p>
<A NAME="2110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1426><b>sn</b> The point seems to be that if his complaint were merely against men he might expect sympathy from other men; but no one dares offer him sympathy when his complaint is against God. So he will give free expression to his spirit (H. H. Rowley, <i>Job</i> [NCBC], 147).</p>
<A NAME="2111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1427><b>tn</b> On disjunctive interrogatives, see GKC 475 §150.<i>g</i>.</p>
<A NAME="2112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1428><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;why should my spirit/breath not be short&#8221; (see Num 21:4; Judg 16:16).</p>
<A NAME="2113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1429><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pÿnu</font>) is from the verb &#8220;to turn,&#8221; related to the word for &#8220;face.&#8221; In calling for them to turn toward him, he is calling for them to look at him. But here it may be more in the sense of their attention rather than just a looking at him.</p>
<A NAME="2114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1430><b>tn</b> The idiom is &#8220;put a hand over a mouth,&#8221; the natural gesture for keeping silent and listening (cf. Job 29:9; 40:4; Mic 7:16).</p>
<A NAME="2115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1431><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zakhar</font>, &#8220;to remember&#8221;). Here it has the sense of &#8220;to keep in memory; to meditate; to think upon.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1432><b>tn</b> The main clause is introduced here by the conjunction, following the adverbial clause of time.</p>
<A NAME="2117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1433><b>tn</b> Some commentators take &#8220;shudder&#8221; to be the subject of the verb, &#8220;a shudder seizes my body.&#8221; But the word is feminine (and see the usage, especially in Job 9:6 and 18:20). It is the subject in Isa 21:4; Ps 55:6; and Ezek 7:18.</p>
<A NAME="2118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1434><b>sn</b> A. B. Davidson (<i>Job</i>, 154) clarifies that Job&#8217;s question is of a universal scope. In the government of God, why do the wicked exist at all? The verb could be translated &#8220;continue to live.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1435><b>tn</b> The verb <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1511;</font></i> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ataq</font>) means &#8220;to move; to proceed; to advance.&#8221; Here it is &#8220;to advance in years&#8221; or &#8220;to grow old.&#8221; This clause could serve as an independent clause, a separate sentence; but it more likely continues the question of the first colon and is parallel to the verb &#8220;live.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1436><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;their seed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1437><b>tn</b> The text uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1501; &#1506;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lifnehem </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">immam</font>, &#8220;before them, with them&#8221;). Many editors think that these were alternative readings, and so omit one or the other. Dhorme moved <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">immam)</font><i> </i>to the second half of the verse and emended it to read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1465;&#1502;&#1456;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">omÿdim</font>, &#8220;abide&#8221;). Kissane and Gordis changed only the vowels and came up with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ammam</font>, &#8220;their kinfolk&#8221;). But Gordis thinks the presence of both of them in the line is evidence of a conflated reading (p. 229).</p>
<A NAME="2122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1438><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shalom</font>, &#8220;peace, safety&#8221;) is here a substantive after a plural subject (see GKC 452 §141.<i>c</i>, n. 3).</p>
<A NAME="2123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1439><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mippakhad</font>) is translated &#8220;without fear,&#8221; literally &#8220;from fear&#8221;; the preposition is similar to the alpha privative in Greek. The word &#8220;fear, dread&#8221; means nothing that causes fear or dread &#8211; they are peaceful, secure. See GKC 382 §119.<i>w</i>.</p>
<A NAME="2124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1440><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;no rod of God.&#8221; The words &#8220;punishment from&#8221; have been supplied in the translation to make the metaphor understandable for the modern reader by stating the purpose of the rod.</p>
<A NAME="2125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1441><b>sn</b> In 9:34 Job was complaining that there was no umpire to remove God&#8217;s rod from him, but here he observes no such rod is on the wicked.</p>
<A NAME="2126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1442><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his bull,&#8221; but it is meant to signify the bulls of the wicked.</p>
<A NAME="2127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1443><b>tn</b> The verb used here means &#8220;to impregnate,&#8221; and not to be confused with the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avar</font>, &#8220;to pass over&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="2128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1444><b>tn</b> The use of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ga</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ar</font>) in this place is interesting. It means &#8220;to rebuke; to abhor; to loathe.&#8221; In the causative stem it means &#8220;to occasion impurity&#8221; or &#8220;to reject as loathsome.&#8221; The rabbinic interpretation is that it does not emit semen in vain, and so the meaning is it does not fail to breed (see E. Dhorme, <i>Job</i>, 311; R. Gordis, <i>Job</i>, 229).</p>
<A NAME="2129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1445><b>tn</b> The verb <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;</font></i> (<font face="Scholar">shalakh</font>) means &#8220;to send forth,&#8221; but in the Piel &#8220;to release; to allow to run free.&#8221; The picture of children frolicking in the fields and singing and dancing is symbolic of peaceful, prosperous times.</p>
<A NAME="2130"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1446><b>tn</b> The verb is simply &#8220;they take up [or lift up],&#8221; but the understood object is &#8220;their voices,&#8221; and so it means &#8220;they sing.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1447><b>tc</b> The <i>Kethib</i> has &#8220;they wear out&#8221; but the <i>Qere</i> and the versions have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1499;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿkhallu</font>, &#8220;bring to an end&#8221;). The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kalah</font>) means &#8220;to finish; to complete,&#8221; and here with the object &#8220;their days,&#8221; it means that they bring their life to a (successful) conclusion. Both readings are acceptable in the context, with very little difference in the overall meaning (which according to Gordis is proof the <i>Qere</i> does not always correct the <i>Kethib</i>).</p>
<A NAME="2132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1448><b>tc</b> The MT has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1461;&#1495;&#1464;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yekhattu</font>, &#8220;they are frightened [or broken]&#8221;), taking the verb from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khatat</font>, &#8220;be terrified&#8221;). But most would slightly repoint it to <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1461;&#1495;&#1464;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;</font></i> (<font face="Scholar">yekhatu</font>), an Aramaism, &#8220;they go down,&#8221; from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhat</font>, &#8220;go down&#8221;). See Job 17:16.</p>
<A NAME="2133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1449><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1462;&#1490;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rega</font>&#8217;) has been interpreted as &#8220;in a moment&#8221; or &#8220;in peace&#8221; (on the basis of Arabic <i>raja`a</i>, &#8220;return to rest&#8221;). Gordis thinks this is a case of <i>talhin &#8211; </i>both meanings present in the mind of the writer.</p>
<A NAME="2134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1450><b>tn</b> The absence of the preposition before the complement adds greater vividness to the statement: &#8220;and knowing your ways &#8211; we do not desire.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2135"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1451><b>sn</b> Contrast Ps 25:4, which affirms that walking in God&#8217;s ways means to obey God&#8217;s will &#8211; the Torah.</p>
<A NAME="2136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1452><b>tn</b> The interrogative clause is followed by <i>ki</i>, similar to Exod 5:2, &#8220;Who is Yahweh, that I should obey him?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1453><b>tn</b> The verb <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1506;</font></i> (<font face="Scholar">paga</font>&#8217;) means &#8220;to encounter; to meet,&#8221; but also &#8220;to meet with request; to intercede; to interpose.&#8221; The latter meaning is a derived meaning by usage.</p>
<A NAME="2138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1454><b>tn</b> The verse is not present in the LXX. It may be that it was considered too blasphemous and therefore omitted.</p>
<A NAME="2139"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1455><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;is not in their hand.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The implication of this statement is that their well-being is from God, which is the problem Job is raising in the chapter. A number of commentators make it a question, interpreting it to mean that the wicked enjoy prosperity as if it is their right. Some emend the text to say &#8220;his hands&#8221; &#8211; Gordis reads it, &#8220;Indeed, our prosperity is not in his hands.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2140"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1456><b>sn</b> Even though their life seems so good in contrast to his own plight, Job cannot and will not embrace their principles &#8211; &#8220;far be from me their counsel.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2141"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1457><b>tn</b> The interrogative &#8220;How often&#8221; occurs only with the first colon; it is supplied for smoother reading in the next two.</p>
<A NAME="2142"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1458><b>tn</b> The pronominal suffix is objective; it re-enforces the object of the preposition, &#8220;upon them.&#8221; The verb in the clause is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bo</font>&#8217;) followed by <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font></i> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>), &#8220;come upon [or against],&#8221; may be interpreted as meaning attack or strike.</p>
<A NAME="2143"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1459><b>tn</b> <b><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1458;&#1489;&#1464;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font></b> (<font face="Scholar">khavalim</font>) can mean &#8220;ropes&#8221; or &#8220;cords,&#8221; but that would not go with the verb &#8220;apportion&#8221; in this line. The meaning of &#8220;pangs (as in &#8220;birth-pangs&#8221;) seems to fit best here. The wider meaning would be &#8220;physical agony.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1460><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;to them&#8221; is understood and thus is supplied in the translation for clarification.</p>
<A NAME="2145"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1461><b>tn</b> To retain the sense that the wicked do not suffer as others, this verse must either be taken as a question or a continuation of the question in v. 17.</p>
<A NAME="2146"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1462><b>tn</b> The verb used actually means &#8220;rob.&#8221; It is appropriate to the image of a whirlwind suddenly taking away the wisp of straw.</p>
<A NAME="2147"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1463><b>tn</b> These words are supplied. The verse records an idea that Job suspected they might have, namely, that if the wicked die well God will make their children pay for the sins (see Job 5:4; 20:10; as well as Exod 20:5).</p>
<A NAME="2148"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1464><b>tn</b> The text simply has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ono</font>, &#8220;his iniquity&#8221;), but by usage, &#8220;the punishment for the iniquity.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="2151"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1467><b>tn</b> The text simply has &#8220;let him repay [to] him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2152"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=1468><b>tn</b> The imperfect verb after the jussive carries the meaning of a purpose clause, and so taken as a final imperfect: &#8220;in order that he may know [or realize].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2153"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1469><b>tc</b> This word occurs only here. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kid</font>) was connected to Arabic <i>kaid</i>, &#8220;fraud, trickery,&#8221; or &#8220;warfare.&#8221; The word is emended by the commentators to other ideas, such as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pid</font>, &#8220;[his] calamity&#8221;). Dahood and others alter it to &#8220;cup&#8221;; Wright to &#8220;weapons.&#8221; A. F. L. Beeston argues for a meaning &#8220;condemnation&#8221; for the MT form, and so makes no change in the text (<i>Mus</i> 67 [1954]: 315-16). If the connection to Arabic &#8220;warfare&#8221; is sustained, or if such explanations of the existing MT can be sustained, then the text need not be emended. In any case, the sense of the line is clear.</p>
<A NAME="2154"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1470><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his desire.&#8221; The meaning is that after he is gone he does not care about what happens to his household (&#8220;house&#8221; meaning &#8220;family&#8221; here).</p>
<A NAME="2155"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=1471><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;after him,&#8221; but clearly the meaning is &#8220;after he is gone.&#8221;</p>

The other Hebrew words that are connected to the root <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1510;</font></i> (<font face="Scholar">khatsats</font>) do not offer any help.</p>
<A NAME="2157"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=1473><b>tn</b> The imperfect verb in this question should be given the modal nuance of potential imperfect. The question is rhetorical &#8211; it is affirming that no one can teach God.</p>
<A NAME="2158"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=1474><b>tn</b> The clause begins with the disjunctive <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) and the pronoun, &#8220;and he.&#8221; This is to be subordinated as a circumstantial clause. See GKC 456 §142.<i>d</i>.</p>
<A NAME="2159"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=1475><b>tc</b> The Hebrew has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ramim</font>), a plural masculine participle of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rum</font>, &#8220;to be high; to be exalted&#8221;). This is probably a reference to the angels. But M. Dahood restores an older interpretation that it refers to &#8220;the Most High&#8221; (&#8220;Some Northwest Semitic words in Job,&#8221;<i>Bib</i> 38 [1957]: 316-17). He would take the word as a singular form with an enclitic <font face="Scholar">mem</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1501;</font>). He reads the verse, &#8220;will he judge the Most High?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2160"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=1476><b>tn</b> The line has &#8220;in the bone of his perfection.&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1510;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">etsem</font>), which means &#8220;bone,&#8221; is used pronominally to express &#8220;the same, very&#8221;; here it is &#8220;in the very fullness of his strength&#8221; (see GKC 449 §139.<i>g</i>). The abstract <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tom</font>) is used here in the sense of physical perfection and strengths.</p>
<A NAME="2161"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=1477><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1496;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">atan</font>) has the precise meaning of &#8220;press olives.&#8221; But because here it says &#8220;full of milk,&#8221; the derived meaning for the noun has been made to mean &#8220;breasts&#8221; or &#8220;pails&#8221; (although in later Hebrew this word occurs &#8211; but with olives, not with milk). Dhorme takes it to refer to &#8220;his sides,&#8221; and repoints the word for &#8220;milk&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1489;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khalav</font>) to get &#8220;fat&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1489;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khelev</font>) &#8211; &#8220;his sides are full of fat,&#8221; a rendering followed by NASB. However, this weakens the parallelism.</p>
<A NAME="2162"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=1478><b>tn</b> This interpretation, adopted by several commentaries and modern translations (cf. NAB, NIV), is a general rendering to capture the sense of the line.</p>
<A NAME="2163"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=1479><b>tn</b> The verb <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1492;</font></i> (<font face="Scholar">shaqah</font>) means &#8220;to water&#8221; and here &#8220;to be watered thoroughly.&#8221; The picture in the line is that of health and vigor.</p>
<A NAME="2164"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=1480><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;this (v. 23)&#8230;and this&#8221; (v. 25) means &#8220;one&#8230;the other.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2165"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=1481><b>tn</b> The text literally has &#8220;and this [man] dies in soul of bitterness.&#8221; Some simply reverse it and translate &#8220;in the bitterness of soul.&#8221; The genitive &#8220;bitterness&#8221; may be an attribute adjective, &#8220;with a bitter soul.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2166"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=1482><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;eaten what is good.&#8221; It means he died without having enjoyed the good life.</p>
<A NAME="2167"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=1483><b>tn</b> The word is &#8220;your thoughts.&#8221; The word for &#8220;thoughts&#8221; (from <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1489;</font></i> [<font face="Scholar">khatsav</font>, &#8220;to think; to reckon; to plan&#8221;]) has more to do with their intent than their general thoughts. He knows that when they talked about the fate of the wicked they really were talking about him.</p>
<A NAME="2168"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=1484><b>tn</b> For the meaning of this word, and its root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zamam</font>), see Job 17:11. It usually means the &#8220;plans&#8221; or &#8220;schemes&#8221; that are concocted against someone.</p>
<A NAME="2169"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=1485><b>tn</b> E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 321) distinguishes the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1505;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khamas</font>) from the noun for &#8220;violence.&#8221; He proposes a meaning of &#8220;think, imagine&#8221;: &#8220;and the ideas you imagined about me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2170"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=1486><b>sn</b> The question implies the answer will be &#8220;vanished&#8221; or &#8220;gone.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2171"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=1487><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And where is the tent, the dwellings of the wicked.&#8221; The word &#8220;dwellings of the wicked&#8221; is in apposition to &#8220;tent.&#8221; A relative pronoun must be supplied in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="2172"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=1488><b>tc</b> The LXX reads, &#8220;Ask those who go by the way, and do not disown their signs.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The idea is that the merchants who travel widely will talk about what they have seen and heard. These travelers give a different account of the wicked; they tell how he is spared. E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 322) interprets &#8220;signs&#8221; concretely: &#8220;Their custom was to write their names and their thoughts somewhere at the main cross-roads. The main roads of Sinai are dotted with these scribblings made by such passers of a day.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2173"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=1489><b>tn</b> The verb means &#8220;to be led forth.&#8221; To be &#8220;led forth in the day of trouble&#8221; means to be delivered. </p>
<A NAME="2174"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=1490><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;and he has done&#8221; is taken here to mean &#8220;what he has done.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2175"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">75</span><note=1491><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Who declares his way to his face? // Who repays him for what he has done?&#8221; These rhetorical questions, which expect a negative answer (&#8220;No one!&#8221;) have been translated as indicative statements to bring out their force clearly.</p>
<A NAME="2176"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">76</span><note=1492><b>tn</b> The verb says &#8220;he will watch.&#8221; The subject is unspecified, so the translation is passive.</p>
<A NAME="2177"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=1493><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word refers to the tumulus, the burial mound that is erected on the spot where the person is buried.</p>
<A NAME="2178"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=1494><b>tn</b> The clods are those that are used to make a mound over the body. And, for a burial in the valley, see Deut 34:6. The verse here sees him as participating in his funeral and enjoying it. Nothing seems to go wrong with the wicked.</p>
<A NAME="2179"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">79</span><note=1495><b>tn</b> The word <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font></i> (<font face="Scholar">ma</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) is used for &#8220;treachery; deception; fraud.&#8221; Here Job is saying that their way of interpreting reality is dangerously unfaithful.</p>
