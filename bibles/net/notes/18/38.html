<A NAME="381"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2231><b>sn</b> This is the culmination of it all, the revelation of the <sc>Lord to Job. Most interpreters see here the style and content of the author of the book, a return to the beginning of the book. Here the <sc>Lord speaks to Job and displays his sovereign power and glory. Job has lived through the suffering &#8211; without cursing God. He has held to his integrity, and nowhere regretted it. But he was unaware of the real reason for the suffering, and will remain unaware throughout these speeches. God intervenes to resolve the spiritual issues that surfaced. Job was not punished for sin. And Job&#8217;s suffering had not cut him off from God. In the end the point is that Job cannot have the knowledge to make the assessments he made. It is wiser to bow in submission and adoration of God than to try to judge him. The first speech of God has these sections: the challenge (38:1-3), the surpassing mysteries of earth and sky beyond Job&#8217;s understanding (4-38), and the mysteries of animal and bird life that surpassed his understanding (38:39&#8211;39:30).</p>
<A NAME="382"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2232><b>sn</b> This is not the storm described by Elihu &#8211; in fact, the <sc>Lord ignores Elihu. The storm is a common accompaniment for a theophany (see Ezek 1:4; Nah 1:3; Zech 9:14).</p>
<A NAME="383"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2233><b>tn</b> The demonstrative pronoun is used here to emphasize the interrogative pronoun (see GKC 442 §136.<i>c</i>).</p>
<A NAME="384"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2234><b>sn</b> The referent of &#8220;counsel&#8221; here is not the debate between Job and the friends, but the purposes of God (see Ps 33:10; Prov 19:21; Isa 19:17). Dhorme translates it &#8220;Providence.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="385"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2235><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Gird up your loins.&#8221; This idiom basically describes taking the hem of the long garment or robe and pulling it up between the legs and tucking it into the front of the belt, allowing easier and freer movement of the legs. &#8220;Girding the loins&#8221; meant the preparation for some difficult task (Jer 1:17), or for battle (Isa 5:27), or for running (1 Kgs 18:46). C. Gordon suggests that it includes belt-wrestling, a form of hand-to-hand mortal combat (&#8220;Belt-wrestling in the Bible World,&#8221; <i>HUCA</i> 23 [1950/51]: 136).</p>
<A NAME="386"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2236><b>tn</b> The construction is the infinitive construct in a temporal clause, using the preposition and the subjective genitive suffix.</p>
<A NAME="387"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2237><b>tn</b> The verb is the imperative; it has no object &#8220;me&#8221; in the text.</p>
<A NAME="388"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2238><b>tn</b> The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) is taken here for a conditional clause, &#8220;if you know&#8221; (see GKC 498 §159.<i>dd</i>). Others take it as &#8220;surely&#8221; with a biting irony.</p>
<A NAME="389"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2239><b>tn</b> For the interrogative serving as a genitive, see GKC 442 §136.<i>b</i>.</p>
<A NAME="3810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2240><b>sn</b> The world was conceived of as having bases and pillars, but these poetic descriptions should not be pressed too far (e.g., see Ps 24:2, which may be worded as much for its polemics against Canaanite mythology as anything).</p>
<A NAME="3811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2241><b>sn</b> The expression &#8220;morning stars&#8221; (<i>Heb </i>&#8220;stars of the morning&#8221;) is here placed in parallelism to the angels, &#8220;the sons of God.&#8221; It may refer to the angels under the imagery of the stars, or, as some prefer, it may poetically include all creation. There is a parallel also with the foundation of the temple which was accompanied by song (see Ezra 3:10,11). But then the account of the building of the original tabernacle was designed to mirror creation (see M. Fishbane, <i>Biblical Text and Texture</i>).</p>
<A NAME="3812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2242><b>tn</b> The construction, an adverbial clause of time, uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ranan</font>), which is often a ringing cry, an exultation. The parallelism with &#8220;shout for joy&#8221; shows this to be enthusiastic acclamation. The infinitive is then continued in the next colon with the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive preterite.</p>
<A NAME="3813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2243><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;together.&#8221; This is Dhorme&#8217;s suggestion for expressing how they sang together.</p>
<A NAME="3814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2244><b>tn</b> See Job 1:6.</p>
<A NAME="3815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2245><b>tn</b> The MT has &#8220;and he shut up.&#8221; The Vulgate has &#8220;Who?&#8221; and so many commentaries and editions adopt this reading, if not from the Vulgate, then from the sense of the sequence in the text itself.</p>
<A NAME="3816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2246><b>tn</b> The line uses two expressions, first the temporal clause with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">giakh</font>, &#8220;when it burst forth&#8221;) and then the finite verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1461;&#1510;&#1461;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yetse</font>&#8217;, &#8220;go out&#8221;) to mark the concomitance of the two actions.</p>
<A NAME="3817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2247><b>tn</b> The temporal clause here uses the infinitive from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sim</font>, &#8220;to place; to put; to make&#8221;). It underscores the sovereign placing of things.</p>
<A NAME="3818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2248><b>tn</b> This noun is found only here. The verb is in Ezek 16:4, and a related noun is in Ezek 30:21.</p>
<A NAME="3819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2249><b>tc</b> The MT has &#8220;and I broke,&#8221; which cannot mean &#8220;set, prescribed&#8221; or the like. The LXX and the Vulgate have such a meaning, suggesting a verb<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew"> &#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ashiyt</font>, &#8220;plan, prescribe&#8221;). A. Guillaume finds an Arabic word with a meaning &#8220;measured it by span by my decree.&#8221; Would God give himself a decree? R. Gordis simply argues that the basic meaning &#8220;break&#8221; develops the connotation of &#8220;decide, determine&#8221; (2 Sam 5:24; Job 14:3; Dan 11:36).</p>
<A NAME="3820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2250><b>tn</b> Dhorme suggested reversing the two verbs, making this the first, and then &#8220;shatter&#8221; for the second colon.</p>
<A NAME="3821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2251><b>tn</b> The imperfect verb receives the permission nuance here.</p>
<A NAME="3822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2252><b>tn</b> The text has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1465;&#1505;&#1460;&#1497;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tosif</font>, &#8220;and you may not add&#8221;), which is often used idiomatically (as in verbal hendiadys constructions).</p>
<A NAME="3823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2253><b>tn</b> The MT literally says, &#8220;here he will put on the pride of your waves.&#8221; The verb has no expressed subject and so is made a passive voice. But there has to be some object for the verb &#8220;put,&#8221; such as &#8220;limit&#8221; or &#8220;boundary&#8221;; the translations &#8220;confined; halted; stopped&#8221; all serve to paraphrase such an idea. The LXX has &#8220;broken&#8221; at this point, suggesting the verse might have been confused &#8211; but &#8220;breaking the pride&#8221; of the waves would mean controlling them. Some commentators have followed this, exchanging the verb in v. 11 with this one.</p>
<A NAME="3824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2254><b>tn</b> The Hebrew idiom is &#8220;have you from your days?&#8221; It means &#8220;never in your life&#8221; (see 1 Sam 25:28; 1 Kgs 1:6).</p>
<A NAME="3825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2255><b>tn</b> The verb is the Piel of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yada</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to know&#8221;) with a double accusative.</p>
<A NAME="3826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2256><b>sn</b> The poetic image is that darkness or night is like a blanket that covers the earth, and at dawn it is taken by the edges and shaken out. Since the wicked function under the cover of night, they are included in the shaking when the dawn comes up.</p>
<A NAME="3827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2257><b>sn</b> The verse needs to be understood in the context: as the light shines in the dawn, the features of the earth take on a recognizable shape or form. The language is phenomenological.</p>
<A NAME="3828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2258><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they&#8221;; the referent (the objects or features on the earth) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2259><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;they stand up like a garment&#8221; (NASB, NIV) or &#8220;its features stand out like a garment&#8221; (ESV). The reference could be either to embroidered decoration on a garment or to the folds of a garment (REB: &#8220;until all things stand out like the folds of a cloak&#8221;; cf. J. E. Hartley, <i>Job</i> [NICOT], 497, &#8220;the early light of day makes the earth appear as a beautiful <i>garment, </i>exquisite in design and glorious in color&#8221;). Since this is thought to be an odd statement, some suggest with Ehrlich that the text be changed to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">titsabba</font>&#8217;, &#8220;is dyed [like a garment]&#8221;). This reference would be to the colors appearing on the earth&#8217;s surface under daylight. The present translation follows the emendation.</p>
<A NAME="3830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2260><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the raised arm.&#8221; The words &#8220;in violence&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text, but are supplied in the translation to clarify the metaphor.</p>
<A NAME="3831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2261><b>sn</b> What is active at night, the violence symbolized by the raised arm, is broken with the dawn. G. R. Driver thought the whole verse referred to stars, and that the arm is the navigator&#8217;s term for the line of stars (&#8220;Two astronomical passages in the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>JTS </i>4 [1953]: 208-12).</p>
<A NAME="3832"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2262><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the springs of the sea.&#8221; The words &#8220;that fill&#8221; are supplied in the translation to clarify the meaning of the phrase.</p>
<A NAME="3833"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2263><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;uncovered to you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3834"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2264><b>tn</b> Some still retain the traditional phrase &#8220;shadow of death&#8221; in the English translation (cf. NIV). The reference is to the entrance to Sheol (see Job 10:21).</p>
<A NAME="3835"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2265><b>tn</b> The interrogative with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">derekh</font>) means &#8220;in what road&#8221; or &#8220;in what direction.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3836"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2266><b>tn</b> The suffixes are singular (&#8220;that you may take it to its border&#8230;to its home&#8221;), referring to either the light or the darkness. Because either is referred to, the translation has employed plurals, since singulars would imply that only the second item, &#8220;darkness,&#8221; was the referent. Plurals are also employed by NAB and NIV.</p>
<A NAME="3837"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2267><b>tn</b> The imperfect verb after the adverb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1494;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">az</font>, &#8220;then&#8221;) functions as a preterite: &#8220;you were born.&#8221; The line is sarcastic.</p>
<A NAME="3838"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2268><b>sn</b> Snow and ice are thought of as being in store, brought out by God for specific purposes, such as times of battle (see Josh 10:11; Exod 9:2ff.; Isa 28:17; Isa 30:30; and Ps 18:12 [13]).</p>
<A NAME="3839"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2269><b>tn</b> The same Hebrew term (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1510;&#1464;&#1512;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">otsar</font>), has been translated &#8220;storehouse&#8221; in the first line and &#8220;armory&#8221; in the second. This has been done for stylistic variation, but also because &#8220;hail,&#8221; as one of God&#8217;s &#8220;weapons&#8221; (cf. the following verse) suggests military imagery; in this context the word refers to God&#8217;s &#8220;ammunition dump&#8221; where he stockpiles hail.</p>
<A NAME="3840"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=2270><b>sn</b> The terms translated <i>war</i> and <i>battle</i> are different Hebrew words, but both may be translated &#8220;war&#8221; or &#8220;battle&#8221; depending on the context.</p>
<A NAME="3841"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=2271><b>tn</b> Because the parallel with &#8220;light&#8221; and &#8220;east wind&#8221; is not tight, Hoffmann proposed &#8216;<i>ed</i> instead, &#8220;mist.&#8221; This has been adopted by many. G. R. Driver suggests &#8220;parching heat&#8221; (&#8220;Problems in the Hebrew text of Job,&#8221; VTSup 3 [1955]: 91-92).</p>
<A NAME="3842"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=2272><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;on a land, no man.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3843"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2273><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a desert, no man in it.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3844"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=2274><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to cause to sprout <i>a source of</i> vegetation.&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1465;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">motsa</font>&#8217;) is rendered &#8220;mine&#8221; in Job 28:1. The suggestion with the least changes is Wright&#8217;s: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1502;&#1461;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsame</font>&#8217;, &#8220;thirsty&#8221;). But others choose <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mitsiyyah</font>, &#8220;from the steppe&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="3845"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=2275><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;heavens.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shamayim</font>) may be translated &#8220;heaven(s)&#8221; or &#8220;sky&#8221; depending on the context.</p>
<A NAME="3846"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=2276><b>tn</b> Several suggest that the verb is not from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khava</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to hide&#8221;) but from a homonym, &#8220;to congeal.&#8221; This may be too difficult to support, however.</p>
<A NAME="3847"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=2277><b>tn</b> This word is found here and in 1 Sam 15:32. Dhorme suggests, with others, that there has been a metathesis (a reversal of consonants), and it is the same word found in Job 31:36 (&#8220;bind&#8221;). G. R. Driver takes it as &#8220;cluster&#8221; without changing the text (&#8220;Two astronomical passages in the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>JTS </i>7 [1956] :3).</p>
<A NAME="3848"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=2278><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1494;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mazzarot</font>) is taken by some to refer to the constellations (see 2 Kgs 23:5), and by others as connected to the word for &#8220;crown,&#8221; and so &#8220;corona.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3849"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=2279><b>sn</b> See Job 9:9.</p>
<A NAME="3850"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=2280><b>tc</b> The LXX has &#8220;answer you,&#8221; and some editors have adopted this. However, the reading of the MT makes better sense in the verse.</p>
<A NAME="3851"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=2281><b>tn</b> This verse is difficult because of the two words, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1467;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tukhot</font>, rendered here &#8220;heart&#8221;) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1499;&#1456;&#1493;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sekhvi</font>, here &#8220;mind&#8221;). They have been translated a number of ways: &#8220;meteor&#8221; and &#8220;celestial appearance&#8221;; the stars &#8220;Procyon&#8221; and &#8220;Sirius&#8221;; &#8220;inward part&#8221; and &#8220;mind&#8221;; even as birds, &#8220;ibis&#8221; and &#8220;cock.&#8221; One expects them to have something to do with nature &#8211; clouds and the like. The RSV accordingly took them to mean &#8220;meteor&#8221; (from a verb &#8220;to wander&#8221;) and &#8220;a celestial appearance.&#8221; But these meanings are not well-attested.</p>
<A NAME="3852"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=2282><b>tn</b> The word actually means &#8220;to cause to lie down.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3853"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=2283><b>tn</b> The word means &#8220;to flow&#8221; or &#8220;to cast&#8221; (as in casting metals). So the noun developed the sense of &#8220;hard,&#8221; as in cast metal.</p>
<A NAME="3854"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=2284><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fill up the life of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3855"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=2285><b>tn</b> The verse is difficult, making some suspect that a line has dropped out. The little birds in the nest hardly go wandering about looking for food. Dhorme suggest &#8220;and stagger for lack of food.&#8221;</p>
