<A NAME="1735"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1237><b>tn</b> The repetition of &#8220;my hope&#8221; in the verse has thrown the versions off, and their translations have led commentators also to change the second one to something like &#8220;goodness,&#8221; on the assumption that a word cannot be repeated in the same verse. The word actually carries two different senses here. The first would be the basic meaning &#8220;hope,&#8221; but the second a metonymy of cause, namely, what hope produces, what will be seen.</p>
