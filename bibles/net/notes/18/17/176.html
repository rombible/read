<A NAME="176"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1208><b>tn</b> The meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hammÿrotam</font>) is unclear, and the versions offer no help. If the MT is correct, it would probably be connected to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">marah</font>, &#8220;to be rebellious&#8221;) and the derived form something like &#8220;hostility; provocation.&#8221; But some commentators suggest it should be related to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;&#1465;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">marorot</font>, &#8220;bitter things&#8221;). Others have changed both the noun and the verb to obtain something like &#8220;My eye is weary of their contentiousness&#8221; (Holscher), or mine eyes are wearied by your stream of peevish complaints&#8221; (G. R. Driver, &#8220;Problems in the Hebrew text of Job,&#8221; VTSup 3 [1955]: 78). There is no alternative suggestion that is compelling.</p>
