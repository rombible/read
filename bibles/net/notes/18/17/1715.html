<A NAME="1715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1217><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1465;&#1508;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tofet</font>) is a <i>hapax legomenon</i>. The expression is &#8220;and a spitting in/to the face I have become,&#8221; i.e., &#8220;I have become one in whose face people spit.&#8221; Various suggestions have been made, including a link to Tophet, but they are weak. The verse as it exists in the MT is fine, and fits the context well.</p>
