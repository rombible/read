<A NAME="177"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1209><b>tn</b> The MT has two imperatives: &#8220;Lay down, pledge me, with me.&#8221; Most commentators think that the second imperative should be a noun, and take it to say, &#8220;Lay my pledge with/beside you.&#8221; A. B. Davidson (<i>Job</i>, 126) suggests that the first verb means &#8220;give a pledge,&#8221; and so the two similar verbs would be emphatic: &#8220;Give a pledge, be my surety.&#8221; Other than such a change (which would involve changing the vowels) one would have to interpret similarly by seeing the imperatives as a kind of hendiadys, with the main emphasis being on the second imperative, &#8220;make a pledge.&#8221;</p>
