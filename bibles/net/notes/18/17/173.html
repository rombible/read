<A NAME="173"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1205><b>tn</b> The plural &#8220;graves&#8221; could be simply an intensification, a plural of extension (see GKC 397 §124.<i>c</i>), or a reference to the graveyard. Coverdale had: &#8220;I am harde at deathes dore.&#8221; The Hebrew expression simply reads &#8220;graves for me.&#8221; It probably means that graves await him.</p>
