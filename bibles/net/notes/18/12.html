<A NAME="121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=871><b>sn</b> This long speech of Job falls into three parts: in 12:2-25 Job expresses his resentment at his friends&#8217; attitude of superiority and acknowledges the wisdom of God; then, in 13:1-28 Job expresses his determination to reason with God, expresses his scorn for his friends&#8217; advice, and demands to know what his sins are; and finally, in 14:1-22 Job laments the brevity of life and the finality of death. </p>
<A NAME="122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=872><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;you are the people&#8221; is a way of saying that the friends hold the popular opinion &#8211; they represent it. The line is sarcastic. Commentators do not think the parallelism is served well by this, and so offer changes for &#8220;people.&#8221; Some have suggested &#8220;you are complete&#8221; (based on Arabic), &#8220;you are the strong one&#8221; (based on Ugaritic), etc. J. A. Davies tried to solve the difficulty by making the second clause in the verse a paratactic relative clause: &#8220;you are the people with whom wisdom will die&#8221; (&#8220;Note on Job 12:2,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 25 [1975]: 670-71).</p>
<A NAME="123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=873><b>sn</b> The sarcasm of Job admits their claim to wisdom, as if no one has it besides them. But the rest of his speech will show that they do not have a monopoly on it.</p>
<A NAME="124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=874><b>tn</b> The word is literally &#8220;heart,&#8221; meaning a mind or understanding.</p>
<A NAME="125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=875><b>tn</b> Because this line is repeated in 13:2, many commentators delete it from this verse (as does the LXX). The Syriac translates <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1465;&#1508;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nofel</font>) as &#8220;little,&#8221; and the Vulgate &#8220;inferior.&#8221; Job is saying that he does not fall behind them in understanding.</p>
<A NAME="126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=876><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;With whom are not such things as these?&#8221; The point is that everyone knows the things that these friends have been saying &#8211; they are commonplace.</p>
<A NAME="127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=877><b>tn</b> Some are troubled by the disharmony with &#8220;I am&#8221; and &#8220;to his friend.&#8221; Even though the difficulty is not insurmountable, some have emended the text. Some simply changed the verb to &#8220;he is,&#8221; which was not very compelling. C. D. Isbell argued that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ehyeh</font>, &#8220;I am&#8221;) is an orthographic variant of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yihyeh</font>, &#8220;he will&#8221;) &#8211; &#8220;a person who does not know these things would be a laughingstock&#8221; (<i>JANESCU</i> 37 [1978]: 227-36). G. R. Driver suggests the meaning of the MT is something like &#8220;(One that is) a mockery to his friend I am to be.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=878><b>tn</b> The word simply means &#8220;laughter&#8221;; but it can also mean the object of laughter (see Jer 20:7). The LXX jumps from one &#8220;laughter&#8221; to the next, eliminating everything in between, presumably due to haplography.</p>
<A NAME="129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=879><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his friend.&#8221; A number of English versions (e.g., NASB, NIV, NRSV, NLT) take this collectively, &#8220;to my friends.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=880><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;one calling to God and he answered him.&#8221; H. H. Rowley (<i>Job</i> [NCBC], 92) contends that because Job has been saying that God is not answering him, these words must be part of the derisive words of his friends.</p>
<A NAME="1211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=881><b>tn</b> The two words, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1511; &#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsadiq tamim</font>), could be understood as a hendiadys (= &#8220;blamelessly just&#8221;) following W. G. E. Watson (<i>Classical Hebrew Poetry</i>, 327).</p>
<A NAME="1212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=882><b>tn</b> The first word, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lapid</font>), could be rendered &#8220;a torch of scorn,&#8221; but this gives no satisfying meaning. The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lamed</font>) is often taken as an otiose letter, and the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pid</font>) is &#8220;misfortune, calamity&#8221; (cf. Job 30:24; 31:29).</p>
<A NAME="1213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=883><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ashtut</font>, preferably <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">ashtot</font>) is an abstract noun from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ashat</font>, &#8220;to think&#8221;). The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anan</font>) means &#8220;easy in mind, carefree,&#8221; and &#8220;happy.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=884><b>tn</b> The form has traditionally been taken to mean &#8220;is ready&#8221; from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kun</font><i>, </i>&#8220;is fixed, sure&#8221;). But many commentators look for a word parallel to &#8220;calamity.&#8221; So the suggestion has been put forward that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1499;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhon</font>) be taken as a noun from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhah</font>, &#8220;strike, smite&#8221;): &#8220;a blow&#8221; (Schultens, Dhorme, Gordis), &#8220;thrust&#8221; or &#8220;kick&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 698 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1499;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font>).</p>
<A NAME="1215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=885><b>tn</b> The verse gives the other side of the coin now, the fact that the wicked prosper.</p>
<A NAME="1216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=886><b>tn</b> The plural is used to suggest the supreme degree of arrogant confidence (E. Dhorme, <i>Job</i>, 171).</p>
<A NAME="1217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=887><b>sn</b> The line is perhaps best understood as describing one who thinks he is invested with the power of God. </p>
<A NAME="1218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=888><b>sn</b> As J. E. Hartley (<i>Job</i> [NICOT], 216) observes, in this section Job argues that respected tradition &#8220;must not be accepted uncritically.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=889><b>tn</b> The singular verb is used here with the plural collective subject (see GKC 464 §145.<i>k</i>).</p>
<A NAME="1220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=890><b>tn</b> The word in the MT means &#8220;to complain,&#8221; not simply &#8220;to speak,&#8221; and one would expect animals as the object here in parallel to the last verse. So several commentators have replaced the word with words for animals or reptiles &#8211; totally different words (cf. NAB, &#8220;reptiles&#8221;). The RSV and NRSV have here the word &#8220;plants&#8221; (see 30:4, 7; and Gen 21:15).</p>
<A NAME="1221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=891><b>tn</b> A. B. Davidson (<i>Job</i>, 90) offers a solution by taking &#8220;earth&#8221; to mean all the lower forms of life that teem in the earth (a metonymy of subject). </p>
<A NAME="1222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=892><b>tn</b> This line could also be translated &#8220;by all these,&#8221; meaning &#8220;who is not instructed by nature?&#8221; (H. H. Rowley, <i>Job</i> [NCBC], 93). But D. J. A. Clines points out that the verses have presented the animals as having knowledge and communicating it, so the former reading would be best (<i>Job </i>[WBC], 279).</p>
<A NAME="1223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=893><b>tc</b> Some commentators have trouble with the name &#8220;Yahweh&#8221; in this verse, which is not the pattern in the poetic section of Job. Three <sc>mss of Kennicott and two of de Rossi have &#8220;God.&#8221; If this is so the reminiscence of Isaiah 41:20 led the copyist to introduce the tetragrammaton. But one could argue equally that the few <sc>mss with &#8220;God&#8221; were the copyists&#8217; attempt to correct the text in accord with usage elsewhere.</p>
<A NAME="1224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=894><b>sn</b> The expression &#8220;has done this&#8221; probably refers to everything that has been discussed, namely, the way that God in his wisdom rules over the world, but specifically it refers to the infliction of suffering in the world.</p>
<A NAME="1225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=895><b>tn</b> The construction with the relative clause includes a resumptive pronoun referring to God: &#8220;who in his hand&#8221; = &#8220;in whose hand.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=896><b>tn</b> The two words <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ruakh</font>) are synonymous in general. They could be translated &#8220;soul&#8221; and &#8220;spirit,&#8221; but &#8220;soul&#8221; is not precise for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>), and so &#8220;life&#8221; is to be preferred. Since that is the case for the first half of the verse, &#8220;breath&#8221; will be preferable in the second part.</p>
<A NAME="1227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=897><b>tn</b> Human life is made of &#8220;flesh&#8221; and &#8220;spirit.&#8221; So here the line reads &#8220;and the spirit of all flesh of man.&#8221; If the text had simply said &#8220;all flesh,&#8221; that would have applied to all flesh in which there is the breath of life (see Gen 6:17; 7:15). But to limit this to human beings requires the qualification with &#8220;man.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=898><b>tn</b> The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vav</font>) introduces the comparison here (see 5:7; 11:12); see GKC 499 §161.<i>a</i>.</p>
<A NAME="1229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=899><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the palate.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=900><b>tn</b> The final preposition with its suffix is to be understood as a pleonastic <i>dativus ethicus</i> and not translated (see GKC 439 §135.<i>i</i>).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In the rest of the chapter Job turns his attention away from creation to the wisdom of ancient men. In Job 13:1 when Job looks back to this part, he refers to both the eye and the ear. In vv. 13-25 Job refers to many catastrophes which he could not have seen, but must have heard about.</p>
<A NAME="1231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=901><b>tn</b> The statement in the Hebrew Bible simply has &#8220;among the aged &#8211; wisdom.&#8221; Since this seems to be more the idea of the friends than of Job, scholars have variously tried to rearrange it. Some have proposed that Job is citing his friends: &#8220;With the old men, you say, is wisdom&#8221; (Budde, Gray, Hitzig). Others have simply made it a question (Weiser). But others take <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;) from the previous verse and make it the negative here, to say, &#8220;wisdom is not&#8230;.&#8221; But Job will draw on the wisdom of the aged, only with discernment, for ultimately all wisdom is with God.</p>
<A NAME="1232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=902><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;him&#8221;; the referent (God) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=903><b>sn</b> A. B. Davidson (<i>Job</i>, 91) says, &#8220;These attributes of God&#8217;s [<i>sic</i>] confound and bring to nought everything bearing the same name among men.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=904><b>tn</b> The use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hen</font>, equivalent to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>, &#8220;behold&#8221;) introduces a hypothetical condition.</p>
<A NAME="1235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=905><b>tn</b> The verse employs antithetical ideas: &#8220;tear down&#8221; and &#8220;build up,&#8221; &#8220;imprison&#8221; and &#8220;escape.&#8221; The Niphal verbs in the sentences are potential imperfects. All of this is to say that humans cannot reverse the will of God.</p>
<A NAME="1236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=906><b>tc</b> The LXX has a clarification: &#8220;he will dry the earth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=907><b>sn</b> The verse is focusing on the two extremes of drought and flood. Both are described as being under the power of God.</p>
<A NAME="1238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=908><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hafakh</font>) means &#8220;to overthrow; to destroy; to overwhelm.&#8221; It was used in Job 9:5 for &#8220;overturning&#8221; mountains. The word is used in Genesis for the destruction of Sodom.</p>
<A NAME="1239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=909><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tushiyyah</font>) is here rendered &#8220;prudence.&#8221; Some object that God&#8217;s power is intended here, and so a word for power and not wisdom should be included. But v. 13 mentioned wisdom. The point is that it is God&#8217;s efficient wisdom that leads to success. One could interpret this as a metonymy of cause, the intended meaning being victory or success.</p>
<A NAME="1240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=910><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text uses a wordplay here: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1490;&#1461;&#1490;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shogeg</font>) is &#8220;the one going astray,&#8221; i.e., the one who is unable to guard and guide his life. The second word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1490;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mashgeh</font>), from a different but historically related root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1490;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shagah</font>),<i> </i>which here in the Hiphil means &#8220;the one who misleads, causes to go astray.&#8221; These two words are designed to include everybody &#8211; all are under the wisdom of God.</p>
<A NAME="1241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=911><b>tn</b> The personal pronoun normally present as the subject of the participle is frequently omitted (see GKC 381 §119.<i>s</i>).</p>
<A NAME="1242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=912><b>tn</b> GKC 361-62 §116.<i>x</i> notes that almost as a rule a participle beginning a sentence is continued with a finite verb with or without a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vav</font>). Here the participle (&#8220;leads&#8221;) is followed by an imperfect (&#8220;makes fools&#8221;) after a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vav</font>).</p>
<A NAME="1243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=913><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sholal</font>), from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shalal</font>, &#8220;to plunder; to strip&#8221;), is an adjective expressing the state (and is in the singular, as if to say, &#8220;in the state of one naked&#8221; [GKC 375 §118.<i>o</i>]). The word is found in military contexts (see Mic 1:8). It refers to the carrying away of people in nakedness and shame by enemies who plunder (see also Isa 8:1-4). They will go away as slaves and captives, deprived of their outer garments. Some (cf. NAB) suggest &#8220;barefoot,&#8221; based on the LXX of Mic 1:8; but the meaning of that is uncertain. G. R. Driver wanted to derive the word from an Arabic root &#8220;to be mad; to be giddy,&#8221; forming a better parallel.</p>
<A NAME="1244"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=914><b>sn</b> The judges, like the counselors, are nobles in the cities. God may reverse their lot, either by captivity or by shame, and they cannot resist his power.</p>
<A NAME="1245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=915><b>tn</b> Some translate this &#8220;makes mad&#8221; as in Isa 44:25, but this gives the wrong connotation today; more likely God shows them to be fools.</p>
<A NAME="1246"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=916><b>tn</b> The verb may be classified as a gnomic perfect, or possibly a potential perfect &#8211; &#8220;he can loosen.&#8221; The Piel means &#8220;to untie; to unbind&#8221; (Job 30:11; 38:31; 39:5).</p>
<A NAME="1247"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=917><b>tc</b> There is a potential textual difficulty here. The MT has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">musar</font>, &#8220;discipline&#8221;), which might have replaced <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1505;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">moser</font>, &#8220;bond, chain&#8221;) from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asar</font>,<i> </i>&#8220;to bind&#8221;). Or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1463;&#1512;</font> might be an unusual form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (an option noted in <i>HALOT</i> 557 s.v. *<i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1505;&#1461;&#1512;</font></i>). The line is saying that if the kings are bound, God can set them free, and in the second half, if they are free, he can bind them. Others take the view that this word &#8220;bond&#8221; refers to the power kings have over others, meaning that God can reduce kings to slavery.</p>
<A NAME="1248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=918><b>tn</b> Some commentators want to change <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1494;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ezor</font>, &#8220;girdle&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">esur</font>, &#8220;bond&#8221;) because binding the loins with a girdle was an expression for strength. But H. H. Rowley notes that binding the king&#8217;s loins this way would mean so that he would do servitude, menial tasks. Such a reference would certainly indicate troubled times.</p>
<A NAME="1249"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=919><b>tn</b> Except for &#8220;priests,&#8221; the phraseology is identical to v. 17a.</p>
<A NAME="1250"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=920><b>tn</b> The verb has to be defined by its context: it can mean &#8220;falsify&#8221; (Exod 23:8), &#8220;make tortuous&#8221; (Prov 19:3), or &#8220;plunge&#8221; into misfortune (Prov 21:12). God overthrows those who seem to be solid.</p>
<A NAME="1251"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=921><b>tn</b> The original meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eytan</font>) is &#8220;perpetual.&#8221; It is usually an epithet for a torrent that is always flowing. It carries the connotations of permanence and stability; here applied to people in society, it refers to one whose power and influence does not change. These are the pillars of society.</p>
<A NAME="1252"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=922><b>tn</b> The Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1488;&#1457;&#1502;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ne</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">emanim</font>) is the Niphal participle; it is often translated &#8220;the faithful&#8221; in the Bible. The Rabbis rather fancifully took the word from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1488;&#1467;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">um</font>, &#8220;oracle, utterance&#8221;) and so rendered it &#8220;those who are eloquent, fluent in words.&#8221; But that would make this the only place in the Bible where this form came from that root or any other root besides <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aman</font>, &#8220;confirm, support&#8221;). But to say that God takes away the speech of the truthful or the faithful would be very difficult. It has to refer to reliable men, because it is parallel to the elders or old men. The NIV has &#8220;trusted advisers,&#8221; which fits well with kings and judges and priests.</p>
<A NAME="1253"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=923><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he removes the lip of the trusted ones.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1255"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=925><b>tn</b> The expression in Hebrew uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1494;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿziakh</font>, &#8220;belt&#8221;) and the Piel verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rippah</font>, &#8220;to loosen&#8221;) so that &#8220;to loosen the belt of the mighty&#8221; would indicate &#8220;to disarm/incapacitate the mighty.&#8221; Others have opted to change the text: P. Joüon emends to read &#8220;forehead&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;he humbles the brow of the mighty.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1256"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=926><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">afaq</font>, &#8220;to be strong&#8221;) is well-attested, and the form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1508;&#1460;&#1497;&#1511;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">afiq</font>) is a normal adjective formation. So a translation like &#8220;mighty&#8221; (KJV, NIV) or &#8220;powerful&#8221; is acceptable, and further emendations are unnecessary.</p>
<A NAME="1257"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=927><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word is traditionally rendered &#8220;shadow of death&#8221; (so KJV, ASV); see comments at Job 3:3.</p>

Some <sc>mss have a change, reading the form from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1490;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shagah</font>,<i> </i>&#8220;leading astray&#8221;).

<A NAME="1259"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=929><b>tn</b> The difficulty with the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhah</font>) is that it means &#8220;to lead; to guide,&#8221; but not &#8220;to lead away&#8221; or &#8220;to disperse,&#8221; unless this passage provides the context for such a meaning. Moreover, it never has a negative connotation. Some vocalize it <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyannikhem</font>), from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nuakh</font>), the causative meaning of &#8220;rest,&#8221; or &#8220;abandon&#8221; (Driver, Gray, Gordis). But even there it would mean &#8220;leave in peace.&#8221; Blommerde suggests the second part is antithetical parallelism, and so should be positive. So Ball proposed <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1495;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyimkhem</font>) from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">makhah</font>): &#8220;and he cuts them off.&#8221;</p>

But in this passage some commentators emend the text to a Niphal of the verb and put it in the plural, to get the reading &#8220;they reel to and fro.&#8221; But even if the verse closes the chapter and there is no further need for a word of divine causation, the Hiphil sense works well here &#8211; causing people to wander <i>like a drunken man</i> would be the same as making them stagger.</p>
