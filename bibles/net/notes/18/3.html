<A NAME="31"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=136><b>sn</b> The previous chapters (1-2) were prose narrative, this chapter, however, commences the poetic section of the book (chs. 3-41) containing the cycles of speeches.</p>
<A NAME="32"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=137><b>sn</b> The detailed introduction to the speech with &#8220;he opened his mouth&#8221; draws the readers attention to what was going to be said. As the introduction to the poetic speech that follows (3:3-26), vv. 1-2 continue the prose style of chapters 1-2. Each of the subsequent speeches is introduced by such a prose heading.</p>
<A NAME="33"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=138><b>tn</b> The verb &#8220;cursed&#8221; is the Piel preterite from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qalal</font>); this means &#8220;to be light&#8221; in the Qal stem, but here &#8220;to treat lightly, with contempt, curse.&#8221; See in general H. C. Brichto, <i>The Problem of </i>&#8220;<i>Curse</i>&#8221;<i> in the Hebrew Bible</i> (JBLMS); and A. C. Thiselton, &#8220;The Supposed Power of Words in the Biblical Writings,&#8221; <i>JTS</i> 25 (1974): 283-99.</p>
<A NAME="34"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=139><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his day&#8221; (so KJV, ASV, NAB). The Syriac has &#8220;the day on which he was born.&#8221; The context makes it clear that Job meant the day of his birth. But some have tried to offer a different interpretation, such as his destiny or his predicament. For this reason the Syriac clarified the meaning for their readers in much the same way as the present translation does by rendering &#8220;his day&#8221; as &#8220;the day he was born.&#8221; On the Syriac translation of the book of Job, see Heidi M. Szpek, <i>Translation Technique in the Peshitta to Job</i> (SBLDS).</p>
<A NAME="35"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=140><b>tn</b> The text has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">an</font>), literally, &#8220;and he answered.&#8221; The LXX simply has &#8220;saying&#8221; for the entire verse. The Syriac, Targum, and Greek A have what the MT has. &#8220;[Someone] answered and said&#8221; is phraseology characteristic of all the speeches in Job beginning with Satan in 1:9. Only in 40:1 is it employed when God is speaking. No other portion of the OT employs this phraseology as often or as consistently.</p>
<A NAME="36"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=141><b>tn</b> The relative clause is carried by the preposition with the resumptive pronoun: &#8220;the day [which] I was born <i>in it</i>&#8221; meaning &#8220;the day on which I was born&#8221; (see GKC 486-88 §155.<i>f</i>, <i>i</i>).</p>
<A NAME="37"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=142><b>tn</b> The verb is the Niphal imperfect. It may be interpreted in this dependent clause (1) as representing a future event from some point of time in the past &#8211; &#8220;the day on which I was born&#8221; or &#8220;would be born&#8221; (see GKC 316 §107.<i>k</i>). Or (2) it may simply serve as a preterite indicating action that is in the past.</p>
<A NAME="38"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=143><b>tn</b> The MT simply has &#8220;and the night &#8211; it said&#8230;.&#8221; By simple juxtaposition with the parallel construction (&#8220;on which I was born&#8221;) the verb &#8220;it said&#8221; must be a relative clause explaining &#8220;the night.&#8221; Rather than supply &#8220;in which&#8221; and make the verb passive (which is possible since no specific subject is provided, but leaves open the question of who said it), it is preferable to take the verse as a personification. First Job cursed the day; now he cursed the night that spoke about what it witnessed. See A. Ehrman, &#8220;A Note on the Verb &#8216;<i>amar</i>,&#8221; <i>JQR</i> 55 (1964/65): 166-67.</p>
<A NAME="39"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=144><b>tn</b> The word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gever</font>, &#8220;a man&#8221;). The word usually distinguishes a man as strong, distinct from children and women. Translations which render this as &#8220;boy&#8221; (to remove the apparent contradiction of an adult being &#8220;conceived&#8221; in the womb) miss this point.</p>
<A NAME="310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=145><b>sn</b> The announcement at birth is to the fact that a male was conceived. The same parallelism between &#8220;brought forth/born&#8221; and &#8220;conceived&#8221; may be found in Ps 51:7 HT (51:5 ET). The motifs of the night of conception and the day of birth will be developed by Job. For the entire verse, which is more a wish or malediction than a curse, see S. H. Blank, &#8220;&#8216;Perish the Day!&#8217; A Misdirected Curse (Job 3:3),&#8221; <i>Prophetic Thought</i>, 61-63.</p>
<A NAME="311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=146><b>tn</b> The first two words should be treated as a <i>casus pendens</i> (see D. J. A. Clines, <i>Job </i>[WBC], 69), referred to as an extraposition in recent grammarians.</p>
<A NAME="312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=147><b>sn</b> This expression by Job is the negation of the divine decree at creation &#8211; &#8220;Let there be light,&#8221; and that was the first day. Job wishes that his first day be darkness: &#8220;As for that day, let there be darkness.&#8221; Since only God has this prerogative, Job adds the wish that God on high would not regard that day.</p>
<A NAME="313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=148><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">darash</font>) means &#8220;to seek, inquire,&#8221; and &#8220;to address someone, be concerned about something&#8221; (cf. Deut 11:12; Jer 30:14,17). Job wants the day to perish from the mind of God.</p>
<A NAME="314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=149><b>tn</b> The verb is the Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yafa</font>&#8217;), which means here &#8220;cause to shine.&#8221; The subject is the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nÿharah</font>,&#8220;light&#8221;), a <i>hapax legomenon</i> which is from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nahar</font>, &#8220;to gleam&#8221; [see Isa 60:5]).</p>
<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=150><b>sn</b> The translation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1493;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsalmavet</font>, &#8220;shadow of death&#8221;) has been traditionally understood to indicate a dark, death shadow (supported in the LXX), but many scholars think it may not represent the best etymological analysis of the word. The word may be connected to an Arabic word which means &#8220;to be dark,&#8221; and an Akkadian word meaning &#8220;black.&#8221; It would then have to be repointed throughout its uses to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsalmut</font>) forming an abstract ending. It would then simply mean &#8220;darkness&#8221; rather than &#8220;shadow of death.&#8221; Or the word can be understood as an idiomatic expression meaning &#8220;gloom&#8221; that is deeper than <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khoshekh</font>; see <i>HALOT</i> 1029 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1493;&#1462;&#1514;</font>). Since &#8220;darkness&#8221; has already been used in the line, the two together could possibly form a nominal hendiadys: &#8220;Let the deepest darkness&#8230;.&#8221; There is a significant amount of literature on this; one may begin with W. L. Michel, &#8220;SLMWT, &#8216;Deep Darkness&#8217; or &#8216;Shadow of Death&#8217;?&#8221; <i>BR</i> 29 (1984): 5-20.</p>
<A NAME="316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=151><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ga</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>, &#8220;redeem, claim&#8221;). Some have suggested that the verb is actually the homonym &#8220;pollute.&#8221; This is the reading in the Targum, Syriac, Vulgate, and Rashi, who quotes from Mal 1:7,12. See A. R. Johnson, &#8220;The Primary Meaning of <i>ga</i>&#8217;<i>al,</i>&#8221;<i> </i>VTSup 1 (1953): 67-77.</p>
<A NAME="317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=152><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;the blackness of the day&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497; &#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kimrire yom</font>) probably means everything that makes the day black, such as supernatural events like eclipses. Job wishes that all ominous darknesses would terrify that day. It comes from the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kamar</font>, &#8220;to be black&#8221;), related to Akkadian <font face="Scholar">kamaru</font> (&#8220;to overshadow, darken&#8221;). The versions seem to have ignored the first letter and connected the word to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">marar</font>, &#8220;be bitter&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=153><b>tn</b> The verb is simply <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">laqakh</font>, &#8220;to take&#8221;). Here it conveys a strong sense of seizing something and not letting it go.</p>
<A NAME="319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=154><b>tn</b> The pointing of the verb is meant to connect it with the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khadah</font>, &#8220;rejoice&#8221;). But the letters in the text were correctly understood by the versions to be from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yakhad</font>, &#8220;to be combined, added&#8221;). See G. Rendsburg, &#8220;Double Polysemy in Genesis 49:6 and Job 3:6,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 44 (1982): 48-51. </p>
<A NAME="320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=155><b>sn</b> The choice of this word for &#8220;moons,&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿrakhim</font>) instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1459;&#1491;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khodashim</font>) is due to the fact that &#8220;month&#8221; here is not a reference for which an exact calendar date is essential (in which case <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1491;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> [<font face="Scholar">khodesh</font>] would have been preferred). See J. Segal, &#8220;&#8216;<font face="Scholar">yrh</font>&#8217; in the Gezer &#8216;Calendar,&#8217;&#8221; <i>JSS</i> 7 (1962): 220, n. 4. Twelve times in the OT <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1462;&#1512;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yerakh</font>) means &#8220;month&#8221; (Exod 2:2; Deut 21:13; 33:14; 1 Kgs 6:37, 38; 8:2; 2 Kgs 15:13; Zech 11:8; Job 3:6; 7:3; 29:2; 39:2).</p>
<A NAME="321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=156><b>tn</b> The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>, &#8220;behold&#8221;) in this sentence focuses the reader&#8217;s attention on the statement to follow.</p>
<A NAME="322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=157><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">galmud</font>) probably has here the idea of &#8220;barren&#8221; rather than &#8220;solitary.&#8221; See the parallelism in Isa 49:21. In Job it seems to carry the idea of &#8220;barren&#8221; in 15:34, and &#8220;gloomy&#8221; in 30:3. Barrenness can lead to gloom.</p>
<A NAME="323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=158><b>tn</b> The word is from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ranan</font>, &#8220;to give a ringing cry&#8221; or &#8220;shout of joy&#8221;). The sound is loud and shrill.</p>
<A NAME="324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=159><b>tn</b> The verb is simply <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bo</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to enter&#8221;). The NIV translates interpretively &#8220;be heard in it.&#8221; A shout of joy, such as at a birth, that &#8220;enters&#8221; a day is certainly heard on that day.</p>
<A NAME="325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=160><b>tn</b> Not everyone is satisfied with the reading of the MT. Gordis thought &#8220;day&#8221; should be &#8220;sea,&#8221; and &#8220;cursers&#8221; should be &#8220;rousers&#8221; (changing &#8217;<font face="Scholar">alef</font> to &#8217;<font face="Scholar">ayin</font>; cf. NRSV). This is an unnecessary change, for there is no textual problem in the line (D. J. A. Clines, <i>Job </i>[WBC], 71). Others have taken the reading &#8220;sea&#8221; as a personification and accepted the rest of the text, gaining the sense of &#8220;those whose magic binds even the sea monster of the deep&#8221; (e.g., NEB).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Those who curse the day</i> are probably the professional enchanters and magicians who were thought to cast spells on days and overwhelm them with darkness and misfortune. The myths explained eclipses as the dragon throwing its folds around the sun and the moon, thus engulfing or swallowing the day and the night. This interpretation matches the parallelism better than the interpretation that says these are merely professional mourners.</p>
<A NAME="326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=161><b>tn</b> The verb is probably &#8220;execrate, curse,&#8221; from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qavav</font>). But E. Ullendorff took it from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">naqav</font>, &#8220;pierce&#8221;) and gained a reading &#8220;Let the light rays of day pierce it (i.e. the night) apt even to rouse Leviathan&#8221; (&#8220;Job 3:8,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 11 [1961]: 350-51).</p>
<A NAME="327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=162><b>tn</b> The verbal adjective <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">atid</font>) means &#8220;ready, prepared.&#8221; Here it has a substantival use similar to that of participles. It is followed by the Polel infinitive construct <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1465;&#1512;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">orer</font>). The infinitive without the preposition serves as the object of the preceding verbal adjective (GKC 350 §114.<i>m</i>).</p>
<A NAME="328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=163><b>sn</b> Job employs here the mythological figure Leviathan, the monster of the deep or chaos. Job wishes that such a creation of chaos could be summoned by the mourners to swallow up that day. See E. Ullendorff, &#8220;Job 3:8,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 11 (1961): 350-51.</p>
<A NAME="329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=164><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the stars of its dawn.&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">neshef</font>) can mean &#8220;twilight&#8221; or &#8220;dawn.&#8221; In this context the morning stars are in mind. Job wishes that the morning stars &#8211; that should announce the day &#8211; go out.</p>
<A NAME="330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=165><b>tn</b> The verb &#8220;wait, hope&#8221; has the idea of eager expectation and preparation. It is used elsewhere of waiting on the <sc>Lord with anticipation.</p>
<A NAME="331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=166><b>tn</b> The absolute state <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ayin</font>, &#8220;there is none&#8221;) is here used as a verbal predicate (see GKC 480 §152.<i>k</i>). The concise expression literally says &#8220;and none.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=167><b>sn</b> The expression is literally &#8220;the eyelids of the morning.&#8221; This means the very first rays of dawn (see also Job 41:18). There is some debate whether it refers to &#8220;eyelids&#8221; or &#8220;eyelashes&#8221; or &#8220;eyeballs.&#8221; If the latter, it would signify the flashing eyes of a person. See for the Ugaritic background H. L. Ginsberg, <i>The Legend of King Keret </i>(BASORSup), 39; see also J. M. Steadman, &#8220;&#8216;Eyelids of Morn&#8217;: A Biblical Convention,&#8221; <i>HTR</i> 56 (1963): 159-67.</p>
<A NAME="333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=168><b>tn</b> The subject is still &#8220;that night.&#8221; Here, at the end of this first section, Job finally expresses the crime of that night &#8211; it did not hinder his birth.</p>
<A NAME="334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=169><b>sn</b> This use of doors for the womb forms an implied comparison; the night should have hindered conception (see Gen 20:18 and 1 Sam 1:5).</p>
<A NAME="335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=170><b>tn</b> The Hebrew has simply &#8220;my belly [= womb].&#8221; The suffix on the noun must be objective &#8211; it was the womb of Job&#8217;s mother in which he lay before his birth. See however N. C. Habel, &#8220;The Dative Suffix in Job 33:13,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 63 (1982): 258-59, who thinks it is deliberately ambiguous.</p>
<A NAME="336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=171><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amal</font>) means &#8220;work, heavy labor, agonizing labor, struggle&#8221; with the idea of fatigue and pain.</p>
<A NAME="337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=172><b>sn</b> Job follows his initial cry with a series of rhetorical questions. His argument runs along these lines: since he was born (v. 10), the next chance he had of escaping this life of misery would have been to be still born (vv. 11-12, 16). In vv. 13-19 Job considers death as falling into a peaceful sleep in a place where there is no trouble. The high frequency of rhetorical questions in series is a characteristic of the Book of Job that sets it off from all other portions of the OT. The effect is primarily dramatic, creating a tension that requires resolution. See W. Watson, <i>Classical Hebrew Poetry</i>, 340-41.</p>
<A NAME="338"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=173><b>tn</b> The negative only occurs with the first clause, but it extends its influence to the parallel second clause (GKC 483 §152.<i>z</i>).</p>
<A NAME="339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=174><b>tn</b> The two verbs in this verse are both prefix conjugations; they are clearly referring to the past and should be classified as preterites. E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 32) notes that the verb &#8220;I came out&#8221; is in the perfect to mark its priority in time in relation to the other verbs.</p>
<A NAME="340"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=175><b>tn</b> The translation &#8220;at birth&#8221; is very smooth, but catches the meaning and avoids the tautology in the verse. The line literally reads &#8220;from the womb.&#8221; The second half of the verse has the verb &#8220;I came out/forth&#8221; which does double duty for both parallel lines.

<A NAME="394"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">94</span><note=229><b>tn</b> The construction uses the cognate accusative with the verb: &#8220;the fear I feared,&#8221; or &#8220;the dread thing I dreaded&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1491; &#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">pakhad pakhadti</font>). The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pakhad</font>) has the sense of &#8220;dread&#8221; and the noun the meaning &#8220;thing dreaded.&#8221; The structure of the sentence with the perfect verb followed by the preterite indicates that the first action preceded the second &#8211; he feared something but then it happened. Some commentaries suggest reading this as a conditional clause followed by the present tense translation: &#8220;If I fear a thing it happens to me&#8221; (see A. B. Davidson, <i>Job</i>, 24). The reason for this change is that it is hard for some to think that in his prime Job had such fears. He did have a pure trust and confidence in the <sc>Lord (16:19, 29:18ff). But on the other hand, he did make sacrifices for his sons because he thought they might sin. There is evidence to suggest that he was aware that calamity could strike, and this is not necessarily incompatible with trust.</p>
<A NAME="395"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">95</span><note=230><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">atah</font>) is Aramaic and is equivalent to the Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bo</font>&#8217;, &#8220;come, happen&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="396"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">96</span><note=231><b>tn</b> The final verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yavo</font>&#8217;, &#8220;has come&#8221;). It appears to be an imperfect, but since it is parallel to the preterite of the first colon it should be given that nuance here. Of course, if the other view of the verse is taken, then this would simply be translated as &#8220;comes,&#8221; and the preceding preterite also given an English present tense translation.</p>
<A NAME="397"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">97</span><note=232><b>tn</b> The LXX &#8220;peace&#8221; bases its rendering on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shalam</font>) and not <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shalah</font>), which retains the original <font face="Scholar">vav </font>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>). The verb means &#8220;to be quiet, to be at ease.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="398"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">98</span><note=233><b>tn</b> The verb is literally &#8220;and I do/can not rest.&#8221; A potential perfect nuance fits this passage well. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nuakh</font>, &#8220;rest&#8221;) implies &#8220;rest&#8221; in every sense, especially in contrast to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1465;&#1490;&#1462;&#1494;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rogez</font>, &#8220;turmoil, agitation&#8221; [vv. 26 and 17]).</p>
<A NAME="399"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">99</span><note=234><b>tn</b> The last clause simply has &#8220;and trouble came.&#8221; Job is essentially saying that since the trouble has come upon him there is not a moment of rest and relief.</p>
