<A NAME="331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2000><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;give ear,&#8221; the Hiphil denominative verb from &#8220;ear.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2001><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;hear all my words.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2002><b>tn</b> The perfect verbs in this verse should be classified as perfects of resolve: &#8220;I have decided to open&#8230;speak.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2003><b>sn</b> H. H. Rowley (<i>Job</i> [NCBC], 210) says, &#8220;The self-importance of Elihu is boundless, and he is the master of banality.&#8221; He adds that whoever wrote these speeches this way clearly intended to expose the character rather than exalt him.</p>
<A NAME="335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2004><b>tc</b> This expression is unusual; R. Gordis (<i>Job</i>, 371) says it can be translated, &#8220;the purity of my heart [is reflected] in my words,&#8221; but that is far-fetched and awkward. So there have been suggestions for emending <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yosher</font>, &#8220;uprightness&#8221;). Kissane&#8217;s makes the most sense if a change is desired: &#8220;shall reveal&#8221; (an Arabic sense of <font face="Scholar">yasher</font>), although Holscher interpreted &#8220;shall affirm&#8221; (<font face="Scholar">yasher</font>,<font face="Scholar"> </font>with a Syriac sense). Dhorme has &#8220;my heart will repeat&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yashur</font>), but this is doubtful. If Kissane&#8217;s view is taken, it would say, &#8220;my heart will reveal my words.&#8221; Some commentators would join &#8220;and knowledge&#8221; to this colon, and read &#8220;words of knowledge&#8221; &#8211; but that requires even more emendations.</p>
<A NAME="336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2005><b>tn</b> More literally, &#8220;and the knowledge of my lips they will speak purely.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2006><b>tc</b> Some commentators want to put this verse after v. 6, while others omit the verse entirely. Elihu is claiming here that he is inspired by God.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tÿkhayyeni</font>) is the Piel imperfect of the verb &#8220;to live.&#8221; It can mean &#8220;gives me life,&#8221; but it can also me &#8220;quickens me, enlivens me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="338"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2007><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text does not contain the term &#8220;arguments,&#8221; but this verb has been used already for preparing or arranging a defense.</p>
<A NAME="339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2008><b>tn</b> The verb means &#8220;nipped off,&#8221; as a potter breaks off a piece of clay when molding a vessel.</p>
<A NAME="3310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2009><b>tc</b> The noun means &#8220;my pressure; my burden&#8221; in the light of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1499;&#1458;&#1507;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akhaf</font>, &#8220;to press on; to grip tightly&#8221;). In the parallel passages the text used &#8220;hand&#8221; and &#8220;rod&#8221; in the hand to terrify. The LXX has &#8220;hand&#8221; here for this word. But simply changing it to &#8220;hand&#8221; is ruled out because the verb is masculine.</p>
<A NAME="3311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2010><b>tn</b> See Job 9:34 and 13:21.</p>
<A NAME="3312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2011><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in my ears.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2012><b>sn</b> See Job 9:21; 10:7; 23:7; 27:4; ch. 31.</p>
<A NAME="3314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2013><b>tn</b> The word is a <i>hapax legomenon</i>; <i>hap</i> is from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khafaf</font>). It is used in New Hebrew in expressions like &#8220;to wash&#8221; the head. Cognates in Syriac and Akkadian support the meaning &#8220;to wash; to clean.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2014><b>sn</b> See Job 10:13ff.; 19:6ff.; and 13:24.</p>
<A NAME="3316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2015><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (God) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2016><b>tn</b> The Hebrew means &#8220;frustrations&#8221; or &#8220;oppositions.&#8221; The RSV has &#8220;displeasure,&#8221; NIV &#8220;faults,&#8221; and NRSV &#8220;occasions.&#8221; Rashi chose the word found in Judg 14:4 &#8211; with metathesis &#8211; meaning &#8220;pretexts&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">to</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anot</font>); this is followed by NAB, NASB.</p>
<A NAME="3318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2017><b>sn</b> See Job 13:27.</p>
<A NAME="3319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2018><b>tn</b> The meaning of this verb is &#8220;this is my answer to you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2019><b>tc</b> The LXX has &#8220;he that is above men is eternal.&#8221; Elihu is saying that God is far above Job&#8217;s petty problems.</p>
<A NAME="3321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2020><b>tc</b> The MT has &#8220;all his words.&#8221; This must refer to &#8220;man&#8221; in the previous verse. But many wish to change it to &#8220;my words,&#8221; since it would be summarizing Job&#8217;s complaint to God.</p>
<A NAME="3322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2021><b>tn</b> The Syriac and the Vulgate have &#8220;and he does not repeat it,&#8221; a reading of the text as it is, according to E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 403). But his argument is based on another root with this meaning &#8211; a root which does not exist (see L. Dennefeld, <i>RB</i> 48 [1939]: 175). The verse is saying that God does speak to man.</p>
<A NAME="3323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2022><b>tn</b> The idiom is &#8220;he uncovers the ear of men.&#8221; This expression means &#8220;inform&#8221; in Ruth 4:4; 1 Sam 20:2, etc. But when God is the subject it means &#8220;make a revelation&#8221; (see 1 Sam 9:15; 2 Sam 7:27).</p>
<A NAME="3324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2023><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and seals their bonds.&#8221; The form of the present translation, &#8220;and terrifies them with warnings,&#8221; is derived only by emending the text. Aquila, the Vulgate, Syriac, and Targum Job have &#8220;their correction&#8221; for &#8220;their bond,&#8221; which is what the KJV used. But the LXX, Aquila, and the Syriac have &#8220;terrifies&#8221; for the verb. This involves a change in pointing from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1495;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yakhtom</font>) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿkhittem</font>). The LXX has &#8220;appearances of fear&#8221; instead of &#8220;bonds.&#8221; The point of the verse seems to be that by terrifying dreams God makes people aware of their ways.</p>
<A NAME="3325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2024><b>tc</b> The MT simply has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ma</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aseh</font>, &#8220;deed&#8221;). The LXX has &#8220;from his iniquity&#8221; which would have been <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1506;&#1463;&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">me</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avlah</font>). The two letters may have dropped out by haplography. The MT is workable, but would have to mean &#8220;[evil] deeds.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2025><b>tc</b> Here too the sense of the MT is difficult to recover. Some translations took it to mean that God hides pride from man. Many commentators changed <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1499;&#1463;&#1505;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿkhasseh</font>, &#8220;covers&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1499;&#1463;&#1505;&#1468;&#1461;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿkhasseakh</font>, &#8220;he cuts away&#8221;), or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1499;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿkhalleh</font>, &#8220;he puts an end to&#8221;). The various emendations are not all that convincing.</p>
<A NAME="3327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2026><b>tn</b> A number of interpreters and translations take this as &#8220;the pit&#8221; (see Job 17:14; cf. NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="3328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2027><b>tc</b> Here is another difficult line. The verb normally means &#8220;to pass through; to pass over,&#8221; and so this word would normally mean &#8220;from passing through [or over].&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shelakh</font>) does at times refer to a weapon, but most commentators look for a parallel with &#8220;the pit [or corruption].&#8221; One suggestion is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">olah</font>, &#8220;to Sheol&#8221;), proposed by Duhm. Dhorme thought it was <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shalakh</font>) and referred to the passageway to the underworld (see M. Tsevat, <i>VT</i> 4 [1954]: 43; and Svi Rin, <i>BZ</i> 7 [1963]: 25). See discussion of options in <i>HALOT</i> 1517-18 s.v. IV <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;</font>. The idea of crossing the river of death fits the idea of the passage well, although the reading &#8220;to perish by the sword&#8221; makes sense and was followed by the NIV.</p>
<A NAME="3329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2028><b>tc</b> The MT has the passive form, and so a subject has to be added: &#8220;[a man] is chastened.&#8221; The LXX has the active form, indicating &#8220;[God] chastens,&#8221; but the object &#8220;a man&#8221; has to be added. It is understandable why the LXX thought this was active, within this sequence of verbs; and that is why it is the inferior reading.</p>
<A NAME="3330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2029><b>tc</b> The <i>Kethib</i> &#8220;the strife of his bones is continual,&#8221; whereas the <i>Qere</i> has &#8220;the multitude of his bones are firm.&#8221; The former is the better reading in this passage. It indicates that the pain is caused by the ongoing strife.</p>
<A NAME="3331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2030><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;food of desire.&#8221; The word &#8220;rejects&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but is supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2031><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;are laid bare.&#8221; This is the <i>Qere</i> reading; the <i>Kethib</i> means &#8220;bare height.&#8221; Gordis reverses the word order: &#8220;his bones are bare [i.e., crushed] so that they cannot be looked upon.&#8221; But the sense of that is not clear.</p>
<A NAME="3333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2032><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his soul [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>, &#8220;life&#8221;] draws near.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2033><b>tn</b> The MT uses the Hiphil participle, &#8220;to those who cause death.&#8221; This seems to be a reference to the belief in demons that brought about death, an idea not mentioned in the Bible itself. Thus many proposals have been made for this expression. Hoffmann and Budde divide the word into <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465; &#1502;&#1461;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿmo metim</font>) and simply read &#8220;to the dead.&#8221; Dhorme adds a couple of letters to get <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1511;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501; &#1502;&#1461;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">limqom metim</font>, &#8220;to the place [or abode] of the dead&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="3335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2034><b>sn</b> The verse is describing the way God can preserve someone from dying by sending a messenger (translated here as &#8220;angel&#8221;), who could be human or angelic. This messenger will interpret/mediate God&#8217;s will. By &#8220;one &#8230; out of a thousand&#8221; Elihu could have meant either that one of the thousands of messengers at God&#8217;s disposal might be sent or that the messenger would be unique (see Eccl 7:28; and cp. Job 9:3).</p>
<A NAME="3336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2035><b>tn</b> This is a smoother reading. The MT has &#8220;to tell to a man his uprightness,&#8221; to reveal what is right for him. The LXX translated this word &#8220;duty&#8221;; the choice is adopted by some commentaries. However, that is too far from the text, which indicates that the angel/messenger is to call the person to uprightness.</p>
<A NAME="3337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2036><b>tn</b> This verse seems to continue the protasis begun in the last verse, with the apodosis coming in the next verse.</p>
<A NAME="3338"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2037><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (God) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2038><b>tc</b> The verb is either taken as an anomalous form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pada</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to rescue; to redeem,&#8221; or &#8220;to exempt him&#8221;), or it is emended to some similar word, like <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">para</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to let loose,&#8221; so Wright).</p>
<A NAME="3340"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=2039><b>sn</b> This verse and v. 28 should be compared with Ps 49:7-9, 15 (8-10, 16 HT) where the same basic vocabulary and concepts are employed.</p>
<A NAME="3341"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=2040><b>tc</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1467;&#1496;&#1458;&#1508;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rutafash</font>) is found nowhere else. One suggestion is that it should be <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1496;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yirtav</font>, &#8220;to become fresh&#8221;), connected to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1496;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ratav</font>, &#8220;to be well watered [or moist]&#8221;). It is also possible that it was a combination of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1496;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ratav</font>, &#8220;to be well watered&#8221;) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tafash</font>, &#8220;to grow fat&#8221;). But these are all guesses in the commentaries.</p>
<A NAME="3342"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=2041><b>tn</b> The word describes the period when the man is healthy and vigorous, ripe for what life brings his way.</p>
<A NAME="3343"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2042><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (God) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>

<A NAME="3345"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=2044><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (God) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3346"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=2045><b>tc</b> Many commentators think this line is superfluous and so delete it. The RSV changed the verb to &#8220;he recounts,&#8221; making the idea that the man publishes the news of his victory or salvation (taking &#8220;righteousness&#8221; as a metonymy of cause).</p>
<A NAME="3347"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=2046><b>tc</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yashor</font>) is unusual. The typical view is to change it to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yashir</font>, &#8220;he sings&#8221;), but that may seem out of harmony with a confession. Dhorme suggests a root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shur</font>, &#8220;to repeat&#8221;), but this is a doubtful root. J. Reider reads it <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1497;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yasher</font>) and links it to an Arabic word &#8220;confesses&#8221; (<i>ZAW</i> 24 [1953]: 275).</p>

<A NAME="3349"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=2048><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shavah</font>) has the impersonal meaning here, &#8220;it has not been requited to me.&#8221; The meaning is that the sinner has not been treated in accordance with his deeds: &#8220;I was not punished according to what I deserved.&#8221;</p>
