<A NAME="2615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1663><b>sn</b> The Hebrew word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1508;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsafon</font>). Some see here a reference to Mount Zaphon of the Ugaritic texts, the mountain that Baal made his home. The Hebrew writers often equate and contrast Mount Zion with this proud mountain of the north. Of course, the word just means north, and so in addition to any connotations for pagan mythology, it may just represent the northern skies &#8211; the stars. Since the parallel line speaks of the earth, that is probably all that was intended in this particular context.</p>
