<A NAME="2623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1671><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">raga</font>&#8217;) has developed a Semitic polarity, i.e., having totally opposite meanings. It can mean &#8220;to disturb; to stir up&#8221; or &#8220;to calm; to still.&#8221; Gordis thinks both meanings have been invoked here. But it seems more likely that &#8220;calm&#8221; fits the context better.</p>
