<A NAME="261"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1649><b>sn</b> These two chapters will be taken together under this title, although most commentators would assign Job 26:5-14 to Bildad and Job 27:7-23 to Zophar. Those sections will be noted as they emerge. For the sake of outlining, the following sections will be marked off: Job&#8217;s scorn for Bildad (26:2-4); a better picture of God&#8217;s greatness (26:5-14); Job&#8217;s protestation of innocence (27:2-6); and a picture of the condition of the wicked (27:7-23).</p>
