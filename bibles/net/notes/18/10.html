<A NAME="101"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=758><b>tn</b> The Hebrew has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nafshi</font>), usually rendered &#8220;my soul.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="102"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=759><b>tn</b> The verb is pointed like a Qal form but is originally a Niphal from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qut</font>). Some wish to connect the word to Akkadian cognates for a meaning &#8220;I am in anguish&#8221;; but the meaning &#8220;I am weary&#8221; fits the passage well.</p>
<A NAME="103"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=760><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">azav</font>) means &#8220;to abandon.&#8221; It may have an extended meaning of &#8220;to let go&#8221; or &#8220;to let slip.&#8221; But the expression &#8220;abandon to myself&#8221; means to abandon all restraint and give free course to the complaint.</p>
<A NAME="104"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=761><b>tn</b> The negated jussive is the Hiphil jussive of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rasha</font>&#8217;); its meaning then would be literally &#8220;do not declare me guilty.&#8221; The negated jussive stresses the immediacy of the request.</p>
<A NAME="105"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=762><b>tn</b> The Hiphil imperative of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yada</font>&#8217;) would more literally be &#8220;cause me to know.&#8221; It is a plea for God to help him understand the afflictions.</p>
<A NAME="106"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=763><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">riv</font>), meaning &#8220;to dispute; to contend; to strive; to quarrel&#8221; &#8211; often in the legal sense. The precise words chosen in this verse show that the setting is legal. The imperfect verb here is progressive, expressing what is currently going on.</p>
<A NAME="107"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=764><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Does it give you pleasure?&#8221; The expression could also mean, &#8220;Is it profitable for you?&#8221; or &#8220;Is it fitting for you?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="108"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=765><b>tn</b> The construction uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) with the imperfect verb &#8211; &#8220;that you oppress.&#8221; Technically, this clause serves as the subject, and &#8220;good&#8221; is the predicate adjective. In such cases one often uses an English infinitive to capture the point: &#8220;Is it good for you to oppress?&#8221; The LXX changes the meaning considerably: &#8220;Is it good for you if I am unrighteous, for you have disowned the work of your hands.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="109"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=766><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;that you despise.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=767><b>tn</b> Now, in the second half of the verse, there is a change in the structure. The conjunction on the preposition followed by the perfect verb represents a circumstantial clause.</p>
<A NAME="1011"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=768><b>tn</b> The Hiphil of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yafa</font>&#8217;) means &#8220;shine.&#8221; In this context the expression &#8220;you shine upon&#8221; would mean &#8220;have a glowing expression,&#8221; be radiant, or smile.</p>
<A NAME="1012"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=769><b>tn</b> Here &#8220;flesh&#8221; is the sign of humanity. The expression &#8220;eyes of flesh&#8221; means essentially &#8220;human eyes,&#8221; i.e., the outlook and vision of humans.</p>
<A NAME="1013"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=770><b>sn</b> The verb translated &#8220;see&#8221; could also include the figurative category of perceive as well. The answer to Job&#8217;s question is found in 1 Sam 16:7: &#8220;The <sc>Lord sees not as a man sees; man looks on the outward appearance, but the <sc>Lord looks on the heart.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1014"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=771><b>sn</b> In this verse Job asks whether or not God is liable to making mistakes or errors of judgment. He wonders if God has no more insight than his friends have. Of course, the questions are rhetorical, for he knows otherwise. But his point is that God seems to be making a big mistake here.</p>
<A NAME="1015"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=772><b>tn</b> The Hebrew has repeated here &#8220;like the days of,&#8221; but some scholars think that this was an accidental replacement of what should be here, namely, &#8220;like the years of.&#8221; D. J. A. Clines notes that such repetition is not uncommon in Job, but suggests that the change should be made for English style even if the text is not emended (<i>Job </i>[WBC], 221). This has been followed in the present translation.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The question Job asks concerns the mode of life and not just the length of it (see Job 7:1). Humans spend their days and years watching each other and defending themselves. But there is also the implication that if God is so limited like humans he may not uncover Job&#8217;s sins before he dies.</p>
<A NAME="1016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=773><b>tn</b> The clause seems to go naturally with v. 4: do you have eyes of flesh&#8230;that you have to investigate? For that reason some like Duhm would delete v. 5. But v. 5 adds to the premise: are you also like a human running out of time that you must try to find out my sin?</p>
<A NAME="1017"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=774><b>tn</b> The imperfect verbs in this verse are best given modal nuances. Does God have such limitations that he must make such an investigation? H. H. Rowley observes that Job implies that God has not yet found the iniquity, or extracted a confession from him (<i>Job</i> [NCBC], 84).</p>
<A NAME="1018"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=775><b><i>tn</i></b> <i>Heb</i> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al da</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">tÿkha</font>, &#8220;upon your knowledge&#8221;). The use of the preposition means basically &#8220;in addition to your knowledge,&#8221; or &#8220;in spite of your knowledge,&#8221; i.e., &#8220;notwithstanding&#8221; or &#8220;although&#8221; (see GKC 383 §119.<i>aa</i>, n. 2).</p>
<A NAME="1019"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=776><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and there is no deliverer.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The fact is that humans are the work of God&#8217;s hands. They are helpless in the hand of God. But it is also unworthy of God to afflict his people.</p>
<A NAME="1020"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=777><b>tn</b> The root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">atsav</font>) is linked by some to an Arabic word meaning &#8220;to cut out, hew.&#8221; The derived word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1510;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">atsabbim</font>) means &#8220;idols.&#8221; Whatever the precise meaning, the idea is that God formed or gave shape to mankind in creation.</p>
<A NAME="1021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=778><b>tn</b> The verb in this part is a preterite with the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font></i>) consecutive. However, here it has merely an external connection with the preceding perfects, so that in reality it presents an antithesis (see GKC 327 §111.<i>e</i>).</p>
<A NAME="1022"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=779><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;together round about and you destroy me.&#8221; The second half of this verse is very difficult. Most commentators follow the LXX and connect the first two words with the second colon as the MT accents indicate (NJPS, &#8220;then destroyed every part of me&#8221;), rather than with the first colon (&#8220;and made me complete,&#8221; J. E. Hartley, <i>Job</i> [NICOT], 185). Instead of &#8220;together&#8221; some read &#8220;after.&#8221; Others see in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">saviv</font>) not so much an adjectival use but a verbal or adverbial use: &#8220;you turn and destroy&#8221; or &#8220;you destroy utterly (all around).&#8221; This makes more sense than &#8220;turn.&#8221; In addition, the verb form in the line is the preterite with <i>vav</i> consecutive; this may be another example of the transposition of the copula (see 4:6). For yet another option (&#8220;You have engulfed me about altogether&#8221;), see R. Fuller, &#8220;Exodus 21:22: The Miscarriage Interpretation and the Personhood of the Fetus,&#8221; <i>JETS</i> 37 (1994): 178. </p>
<A NAME="1023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=780><b>tn</b> The preposition &#8220;like&#8221; creates a small tension here. So some ignore the preposition and read &#8220;clay&#8221; as an adverbial accusative of the material (GKC 371 §117.<i>hh</i> but cf. 379 §119.<i>i</i> with reference to <i>beth essentiae</i>: &#8220;as it were, by clay&#8221;). The NIV gets around the problem with a different meaning for the verb: &#8220;you molded me like clay.&#8221; Some suggest the meaning was &#8220;as [with] clay&#8221; (in the same manner that we have &#8220;as [in] the day of Midian&#8221; [Isa 9:4]).</p>
<A NAME="1024"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=781><b>tn</b> The text has a conjunction: &#8220;and to dust&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1025"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=782><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">natakh</font>) means &#8220;to flow,&#8221; and in the Hiphil, &#8220;to cause to flow.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1026"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=783><b>tn</b> This verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1508;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qafa</font>&#8217;) means &#8220;to coagulate.&#8221; In the Hiphil it means &#8220;to stiffen; to congeal.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1027"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=784><b>tn</b> The verbs in v. 10 are prefixed conjugations; since the reference is to the womb, these would need to be classified as preterites. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> These verses figuratively describe the formation of the embryo in the womb.</p>
<A NAME="1028"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=785><b>tn</b> The skin and flesh form the exterior of the body and so the image of &#8220;clothing&#8221; is appropriate. Once again the verb is the prefixed conjugation, expressing what God did.</p>
<A NAME="1029"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=786><b>tn</b> This verb is found only here (related nouns are common) and in the parallel passage of Ps 139:13. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sakhakh</font>), here a Poel prefixed conjugation (preterite), means &#8220;to knit together.&#8221; The implied comparison is that the bones and sinews form the tapestry of the person (compare other images of weaving the life).</p>
<A NAME="1030"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=787><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;you made with me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1031"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=788><b>tn</b> E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 150) suggests that the relation between these two words is like a hendiadys. In other words, &#8220;life,&#8221; which he says is made prominent by the shift of the copula, specifies the nature of the grace. He renders it &#8220;the favor of life.&#8221; D. J. A. Clines at least acknowledges that the expression &#8220;you showed loyal love with me&#8221; is primary. There are many other attempts to improve the translation of this unusual combination.</p>
<A NAME="1032"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=789><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1511;&#1467;&#1464;&#1464;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pÿquddah</font>), originally translated &#8220;visitation,&#8221; actually refers to any divine intervention for blessing on the life. Here it would include the care and overseeing of the life of Job. &#8220;Providence&#8221; may be too general for the translation, but it is not far from the meaning of this line. The LXX has &#8220;your oversight.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1033"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=790><b>sn</b> &#8220;These things&#8221; refers to the affliction that God had brought on Job. They were concealed by God from the beginning.</p>
<A NAME="1034"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=791><b>sn</b> The meaning of the line is that this was God&#8217;s purpose all along. &#8220;These things&#8221; and &#8220;this&#8221; refer to the details that will now be given in the next few verses.</p>
<A NAME="1035"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=792><b>sn</b> The contradiction between how God had provided for and cared for Job&#8217;s life and how he was now dealing with him could only be resolved by Job with the supposition that God had planned this severe treatment from the first as part of his plan.</p>
<A NAME="1036"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=793><b>sn</b> The verbs &#8220;guilty&#8221; and &#8220;innocent&#8221; are actually the verbs &#8220;I am wicked,&#8221; and &#8220;I am righteous.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1037"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=794><b>tn</b> The exclamation occurs only here and in Mic 7:1.</p>
<A NAME="1038"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=795><b>sn</b> The action of lifting up the head is a symbol of pride and honor and self-respect (Judg 8:28) &#8211; like &#8220;hold your head high.&#8221; In 11:15 the one who is at peace with God lifts his head (face).</p>
<A NAME="1039"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=796><b>tn</b> The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1506; &#1511;&#1464;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sÿva</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> qalon</font>) may be translated &#8220;full of shame.&#8221; The expression literally means &#8220;sated of ignominy&#8221; (or contempt [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1463;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">qalal</font>]).</p>
<A NAME="1040"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=797><b>tn</b> The last clause is difficult to fit into the verse. It translates easily enough: &#8220;and see my affliction.&#8221; Many commentators follow the suggestion of Geiger to read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1456;&#1493;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rÿveh</font>, &#8220;watered with&#8221;) instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eh</font>, &#8220;see&#8221;). This could then be interpreted adjectivally and parallel to the preceding line: &#8220;steeped/saturated with affliction.&#8221; This would also delete the final <i>yod</i> as dittography (E. Dhorme, <i>Job</i>, 152). But D. J. A. Clines notes more recent interpretations that suggest the form in the text is an orthographic variant of <i>raweh</i> meaning &#8220;satiated.&#8221; This makes any emendation unnecessary (and in fact that idea of &#8220;steeped&#8221; was not helpful any way because it indicated imbibing rather than soaking). The NIV renders it &#8220;and drowned in my affliction&#8221; although footnoting the other possibility from the MT, &#8220;aware of my affliction&#8221; (assuming the form could be adjectival). The LXX omits the last line.</p>
<A NAME="1041"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=798><b>tn</b> The MT has the 3rd person of the verb, &#8220;and he lifts himself up.&#8221; One might assume that the subject is &#8220;my head&#8221; &#8211; but that is rather far removed from the verb. It appears that Job is talking about himself in some way. Some commentators simply emend the text to make it first person. This has the support of Targum Job, which would be expected since it would be interpreting the passage in its context (see D. M. Stec, &#8220;The Targum Rendering of WYG&#8217;H in Job X 16,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 34 [1984]: 367-8). Pope and Gordis make the word adjectival, modifying the subject: &#8220;proudly you hunt me,&#8221; but support is lacking. E. Dhorme thinks the line should be parallel to the two preceding it, and so suggests <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1490;&#1468;&#1461;&#1506;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yagea</font>&#8217;,<i> </i>&#8220;exhausted&#8221;) for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yig</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eh</font>, &#8220;lift up&#8221;). The contextual argument is that Job has said that he cannot raise his head, but if he were to do so, God would hunt him down. God could be taken as the subject of the verb if the text is using enallage (shifting of grammatical persons within a discourse) for dramatic effect. Perhaps the initial 3rd person was intended with respect within a legal context of witnesses and a complaint, but was switched to 2nd person for direct accusation.</p>
<A NAME="1042"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=799><b>sn</b> There is some ambiguity here: Job could be the lion being hunted by God, or God could be hunting Job like a lion hunts its prey. The point of the line is clear in either case.</p>
<A NAME="1043"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=800><b>tn</b> The text uses two verbs without a coordinating conjunction: &#8220;then you return, you display your power.&#8221; This should be explained as a verbal hendiadys, the first verb serving adverbially in the clause (see further GKC 386-87 §120.<i>g</i>).</p>
<A NAME="1044"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=801><b>tn</b> The form is the Hitpael of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pala</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to be wonderful; to be surpassing; to be extraordinary&#8221;). Here in this stem it has the sense of &#8220;make oneself admirable, surpassing&#8221; or &#8220;render oneself powerful, glorious.&#8221; The text is ironic; the word that described God&#8217;s marvelous creation of Job is here used to describe God&#8217;s awesome destruction of Job.</p>
<A NAME="1045"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=802><b>tn</b> The text has &#8220;you renew/increase your witnesses.&#8221; This would probably mean Job&#8217;s sufferings, which were witness to his sins. But some suggested a different word here, one that is cognate to Arabic &#8217;<font face="Scholar">adiya</font><i>,</i> &#8220;to be an enemy; to be hostile&#8221;: thus &#8220;you renew your hostility against me.&#8221; Less convincing are suggestions that the word is cognate to Ugaritic &#8220;troops&#8221; (see W. G. E. Watson, &#8220;The Metaphor in Job 10,17,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 63 [1982]: 255-57).</p>
<A NAME="1046"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=803><b>tn</b> The Hebrew simply says &#8220;changes and a host are with me.&#8221; The &#8220;changes and a host&#8221; is taken as a hendiadys, meaning relieving troops (relief troops of the army). The two words appear together again in 14:14, showing that emendation is to be avoided. The imagery depicts blow after blow from God &#8211; always fresh attacks.</p>
<A NAME="1047"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=804><b>tn</b> The two imperfect verbs in this section are used to stress regrets for something which did not happen (see GKC 317 §107.<i>n</i>).</p>
<A NAME="1048"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=805><b>sn</b> This means &#8220;If only I had never come into existence.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1049"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=806><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;are not my days few; cease/let it cease&#8230;.&#8221; The versions have &#8220;the days of my life&#8221; (reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1502;&#1461;&#1497; &#1495;&#1462;&#1500;&#1456;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;</font> [<font face="Scholar">yÿme kheldi</font>] instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1497; &#1493;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1491;&#1464;&#1500;</font> [<font face="Scholar">yamay vakhadal</font>]). Many commentators and the RSV, NAB, and NRSV accept this reading. The <i>Kethib</i> is an imperfect or jussive, &#8220;let it cease/ it will cease.&#8221; The <i>Qere</i> is more intelligible for some interpreters &#8211; &#8220;cease&#8221; (as in 7:16). For a discussion of the readings, see D. W. Thomas, &#8220;Some Observations on the Hebrew Root <i>hadal,</i>&#8221;<i> </i>VTSup 4 [1057]: 14). But the text is not impossible as it stands.</p>
<A NAME="1050"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=807><b>tn</b> Taking the form as the imperative with the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vav</font>), the sentence follows the direct address to God (as in v. 18 as well as 7:16). This requires less changes. See the preceding note regarding the plausibility of the jussive. The point of the verse is clear in either reading &#8211; his life is short, and he wants the suffering to stop.</p>
<A NAME="1051"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=808><b>tn</b> In the different suggestions for the line, the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yod</font>) of this word is believed to belong to the preceding word making &#8220;my life.&#8221; That would here leave an imperative rather than an imperfect. But if the <i>Qere</i> is read, then it would be an imperative anyway, and there would be no reason for the change.</p>
<A NAME="1052"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=809><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;put from me,&#8221; an expression found nowhere else. The <i>Qere</i> has a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vav</font>) and not a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yod</font>), forming an imperative rather than an imperfect. H. H. Rowley suggests that there is an ellipsis here, &#8220;hand&#8221; needing to be supplied. Job wanted God to take his hand away from him. That is plausible, but difficult.</p>
<A NAME="1053"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=810><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1490;</font> (<font face="Scholar">balag</font>) in the Hiphil means &#8220;to have cheer [or joy]&#8221; (see 7:27; Ps 39:14). The cohortative following the imperatives shows the purpose or result &#8211; &#8220;in order that.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1054"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=811><b>sn</b> The verbs are simple, &#8220;I go&#8221; and &#8220;I return&#8221;; but Job clearly means before he dies. A translation of &#8220;depart&#8221; comes closer to communicating this. The second verb may be given a potential imperfect translation to capture the point. The NIV offered more of an interpretive paraphrase: &#8220;before I go to the place of no return.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1055"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=812><b>tn</b> See Job 3:5.</p>
<A NAME="1056"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=813><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1461;&#1491;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">seder</font>, &#8220;order&#8221;) occurs only here in the Bible. G. R. Driver found a new meaning in Arabic <i>sadira</i>, &#8220;dazzled by the glare&#8221; (&#8220;Problems in the Hebrew text of Job,&#8221; VTSup 3 [1955]: 76-77); this would mean &#8220;without a ray of light.&#8221; This is accepted by those who see chaos out of place in this line. But the word &#8220;order&#8221; is well-attested in later Hebrew (see J. Carmignac, &#8220;Précisions aportées au vocabulaire d&#8217;hébreu biblique par La guerre des fils de lumière contre les fils de ténèbres,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 5 [1955]: 345-65).</p>
<A NAME="1057"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=814><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word literally means &#8220;it shines&#8221;; the feminine verb implies a subject like &#8220;the light&#8221; (but see GKC 459 §144.<i>c</i>).</p>
<A NAME="1058"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=815><b>tn</b> The verse multiplies images for the darkness in death. Several commentators omit &#8220;as darkness, deep darkness&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465; &#1488;&#1465;&#1508;&#1462;&#1500; &#1510;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1493;&#1462;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kÿmo </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ofel tsalmavet</font>) as glosses on the rare word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1497;&#1508;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">efatah</font>, &#8220;darkness&#8221;) drawn from v. 21 (see also RSV). The verse literally reads: &#8220;[to the] land of darkness, like the deep darkness of the shadow of death, without any order, and the light is like the darkness.&#8221;</p>
