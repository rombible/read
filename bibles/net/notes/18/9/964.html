<A NAME="964"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=711><b>tn</b> Dhorme, in an effort to avoid tautology, makes this a question: &#8220;Am I blameless?&#8221; The next clause then has Job answering that he does not know. But through the last section Job has been proclaiming his innocence. The other way of interpreting these verses is to follow NIV and make all of them hypothetical (&#8220;If I were blameless, he would pronounce me guilty&#8221;) and then come to this verse with Job saying, &#8220;I am blameless.&#8221; The second clause of this verse does not fit either view very well. In vv. 20, 21, and 22 Job employs the same term for &#8220;blameless&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tam</font>) as in the prologue (1:1). God used it to describe Job in 1:8 and 2:3. Bildad used it in 8:20. These are the final occurrences in the book.</p>
