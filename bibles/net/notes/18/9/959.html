<A NAME="959"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=706><b>tn</b> The question could be taken as &#8220;who will summon me?&#8221; (see Jer 49:19 and 50:44). This does not make immediate sense. Some have simply changed the suffix to &#8220;who will summon him.&#8221; If the MT is retained, then supplying something like &#8220;he will say&#8221; could make the last clause fit the whole passage. Another option is to take it as &#8220;Who will reveal it to me?&#8221; &#8211; i.e., Job could be questioning his friends&#8217; qualifications for being God&#8217;s emissaries to bring God&#8217;s charges against him (cf. KJV, NKJV; and see 10:2 where Job uses the same verb in the Hiphil to request that God reveal what his sin has been that has led to his suffering).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Job is saying that whether it is a trial of strength or an appeal to justice, he is unable to go against God.</p>
