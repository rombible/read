<A NAME="926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=673><b>sn</b> The identification of this as <i>the Pleiades</i> is accepted by most (the Vulgate has &#8220;Hyades&#8221;). In classical Greek mythology, the seven Pleiades were seven sisters of the Hyades who were pursued by Orion until they were changed into stars by Zeus. The Greek myth is probably derived from an older Semitic myth.</p>
