<A NAME="915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=662><b>tn</b> The verb is plural: &#8220;they do not know it.&#8221; This suggests that the mountains would not know it. Some follow the Syriac with a singular verb, i.e., God does not know it, meaning, it is so trifling to God that he can do it without thinking. But the better interpretation may be &#8220;suddenly.&#8221; This would be interpreted from the MT as it stands; it would imply &#8220;before they know anything,&#8221; thus &#8220;suddenly&#8221; (Gray, Dhorme, Buttenwieser, et. al.). D. W. Thomas connects the meaning to another verb based on Arabic and translates it, &#8220; so that they are no longer still&#8221; (&#8220;Additional Notes on the Root <i>yada`</i> in Hebrew,&#8221; <i>JTS</i> 15 [1964]: 54-57). J. A. Emerton works with a possible root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yada</font>&#8217;) meaning &#8220;be still&#8221; (&#8220;A Consideration of Some Alleged Meanings of <i>yada`</i> in Hebrew,&#8221; <i>JSS</i> 15 [1970]: 145-80).</p>
