<A NAME="920"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=667><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zarakh</font>) means &#8220;rise.&#8221; This is the ordinary word for the sunrise. But here it probably has the idea of &#8220;shine; glisten,&#8221; which is also attested in Hebrew and Aramaic.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> There are various views on the meaning of this line in this verse. Some think it refers to some mysterious darkness like the judgment in Egypt (Exod 10:21-23), or to clouds building (3:5), often in accompaniment of earthquakes (see Joel 2:10, 3:15-16; Isa 13:10-13). It could also refer to an eclipse. All this assumes that the phenomenon here is limited to the morning or the day; but it could simply be saying that God controls light and darkness.</p>
