<A NAME="933"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=680><b>tn</b> E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 133) surveys the usages and concludes that the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khataf</font>) normally describes the wicked actions of a man, especially by treachery or trickery against another. But a verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khataf</font>) is found nowhere else; a noun &#8220;robber&#8221; is found in Prov 23:28. Dhorme sees no reason to emend the text, because he concludes that the two verbs are synonymous. Job is saying that if God acts like a plunderer, there is no one who can challenge what he does.</p>
