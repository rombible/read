<A NAME="9110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">110</span><note=757><b>tn</b> The last half of the verse is rather cryptic: &#8220;but not so I with me.&#8221; NIV renders it &#8220;but as it now stands with me, I cannot.&#8221; This is very smooth and interpretive. Others transpose the two halves of the verse to read, &#8220;Since it is not so, I with myself // will commune and not fear him.&#8221; Job would be saying that since he cannot contend with God on equal terms, and since there is no arbiter, he will come on his own terms. English versions have handled this differently: &#8220;for I know I am not what I am thought to be&#8221; (NEB); &#8220;since this is not the case with me&#8221; (NAB); &#8220;I do not see myself like that at all&#8221; (JB). </p>
