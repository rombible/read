<A NAME="94"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=651><b>tn</b> The attempt to define <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">enosh</font>) as &#8220;weak&#8221; or &#8220;mortal&#8221; man is not compelling. Such interpretations are based on etymological links without the clear support of usage (an issue discussed by J. Barr, <i>Comparative Philology and the Text of the Old Testament</i>). This seems to be a poetic word for &#8220;human&#8221; (the only nonpoetic use is in 2 Chr 14:10).</p>
