<A NAME="913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=660><b>tn</b> The verb is the Hiphil of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qashah</font>, &#8220;to be hard&#8221;). It frequently is found with the word for &#8220;neck,&#8221; describing people as &#8220;stiff-necked,&#8221; i.e., stubborn, unbending. So the idea of resisting God fits well. The fact that this word occurs in Exodus with the idea of hardening the heart against God may indicate that there is an allusion to Pharaoh here.</p>
