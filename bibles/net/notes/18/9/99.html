<A NAME="99"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=656><b>tn</b> This use of the imperfect as potential imperfect assumes that the human is the subject, that in a dispute with God he could not answer one of God&#8217;s questions (for which see the conclusion of the book when God questions Job). On the other hand, if the interpretation were that God does not answer the demands of mortals, then a simple progressive imperfect would be required. In support of this is the frustration of Job that God does not answer him.</p>
