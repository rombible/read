<A NAME="966"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=713><b>tc</b> The LXX omits the phrase &#8220;It is all one.&#8221; Modern scholars either omit it or transpose it for clarity.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The expression &#8220;it is one&#8221; means that God&#8217;s dealings with people is undiscriminating. The number &#8220;one&#8221; could also be taken to mean &#8220;the same&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;it is all the same.&#8221; The implication is that it does not matter if Job is good or evil, if he lives or dies. This is the conclusion of the preceding section.</p>
