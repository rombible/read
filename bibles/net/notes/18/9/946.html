<A NAME="946"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=693><b>tn</b> The form is the Qal imperfect of the verb &#8220;answer.&#8221; As the text stands, Job is saying that he cannot answer or could not answer (contend with) God if given a chance. Some commentators think a Niphal fits better here: &#8220;I am not answered,&#8221; meaning God does not reply to him. This has the LXX, the Syriac, and Theodotion in support of it. The advantage would be to avoid the repetition of the same word from v. 14. But others rightly reject this, because all Job is saying here is that he would be too overwhelmed by God to answer him in court. The LXX change to a passive is understandable in that it would be seeking a different idea in this verse and without vocalization might have assumed a passive voice here.</p>
