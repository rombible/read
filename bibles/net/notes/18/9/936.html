<A NAME="936"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=683><b>sn</b> &#8220;Rahab&#8221; is not to be confused with the harlot of the same name from Jericho. &#8220;Rahab&#8221; is identified with Tiamat of the Babylonian creation epic, or Leviathan of the Canaanite myths. It is also used in parallelism to the sea (26:12), or the Red Sea (Ps 74:13), and so comes to symbolize Egypt (Isa 30:7). In the Babylonian Creation Epic there is reference to the helpers of Tiamat. In the Bible the reference is only to the raging sea, which the <sc>Lord controlled at creation.</p>
