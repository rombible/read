<A NAME="949"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=696><b>sn</b> The idea of &#8220;answer&#8221; in this line is that of responding to the summons, i.e., appearing in court. This preterite and the perfect before it have the nuance of hypothetical perfects since they are in conditional clauses (GKC 330 §111.<i>x</i>). D. J. A. Clines (<i>Job </i>[WBC], 219) translates literally, &#8220;If I should call and he should answer.&#8221; </p>
