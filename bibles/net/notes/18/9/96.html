<A NAME="96"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=653><b>sn</b> The point of Job&#8217;s rhetorical question is that man cannot be justified as against God, because God is too powerful and too clever &#8211; he controls the universe. He is discussing now the question that Eliphaz raised in 4:17. Peake observes that Job is raising the question of whether something is right because God says it is right, or that God declares it right because it is right.</p>
