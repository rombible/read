<A NAME="923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=670><b>tn</b> The reference is probably to the waves of the sea. This is the reading preserved in NIV and NAB, as well as by J. Crenshaw, &#8220;<i>W</i>ÿ<i>dorek `al-bamote </i>&#8216;<i>ares</i>,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 34 (1972): 39-53. But many see here a reference to Canaanite mythology. The marginal note in the RSV has &#8220;the back of the sea dragon.&#8221; The view would also see in &#8220;sea&#8221; the Ugaritic god <i>Yammu</i>.</p>
