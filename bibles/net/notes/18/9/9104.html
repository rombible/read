<A NAME="9104"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">104</span><note=751><b>sn</b> The idiom of &#8220;lay his hand on the two of us&#8221; may come from a custom of a judge putting his hands on the two in order to show that he is taking them both under his jurisdiction. The expression can also be used for protection (see Ps 139:5). Job, however, has a problem in that the other party is God, who himself will be arbiter in judgment.</p>
