<A NAME="995"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">95</span><note=742><b>tn</b> The Syriac and Targum Job read with the <i>Qere </i>&#8220;with water of [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1456;&#1502;&#1461;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bÿme</font>] snow.&#8221; The <i>Kethib</i> simply has &#8220;in [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bÿmo</font>] snow.&#8221; In Ps 51:9 and Isa 1:18 snow forms a simile for purification. Some protest that snow water is not necessarily clean; but if fresh melting snow is meant, then the runoff would be very clear. The image would work well here. Nevertheless, others have followed the later Hebrew meaning for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1490;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sheleg</font>) &#8211; &#8220;soap&#8221; (so NIV, NRSV, NLT). Even though that makes a nice parallelism, it is uncertain whether that meaning was in use at the time this text was written.</p>
