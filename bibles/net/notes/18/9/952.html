<A NAME="952"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=699><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1461;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿshufeni</font>) is the same verb that is used in Gen 3:15 for the wounding of the serpent. The Targum to Job, the LXX, and the Vulgate all translate it &#8220;to crush; to pound,&#8221; or &#8220;to bruise.&#8221; The difficulty for many exegetes is that this is to be done &#8220;with a tempest.&#8221; The Syriac and Targum Job see a different vocalization and read &#8220;with a hair.&#8221; The text as it stands is understandable and so no change is needed. The fact that the word &#8220;tempest&#8221; is written with a different sibilant in other places in Job is not greatly significant in this consideration.</p>
