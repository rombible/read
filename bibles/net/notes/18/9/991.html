<A NAME="991"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">91</span><note=738><b>tn</b> The clause simply has &#8220;I am guilty.&#8221; It is the same type of construction found in v. 24. It is also the opposite of that in v. 20. GKC 317 §107.<i>n</i> lists this as an example of the use of the imperfect to express an obligation or necessity according to the judgment of others; it would therefore mean &#8220;if I am to be guilty.&#8221;</p>
