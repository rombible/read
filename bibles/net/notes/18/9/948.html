<A NAME="948"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=695><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1508;&#1456;&#1496;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿshofti</font>) appears to be simply &#8220;my judge.&#8221; But most modern interpretations take the <i>po&#8216;el</i> participle to mean &#8220;my adversary in a court of law.&#8221; Others argue that the form is at least functioning as a noun and means &#8220;judge&#8221; (see 8:5). This would fit better with the idea of appealing for mercy from God. The dilemma of Job, of course, is that the <sc>Lord would be both his adversary in the case <i>and</i> his judge.</p>
