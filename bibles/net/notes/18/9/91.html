<A NAME="91"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=648><b>sn</b> This speech of Job in response to Bildad falls into two large sections, chs. 9 and 10. In ch. 9 he argues that God&#8217;s power and majesty prevent him from establishing his integrity in his complaint to God. And in ch. 10 Job tries to discover in God&#8217;s plan the secret of his afflictions. The speech seems to continue what Job was saying to Eliphaz more than it addresses Bildad. See K. Fullerton, &#8220;On Job 9 and 10,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 53 (1934): 321-49.</p>
