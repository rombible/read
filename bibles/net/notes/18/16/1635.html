<A NAME="1635"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1179><b>tn</b> The meaning of &#8220;his archers&#8221; is supported for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rabbayv</font>) in view of Jer 50:29. The LXX, Syriac, Vulgate, Targum Job, followed by several translations and commentators prefer &#8220;arrows.&#8221; They see this as a more appropriate figure without raising the question of who the archers might be (see 6:4). The point is an unnecessary distinction, for the figure is an illustration of the affliction that God has brought on him.</p>
