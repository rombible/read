<A NAME="1652"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=1196><b>tn</b> The first two words of this verse are problematic: <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1510;&#1463;&#1497; &#1512;&#1461;&#1506;&#1464;&#1497;</font> </i>(<font face="Scholar">mÿlitsay re</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ay</font>, &#8220;my scorners are my friends&#8221;). The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">melits</font>), from or related to the word for &#8220;scorner&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1509;</font>, <font face="Scholar">lits</font>) in wisdom literature especially, can also mean &#8220;mediator&#8221; (Job 33:23), &#8220;interpreter&#8221; (Gen 42:23). This gives the idea that &#8220;scorn&#8221; has to do with the way words are used. It may be that the word here should have the singular suffix and be taken as &#8220;my spokesman.&#8221; This may not be from the same root as &#8220;scorn&#8221; (see N. H. Richardson, &#8220;Some Notes on <i>lis</i> and Its Derivatives,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 5 [1955]: 434-36). This is the view of the NIV, NJPS, JB, NAB, as well as a number of commentators. The idea of &#8220;my friends are scorners&#8221; is out of place in this section, unless taken as a parenthesis. Other suggestions are not convincing. The LXX has &#8220;May my prayer come to the Lord, and before him may my eye shed tears.&#8221; Some have tried to change the Hebrew to fit this. The word &#8220;my friends&#8221; also calls for some attention. Instead of a plural noun suffix, most would see it as a singular, a slight vocalic change. But others think it is not the word &#8220;friend.&#8221; D. J. A. Clines accepts the view that it is not &#8220;friends&#8221; but &#8220;thoughts&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1461;&#1506;&#1463;</font>, <font face="Scholar">rea</font>&#8217;). E. Dhorme takes it as &#8220;clamor,&#8221; from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rua</font>&#8217;) and so interprets &#8220;my claimant word has reached God.&#8221; J. B. Curtis tries &#8220;My intercessor is my shepherd,&#8221; from <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1465;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;</font> </i>(<font face="Scholar">ro</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">i</font>). See &#8220;On Job&#8217;s Witness in Heaven,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 102 [1983]: 549-62.</p>
