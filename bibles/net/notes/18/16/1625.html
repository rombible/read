<A NAME="1625"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1169><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1496;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">satam</font>) is translated &#8220;hate&#8221; in the RSV, but this is not accepted by very many. Many emend it to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shamat</font>), reading &#8220;and he dropped me&#8221; (from his mouth). But that suggests escape. D. J. A. Clines notes that usage shows it reflects ongoing hatred represented by an action such as persecution or attack (<i>Job </i>[WBC], 370).</p>
