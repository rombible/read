<A NAME="161"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1145><b>sn</b> In the next two chapters we have Job&#8217;s second reply to Eliphaz. Job now feels abandoned by God and by his friends, and so complains that this all intensifies his sufferings. But he still holds to his innocence as he continues his appeal to God as his witness. There are four sections to this speech: in vv. 2-5 he dismisses the consolation his friends offered; in vv. 6-17 he laments that he is abandoned by God and man; in 16:8&#8211;17:9 he makes his appeal to God in heaven as a witness; and finally, in 10-16 he anticipates death.</p>
