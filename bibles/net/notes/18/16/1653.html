<A NAME="1653"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1197><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb means &#8220;to drip; to stream; to flow&#8221;; the expression is cryptic, but understandable: &#8220;my eye flows [with tears as I cry out] to God.&#8221; But many suggestions have been made for this line too. Driver suggested in connection with cognate words that it be given the meaning &#8220;sleepless&#8221; (<i>JTS</i> 34 [1933]: 375-85), but this would also require additional words for a smooth reading. See also E. A. Speiser, &#8220;The Semantic Range of <i>dalapu,</i>&#8221;<i> JCS</i> 5 (1951): 64-66, for the Akkadian connection. But for the retention of &#8220;dripping eyes&#8221; based on the Talmudic use, see J. C. Greenfield, &#8220;Lexicographical Notes I,&#8221; <i>HUCA</i> 29 (1958): 203-28.</p>
