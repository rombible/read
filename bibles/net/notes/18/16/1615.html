<A NAME="1615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1159><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1465;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yakhsokh</font>) means &#8220;to restrain; to withhold.&#8221; There is no object, so many make it first person subject, &#8220;I will not restrain.&#8221; The LXX and the Syriac have a different person &#8211; &#8220;I would not restrain.&#8221; G. R. Driver, arguing that the verb is intransitive here, made it &#8220;the solace of my lips would not [added] be withheld&#8221; (see <i>JTS</i> 34 [1933]: 380). D. J. A. Clines says that what is definitive is the use of the verb in the next line, where it clearly means &#8220;soothed, assuaged.&#8221;</p>
