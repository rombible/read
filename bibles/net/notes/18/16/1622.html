<A NAME="1622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1166><b>tn</b> The verb is used in Ps 109:24 to mean &#8220;to be lean&#8221;; and so &#8220;leanness&#8221; is accepted here for the noun by most. Otherwise the word is &#8220;lie, deceit.&#8221; Accordingly, some take it here as &#8220;my slanderer&#8221; or &#8220;my liar&#8221; (gives evidence against me).</p>
