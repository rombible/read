<A NAME="161"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1145><b>sn</b> In the next two chapters we have Job&#8217;s second reply to Eliphaz. Job now feels abandoned by God and by his friends, and so complains that this all intensifies his sufferings. But he still holds to his innocence as he continues his appeal to God as his witness. There are four sections to this speech: in vv. 2-5 he dismisses the consolation his friends offered; in vv. 6-17 he laments that he is abandoned by God and man; in 16:8&#8211;17:9 he makes his appeal to God in heaven as a witness; and finally, in 10-16 he anticipates death.</p>
<A NAME="162"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1146><b>tn</b> The expression uses the Piel participle in construct: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1502;&#1461;&#1497; &#1506;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿnahame </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amal</font>, &#8220;comforters of trouble&#8221;), i.e., comforters who increase trouble instead of relieving it. D. W. Thomas translates this &#8220;breathers out of trouble&#8221; (&#8220;A Note on the Hebrew Root <i>naham,</i>&#8221;<i> ExpTim</i> 44 [1932/33]: 192).</p>
<A NAME="163"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1147><b>tn</b> Disjunctive questions are introduced with the sign of the interrogative; the second part is introduced with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">o</font>, see GKC 475 §150.<i>g</i>).</p>
<A NAME="164"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1148><b>tn</b> In v. 3 the second person singular is employed rather than the plural as in vv. 2 and 4. The singular might be an indication that the words of v. 3 were directed at Eliphaz specifically.</p>
<A NAME="165"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1149><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;words of wind.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="166"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1150><b>tn</b> The Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">marats</font>) does not occur anywhere else. The word means &#8220;to compel; to force&#8221; (see 6:25).</p>
<A NAME="167"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1151><b>tn</b> The LXX seems to have gone a different way: &#8220;What, is there any reason in vain words, or what will hinder you from answering?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="168"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1152><b>tn</b> For the use of the cohortative in the apodosis of conditional sentences, see GKC 322 §109.<i>f</i>.</p>
<A NAME="169"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1153><b>tn</b> The conjunction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lu</font>) is used to introduce the optative, a condition that is incapable of fulfillment (see GKC 494-95 §159.<i>l</i>).</p>
<A NAME="1610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1154><b>tn</b> This verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akhbirah</font>) is usually connected to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khavar</font>, &#8220;to bind&#8221;). There are several suggestions for this word. J. J. Finkelstein proposed a second root, a homonym, meaning &#8220;to make a sound,&#8221; and so here &#8220;to harangue&#8221; (&#8220;Hebrew <i>habar</i> and Semitic <i>HBR,</i>&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 75 [1956]: 328-31; see also O. Loretz, &#8220;<i>HBR</i> in Job 16:4,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 23 [1961]: 293-94, who renders it &#8220;I could make noisy speeches&#8221;). Other suggestions have been for new meanings based on cognate studies, such as &#8220;to make beautiful&#8221; (i.e., make polished speeches).</p>
<A NAME="1611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1155><b>sn</b> The action is a sign of mockery (see Ps 22:7[8]; Isa 37:22; Matt 27:39).</p>
<A NAME="1612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1156><b>tn</b> &#8220;But&#8221; has been added in the translation to strengthen the contrast.</p>
<A NAME="1613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1157><b>tn</b> The Piel of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amats</font>) means &#8220;to strengthen, fortify.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1158><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my mouth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1159><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1465;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yakhsokh</font>) means &#8220;to restrain; to withhold.&#8221; There is no object, so many make it first person subject, &#8220;I will not restrain.&#8221; The LXX and the Syriac have a different person &#8211; &#8220;I would not restrain.&#8221; G. R. Driver, arguing that the verb is intransitive here, made it &#8220;the solace of my lips would not [added] be withheld&#8221; (see <i>JTS</i> 34 [1933]: 380). D. J. A. Clines says that what is definitive is the use of the verb in the next line, where it clearly means &#8220;soothed, assuaged.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1160><b>tn</b> &#8220;But&#8221; is supplied in the translation to strengthen the contrast.</p>
<A NAME="1617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1161><b>tn</b> The Niphal <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1461;&#1495;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yekhasekh</font>) means &#8220;to be soothed; to be assuaged.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1162><b>tn</b> Some argue that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mah</font>) in the text is the Arabic <i>ma, </i>the simple negative. This would then mean &#8220;it does not depart far from me.&#8221; The interrogative used rhetorically amounts to the same thing, however, so the suggestion is not necessary.</p>
<A NAME="1619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1163><b>tn</b> In poetic discourse there is often an abrupt change from person to another. See GKC 462 §144.<i>p</i>. Some take the subject of this verb to be God, others the pain (&#8220;surely now it has worn me out&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1164><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qamat</font>) which is used only here and in 22:16; it means &#8220;to seize; to grasp.&#8221; By God&#8217;s seizing him, Job means his afflictions.</p>
<A NAME="1621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1165><b>tn</b> The subject is &#8220;my calamity.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1166><b>tn</b> The verb is used in Ps 109:24 to mean &#8220;to be lean&#8221;; and so &#8220;leanness&#8221; is accepted here for the noun by most. Otherwise the word is &#8220;lie, deceit.&#8221; Accordingly, some take it here as &#8220;my slanderer&#8221; or &#8220;my liar&#8221; (gives evidence against me).</p>
<A NAME="1623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1167><b>tn</b> The referent of these pronouns in v. 9 (&#8220;his anger&#8230;he has gnashed&#8230;his teeth&#8230;his eyes&#8221;) is best taken as God.</p>
<A NAME="1624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1168><b>sn</b> The figure used now is that of a wild beast. God&#8217;s affliction of Job is compared to the attack of such an animal. Cf. Amos 1:11.</p>
<A NAME="1625"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1169><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1496;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">satam</font>) is translated &#8220;hate&#8221; in the RSV, but this is not accepted by very many. Many emend it to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shamat</font>), reading &#8220;and he dropped me&#8221; (from his mouth). But that suggests escape. D. J. A. Clines notes that usage shows it reflects ongoing hatred represented by an action such as persecution or attack (<i>Job </i>[WBC], 370).</p>
<A NAME="1626"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1170><b>tn</b> The verb is used of sharpening a sword in Ps 7:12; here it means &#8220;to look intently&#8221; as an animal looks for prey. The verse describes God&#8217;s relentless pursuit of Job.</p>
<A NAME="1627"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1171><b>tn</b> &#8220;People&#8221; is supplied; the Hebrew verb is third plural. The colon reads, &#8220;they have opened against me with [the preposition is instrumental] their mouth.&#8221; The gestures here follow the animal imagery; they reflect destructive opposition and attack (see Ps 22:13 among others).</p>
<A NAME="1628"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1172><b>tn</b> This is an &#8220;insult&#8221; or a &#8220;reproach.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1629"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1173><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yitmalla</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">un</font>) is taken from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1500;&#1461;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">male</font>&#8217;), &#8220;to be full,&#8221; and in this stem, &#8220;to pile up; to press together.&#8221; The term has a military connotation, such as &#8220;to mobilize&#8221; (see D. W. Thomas, &#8220;<i>ml'w</i> in Jeremiah 4:5 : a military term,&#8221; <i>JJS</i> 3 [1952]: 47-52). Job sees himself surrounded by enemies who persecute him and mock him.</p>
<A NAME="1630"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1174><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1493;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avil</font>) means &#8220;child,&#8221; and this cannot be right here. If it is read as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1493;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avval</font>)<i> </i>as in Job 27:7 it would be the unrighteous.</p>
<A NAME="1631"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1175><b>sn</b> Job does not refer here to his friends, but more likely to the wicked men who set about to destroy him and his possessions, or to the rabble in ch. 30.</p>
<A NAME="1632"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1176><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1496;&#1461;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yirteni</font>) does not derive from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ratah</font>) as would fit the pointing in the MT, but from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yarat</font>), cognate to Arabic <i>warrata,</i> &#8220;to throw; to hurl.&#8221; E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 236) thinks that since the normal form would have been <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1456;&#1496;&#1461;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yirÿteni</font>), it is probable that one of the <i>yods</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font>) would have affected the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1493;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avil</font>) &#8211; but that does not make much sense.</p>
<A NAME="1633"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1177><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">parar</font>) means &#8220;to shake.&#8221; In the Hiphil it means &#8220;to break; to shatter&#8221; (5:12; 15:4). The Pilpel means &#8220;to break in pieces,&#8221; and in the Poel in Jer 23:29 &#8220;to smash up.&#8221; So Job was living at ease, and God shattered his life.</p>
<A NAME="1634"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1178><b>tn</b> Here is another Pilpel, now from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">patsats</font>) with a similar meaning to the other verb. It means &#8220;to dash into pieces&#8221; and even scatter the pieces. The LXX translates this line, &#8220;he took me by the hair of the head and plucked it out.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1635"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1179><b>tn</b> The meaning of &#8220;his archers&#8221; is supported for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rabbayv</font>) in view of Jer 50:29. The LXX, Syriac, Vulgate, Targum Job, followed by several translations and commentators prefer &#8220;arrows.&#8221; They see this as a more appropriate figure without raising the question of who the archers might be (see 6:4). The point is an unnecessary distinction, for the figure is an illustration of the affliction that God has brought on him.</p>
<A NAME="1636"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1180><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he does not pity,&#8221; but the clause is functioning adverbially in the line.</p>
<A NAME="1637"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1181><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">palakh</font>) in the Piel means &#8220;to pierce&#8221; (see Prov 7:23). A fuller comparison should be made with Lam 3:12-13.</p>
<A NAME="1638"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1182><b>tn</b> This word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1512;&#1464;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿrerati</font>, &#8220;my gall&#8221;) is found only here. It is close to the form in Job 13:26, &#8220;bitter things.&#8221; In Job 20:14 it may mean &#8220;poison.&#8221; The thought is also found in Lam 2:11.</p>
<A NAME="1639"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1183><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">parats</font>) means &#8220;to make a breach&#8221; in a wall (Isa 5:5; Ps 80:13). It is used figuratively in the birth and naming of Peres in Gen 38:29. Here the image is now of a military attack that breaks through a wall. The text uses the cognate accusative, and then with the addition of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al-pÿne</font>, &#8220;in addition&#8221;) it repeats the cognate noun. A smooth translation that reflects the three words is difficult. E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 237) has &#8220;he batters me down, breach upon breach.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1640"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1184><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;runs.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1641"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1185><b>sn</b> The language is hyperbolic; Job is saying that the sackcloth he has put on in his lamentable state is now stuck to his skin as if he had stitched it into the skin. It is now a habitual garment that he never takes off.</p>
<A NAME="1642"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1186><b>tn</b> The Poel <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1465;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">olalti</font>) from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alal</font>, &#8220;to enter&#8221;) has here the meaning of &#8220;to thrust in.&#8221; The activity is the opposite of &#8220;raising high the horn,&#8221; a picture of dignity and victory.</p>
<A NAME="1643"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1187><b>tn</b> There is no English term that captures exactly what &#8220;horn&#8221; is meant to do. Drawn from the animal world, the image was meant to convey strength and pride and victory. Some modern commentators have made other proposals for the line. Svi Rin suggested from Ugaritic that the verb be translated &#8220;lower&#8221; or &#8220;dip&#8221; (&#8220;Ugaritic &#8211; Old Testament Affinities,&#8221; <i>BZ</i> 7 [1963]: 22-33).</p>
<A NAME="1644"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1188><b>tn</b> An intensive form, a Qetaltal form of the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khamar</font>, &#8220;red&#8221;) is used here. This word has as probable derivatives <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khomer</font>, &#8220;[red] clay&#8221;) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1458;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khamor</font>, &#8220;[red] ass&#8221;) and the like. Because of the weeping, his whole complexion has been reddened (the LXX reads &#8220;my belly&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1645"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1189><b>sn</b> A. B. Davidson (<i>Job</i>, 122) notes that spontaneous and repeated weeping is one of the symptoms of elephantiasis.</p>
<A NAME="1646"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1190><b>sn</b> See Job 3:5. Just as joy brings light and life to the eyes, sorrow and suffering bring darkness. The &#8220;eyelids&#8221; here would be synecdoche, reflecting the whole facial expression as sad and sullen.</p>
<A NAME="1647"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1191><b>tn</b> For the use of the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) to introduce concessive clauses, see GKC 499 §160.<i>c</i>.</p>
<A NAME="1648"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1192><b>sn</b> Job knows that he will die, and that his death, signified here by blood on the ground, will cry out for vindication.</p>
<A NAME="1649"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1193><b>tn</b> The word is simply &#8220;a place,&#8221; but in the context it surely means a hidden place, a secret place that would never be discovered (see 18:21). </p>
<A NAME="1650"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1194><b>sn</b> The witness in heaven must be God, to whom the cries and prayers come. Job&#8217;s dilemma is serious, but common to the human experience: the hostility of God toward him is baffling, but he is conscious of his innocence and can call on God to be his witness.</p>
<A NAME="1651"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1195><b>tn</b> The parallelism now uses the Aramaic word &#8220;my advocate&#8221; &#8211; the one who testifies on my behalf. The word again appears in Gen 31:47 for Laban&#8217;s naming of the &#8220;heap of witness&#8221; in Aramaic &#8211; &#8220;Sahadutha.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1652"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=1196><b>tn</b> The first two words of this verse are problematic: <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1510;&#1463;&#1497; &#1512;&#1461;&#1506;&#1464;&#1497;</font> </i>(<font face="Scholar">mÿlitsay re</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ay</font>, &#8220;my scorners are my friends&#8221;). The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">melits</font>), from or related to the word for &#8220;scorner&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1509;</font>, <font face="Scholar">lits</font>) in wisdom literature especially, can also mean &#8220;mediator&#8221; (Job 33:23), &#8220;interpreter&#8221; (Gen 42:23). This gives the idea that &#8220;scorn&#8221; has to do with the way words are used. It may be that the word here should have the singular suffix and be taken as &#8220;my spokesman.&#8221; This may not be from the same root as &#8220;scorn&#8221; (see N. H. Richardson, &#8220;Some Notes on <i>lis</i> and Its Derivatives,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 5 [1955]: 434-36). This is the view of the NIV, NJPS, JB, NAB, as well as a number of commentators. The idea of &#8220;my friends are scorners&#8221; is out of place in this section, unless taken as a parenthesis. Other suggestions are not convincing. The LXX has &#8220;May my prayer come to the Lord, and before him may my eye shed tears.&#8221; Some have tried to change the Hebrew to fit this. The word &#8220;my friends&#8221; also calls for some attention. Instead of a plural noun suffix, most would see it as a singular, a slight vocalic change. But others think it is not the word &#8220;friend.&#8221; D. J. A. Clines accepts the view that it is not &#8220;friends&#8221; but &#8220;thoughts&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1461;&#1506;&#1463;</font>, <font face="Scholar">rea</font>&#8217;). E. Dhorme takes it as &#8220;clamor,&#8221; from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rua</font>&#8217;) and so interprets &#8220;my claimant word has reached God.&#8221; J. B. Curtis tries &#8220;My intercessor is my shepherd,&#8221; from <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1465;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;</font> </i>(<font face="Scholar">ro</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">i</font>). See &#8220;On Job&#8217;s Witness in Heaven,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 102 [1983]: 549-62.</p>
<A NAME="1653"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1197><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb means &#8220;to drip; to stream; to flow&#8221;; the expression is cryptic, but understandable: &#8220;my eye flows [with tears as I cry out] to God.&#8221; But many suggestions have been made for this line too. Driver suggested in connection with cognate words that it be given the meaning &#8220;sleepless&#8221; (<i>JTS</i> 34 [1933]: 375-85), but this would also require additional words for a smooth reading. See also E. A. Speiser, &#8220;The Semantic Range of <i>dalapu,</i>&#8221;<i> JCS</i> 5 (1951): 64-66, for the Akkadian connection. But for the retention of &#8220;dripping eyes&#8221; based on the Talmudic use, see J. C. Greenfield, &#8220;Lexicographical Notes I,&#8221; <i>HUCA</i> 29 (1958): 203-28.</p>
<A NAME="1654"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1198><b>tn</b> E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 240) alters this slightly to read &#8220;Would that&#8221; or &#8220;Ah! if only.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1655"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=1199><b>tn</b> This is the simple translation of the expression &#8220;son of man&#8221; in Job. But some commentators wish to change the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ben</font>, &#8220;son&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ben</font>, &#8220;between&#8221;). It would then be &#8220;[as] between a man and [for] his friend.&#8221; Even though a few <sc>mss have this reading, it is to be rejected. But see J. Barr, &#8220;Some Notes on &#8216;<i>ben</i>&#8217; in Classical Hebrew,&#8221; <i>JSS</i> 23 (1978): 1-22.</p>
<A NAME="1656"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=1200><b>tn</b> The verb is supplied from the parallel clause.</p>
<A NAME="1657"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=1201><b>tn</b> The expression is &#8220;years of number,&#8221; meaning that they can be counted, and so &#8220;the years are few.&#8221; The verb simply means &#8220;comes&#8221; or &#8220;lie ahead.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1658"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=1202><b>tn</b> The verbal expression &#8220;I will not return&#8221; serves here to modify the journey that he will take. It is &#8220;the road [of] I will not return.&#8221;</p>
