<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1417><b>sn</b> In this chapter Job actually answers the ideas of all three of his friends. Here Job finds the flaw in their argument &#8211; he can point to wicked people who prosper. But whereas in the last speech, when he looked on his suffering from the perspective of his innocence, he found great faith and hope, in this chapter when he surveys the divine government of the world, he sinks to despair. The speech can be divided into five parts: he appeals for a hearing (2-6), he points out the prosperity of the wicked (7-16), he wonders exactly when the godless suffer (17-22), he shows how death levels everything (23-26), and he reveals how experience contradicts his friends&#8217; argument (27-34).</p>
