<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1424><b>tn</b> The verb is the imperfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1490;</font> (<font face="Scholar">la</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ag</font>). The Hiphil has the same basic sense as the Qal, &#8220;to mock; to deride.&#8221; The imperfect here would be modal, expressing permission. The verb is in the singular, suggesting that Job is addressing Zophar; however, most of the versions put it into the plural. Note the singular in 16:3 between the plural in 16:1 and 16:4.</p>
