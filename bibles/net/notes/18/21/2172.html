<A NAME="2172"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=1488><b>tc</b> The LXX reads, &#8220;Ask those who go by the way, and do not disown their signs.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The idea is that the merchants who travel widely will talk about what they have seen and heard. These travelers give a different account of the wicked; they tell how he is spared. E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 322) interprets &#8220;signs&#8221; concretely: &#8220;Their custom was to write their names and their thoughts somewhere at the main cross-roads. The main roads of Sinai are dotted with these scribblings made by such passers of a day.&#8221;</p>
