<A NAME="2131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1447><b>tc</b> The <i>Kethib</i> has &#8220;they wear out&#8221; but the <i>Qere</i> and the versions have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1499;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿkhallu</font>, &#8220;bring to an end&#8221;). The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kalah</font>) means &#8220;to finish; to complete,&#8221; and here with the object &#8220;their days,&#8221; it means that they bring their life to a (successful) conclusion. Both readings are acceptable in the context, with very little difference in the overall meaning (which according to Gordis is proof the <i>Qere</i> does not always correct the <i>Kethib</i>).</p>
