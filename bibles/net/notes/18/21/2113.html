<A NAME="2113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1429><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pÿnu</font>) is from the verb &#8220;to turn,&#8221; related to the word for &#8220;face.&#8221; In calling for them to turn toward him, he is calling for them to look at him. But here it may be more in the sense of their attention rather than just a looking at him.</p>
