<A NAME="2161"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=1477><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1496;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">atan</font>) has the precise meaning of &#8220;press olives.&#8221; But because here it says &#8220;full of milk,&#8221; the derived meaning for the noun has been made to mean &#8220;breasts&#8221; or &#8220;pails&#8221; (although in later Hebrew this word occurs &#8211; but with olives, not with milk). Dhorme takes it to refer to &#8220;his sides,&#8221; and repoints the word for &#8220;milk&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1489;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khalav</font>) to get &#8220;fat&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1489;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khelev</font>) &#8211; &#8220;his sides are full of fat,&#8221; a rendering followed by NASB. However, this weakens the parallelism.</p>
