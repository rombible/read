<A NAME="3044"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1854><b>sn</b> The verb is simple, but the interpretation difficult. In this verse it probably means he stands up in prayer (Jer 15:1), but it could mean that he makes his case to God. Others suggest a more figurative sense, like the English expression &#8220;stand pat,&#8221; meaning &#8220;remain silent&#8221; (see Job 29:8).</p>
