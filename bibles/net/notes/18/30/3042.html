<A NAME="3042"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1852><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;like the collar&#8221; is difficult, primarily because their tunics did not have collars. A translation of &#8220;neck&#8221; would suit better. Some change the preposition to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet</font>), getting a translation &#8220;by the neck of my tunic.&#8221;</p>
