<A NAME="3041"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1851><b>tc</b> This whole verse is difficult. The first problem is that this verb in the MT means &#8220;is disguised [or disfigured],&#8221; indicating that Job&#8217;s clothes hang loose on him. But many take the view that the verb is a phonetic variant of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khavash</font>, &#8220;to bind; to seize&#8221;) and that the Hitpael form is a conflation of the third and second person because of the interchange between them in the passage (R. Gordis, <i>Job</i>, 335). The commentaries list a number of conjectural emendations, but the image in the verse is probably that God seizes Job by the garment and throws him down.</p>
