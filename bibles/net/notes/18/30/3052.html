<A NAME="3052"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=1862><b>tc</b> Here is another very difficult verse, as is attested by the differences among commentaries and translations. The MT has &#8220;surely not against a ruinous heap will he [God] put forth his [God&#8217;s] hand.&#8221; But A. B. Davidson takes Job as the subject, reading &#8220;does not one stretch out his hand in his fall?&#8221; The RSV suggests a man walking in the ruins and using his hand for support. Dillmann changed it to &#8220;drowning man&#8221; to say &#8220;does not a drowning man stretch out his hand?&#8221; Beer has &#8220;have I not given a helping hand to the poor?&#8221; Dhorme has, &#8220;I did not strike the poor man with my hand.&#8221; Kissane follows this but retains the verb form, &#8220;one does not strike the poor man with his hand.&#8221;</p>
