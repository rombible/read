<A NAME="3023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1833><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">patakh</font>) means &#8220;to untie [or undo]&#8221; a rope or bonds. In this verse <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yitro</font>, the <i>Kethib</i>, LXX, and Vulgate) would mean &#8220;his rope&#8221; (see <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</font> [<font face="Scholar">yeter</font>] in Judg 16:7-9). The <i>Qere</i> would be <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yitri</font>, &#8220;my rope [or cord]&#8221;), meaning &#8220;me.&#8221; The word could mean &#8220;rope,&#8221; &#8220;cord,&#8221; or &#8220;bowstring.&#8221; If the reading &#8220;my cord&#8221; is accepted, the cord would be something like &#8220;my tent cord&#8221; (as in Job 29:20), more than K&amp;D 12:147 &#8220;cord of life.&#8221; This has been followed in the present translation. If it were &#8220;my bowstring,&#8221; it would give the sense of disablement. If &#8220;his cord&#8221; is taken, it would signify that the restraint that God had in afflicting Job was loosened &#8211; nothing was held back.</p>
