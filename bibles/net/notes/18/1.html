Owens, &#8220;Prologue and Epilogue,&#8221; <i>RevExp</i> 68 (1971): 457-67; and R. Polzin, &#8220;The Framework of the Book of Job,&#8221; <i>Int</i> 31 (1974): 182-200.</p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2><b>sn</b> The Book of Job is one of the major books of wisdom literature in the Bible. But it is a different kind of wisdom. Whereas the Book of Proverbs is a collection of the short wisdom sayings, Job is a thorough analysis of the relationship between suffering and divine justice put in a dramatic poetic form. There are a number of treatises on this subject in the ancient Near East, but none of them are as thorough and masterful as Job. See J. Gray, &#8220;The Book of Job in the Context of Near Eastern Literature,&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 82 (1970): 251-69; S. N. Kramer, &#8220;Man and His God, A Sumerian Variation on the &#8216;Job&#8217; Motif,&#8221; VTSup 3 (1953): 170-82. While the book has fascinated readers for ages, it is a difficult book, difficult to translate and difficult to study. Most of it is written in poetic parallelism. But it is often very cryptic, it is written with unusual grammatical constructions, and it makes use of a large number of very rare words. All this has led some scholars to question if it was originally written in Hebrew or some other related Semitic dialect or language first. There is no indication of who the author was. It is even possible that the work may have been refined over the years; but there is no evidence for this either. The book uses a variety of genres (laments, hymns, proverbs, and oracles) in the various speeches of the participants. This all adds to the richness of the material. And while it is a poetic drama using cycles of speeches, there is no reason to doubt that the events represented here do not go back to a real situation and preserve the various arguments. Several indications in the book would place Job&#8217;s dates in the time of the patriarchs. But the composition of the book, or at least its final form, may very well come from the first millennium, maybe in the time of the flowering of wisdom literature with Solomon. We have no way of knowing when the book was written, or when its revision was completed. But dating it late in the intertestamental period is ruled out by the appearance of translations and copies of it, notably bits of a Targum of Job in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Among the general works and commentaries, see A. Hurvitz, &#8220;The Date of the Prose Tale of Job Linguistically Reconsidered,&#8221; <i>HTR</i> 67 (1974): 17-34; R. H. Pfeiffer, &#8220;The Priority of Job over Isaiah 40-55,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 46 (1927): 202ff. The book presents many valuable ideas on the subject of the suffering of the righteous. Ultimately it teaches that one must submit to the wisdom of the Creator. But it also indicates that the shallow answers of Job&#8217;s friends do not do justice to the issue. Their arguments that suffering is due to sin are true to a point, but they did not apply to Job. His protests sound angry and belligerent, but he held tenaciously to his integrity. His experience shows that it is possible to live a pure life and yet still suffer. He finally turns his plea to God, demanding a hearing. This he receives, of course, only to hear that God is sovereignly ruling the universe. Job can only submit to him. In the end God does not abandon his sufferer. For additional material, see G. L. Archer, <i>The Book of Job</i>; H. H. Rowley, &#8220;The Book of Job and Its Meaning,&#8221; <i>BJRL</i> 41 (1958/59): 167-207; J. A. Baker, <i>The Book of Job</i>; C. L. Feinberg, &#8220;The Book of Job,&#8221; <i>BSac</i> 91 (1934): 78-86; R. Polzin and D. Robertson, &#8220;Studies in the Book of Job,&#8221; <i>Semeia</i> 7 (Missoula: Scholars Press, 1977).</p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3><b>tn</b> The Hebrew construction is literally &#8220;a man was,&#8221; using <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ish hayah</font>) rather than a preterite first. This simply begins the narrative. </p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4><b>sn</b> The term <i>Uz</i> occurs several times in the Bible: a son of Aram (Gen 10:23), a son of Nahor (Gen 22:21), and a descendant of Seir (Gen 36:28). If these are the clues to follow, the location would be north of Syria or south near Edom. The book tells how Job&#8217;s flocks were exposed to Chaldeans, the tribes between Syria and the Euphrates (1:17), and in another direction to attacks from the Sabeans (1:15). The most prominent man among his friends was from Teman, which was in Edom (2:11). Uz is also connected with Edom in Lamentations 4:21. The most plausible location, then, would be east of Israel and northeast of Edom, in what is now North Arabia. The LXX has &#8220;on the borders of Edom and Arabia.&#8221; An early Christian tradition placed his home in an area about 40 miles south of Damascus, in Baashan at the southeast foot of Hermon.</p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>tn</b> In Hebrew the defining relative clause (&#8220;whose name was Job&#8221;) is actually an asyndetic verbless noun-clause placed in apposition to the substantive (&#8220;a man&#8221;); see GKC 486 §155.<i>e</i>.</p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=6><b>sn</b> The name &#8220;Job&#8221; is mentioned by Ezekiel as one of the greats in the past &#8211; Noah, Job, and Daniel (14:14). The suffering of Job was probably well known in the ancient world, and this name was clearly part of that tradition. There is little reason to try to determine the etymology and meaning of the name, since it may not be Hebrew. If it were Hebrew, it might mean something like &#8220;persecuted,&#8221; although some suggest &#8220;aggressor.&#8221; If Arabic it might have the significance of &#8220;the one who always returns to God.&#8221;</p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=7><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tam</font>) has been translated &#8220;perfect&#8221; (so KJV, ASV). The verbal root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tamam</font>) means &#8220;to be blameless, complete.&#8221; The word is found in Gen 25:27 where it describes Jacob as &#8220;even-tempered.&#8221; It also occurs in Ps 64:5 (64:4 ET) and Prov 29:10. The meaning is that a person or a thing is complete, perfect, flawless. It does not mean that he was sinless, but that he was wholeheartedly trying to please God, that he had integrity and was blameless before God.</p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=8><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yashar</font>, &#8220;upright&#8221;) is complementary to &#8220;blameless.&#8221; The idea is &#8220;upright, just,&#8221; and applies to his relationships with others (Ps 37:37 and 25:21).</p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=9><b>sn</b> These two expressions indicate the outcome of Job&#8217;s character. &#8220;Fearing God&#8221; and &#8220;turning from evil&#8221; also express two correlative ideas in scripture; they signify his true piety &#8211; he had reverential fear of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, meaning he was a truly devoted worshiper who shunned evil. </p>
<a name="110"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=10><b>sn</b> The numbers used in the chapter, seven, three, and five, carry the symbolism in the Bible of perfection and completeness (see J. J. Davis, <i>Biblical Numerology</i>). Job&#8217;s &#8220;seven sons&#8221; are listed first because in the East sons were considered more valuable than daughters (recall Ruth, who is &#8220;better than seven sons&#8221; [Ruth 4:15]).</p>
<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>tn</b> The verb begins the sentence: &#8220;and there were born.&#8221; This use of the preterite with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive, especially after the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hayah</font>, &#8220;to be&#8221;), is explanatory: there was a man&#8230;and there was born to him&#8230;&#8221; (<i>IBHS</i> 551-52 §33.2.2b).</p>
<a name="112"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=12><b>tn</b> The word means &#8220;cattle, livestock, possessions&#8221; (see also Gen 26:14). Here it includes the livestock, but also the entire substance of his household.</p>
<a name="113"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=13><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;amounted to,&#8221; &#8220;totaled.&#8221; The preterite of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hayah</font>, &#8220;to be&#8221;) is sometimes employed to introduce a total amount or an inventory (see Exod 1:5; Num 3:43).</p>
<a name="114"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=14><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1489;&#1467;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avuddah</font>, &#8220;service of household servants&#8221;) indicates that he had a very large body of servants, meaning a very large household.</p>
<a name="115"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=15><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and that man.&#8221;</p>
<a name="116"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=16><b>tn</b> The expression is literally &#8220;sons of the east.&#8221; The use of the genitive after &#8220;sons&#8221; in this construction may emphasize their nature (like &#8220;sons of belial&#8221;); it would refer to them as easterners (like &#8220;sons of the south&#8221; in contemporary American English). BDB 869 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1462;&#1491;&#1462;&#1501;</font> says &#8220;dwellers in the east.&#8221;</p>
<a name="117"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=17><b>tn</b> The perfect verb with the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vav</font>), <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿhalÿkhu</font>, &#8220;they went&#8221;) indicates their characteristic action, actions that were frequently repeated (GKC 335-36 §112.<i>dd</i>).</p>
<a name="118"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=18><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;make a feast.&#8221;</p>
<a name="119"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=19><b>tn</b> The sense is cryptic; it literally says &#8220;house &#8211; a man &#8211; his day.&#8221; The word &#8220;house&#8221; is an adverbial accusative of place: &#8220;in the house.&#8221; &#8220;Man&#8221; is the genitive; it also has a distributive sense: &#8220;in the house of each man.&#8221; And &#8220;his day&#8221; is an adverbial accusative: &#8220;on his day.&#8221; The point is that they feasted every day of the week in rotation.</p>
<a name="120"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=20><b>tn</b> The use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qara</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to call, invite&#8221;) followed by the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lamed</font>) usually has the force of &#8220;to summon.&#8221; Here the meaning would not be so commanding, but would refer to an invitation (see also 1 Kgs 1:19, 25, 26).</p>
<a name="121"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=21><b>tn</b> Normally cardinal numerals tend to disagree in gender with the numbered noun. In v. 2 &#8220;three daughters&#8221; consists of the masculine numeral followed by the feminine noun. However, here &#8220;three sisters&#8221; consists of the feminine numeral followed by the feminine noun. The distinction appears to be that the normal disagreement between numeral and noun when the intent is merely to fix the number (3 daughters as opposed to 2 or 4 daughters). However, when a particular, previously known group is indicated, the numeral tends to agree with the noun in gender. A similar case occurs in Gen 3:13 (&#8220;three wives&#8221; of Noah&#8217;s sons).</p>
<a name="122"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=22><b>tn</b> The verse begins with the temporal indicator &#8220;and it happened&#8221; or &#8220;and it came to pass,&#8221; which need not be translated. The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>, &#8220;when&#8221;) with the initial verbal form indicates it is a temporal clause.</p>
<a name="123"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=23><b>tn</b> The verb is the Hiphil perfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">naqaf</font>, &#8220;go around&#8221;), here it means &#8220;to make the round&#8221; or &#8220;complete the circuit&#8221; (BDB 668-69 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1507;</font> Hiph). It indicates that when the feasting had made its circuit of the seven sons, then Job would sanctify them. </p>
<a name="124"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=24><b>tn</b> The form is a preterite with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive. The same emphasis on repeated or frequent action continues here in this verse. The idea here is that Job would send <i>for them</i>, because the sanctification of them would have consisted of washings and changes of garments as well as the sacrifices (see Gen 35:2; 1 Sam 16:5).</p>
<a name="125"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=25><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;purify.&#8221;</p>
<a name="126"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=26><b>tn</b> The first verb could also be joined with the next to form a verbal hendiadys: &#8220;he would rise early and he would sacrifice&#8221; would then simply be &#8220;he would sacrifice early in the morning&#8221; (see M. Delcor, &#8220;Quelques cas de survivances du vocabulaire nomade en hébreu biblique,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 25 [1975]: 307-22). This section serves to explain in more detail how Job sanctified his children. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In the patriarchal society it was normal for the father to act as priest for the family, making the sacrifices as needed. Job here is exceptional in his devotion to the duty. The passage shows the balance between the greatest earthly rejoicing by the family, and the deepest piety and affection of the father.</p>
<a name="127"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=27><b>tn</b> The text does not have &#8220;according to&#8221;; the noun &#8220;number&#8221; is an accusative that defines the extent of his actions (GKC 373-74 §118.<i>e</i>, <i>h</i>).</p>
<a name="128"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=28><b>tn</b> The clause stands as an accusative to the verb, here as the direct object introduced with &#8220;perhaps&#8221; (<i>IBHS</i> 645-46 §38.8d).</p>
<a name="129"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=29><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sons,&#8221; but since the three daughters are specifically mentioned in v. 4, &#8220;children&#8221; has been used in the translation. In this patriarchal culture, however, it is possible that only the sons are in view.</p>
<a name="130"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=30><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">barakh</font>), which means &#8220;to bless.&#8221; Here is a case where the writer or a scribe has substituted the word &#8220;curse&#8221; with the word &#8220;bless&#8221; to avoid having the expression &#8220;curse God.&#8221; For similar euphemisms in the ancient world, see K. A. Kitchen, <i>Ancient Orient and Old Testament</i>, 166. It is therefore difficult to know exactly what Job feared they might have done. The opposite of &#8220;bless&#8221; would be &#8220;curse,&#8221; which normally would convey disowning or removing from blessing. Some commentators try to offer a definition of &#8220;curse&#8221; from the root in the text, and noting that &#8220;curse&#8221; is too strong, come to something like &#8220;renounce.&#8221; The idea of blaspheming is probably not meant; rather, in their festivities they may have said things that renounced God or their interest in him. Job feared this momentary turning away from God in their festivities, perhaps as they thought their good life was more important than their religion.</p>
<a name="131"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=31><b>tn</b> The imperfect expresses continual action in past time, i.e., a customary imperfect (GKC 315 §107.<i>e</i>).</p>
<a name="132"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=32><b>sn</b> The text draws the curtain of heaven aside for the reader to understand the background of this drama. God extols the virtue of Job, but Satan challenges the reasons for it. He receives permission to try to dislodge Job from his integrity. In short, God is using Job to prove Satan&#8217;s theory wrong.</p>
<a name="133"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=33><b>tn</b> The beginning Hebrew expression &#8220;and there was &#8211; the day&#8221; indicates that &#8220;there came a day when&#8221; or more simply &#8220;the day came when.&#8221; It emphasizes the particular day. The succeeding clause is then introduced with a preterite with the with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive (see E. Dhorme, <i>Job</i>, 5).</p>
<a name="134"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=34><b>sn</b> The &#8220;sons of God&#8221; in the OT is generally taken to refer to angels. They are not actually &#8220;sons&#8221; of <i>Elohim</i>; the idiom is a poetic way of describing their nature and relationship to God. The phrase indicates their supernatural nature, and their submission to God as the sovereign Lord. It may be classified as a genitive that expresses how individuals belong to a certain class or type, i.e., the supernatural (GKC 418 §128.<i>v</i>). In the pagan literature, especially of Ugarit, &#8220;the sons of God&#8221; refers to the lesser gods or deities of the pantheon. See H. W. Robinson, &#8220;The Council of Yahweh,&#8221; <i>JTS</i> 45 (1943): 151-57; G. Cooke, &#8220;The Sons of (the) God(s),&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 76 (1964): 22-47; M.

<a name="136"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=36><b>sn</b> The word means &#8220;adversary&#8221; or with the article &#8220;the adversary&#8221; &#8211; here the superhuman adversary or Satan. The word with the article means that the meaning of the word should receive prominence. A denominative verb meaning &#8220;to act as adversary&#8221; occurs. Satan is the great accuser of the saints (see Zech 3 where &#8220;Satan was standing there to &#8216;satanize&#8217; Joshua the priest&#8221;; and see Rev 12 which identifies him with the Serpent in Genesis). He came among the angels at this time because he is one of them and has access among them. Even though fallen, Satan has yet to be cast down completely (see Rev 12).</p>
<a name="137"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=37><b>tn</b> The imperfect may be classified as progressive imperfect; it indicates action that although just completed is regarded as still lasting into the present (GKC 316 §107.<i>h</i>).</p>

In contrast to that narrative report about Job, the emphasis here is on Job&#8217;s present character, and so the participle form is translated here asa gnomic or characteristic present (&#8220;turns&#8221;). It modifies &#8220;man&#8221; as one who is turning from evil.</p>
<a name="144"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=44><b>tn</b> The Hebrew form has the interrogative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">he</font>) on the adverb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khinnam</font>, &#8220;gratis&#8221;), a derivative either of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khanan</font>, &#8220;to be gracious, show favor&#8221;), or its related noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khen</font>, &#8220;grace, favor&#8221;). The adverb has the sense of &#8220;free; gratis; gratuitously; for nothing; for no reason&#8221; (see BDB 336 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font>). The idea is that Satan does not disagree that Job is pious, but that Job is loyal to God because of what he receives from God. He will test the sincerity of Job.</p>
<a name="145"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=45><b>tn</b> The use of the independent personal pronoun here emphasizes the subject of the verb: &#8220;Have <i>you</i> not put up a hedge.&#8221;</p>

I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;&#1456;</font>). The original idea seems to have been to surround with a wall of thorns for the purpose of protection (E.

<a name="152"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=52><b>sn</b> The formula used in the expression is the oath formula: &#8220;if not to your face he will curse you&#8221; meaning &#8220;he will surely curse you to your face.&#8221; Satan is so sure that the piety is insincere that he can use an oath formula.</p>

The verb is feminine because the name is a place name. The Sabeans were a tribe from the Arabian peninsula. They were traders mostly (6:19). The raid came from the south, suggesting that this band of Sabeans were near Edom. The time of the attack seems to be winter since the oxen were plowing.</p>

The word &#8220;messenger&#8221; has been supplied in the translation in vv. 16, 17, and 18 for clarity and for stylistic reasons.</p>

The LXX simply has &#8220;fire.&#8221; The first blow came from enemies; the second from heaven, which might have confused Job more as to the cause of his troubles. The use of the divine epithet could also be an indication of the superlative degree; see D. W.

<a name="180"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">80</span><note=80><b>sn</b> It was the custom to tear the robe in a time of mourning, to indicate that the heart was torn (Joel 2:13). The &#8220;garment, mantel&#8221; here is the outer garment frequently worn over the basic tunic. See further D. R. Ap-Thomas, &#8220;Notes on Some Terms Relating to Prayer,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 6 (1956): 220-24.</p>
<a name="181"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">81</span><note=81><b>sn</b> In mourning one normally put off every adornment that enhanced or embellished the person, including that which nature provided (Jer 7:29; Mic 1:16).</p>

But the word essentially means &#8220;to bow down to the ground.&#8221; Here &#8220;worship&#8221; (although employed by several English translations, cf. KJV, NASB, NIV, NRSV, CEV) conveys more than what is taking place &#8211; although Job&#8217;s response is certainly worshipful. See G. I.

<a name="183"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">83</span><note=83><b>tn</b> The adjective &#8220;naked&#8221; is functioning here as an adverbial accusative of state, explicative of the state of the subject. While it does include the literal sense of nakedness at birth, Job is also using it symbolically to mean &#8220;without possessions.&#8221;</p>
<a name="184"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">84</span><note=84><b>sn</b> While the first half of the couplet is to be taken literally as referring to his coming into this life, this second part must be interpreted only generally to refer to his departure from this life. It is parallel to 1 Tim 6:7, &#8220;For we have brought nothing into this world and so we cannot take a single thing out either.&#8221; </p>
<a name="185"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">85</span><note=85><b>tn</b> The two verbs are simple perfects. (1) They can be given the nuance of gnomic imperfect, expressing what the sovereign God always does. This is the approach taken in the present translation. Alternatively (2) they could be referring specifically to Job&#8217;s own experience: &#8220;Yahweh gave [definite past, referring to his coming into this good life] and Yahweh has taken away&#8221; [present perfect, referring to his great losses]. Many English versions follow the second alternative.</p>
<a name="186"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">86</span><note=86><b>sn</b> Some commentators are troubled by the appearance of the word &#8220;Yahweh&#8221; on the lips of Job, assuming that the narrator inserted his own name for God into the story-telling. Such thinking is based on the assumption that Yahweh was only a national god of Israel, unknown to anyone else in the ancient world. But here is a clear indication that a non-Israelite, Job, knew and believed in Yahweh.</p>
<a name="187"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">87</span><note=87><b>tn</b> The last clause is difficult to translate. It simply reads, &#8220;and he did not give unseemliness to God.&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tiflah</font>) means &#8220;unsavoriness&#8221; or &#8220;unseemliness&#8221; in a moral sense. The sense is that Job did not charge God with any moral impropriety in his dealings with him. God did nothing worthless or tasteless. The ancient versions saw the word connected with &#8220;foolishness&#8221; or &#8220;stupidity&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1508;&#1461;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tafel</font>, &#8220;to be tasteless&#8221;).
