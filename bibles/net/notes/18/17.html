<A NAME="171"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1203><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khaval</font>, &#8220;to act badly&#8221;) in the Piel means &#8220;to ruin.&#8221; The Pual translation with &#8220;my spirit&#8221; as the subject means &#8220;broken&#8221; in the sense of finished (not in the sense of humbled as in Ps 51).</p>
<A NAME="172"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1204><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">za</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aq</font>, equivalent of Aramaic <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1511;</font> [<font face="Scholar">da</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aq</font>]) means &#8220;to be extinguished.&#8221; It only occurs here in the Hebrew.</p>
<A NAME="173"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1205><b>tn</b> The plural &#8220;graves&#8221; could be simply an intensification, a plural of extension (see GKC 397 §124.<i>c</i>), or a reference to the graveyard. Coverdale had: &#8220;I am harde at deathes dore.&#8221; The Hebrew expression simply reads &#8220;graves for me.&#8221; It probably means that graves await him.</p>
<A NAME="174"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1206><b>tn</b> The noun is the abstract noun, &#8220;mockery.&#8221; It indicates that he is the object of derision. But many commentators either change the word to &#8220;mockers&#8221; (Tur-Sinai, NEB), or argue that the form in the text is a form of the participle (Gordis).</p>
<A NAME="175"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1207><b>tn</b> E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 243) interprets the preposition to mean &#8220;aimed at me.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="176"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1208><b>tn</b> The meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hammÿrotam</font>) is unclear, and the versions offer no help. If the MT is correct, it would probably be connected to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">marah</font>, &#8220;to be rebellious&#8221;) and the derived form something like &#8220;hostility; provocation.&#8221; But some commentators suggest it should be related to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;&#1465;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">marorot</font>, &#8220;bitter things&#8221;). Others have changed both the noun and the verb to obtain something like &#8220;My eye is weary of their contentiousness&#8221; (Holscher), or mine eyes are wearied by your stream of peevish complaints&#8221; (G. R. Driver, &#8220;Problems in the Hebrew text of Job,&#8221; VTSup 3 [1955]: 78). There is no alternative suggestion that is compelling.</p>
<A NAME="177"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1209><b>tn</b> The MT has two imperatives: &#8220;Lay down, pledge me, with me.&#8221; Most commentators think that the second imperative should be a noun, and take it to say, &#8220;Lay my pledge with/beside you.&#8221; A. B. Davidson (<i>Job</i>, 126) suggests that the first verb means &#8220;give a pledge,&#8221; and so the two similar verbs would be emphatic: &#8220;Give a pledge, be my surety.&#8221; Other than such a change (which would involve changing the vowels) one would have to interpret similarly by seeing the imperatives as a kind of hendiadys, with the main emphasis being on the second imperative, &#8220;make a pledge.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="178"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1210><b>sn</b> The idiom is &#8220;to strike the hand.&#8221; Here the wording is a little different, &#8220;Who is he that will strike himself into my hand?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="179"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1211><b>tn</b> This half-verse gives the reason for the next half-verse.</p>
<A NAME="1710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1212><b>sn</b> The pronoun <i>their</i> refers to Job&#8217;s friends. They have not pledged security for him because God has hidden or sealed off their understanding.</p>
<A NAME="1711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1213><b>tn</b> The object &#8220;them&#8221; is supplied. This is the simplest reading of the line, taking the verb is an active Polel. Some suggest that the subject is &#8220;their hand&#8221; and the verb is to be translated &#8220;is not raised.&#8221; This would carry through the thought of the last verse, but it is not necessary to the point. </p>
<A NAME="1712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1214><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for a portion.&#8221; This verse is rather obscure. The words are not that difficult, but the sense of them in this context is. Some take the idea to mean &#8220;he denounces his friends for a portion,&#8221; and others have a totally different idea of &#8220;he invites his friends to share with him.&#8221; The former fits the context better, indicating that Job&#8217;s friends speak out against him for some personal gain. The second half of the verse then promises that his children will suffer loss for this attempt at gain. The line is surely proverbial. A number of other interpretations can be found in the commentaries. </p>
<A NAME="1713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1215><b>tn</b> The verb is the third person, and so God is likely the subject. The LXX has &#8220;you have made me.&#8221; So most commentators clarify the verb in some such way. However, without an expressed subject it can also be taken as a passive.</p>
<A NAME="1714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1216><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;byword&#8221; is related to the word translated &#8220;proverb&#8221; in the Bible (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mashal</font>). Job&#8217;s case is so well known that he is synonymous with afflictions and with abuse by people.</p>
<A NAME="1715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1217><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1465;&#1508;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tofet</font>) is a <i>hapax legomenon</i>. The expression is &#8220;and a spitting in/to the face I have become,&#8221; i.e., &#8220;I have become one in whose face people spit.&#8221; Various suggestions have been made, including a link to Tophet, but they are weak. The verse as it exists in the MT is fine, and fits the context well.</p>
<A NAME="1716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1218><b>tn</b> See the usage of this verb in Gen 27:1 and Deut 34:7. Usually it is age that causes the failing eyesight, but here it is the grief.</p>
<A NAME="1717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1219><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1510;&#1467;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿtsurim</font>), here with a suffix, occurs only here in the Bible. The word is related to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatsar</font>, &#8220;to form, fashion&#8221;). And so Targum Job has &#8220;my forms,&#8221; and the Vulgate &#8220;my members.&#8221; The Syriac uses &#8220;thoughts&#8221; to reflect <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1461;&#1510;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yetser</font>). Some have followed this to interpret, &#8220;all my thoughts have dissolved into shadows.&#8221; But the parallel with &#8220;eye&#8221; would suggest &#8220;form.&#8221; The plural &#8220;my forms, all of them&#8221; would refer to the whole body.</p>
<A NAME="1718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1220><b>tn</b> This verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shamam</font>, &#8220;appalled&#8221;) is the one found in Isa 52:14, translated there &#8220;astonished.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1221><b>tn</b> The verb means &#8220;to rouse oneself to excitement.&#8221; It naturally means &#8220;to be agitated; to be stirred up.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1222><b>tn</b> The last two words are the imperfect verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1465;&#1505;&#1460;&#1497;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yosif</font>) which means &#8220;he adds,&#8221; and the abstract noun &#8220;energy, strength.&#8221; This noun is not found elsewhere; its Piel verb occurs in Job 4:4 and 16:5. &#8220;he increases strength.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1721"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1223><b>tn</b> The form says &#8220;all of them.&#8221; Several editors would change it to &#8220;all of you,&#8221; but the lack of concord is not surprising; the vocative elsewhere uses the third person (see Mic 1:2; see also GKC 441 §135.<i>r</i>).</p>
<A NAME="1722"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1224><b>tn</b> The first verb, the jussive, means &#8220;to return&#8221;; the second verb, the imperative, means &#8220;to come.&#8221; The two could be taken as a hendiadys, the first verb becoming adverbial: &#8220;to come again.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1225><b>tn</b> Instead of the exact correspondence between coordinate verbs, other combinations occur &#8211; here we have a jussive and an imperative (see GKC 386 §120.<i>e</i>).</p>
<A NAME="1724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1226><b>tn</b> This term usually means &#8220;plans; devices&#8221; in a bad sense, although it can be used of God&#8217;s plans (see e.g., Zech 8:15).</p>
<A NAME="1725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1227><b>tn</b> Although not in the Hebrew text, &#8220;even&#8221; is supplied in the translation, because this line is in apposition to the preceding.</p>
<A NAME="1726"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1228><b>tn</b> This word has been linked to the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yarash</font>, &#8220;to inherit&#8221;) yielding a meaning &#8220;the possessions of my heart.&#8221; But it is actually to be connected to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arash</font>, &#8220;to desire&#8221;) cognate to the Akkadian <i>eresu</i>, &#8220;desire.&#8221; The LXX has &#8220;limbs,&#8221; which may come from an Aramaic word for &#8220;ropes.&#8221; An emendation based on the LXX would be risky.</p>
<A NAME="1727"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1229><b>tn</b> The verse simply has the plural, &#8220;they change.&#8221; But since this verse seems to be a description of his friends, a clarification of the referent in the translation is helpful.</p>
<A NAME="1728"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1230><b>tn</b> The same verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sim</font>, &#8220;set&#8221;) is used this way in Isa 5:20: &#8220;&#8230;who change darkness into light.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1231><b>tn</b> The rest of the verse makes better sense if it is interpreted as what his friends say.</p>
<A NAME="1730"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1232><b>tn</b> This expression is open to alternative translations: (1) It could mean that they say in the face of darkness, &#8220;Light is near.&#8221; (2) It could also mean &#8220;The light is near the darkness&#8221; or &#8220;The light is nearer than the darkness.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1731"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1233><b>tn</b> The clause begins with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>) which here has more of the sense of &#8220;since.&#8221; E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 253) takes a rather rare use of the word to get &#8220;Can I hope again&#8221; (see also GKC 475 §150.<i>f</i> for the caveat).</p>
<A NAME="1732"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1234><b>tn</b> This is understood because the conditional clauses seem to run to the apodosis in v. 15.</p>
<A NAME="1733"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1235><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shakhat</font>)<i> </i>may be the word &#8220;corruption&#8221; from a root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shakhat</font>, &#8220;to destroy&#8221;) or a word &#8220;pit&#8221; from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shuakh</font>, &#8220;to sink down&#8221;). The same problem surfaces in Ps 16:10, where it is parallel to &#8220;Sheol.&#8221; E. F. Sutcliffe, <i>The Old Testament and the Future Life</i>, 76ff., defends the meaning &#8220;corruption.&#8221; But many commentators here take it to mean &#8220;the grave&#8221; in harmony with &#8220;Sheol.&#8221; But in this verse &#8220;worms&#8221; would suggest &#8220;corruption&#8221; is better.</p>
<A NAME="1734"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1236><b>tn</b> The adverb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1508;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">efo</font>, &#8220;then&#8221;) plays an enclitic role here (see Job 4:7).</p>
<A NAME="1735"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1237><b>tn</b> The repetition of &#8220;my hope&#8221; in the verse has thrown the versions off, and their translations have led commentators also to change the second one to something like &#8220;goodness,&#8221; on the assumption that a word cannot be repeated in the same verse. The word actually carries two different senses here. The first would be the basic meaning &#8220;hope,&#8221; but the second a metonymy of cause, namely, what hope produces, what will be seen.</p>
<A NAME="1736"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1238><b>sn</b> It is natural to assume that this verse continues the interrogative clause of the preceding verse.</p>
<A NAME="1737"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1239><b>tn</b> The plural form of the verb probably refers to the two words, or the two senses of the word in the preceding verse. Hope and what it produces will perish with Job.</p>
<A NAME="1738"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1240><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">baddim</font>) describes the &#8220;bars&#8221; or &#8220;bolts&#8221; of Sheol, referring (by synecdoche) to the &#8220;gates of Sheol.&#8221; The LXX has &#8220;with me to Sheol,&#8221; and many adopt that as &#8220;by my side.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1739"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1241><b>tn</b> The conjunction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>) confirms the interrogative interpretation.</p>
<A NAME="1740"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1242><b>tn</b> The translation follows the LXX and the Syriac versions with the change of vocalization in the MT. The MT has the noun &#8220;rest,&#8221; yielding, &#8220;will our rest be together in the dust?&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhat</font>) in Aramaic means &#8220;to go down; to descend.&#8221; If that is the preferred reading &#8211; and it almost is universally accepted here &#8211; then it would be spelled <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1461;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nekhat</font>). In either case the point of the verse is clearly describing death and going to the grave.</p>
