<A NAME="311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1874><b>tn</b> The idea of cutting a covenant for something may suggest a covenant that is imposed, except that this construction elsewhere argues against it (see 2 Chr 29:10).</p>
<A NAME="312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1875><b>tn</b> This half-verse is the effect of the covenant. The interrogative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mah</font>) may have the force of the negative, and so be translated &#8220;not to pay attention.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1876><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lot of Shaddai,&#8221; which must mean &#8220;the lot from Shaddai,&#8221; a genitive of source.</p>
<A NAME="314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1877><b>tn</b> The normal approach is to take this as the protasis, and then have it resumed in v. 7 after a parenthesis in v. 6. But some take v. 6 as the apodosis and a new protasis in v. 7.</p>
<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1878><b>tn</b> The &#8220;if&#8221; is understood by the use of the consecutive verb.</p>
<A NAME="316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1879><b>sn</b> The verbs &#8220;walk&#8221; and &#8220;hasten&#8221; (referring in the verse to the foot) are used metaphorically for the manner of life Job lived.</p>
<A NAME="317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1880><b>tn</b> &#8220;God&#8221; is undoubtedly the understood subject of this jussive. However, &#8220;him&#8221; is retained in the translation at this point to avoid redundancy since &#8220;God&#8221; occurs in the second half of the verse.</p>
<A NAME="318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1881><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1462;&#1491;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsedeq</font>, &#8220;righteousness&#8221;) forms a fitting genitive for the scales used in trade or justice. The &#8220;scales of righteousness&#8221; are scales that conform to the standard (see the illustration in Deut 25:13-15). They must be honest scales to make just decisions.</p>
<A NAME="319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1882><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1461;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿyeda</font>&#8217;, &#8220;and [then] he [God] will know&#8221;). The verb could also be subordinated to the preceding jussive, &#8220;so that God may know.&#8221; The meaning of &#8220;to know&#8221; here has more the idea of &#8220;to come to know; to discover.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1883><b>sn</b> The meaning is &#8220;been led by what my eyes see.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1884><b>tc</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1467;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mu</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">um</font>) could be taken in one of two ways. One reading is to represent <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mum</font>, &#8220;blemish,&#8221; see the Masorah); the other is for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">umah</font>, &#8220;anything,&#8221; see the versions and the <i>Kethib</i>). Either reading fits the passage.</p>
<A NAME="3112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1885><b>tn</b> The cohortative is often found in the apodosis of the conditional clause (see GKC 320 §108.<i>f</i>).</p>
<A NAME="3113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1886><b>tn</b> The word means &#8220;what sprouts up&#8221; (from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font> [<font face="Scholar">yatsa</font>&#8217;] with the sense of &#8220;sprout forth&#8221;). It could refer metaphorically to children (and so Kissane and Pope), as well as in its literal sense of crops. The latter fits here perfectly.</p>
<A NAME="3114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1887><b>tn</b> Gordis notes that the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1514;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">petakh</font>, &#8220;door&#8221;) has sexual connotations in rabbinic literature, based on Prov 7:6ff. (see <i>b. Ketubbot </i>9b). See also the use in Song 4:12 using a synonym.</p>
<A NAME="3115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1888><b>tn</b> Targum Job interpreted the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">takhan</font>, &#8220;grind&#8221;) in a sexual sense, and this has influenced other versions and commentaries. But the literal sense fits well in this line. The idea is that she would be a slave for someone else. The second line of the verse then might build on this to explain what kind of a slave &#8211; a concubine (see A. B. Davidson, <i>Job</i>, 215).</p>
<A NAME="3116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1889><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;bow down over her,&#8221; an idiom for sexual relations.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The idea is that if Job were guilty of adultery it would be an offense against the other woman&#8217;s husband, and so by talionic justice another man&#8217;s adultery with Job&#8217;s wife would be an offense against him. He is not wishing something on his wife; rather, he is simply looking at what would be offenses in kind.</p>
<A NAME="3117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1890><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for that [would be].&#8221; In order to clarify the referent of &#8220;that,&#8221; which refers to v. 9 rather than v. 10, the words &#8220;I have committed&#8221; have been supplied in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="3118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1891><b>tn</b> The word for &#8220;shameful act&#8221; is used especially for sexual offenses (cf. Lev 18:27).</p>
<A NAME="3119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1892><b>tc</b> Some have deleted this verse as being short and irrelevant, not to mention problematic. But the difficulties are not insurmountable, and there is no reason to delete it. There is a <i>Kethib</i>-<i>Qere</i> reading in each half verse; in the first the <i>Kethib</i> is masculine for the subject but the <i>Qere</i> is feminine going with &#8220;shameless deed.&#8221; In the second colon the <i>Kethib</i> is the feminine agreeing with the preceding noun, but the <i>Qere</i> is masculine agreeing with &#8220;iniquity.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503; &#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avon pÿlilim</font>) means &#8220;an iniquity of the judges.&#8221; The first word is not spelled as a construct noun, and so this has led some to treat the second word as an adjective (with enclitic <font face="Scholar">mem</font> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1501;</font>]). The sense is similar in either case, for the adjective occurs in Job 31:28 meaning &#8220;calling for judgment&#8221; (See GKC 427 §131.<i>s</i>).</p>
<A NAME="3120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1893><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to Abaddon.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1894><b>tn</b> The verb means &#8220;to root out,&#8221; but this does not fit the parallelism with fire. Wright changed two letters and the vowels in the verb to get the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsaraf</font>, &#8220;to burn&#8221;). The NRSV has &#8220;burn to the root.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1895><b>tn</b> This construction is an adverbial clause using the temporal preposition, the infinitive from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">riv</font>, &#8220;contend&#8221;), and the suffix which is the subjective genitive.</p>
<A NAME="3123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1896><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;arises.&#8221; The LXX reads &#8220;takes vengeance,&#8221; an interpretation that is somewhat correct but unnecessary. The verb &#8220;to rise&#8221; would mean &#8220;to confront in judgment.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1897><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">paqad</font>) means &#8220;to visit,&#8221; but with God as the subject it means any divine intervention for blessing or cursing, anything God does that changes a person&#8217;s life. Here it is &#8220;visit to judge.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1898><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;him,&#8221; but the plural pronoun has been used in the translation to indicate that the referent is the servants mentioned in v. 13 (since the previous &#8220;him&#8221; in v. 14 refers to God).</p>
<A NAME="3126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1899><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;kept the poor from [their] desire.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1900><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and an orphan did not eat from it.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1901><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he grew up with me.&#8221; Several commentators have decided to change the pronoun to &#8220;I,&#8221; and make it causative.</p>
<A NAME="3129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1902><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;from my mother&#8217;s womb&#8221; is obviously hyperbolic. It is a way of saying &#8220;all his life.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3130"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1903><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I guided her,&#8221; referring to the widow mentioned in v. 16.</p>
<A NAME="3131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1904><b>tn</b> The MT has simply &#8220;if his loins did not bless me.&#8221; In the conditional clause this is another protasis. It means, &#8220;if I saw someone dying and if he did not thank me for clothing them.&#8221; It is Job&#8217;s way of saying that whenever he saw a need he met it, and he received his share of thanks &#8211; which prove his kindness. G. R. Driver has it &#8220;without his loins having blessed me,&#8221; taking &#8220;If&#8230;not&#8221; as an Aramaism, meaning &#8220;except&#8221; (<i>AJSL</i> 52 [1935/36]: 164f.).</p>
<A NAME="3132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1905><b>tn</b> This clause is interpreted here as a subordinate clause to the first half of the verse. It could also be a separate clause: &#8220;was he not warmed&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1906><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;raised my hand&#8221; refers to a threatening manner or gesture in the court rather than a threat of physical violence in the street. Thus the words &#8220;to vote&#8221; are supplied in the translation to indicate the setting.</p>
<A NAME="3134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1907><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;gate,&#8221; referring to the city gate where judicial decisions were rendered in the culture of the time. The translation uses the word &#8220;court&#8221; to indicate this to the modern reader, who might not associate a city gate complex with judicial functions.</p>
<A NAME="3135"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1908><b>sn</b> Here is the apodosis, the imprecation Job pronounces on himself if he has done any of these things just listed.</p>
<A NAME="3136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1909><b>tn</b> The point is that if he has raised his arm against the oppressed it should be ripped off at the joint. The MT has &#8220;let fall my shoulder [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1514;&#1461;&#1508;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kÿtefi</font>] from the nape of the neck [or shoulder blade (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mishikhmah</font>)].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1910><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1504;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qaneh</font>) is &#8220;reed; shaft; beam,&#8221; and here &#8220;shoulder joint.&#8221; All the commentaries try to explain how &#8220;reed&#8221; became &#8220;socket; joint.&#8221; This is the only place that it is used in such a sense. Whatever the exact explanation &#8211; and there seems to be no convincing view &#8211; the point of the verse is nonetheless clear.</p>
<A NAME="3138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1911><b>tc</b> The LXX has &#8220;For the terror of God restrained me.&#8221; Several commentators changed it to &#8220;came upon me.&#8221; Driver had &#8220;The fear of God was burdensome.&#8221; I. Eitan suggested &#8220;The terror of God was mighty upon me&#8221; (&#8220;Two unknown verbs: etymological studies,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 42 [1923]: 22-28). But the MT makes clear sense as it stands.</p>
<A NAME="3139"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1912><b>tn</b> The form is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">umissÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eto</font>); the preposition is causal. The form, from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nasa</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to raise; to lift high&#8221;), refers to God&#8217;s exalted person, his majesty (see Job 13:11).</p>
<A NAME="3140"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1913><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;light&#8221;; but parallel to the moon it is the sun. This section speaks of false worship of the sun and the moon.</p>
<A NAME="3141"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1914><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and my hand kissed my mouth.&#8221; The idea should be that of &#8220;my mouth kissed my hand.&#8221; H. H. Rowley suggests that the hand was important in waving or throwing the kisses of homage to the sun and the moon, and so it receives the focus. This is the only place in the OT that refers to such a custom. Outside the Bible it was known, however.</p>
<A NAME="3142"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1915><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;it.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3143"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1916><b>tn</b> See v. 11 for the construction. In Deut 17:2ff. false worship of heavenly bodies is a capital offense. In this passage, Job is talking about just a momentary glance at the sun or moon and the brief lapse into a pagan thought. But it is still sin.</p>
<A NAME="3144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1917><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kakhash</font>) in the Piel means &#8220;to deny.&#8221; The root meaning is &#8220;to deceive; to disappoint; to grow lean.&#8221; Here it means that he would have failed or proven unfaithful because his act would have been a denial of God.</p>
<A NAME="3145"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1918><b>tn</b> The problem with taking this as &#8220;if,&#8221; introducing a conditional clause, is finding the apodosis, if there is one. It may be that the apodosis is understood, or summed up at the end. This is the view taken here. But R. Gordis (<i>Job</i>, 352) wishes to take this word as the indication of the interrogative, forming the rhetorical question to affirm he has never done this. However, in that case the parenthetical verses inserted become redundant.</p>
<A NAME="3146"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1919><b>sn</b> The law required people to help their enemies if they could (Exod 23:4; also Prov 20:22). But often in the difficulties that ensued, they did exult over their enemies&#8217; misfortune (Pss 54:7; 59:10 [11], etc.). But Job lived on a level of purity that few ever reach. Duhm said, &#8220;If chapter 31 is the crown of all ethical developments of the O.T., verse 29 is the jewel in that crown.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3147"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1920><b>tn</b> The Hitpael of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ur</font>) has the idea of &#8220;exult.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3148"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1921><b>tn</b> The word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;, &#8220;evil&#8221;) in the sense of anything that harms, interrupts, or destroys life.</p>
<A NAME="3149"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1922><b>tn</b> This verse would then be a parenthesis in which he stops to claim his innocence.</p>
<A NAME="3150"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1923><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I have not given my palate.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3151"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1924><b>tn</b> The infinitive construct with the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lamed</font>) preposition (&#8220;by asking&#8221;) serves in an epexegetical capacity here, explaining the verb of the first colon (&#8220;permitted&#8230;to sin&#8221;). To seek a curse on anyone would be a sin.</p>
<A NAME="3152"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=1925><b>tn</b> Now Job picks up the series of clauses serving as the protasis.</p>
<A NAME="3153"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1926><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the men of my tent.&#8221; In context this refers to members of Job&#8217;s household.</p>
<A NAME="3154"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1927><b>sn</b> The line is difficult to sort out. Job is saying it is sinful &#8220;if his men have never said, &#8216;O that there was one who has not been satisfied from his food.&#8217;&#8221; If they never said that, it would mean there were people out there who needed to be satisfied with his food.</p>
<A NAME="3155"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=1928><b>tn</b> The optative is again expressed with &#8220;who will give?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3156"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=1929><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his&#8221;; the referent (Job) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3157"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=1930><b>tn</b> This verse forms another parenthesis. Job stops almost at every point now in the conditional clauses to affirm his purity and integrity.</p>
<A NAME="3158"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=1931><b>tn</b> The word in the MT, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1465;&#1512;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">orakh</font>, &#8220;way&#8221;), is a contraction from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1465;&#1512;&#1461;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">oreakh</font>, &#8220;wayfarer&#8221;); thus, &#8220;traveler.&#8221; The same parallelism is found in Jer 14:8. The reading here &#8220;on/to the road&#8221; is meaningless otherwise.</p>
<A NAME="3159"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=1932><b>tn</b> Now the protasis continues again.</p>
<A NAME="3160"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=1933><b>sn</b> Some commentators suggest taking the meaning here to be &#8220;as Adam,&#8221; referring to the Paradise story of the sin and denial.</p>
<A NAME="3161"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=1934><b>tn</b> The infinitive is epexegetical, explaining the first line.</p>
<A NAME="3162"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=1935><b>tn</b> The MT has &#8220;in my bosom.&#8221; This is the only place in the OT where this word is found. But its meaning is well attested from Aramaic.</p>
<A NAME="3163"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=1936><b>tn</b> Here too the verb will be the customary imperfect &#8211; it explains what he continually did in past time.</p>
<A NAME="3164"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=1937><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the great multitude.&#8221; But some commentators take <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rabbah</font>) adverbially: &#8220;greatly&#8221; (see RSV). </p>
<A NAME="3165"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=1938><b>sn</b> There is no clear apodosis for all these clauses. Some commentators transfer the verses around to make them fit the constructions. But the better view is that there is no apodosis &#8211; that Job broke off here, feeling it was useless to go further. Now he will address God and not men. But in vv. 38-40b he does return to a self-imprecation. However, there is not sufficient reason to start rearranging all the verses.</p>
<A NAME="3166"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=1939><b>tn</b> The optative is again introduced with &#8220;who will give to me hearing me? &#8211; O that someone would listen to me!&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3167"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=1940><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;here is my &#8216;<font face="Scholar">tav</font>&#8217;&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1461;&#1503; &#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hen tavi</font>). The letter <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tav</font>) is the last letter of the alphabet in Hebrew. In paleo-Hebrew the letter was in the form of a cross or an &#8220;X,&#8221; and so used for one making a mark or a signature. In this case Job has signed his statement and delivered it to the court &#8211; but he has yet to be charged. Kissane thought that this being the last letter of the alphabet, Job was saying, &#8220;This is my last word.&#8221; Others take the word to mean &#8220;desire&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;this is my desire, that God would answer me&#8221; (see E. F. Sutcliffe, &#8220;Notes on Job, textual and exegetical,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 30 [1949]: 71-72; G. R. Driver, <i>AJSL</i> 3 [1935/36]: 166; P. P. Saydon, &#8220;Philological and Textual Notes to the Maltese Translation of the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 23 [1961]: 252). R. Gordis (<i>Job</i>, 355) also argues strongly for this view.</p>

<A NAME="3169"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=1942><b>tn</b> The last line is very difficult; it simply says, &#8220;a scroll [that] my [legal] adversary had written.&#8221; The simplest way to handle this is to see it as a continuation of the optative (RSV).</p>
<A NAME="3170"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=1943><b>tn</b> The clause begins with the positive oath formula, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im-lo</font>&#8217;). </p>
<A NAME="3171"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=1944><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;proudly&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but is implied (note the following line).</p>
<A NAME="3172"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=1945><b>tn</b> This verb is only found in Prov 6:21. But E.

<A NAME="3173"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=1946><b>sn</b> Many commentators place vv. 38-40b at the end of v. 34, so that there is no return to these conditional clauses after his final appeal.</p>
<A NAME="3174"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=1947><b>sn</b> Some commentators have suggested that the meaning behind this is that Job might not have kept the year of release (Deut 15:1), and the law against mixing seed (Lev 19:19). But the context will make clear that the case considered is obtaining the land without paying for it and causing the death of its lawful owner (see H. H. Rowley, <i>Job</i> [NCBC], 206). Similar to this would be the case of Naboth&#8217;s vineyard.</p>

The Hebrew verb means &#8220;to breathe,&#8221; but the form is Hiphil. This verb in that stem could mean something of a contemptuous gesture, like &#8220;sniff&#8221; in Mal 1:13. But with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>) in Job 11:20 it means &#8220;to cause death,&#8221; i.e., &#8220;to cause to breathe out; to expire.&#8221;<i> </i>This is likely the meaning here, although it is possible that it only meant &#8220;to cause suffering&#8221; to the people.</p>
<A NAME="3177"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=1950><b>tn</b> There is some debate over the meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1462;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aleyha</font>), usually translated &#8220;its owners.&#8221; Dahood, following others (although without their emendations), thought it referred to &#8220;laborers&#8221; (see M.
