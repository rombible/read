<A NAME="151"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1069><b>sn</b> In the first round of speeches, Eliphaz had emphasized the moral perfection of God, Bildad his unwavering justice, and Zophar his omniscience. Since this did not bring the expected response from Job, the friends see him as a menace to true religion, and so they intensify their approach. Eliphaz, as dignified as ever, rebukes Job for his arrogance and warns about the judgment the wicked bring on themselves. The speech of Eliphaz falls into three parts: the rebuke of Job for his irreverence (2-6); the analysis of Job&#8217;s presumption about wisdom (7-16), and his warning about the fate of the wicked (17-35).</p>
<A NAME="152"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1070><b>tn</b> The Hebrew is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1470;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">da</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">at-ruakh</font>). This means knowledge without any content, vain knowledge.</p>
<A NAME="153"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1071><b>tn</b> The image is rather graphic. It is saying that he puffs himself up with the wind and then brings out of his mouth blasts of this wind.</p>
<A NAME="154"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1072><b>tn</b> The word for &#8220;east wind,&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qadim</font>), is parallel to &#8220;spirit/wind&#8221; also in Hos 12:2. The east wind is maleficent, but here in the parallelism it is so much hot air.</p>
<A NAME="155"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1073><b>tn</b> The infinitive absolute in this place is functioning either as an explanatory adverb or as a finite verb.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Eliphaz draws on Job&#8217;s claim with this word (cf. Job 13:3), but will declare it hollow.</p>
<A NAME="156"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1074><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sakhan</font>)<i> </i>means &#8220;to be useful, profitable.&#8221; It is found 5 times in the book with this meaning. The Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) has the same connotation. E. <font face="Scholar">LipinÃski</font> offers a new meaning on a second root, &#8220;incur danger&#8221; or &#8220;run risks&#8221; with words, but this does not fit the parallelism (<i>FO</i> 21 [1980]: 65-82).</p>
<A NAME="157"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1075><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">parar</font>) in the Hiphil means &#8220;to annul; to frustrate; to destroy; to break,&#8221; and this fits the line quite well. The NEB reflects G. R. Driver&#8217;s suggestion of an Arabic cognate meaning &#8220;to expel; to banish&#8221; (&#8220;Problems in the Hebrew text of Job,&#8221; VTSup 3 [1955]: 77).</p>
<A NAME="158"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1076><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fear,&#8221; &#8220;reverence.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="159"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1077><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gara</font>&#8217;) means &#8220;to diminish,&#8221; regard as insignificant, occasionally with the sense of &#8220;pull down&#8221; (Deut 4:2; 13:1). It is here that Eliphaz is portraying Job as a menace to the religion of society because they dissuade people from seeking God.</p>
<A NAME="1510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1078><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sikhah</font>) is &#8220;complaint; cry; meditation.&#8221; Job would be influencing people to challenge God and not to meditate before or pray to him.</p>
<A NAME="1511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1079><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1507;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">allef</font>) has the meaning of &#8220;to teach; to instruct,&#8221; but it is unlikely that the idea of revealing is intended. If the verb is understood metonymically, then &#8220;to inspire; to prompt&#8221; will be sufficient. Dahood and others find another root, and render the verb &#8220;to increase,&#8221; reversing subject and object: &#8220;your mouth increases your iniquity.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1080><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;tongue.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1081><b>tn</b> The word means &#8220;shrewd; crafty; cunning&#8221; (see Gen 3:1). Job uses clever speech that is misleading and destructive.</p>
<A NAME="1514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1082><b>tn</b> The Hiphil of this root means &#8220;declare wicked, guilty&#8221; (a declarative Hiphil), and so &#8220;condemns.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1083><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anah</font>) with the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lamed</font>) preposition following it means &#8220;to testify against.&#8221; For Eliphaz, it is enough to listen to Job to condemn him.</p>
<A NAME="1516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1084><b>tn</b> The meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sod</font>) is &#8220;confidence.&#8221; In the context the implication is &#8220;secret counsel&#8221; of the <sc>Lord God (see Jer 23:18). It is a question of confidence on the part of God, that only wisdom can know (see Prov 8:30,31). Job seemed to them to claim to have access to the mind of God. </p>
<A NAME="1517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1085><b>tn</b> In v. 4 the word meant &#8220;limit&#8221;; here it has a slightly different sense, namely, &#8220;to reserve for oneself.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1086><b>tn</b> The last clause simply has &#8220;and it is not with us.&#8221; It means that one possesses something through knowledge. Note the parallelism of &#8220;know&#8221; and &#8220;with me&#8221; in Ps 50:11. </p>
<A NAME="1519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1087><b>tn</b> The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sav</font>), from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">siv</font>, &#8220;to have white hair&#8221;; 1 Sam 12:2), only occurs elsewhere in the Bible in the Aramaic sections of Ezra. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yashish</font>, &#8220;aged&#8221;) occurred in 12:12. </p>
<A NAME="1520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1088><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;with us.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1089><b>tn</b> The line reads: &#8220;[men] greater than your father [in] days.&#8221; The expression &#8220;in days&#8221; underscores their age &#8211; they were older than Job&#8217;s father, and therefore wiser. </p>
<A NAME="1522"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1090><b>sn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1504;&#1456;&#1495;&#1467;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tankhumot</font>) occurs here and only in Job 21:34. The words of comfort and consolation that they have been offering to Job are here said to be &#8220;of God.&#8221; But Job will call them miserable comforters (16:2).</p>
<A NAME="1523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1091><b>tn</b> The formula &#8220;is it too little for you&#8221; or &#8220;is it too slight a matter for you&#8221; is also found in Isa 7:13 (see GKC 430 §133.<i>c</i>).</p>
<A NAME="1524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1092><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;spoken&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but has been supplied in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="1525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1093><b>tn</b> The interrogative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mah</font>) here has the sense of &#8220;why?&#8221; (see Job 7:21).</p>
<A NAME="1526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1094><b>tn</b> The verb simply means &#8220;to take.&#8221; The RSV has &#8220;carry you away.&#8221; E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 212-13) goes further, saying that it implies being unhinged by passion, to be carried away by the passions beyond good sense (pp. 212-13). Pope and Tur-Sinai suggest that the suffix on the verb is datival, and translate it, &#8220;What has taken from you your mind?&#8221; But the parallelism shows that &#8220;your heart&#8221; and &#8220;your eyes&#8221; are subjects.</p>
<A NAME="1527"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1095><b>tn</b> Here is another word that occurs only here, and in the absence of a completely convincing suggestion, probably should be left as it is. The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">razam</font>, &#8220;wink, flash&#8221;). Targum Job and the Syriac equate it with a verb found in Aramaic and postbiblical Hebrew with the same letters but metathesized &#8211; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1494;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ramaz</font>). It would mean &#8220;to make a sign&#8221; or &#8220;to wink.&#8221; Budde, following the LXX probably, has &#8220;Why are your eyes lofty?&#8221; Others follow an Arabic root meaning &#8220;become weak.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1528"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1096><b>tn</b> The Hebrew is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1462;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rukhekha</font>, &#8220;your spirit&#8221; or &#8220;your breath&#8221;). But the fact that this is turned &#8220;against God,&#8221; means that it must be given a derived meaning, or a meaning that is metonymical. It is used in the Bible in the sense of anger &#8211; what the spirit vents (see Judg 8:3; Prov 16:32; and Job 4:9 with &#8220;blast&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1529"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1097><b>tn</b> The verb is a Hiphil perfect of <i>yasa</i>&#8217;<i>,</i> &#8220;to go out, proceed, issue forth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1530"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1098><b>tn</b> Eliphaz here reiterates the point made in Job 4:18.</p>
<A NAME="1531"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1099><b>sn</b> The question here is whether the reference is to material &#8220;heavens&#8221; (as in Exod 24:10 and Job 25:5), or to heavenly beings. The latter seems preferable in this context. </p>
<A NAME="1532"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1100><b>tn</b> The two descriptions here used are &#8220;abominable,&#8221; meaning &#8220;disgusting&#8221; (a Niphal participle with the value of a Latin participle [see GKC 356-57 §116.<i>e</i>]), and &#8220;corrupt&#8221; (a Niphal<i> </i>participle which occurs only in Pss 14:3 and 53:4), always in a moral sense. On the significance of the first description, see P. Humbert, &#8220;Le substantif <font face="Scholar">toáe&#8222;ba&#8222;</font> et le verbe <font face="Scholar">táb</font> dans l&#8217;Ancien Testament,&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 72 [1960]: 217ff.). On the second word, G. R. Driver suggests from Arabic, &#8220;debauched with luxury, corrupt&#8221; (&#8220;Some Hebrew Words,&#8221; <i>JTS</i> 29 [1927/28]: 390-96).</p>
<A NAME="1533"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1101><b>sn</b> Man commits evil with the same ease and facility as he drinks in water &#8211; freely and in large quantities.</p>
<A NAME="1534"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1102><b>tn</b> The demonstrative pronoun is used here as a nominative, to introduce an independent relative clause (see GKC 447 §138.<i>h</i>).</p>
<A NAME="1535"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1103><b>tn</b> Here the <i>vav </i>(<i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font></i>)<i> apodosis</i> follows with the cohortative (see GKC 458 §143.<i>d</i>).</p>
<A NAME="1536"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1104><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;tradition&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but has been supplied in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="1537"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1105><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;their fathers.&#8221; Some commentators change one letter and follow the reading of the LXX: &#8220;and their fathers have not hidden.&#8221; Pope tries to get the same reading by classifying the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mem</font>) as an enclitic <font face="Scholar">mem</font><i>. </i>The MT on first glance would read &#8220;and did not hide from their fathers.&#8221; Some take the clause &#8220;and they did not hide&#8221; as adverbial and belonging to the first part of the verse: &#8220;what wise men declare, hiding nothing, according to the tradition of their fathers.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1538"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1106><b>sn</b> Eliphaz probably thinks that Edom was the proverbial home of wisdom, and so the reference here would be to his own people. If, as many interpret, the biblical writer is using these accounts to put Yahwistic ideas into the discussion, then the reference would be to Canaan at the time of the fathers. At any rate, the tradition of wisdom to Eliphaz has not been polluted by foreigners, but has retained its pure and moral nature from antiquity.</p>
<A NAME="1539"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1107><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all the days of the wicked, he suffers.&#8221; The word &#8220;all&#8221; is an adverbial accusative of time, stating along with its genitives (&#8220;of the days of a wicked man&#8221;) how long the individual suffers. When the subject is composed of a noun in construct followed by a genitive, the predicate sometimes agrees with the genitive (see GKC 467 §146.<i>a</i>).</p>
<A NAME="1540"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1108><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mitkholel</font>) is a Hitpolel participle from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khil</font>, &#8220;to tremble&#8221;). It carries the idea of &#8220;torment oneself,&#8221; or &#8220;be tormented.&#8221; Some have changed the letter <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khet</font>) for a letter <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">he</font>), and obtained the meaning &#8220;shows himself mad.&#8221; Theodotion has &#8220;is mad.&#8221; Syriac (&#8220;behave arrogantly,&#8221; apparently confusing Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;</font> with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1500;&#1500;</font>; Heidi M. Szpek, <i>Translation Technique in the Peshitta to Job </i>[SBLDS], 277), Symmachus, and Vulgate have &#8220;boasts himself.&#8221; But the reading of the MT is preferable.</p>
<A NAME="1541"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1109><b>tn</b> It is necessary, with Rashi, to understand the relative pronoun before the verb &#8220;they are stored up/reserved.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1542"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1110><b>tn</b> This has been translated with the idea of &#8220;oppressor&#8221; in Job 6:23; 27:13.</p>
<A NAME="1543"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1111><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;fill&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but has been supplied in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="1544"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1112><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1461;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shoded</font>) means &#8220;a robber; a plunderer&#8221; (see Job 12:6). With the verb <i>bo</i>&#8217; the sentence means that the robber pounces on or comes against him (see GKC 373 §118.<i>f</i>). H. H. Rowley observes that the text does not say that he is under attack, but that the sound of fears is in his ears, i.e., that he is terrified by thoughts of this.</p>
<A NAME="1545"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1113><b>tn</b> This is the meaning of the Hiphil imperfect negated: &#8220;he does not believe&#8221; or &#8220;he has no confidence.&#8221; It is followed by the infinitive construct functioning as the direct object &#8211; he does not expect <i>to return</i> (to escape) from darkness.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The meaning of this line is somewhat in question. H. H. Rowley (<i>Job</i> [NCBC], 111) thinks it could mean that he is afraid he will not wake up from the night, or he dreads misfortune, thinking it will be final for him.</p>
<A NAME="1546"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1114><b>sn</b> In the context of these arguments, &#8220;darkness&#8221; probably refers to calamity, and so the wicked can expect a calamity that is final.</p>
<A NAME="1547"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1115><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he is watched [or waited for] by the sword.&#8221; G. R. Driver reads it, &#8220;he is marked down for the sword&#8221; (&#8220;Problems in the Hebrew text of Job,&#8221; VTSup 3 [1955]: 78). Ewald suggested &#8220;laid up for the sword.&#8221; Ball has &#8220;looks for the sword.&#8221; The MT has a passive participle from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1508;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsafah</font>, &#8220;to observe, watch&#8221;) which can be retained in the text; the meaning of the form can then be understood as the result of the inspection (E. Dhorme, <i>Job</i>, 217).</p>
<A NAME="1548"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1116><b>tn</b> The MT has &#8220;he wanders about for food &#8211; where is it?&#8221; The LXX has &#8220;he has been appointed for food for vultures,&#8221; reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ayyah</font>, &#8220;vulture&#8221;) for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ayyeh</font>, &#8220;where is it?&#8221;). This would carry on the thought of the passage &#8211; he sees himself destined for the sword and food for vultures. Many commentators follow this reading while making a number of smaller changes in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1465;&#1491;&#1461;&#1491;</font> (<i>noded</i>, &#8220;wandering&#8221;) such as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nittan</font>, &#8220;is given&#8221;), <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">no</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ad</font>, &#8220;is appointed&#8221;), <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">noda</font>&#8217;, &#8220;is known&#8221;), or something similar. The latter involves no major change in consonants. While the MT &#8220;wandering&#8221; may not be as elegant as some of the other suggestions, it is not impossible. But there is no reading of this verse that does not involve some change. The LXX has &#8220;and he has been appointed for food for vultures.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1549"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1117><b>tn</b> This line is fraught with difficulties (perceived or real), which prompt numerous suggestions. The reading of the MT is &#8220;he knows that a day of darkness is fixed in his hand,&#8221; i.e., is certain. Many commentators move &#8220;day of darkness&#8221; to the next verse, following the LXX. Then, suggestions have been offered for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1499;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhon</font>, &#8220;ready&#8221;), such as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1461;&#1499;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nekher</font>, &#8220;disaster&#8221;); and for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿyado</font>, &#8220;in his hand&#8221;) a number of ideas &#8211; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ed</font>, &#8220;calamity&#8221;) or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pido</font>, &#8220;his disaster&#8221;). Wright takes this last view and renders it &#8220;he knows that misfortune is imminent,&#8221; leaving the &#8220;day of darkness&#8221; to the next verse. </p>
<A NAME="1550"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1118><b>tn</b> If &#8220;day and darkness&#8221; are added to this line, then this verse is made into a tri-colon &#8211; the main reason for transferring it away from the last verse.

Others have made more extensive changes. Pope and Anderson follow Tur-Sinai in accepting &#8220;with full battle armor.&#8221; But the main idea seems to be that of a headlong assault on God.</p>

<A NAME="1559"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=1127><b>sn</b> K&amp;D 11:266 rightly explains that these are not cities that he, the wicked, has destroyed, but that were destroyed by a judgment on wickedness. Accordingly, Eliphaz is saying that the wicked man is willing to risk such a curse in his confidence in his prosperity (see further H. H. Rowley, <i>Job</i> [NCBC], 113).</p>
<A NAME="1560"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=1128><b>tn</b> The verbal idea serves here to modify &#8220;houses&#8221; as a relative clause; so a relative pronoun is added.</p>

M.

Others suggest it means &#8220;ear of grain,&#8221; either from the common word for &#8220;ears of grain&#8221; or a <i>hapax legomenon</i> in Deuteronomy 23:26 [25].</p>
<A NAME="1563"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=1131><b>tn</b> Some editions and commentators delete the first line of this verse, arguing that it is simply a paraphrase of v. 22a, and that it interrupts the comparison with a tree that falls (although that comparison only starts next).</p>
<A NAME="1564"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=1132><b>tn</b> This last line in the verse is the difficult one. The MT has &#8220;he shall depart by the breath of his mouth.&#8221; If this reading stands, then it must be understood that it is the breath of God&#8217;s mouth that is intended. In place of &#8220;his mouth&#8221; the LXX has &#8220;flower&#8221; (reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;</font> [<font face="Scholar">pirho</font>, properly, &#8220;his fruit&#8221;]<i> </i>instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1493;</font> <font face="Scholar">piv</font>), and &#8220;fall&#8221; instead of &#8220;depart.&#8221; Modern commentators and a number of English versions (e.g., RSV, NRSV, TEV) alter <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yasur</font>, &#8220;depart&#8221;) to something like <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1505;&#1465;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿso</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ar</font>, from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</font> [<font face="Scholar">sa</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ar</font>, &#8220;to drive away&#8221;]), or the like, to get &#8220;will be swept away.&#8221; The result is a reading: &#8220;and his blossom will be swept away by the wind.&#8221; The LXX may have read the Hebrew exactly, but harmonized it with v. 33 (see H. Heater, <i>A Septuagint Translation Technique in the Book of Job</i> [CBQMS]: 61-62).</p>
<A NAME="1565"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=1133><b>tn</b> The word, although difficult in its form, is &#8220;vanity,&#8221; i.e., that which is worthless. E.

The LXX has &#8220;let him not think that he shall endure, for his end shall be vanity.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1566"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=1134><b>tn</b> This word is found in Job 20:18 with the sense of &#8220;trading.&#8221; It can mean the exchange of goods or the profit from them.

Suggestions include <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1502;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">timorato</font>, &#8220;his palm tree&#8221;) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1456;&#1502;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zÿmorato</font>, &#8220;his vine shoot&#8221;). A number of writers simply delete all of v. 31. H. H. Rowley (<i>Job</i> [NCBC], 115) suggests the best reading (assuming one were going to make changes) would be, &#8220;Let him not trust in his stature, deceiving himself, for it is vanity.&#8221; And then put &#8220;his palm tree&#8221; with the next verse, he thinks that achieves the proper balance.</p>

<A NAME="1568"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=1136><b>tn</b> Those who put the last colon of v. 31 with v. 32 also have to change the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1461;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">timmale</font>&#8217;, &#8220;will be fulfilled&#8221;). E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 225) says, &#8220;a mere glance at the use of <i>yimmal</i>&#8230;abundantly proves that the original text had <i>timmal</i> (G, Syr., Vulg), which became <i>timmale</i>&#8217; through the accidental transposition of the &#8216;<i>alep</i> of <i>b</i>ÿ<i>si</i>&#8217;<i>o</i>&#8230;in verse 31&#8230;.&#8221; This, of course, is possible, if all the other changes up to now are granted. But the meaning of a word elsewhere in no way assures it should be the word here. The LXX has &#8220;his harvest shall perish before the time,&#8221; which could translate any number of words that might have been in the underlying Hebrew text. A commercial metaphor is not out of place here, since parallelism does not demand that the same metaphor appear in both lines.</p>

<A NAME="1571"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=1139><b>sn</b> The point is that like the tree the wicked man shows signs of life but produces nothing valuable.

It indicates that the wealth and the possessions that the wicked man has gained may have been gained unjustly.</p>
<A NAME="1575"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">75</span><note=1143><b>tn</b> Infinitives absolute are used in this verse in the place of finite verbs. They lend a greater vividness to the description, stressing the basic meaning of the words.</p>
