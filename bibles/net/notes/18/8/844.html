<A NAME="844"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=624><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1511;&#1493;&#1465;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yaqot</font>) is not known anywhere else; here it looks like it should be a noun to parallel &#8220;spider&#8217;s house&#8221; in the next colon. But scholars have tried to identify it as a verb, perhaps an imperfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1493;&#1465;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qot</font>, BDB 876 s.v.), or related to an Arabic <i>qatta</i>, &#8220;to cut.&#8221; Some versions have &#8220;break in sunder&#8221; (KJV, RV); others &#8220;cut off&#8221; (RSV). Apart from verbs, some commentators follow Sa`adia&#8217;s Arabic translation &#8220;sun cords,&#8221; meaning &#8220;gossamer.&#8221; Accordingly, there are emendations like &#8220;threads,&#8221; &#8220;threads of summer,&#8221; &#8220;spider threads,&#8221; and the like. D. J. A. Clines agrees with those who conclude that emendations based on Sa`adia&#8217;s translation lack a sound philological basis. E. Dhorme &#8220;somewhat timidly&#8221; suggests <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yalqut</font>), the shepherd&#8217;s bag or scrip (1 Sam 17:40). He suggests that an empty bag would be a symbol of something unstable and futile. It seems impossible to determine exactly what the word meant. One can only conclude that it means something like &#8220;fragile&#8221; or &#8220;futile.&#8221; The LXX is of no help: &#8220;for his house shall be without inhabitants.&#8221;</p>
