<A NAME="854"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=634><b>tn</b> The idea is that the plant grows, looking for a place to grow among the stones. Some trees grow so tightly around the rocks and stones that they are impossible to uproot. The rocky ground where it grows forms &#8220;a house of stones.&#8221; The LXX supports an emendation from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1495;&#1457;&#1494;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿkhezeh</font>, &#8220;it looks&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1495;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yikhyeh</font>, &#8220;it lives&#8221;). Others have tried to emend the text in a variety of ways: &#8220;pushes&#8221; (Budde), &#8220;cleave&#8221; (Gordis), &#8220;was opposite&#8221; (Driver), or &#8220;run against&#8221; (NEB, probably based on G. R. Driver). If one were to make a change, the reading with the LXX would be the easiest to defend, but there is no substantial reason to do that. The meaning is about the same without such a change.</p>
