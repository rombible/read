<A NAME="818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=598><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ir</font>, &#8220;rouse, stir up&#8221;) is a strong anthropomorphism. The LXX has &#8220;he will answer your prayer&#8221; (which is probably only the LXX&#8217;s effort to avoid the anthropomorphism [D. J. A. Clines, <i>Job </i>(WBC), 198]). A reading of &#8220;watch over you&#8221; has been adopted because of parallel texts (see H. L. Ginsberg, &#8220;Two North Canaanite Letters from Ugarit,&#8221; <i>BASOR</i> 72 [1938]: 18-19; and H. N. Richardson, &#8220;A Ugaritic Letter of a King to His Mother,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 66 [1947]: 321-24). Others suggest &#8220;his light will shine on you&#8221; or &#8220;he will bestow health on you.&#8221; But the idea of &#8220;awake&#8221; is common enough in the Bible to be retained here.</p>
