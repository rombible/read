<A NAME="88"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=588><b>tn</b> Some commentators think that the second verb should be changed in order to avoid the repetition of the same word and to reflect the different words in the versions. The suggestion is to read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1493;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avveh</font>) instead; this would mean &#8220;to cause someone to deviate,&#8221; for the root means &#8220;to bend.&#8221; The change is completely unwarranted; the LXX probably chose different words for stylistic reasons (see D. J. A. Clines, <i>Job </i>[WBC], 198). The repetition in the Hebrew text is a common type; it strengthens the enormity of the charge Job seems to be making.</p>
