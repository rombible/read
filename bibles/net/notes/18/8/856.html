<A NAME="856"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=636><b>tc</b> Ball reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>, &#8220;God&#8221;) instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>, &#8220;if&#8221;): &#8220;God destroys it&#8221; &#8211; but there is no reason for this. The idea would be implied in the context. A. B. Davidson rightly points out that who destroys it is not important, but the fact that it is destroyed.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The Hebrew has &#8220;if one destroys it&#8221;; the indefinite subject allows for a passive interpretation. The verb means &#8220;swallow&#8221; in the Qal, but in the Piel it means &#8220;to engulf; to destroy; to ruin&#8221; (2:3; 10:8). It could here be rendered &#8220;removed from its place&#8221; (the place where it is rooted); since the picture is that of complete destruction, &#8220;uprooted&#8221; would be a good rendering.</p>
