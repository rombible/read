<A NAME="810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=590><b>tn</b> The verb is a Piel preterite with a <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive. The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vav</font>) need not be translated if the second half of the verse is the apodosis of the first &#8211; since they sinned&#8230;he did this. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shilleakh</font>) means &#8220;to expel; to thrust out&#8221; normally; here the sense of &#8220;deliver up&#8221; or &#8220;deliver over&#8221; fits the sentence well. The verse is saying that sin carries its own punishment, and so God merely delivered the young people over to it.</p>
