<A NAME="866"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=646><b>sn</b> These verses show several points of similarity with the style of the Book of Psalms. &#8220;Those who hate you&#8221; and the &#8220;evil-doers&#8221; are fairly common words to describe the ungodly in the Psalms. &#8220;Those who hate you&#8221; are enemies of the righteous man because of the parallelism in the verse. By this line Bildad is showing Job that he and his friends are not among those who are his enemies, and that Job himself is really among the righteous. It is an appealing way to end the discourse. See further G. W. Anderson, &#8220;Enemies and Evil-doers in the Book of Psalms,&#8221; <i>BJRL</i> 48 (1965/66): 18-29.</p>
