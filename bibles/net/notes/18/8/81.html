<A NAME="81"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=581><b>sn</b> This speech of Bildad ignores Job&#8217;s attack on his friends and focuses rather on Job&#8217;s comments about God&#8217;s justice. Bildad cannot even imagine saying that God is unjust. The only conclusion open to him is that Job&#8217;s family brought this on themselves, and so the only recourse is for Job to humble himself and make supplication to God. To make his point, Bildad will appeal to the wisdom of the ancients, for his theology is traditional. The speech has three parts: vv. 2-7 form his affirmation of the justice of God; vv. 8-19 are his appeal to the wisdom of the ancients, and vv. 20-22 are his summation. See N. C. Habel, &#8220;Appeal to Ancient Tradition as a Literary Form,&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 88 (1976): 253-72; W. A. Irwin, &#8220;The First Speech of Bildad,&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 51 (1953): 205-16.</p>
