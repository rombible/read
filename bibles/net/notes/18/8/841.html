<A NAME="841"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=621><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1504;&#1461;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khanef</font>) is often translated &#8220;hypocrite.&#8221; But the root verb means &#8220;to be profane,&#8221; and this would be done by idolatry or bloodshed. It describes an irreligious person, a godless person. In Dan 11:32 the word seems to mean &#8220;make someone pagan.&#8221; The word in this verse is parallel to &#8220;those who forget God.&#8221;</p>
