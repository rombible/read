<A NAME="852"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=632><b>tn</b> Cheyne reads &#8220;spring&#8221; or &#8220;well&#8221; rather than &#8220;heap.&#8221; However, this does not fit the parallelism very well, and so he emends the second half as well. Nevertheless the Hebrew text needs no emending here.</p>
