<A NAME="821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=601><b>tn</b> The reference to &#8220;your beginning&#8221; is a reference to Job&#8217;s former estate of wealth and peace. The reference to &#8220;latter end&#8221; is a reference to conditions still in the future. What Job had before will seem so small in comparison to what lies ahead.</p>
