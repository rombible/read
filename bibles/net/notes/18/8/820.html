<A NAME="820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=600><b>tn</b> The construct <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nÿvat</font>) is feminine; only the masculine occurs in Hebrew. But the meaning &#8220;abode of your righteousness&#8221; is clear enough. The righteousness of Job is pictured as inhabiting an estate, or it pictures the place where Job lives as a righteous man. A translation &#8220;rightful habitation&#8221; would mean &#8220;the habitation that you deserve&#8221; &#8211; if you are righteous.</p>
