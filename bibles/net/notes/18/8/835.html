<A NAME="835"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=615><b>tn</b> The word has been traditionally translated &#8220;greenness&#8221; (so KJV, ASV), but some modern commentators argue for &#8220;in flower.&#8221; The word is found only in Song 6:11 (where it may be translated &#8220;blossoms&#8221;). From the same root is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aviv</font>, &#8220;fresh young ears of barley&#8221;). Here the word refers to the plant that is still in its early stages of flowering. It should not be translated to suggest the plant is flowering (cf. NRSV), but translating as if the plant is green (so NASB) is also problematic.</p>
