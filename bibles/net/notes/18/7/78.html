<A NAME="78"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=514><b>tn</b> The form is the Hophal perfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhal</font>):<i> </i>&#8220;I have been made to inherit,&#8221; or more simply, &#8220;I have inherited.&#8221; The form occurs only here. The LXX must have confused the letters or sounds, a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vav</font>) for the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nun</font>), for it reads &#8220;I have endured.&#8221; As a passive the form technically has two accusatives (see GKC 388 §121.<i>c</i>). Job&#8217;s point is that his sufferings have been laid on him by another, and so he has inherited them.</p>
