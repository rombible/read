<A NAME="714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=520><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1491;&#1467;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nÿdudim</font>, &#8220;tossing&#8221;)<i> </i>refers to the restless tossing and turning of the sick man at night on his bed. The word is a <i>hapax legomenon</i> derived from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nadad</font>, &#8220;to flee; to wander; to be restless&#8221;). The plural form here sums up the several parts of the actions (GKC 460 §144.<i>f</i>). E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 99) argues that because it applies to both his waking hours and his sleepless nights, it may have more of the sense of wanderings of the mind. There is no doubt truth to the fact that the mind wanders in all this suffering; but there is no need to go beyond the contextually clear idea of the restlessness of the night.</p>
