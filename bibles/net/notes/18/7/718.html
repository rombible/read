<A NAME="718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=524><b>tn</b> The text has &#8220;clods of dust.&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gish</font>, &#8220;dirty scabs&#8221;) is a <i>hapax legomenon</i> from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gush</font>, &#8220;clod&#8221;). Driver suggests the word has a medical sense, like &#8220;pustules&#8221; (G. R. Driver, &#8220;Problems in the Hebrew text of Job,&#8221; VTSup 3 [1955]: 73) or &#8220;scabs&#8221; (JB, NEB, NAB, NIV). Driver thinks &#8220;clods of dust&#8221; is wrong; he repoints &#8220;dust&#8221; to make a new verb &#8220;to cover,&#8221; cognate to Arabic, and reads &#8220;my flesh is clothed with worms, and scab covers my skin.&#8221; This refers to the dirty scabs that crusted over the sores all over his body. The LXX links this with the second half of the verse: &#8220;And my body has been covered with loathsome worms, and I waste away, scraping off clods of dirt from my eruption.&#8221;</p>
