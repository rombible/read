<A NAME="711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=517><b>tn</b> The verb is literally &#8220;they have appointed&#8221;; the form with no expressed subject is to be interpreted as a passive (GKC 460 §144.<i>g</i>). It is therefore not necessary to repoint the verb to make it passive. The word means &#8220;to number; to count,&#8221; and so &#8220;to determine; to allocate.&#8221;</p>
