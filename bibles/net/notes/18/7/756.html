<A NAME="756"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=562><b>tn</b> There is no object for the verb in the text. But the most likely object would be &#8220;my life&#8221; from the last verse, especially since in this verse Job will talk about not living forever. Some have thought the object should be &#8220;death,&#8221; meaning that Job despised death more than the pains. But that is a forced meaning; besides, as H. H. Rowley points out, the word here means to despise something, to reject it. Job wanted death.</p>
