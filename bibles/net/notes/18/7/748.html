<A NAME="748"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=554><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>) is often translated &#8220;soul.&#8221; But since Hebrew thought does not make such a distinction between body and soul, it is usually better to translate it with &#8220;person.&#8221; When a suffix is added to the word, then that pronoun would serve as the better translation, as here with &#8220;my soul&#8221; = &#8220;I&#8221; (meaning with every fiber of my being).</p>
