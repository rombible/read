<A NAME="760"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=566><b>tn</b> The Piel verb is a factitive meaning &#8220;to magnify.&#8221; The English word &#8220;magnify&#8221; might not be the best translation here, for God, according to Job, is focusing inordinately on him. It means to magnify in thought, appreciate, think highly of. God, Job argues, is making too much of mankind by devoting so much bad attention on them.</p>
