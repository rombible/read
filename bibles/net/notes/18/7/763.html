<A NAME="763"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=569><b>tn</b> Now the verb &#8220;to test&#8221; is introduced and gives further explanation to the purpose of the &#8220;visit&#8221; in the parallel line (see the same parallelism in Ps 17:3). The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bakhan</font>) has to do with passing things through the fire or the crucible to purify the metal (see Job 23:10; Zech 13:3); metaphorically it means &#8220;to examine carefully&#8221; and &#8220;to purify by testing.&#8221;</p>
