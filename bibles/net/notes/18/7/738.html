<A NAME="738"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=544><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tannin</font>) could be translated &#8220;whale&#8221; as well as the more mythological &#8220;dragon&#8221; or &#8220;monster of the deep&#8221; (see E. Dhorme, <i>Job</i>, 105). To the Hebrews this was part of God&#8217;s creation in Gen 1; in the pagan world it was a force to be reckoned with, and so the reference would be polemical. The sea is a symbol of the tumultuous elements of creation; in the sea were creatures that symbolized the powerful forces of chaos &#8211; Leviathan, Tannin, and Rahab. They required special attention.</p>
