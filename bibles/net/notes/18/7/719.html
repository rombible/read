<A NAME="719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=525><b>tn</b> The meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">raga</font>&#8217;) is also debated here. D. J. A. Clines (<i>Job </i>[WBC], 163) does not think the word can mean &#8220;cracked&#8221; because scabs show evidence of the sores healing. But E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 100) argues that the usage of the word shows the idea of &#8220;splitting, separating, making a break,&#8221; or the like. Here then it would mean &#8220;my skin splits&#8221; and as a result festers. This need not be a reference to the scabs, but to new places. Or it could mean that the scabbing never heals, but is always splitting open.</p>
