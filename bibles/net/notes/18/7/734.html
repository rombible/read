<A NAME="734"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=540><b>tn</b> The verb means &#8220;to recognize&#8221; by seeing. &#8220;His place,&#8221; the place where he was living, is the subject of the verb. This personification is intended simply to say that the place where he lived will not have him any more. The line is very similar to Ps 103:16b &#8211; when the wind blows the flower away, its place knows it no more.</p>
