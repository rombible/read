<A NAME="731"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=537><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ol</font>) can mean &#8220;the grave,&#8221; &#8220;death,&#8221; or &#8220;Sheol&#8221; &#8211; the realm of departed spirits. In Job this is a land from which there is no return (10:21 and here). It is a place of darkness and gloom (10:21-22), a place where the dead lie hidden (14:13); as a place appointed for all no matter what their standing on earth might have been (30:23). In each case the precise meaning has to be determined. Here the grave makes the most sense, for Job is simply talking about death.</p>
