<A NAME="762"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=568><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">paqad</font>) is a very common one in the Bible; while it is frequently translated &#8220;visit,&#8221; the &#8220;visit&#8221; is never comparable to a social call. When God &#8220;visits&#8221; people it always means a divine intervention for blessing or cursing &#8211; but the visit always changes the destiny of the one visited. Here Job is amazed that God Almighty would be so involved in the life of mere human beings.</p>
