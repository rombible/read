<A NAME="717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=523><b>sn</b> The word for &#8220;worms&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">rimmah</font>, a collective noun), is usually connected with rotten food (Exod 16:24), or the grave (Isa 14:11). Job&#8217;s disease is a malignant ulcer of some kind that causes the rotting of the flesh. One may recall that both Antiochus Epiphanes (2 Macc 9:9) and Herod Agrippa (Acts 12:23) were devoured by such worms in their diseases.</p>
