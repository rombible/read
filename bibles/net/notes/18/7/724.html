<A NAME="724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=530><b>sn</b> Job is probably turning here to God, as is clear from v. 11 on. The NIV supplies the word &#8220;God&#8221; for clarification. It was God who breathed breath into man&#8217;s nostrils (Gen 2:7), and so God is called to remember that man is but a breath.</p>
