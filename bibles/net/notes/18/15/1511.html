<A NAME="1511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1079><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1507;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">allef</font>) has the meaning of &#8220;to teach; to instruct,&#8221; but it is unlikely that the idea of revealing is intended. If the verb is understood metonymically, then &#8220;to inspire; to prompt&#8221; will be sufficient. Dahood and others find another root, and render the verb &#8220;to increase,&#8221; reversing subject and object: &#8220;your mouth increases your iniquity.&#8221;</p>
