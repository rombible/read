<A NAME="1539"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1107><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all the days of the wicked, he suffers.&#8221; The word &#8220;all&#8221; is an adverbial accusative of time, stating along with its genitives (&#8220;of the days of a wicked man&#8221;) how long the individual suffers. When the subject is composed of a noun in construct followed by a genitive, the predicate sometimes agrees with the genitive (see GKC 467 §146.<i>a</i>).</p>
