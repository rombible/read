<A NAME="1526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1094><b>tn</b> The verb simply means &#8220;to take.&#8221; The RSV has &#8220;carry you away.&#8221; E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 212-13) goes further, saying that it implies being unhinged by passion, to be carried away by the passions beyond good sense (pp. 212-13). Pope and Tur-Sinai suggest that the suffix on the verb is datival, and translate it, &#8220;What has taken from you your mind?&#8221; But the parallelism shows that &#8220;your heart&#8221; and &#8220;your eyes&#8221; are subjects.</p>
