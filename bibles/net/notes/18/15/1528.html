<A NAME="1528"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1096><b>tn</b> The Hebrew is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1462;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rukhekha</font>, &#8220;your spirit&#8221; or &#8220;your breath&#8221;). But the fact that this is turned &#8220;against God,&#8221; means that it must be given a derived meaning, or a meaning that is metonymical. It is used in the Bible in the sense of anger &#8211; what the spirit vents (see Judg 8:3; Prov 16:32; and Job 4:9 with &#8220;blast&#8221;).</p>
