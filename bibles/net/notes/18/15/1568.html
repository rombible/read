<A NAME="1568"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=1136><b>tn</b> Those who put the last colon of v. 31 with v. 32 also have to change the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1461;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">timmale</font>&#8217;, &#8220;will be fulfilled&#8221;). E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 225) says, &#8220;a mere glance at the use of <i>yimmal</i>&#8230;abundantly proves that the original text had <i>timmal</i> (G, Syr., Vulg), which became <i>timmale</i>&#8217; through the accidental transposition of the &#8216;<i>alep</i> of <i>b</i>ÿ<i>si</i>&#8217;<i>o</i>&#8230;in verse 31&#8230;.&#8221; This, of course, is possible, if all the other changes up to now are granted. But the meaning of a word elsewhere in no way assures it should be the word here. The LXX has &#8220;his harvest shall perish before the time,&#8221; which could translate any number of words that might have been in the underlying Hebrew text. A commercial metaphor is not out of place here, since parallelism does not demand that the same metaphor appear in both lines.</p>
