<A NAME="1544"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1112><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1461;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shoded</font>) means &#8220;a robber; a plunderer&#8221; (see Job 12:6). With the verb <i>bo</i>&#8217; the sentence means that the robber pounces on or comes against him (see GKC 373 §118.<i>f</i>). H. H. Rowley observes that the text does not say that he is under attack, but that the sound of fears is in his ears, i.e., that he is terrified by thoughts of this.</p>
