<A NAME="1566"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=1134><b>tn</b> This word is found in Job 20:18 with the sense of &#8220;trading.&#8221; It can mean the exchange of goods or the profit from them. Some commentators change <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1464;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tÿmurato</font>, &#8220;his reward&#8221;) because they wish to put it with the next verse as the LXX seems to have done (although the LXX does not represent this). Suggestions include <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1502;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">timorato</font>, &#8220;his palm tree&#8221;) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1456;&#1502;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zÿmorato</font>, &#8220;his vine shoot&#8221;). A number of writers simply delete all of v. 31. H. H. Rowley (<i>Job</i> [NCBC], 115) suggests the best reading (assuming one were going to make changes) would be, &#8220;Let him not trust in his stature, deceiving himself, for it is vanity.&#8221; And then put &#8220;his palm tree&#8221; with the next verse, he thinks that achieves the proper balance.</p>
