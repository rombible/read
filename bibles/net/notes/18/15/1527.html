<A NAME="1527"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1095><b>tn</b> Here is another word that occurs only here, and in the absence of a completely convincing suggestion, probably should be left as it is. The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">razam</font>, &#8220;wink, flash&#8221;). Targum Job and the Syriac equate it with a verb found in Aramaic and postbiblical Hebrew with the same letters but metathesized &#8211; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1494;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ramaz</font>). It would mean &#8220;to make a sign&#8221; or &#8220;to wink.&#8221; Budde, following the LXX probably, has &#8220;Why are your eyes lofty?&#8221; Others follow an Arabic root meaning &#8220;become weak.&#8221;</p>
