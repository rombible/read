<A NAME="411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2357><b>sn</b> Beginning with <b>41:1</b>, the verse numbers through <b>41:9</b> in the English Bible differ from the verse numbers in the Hebrew text (<i>BHS</i>), with <b>41:1</b> ET = <b>40:25</b> HT, <b>41:2</b> ET = <b>40:26</b> HT, etc., through <b>41:34</b> ET = <b>41:26</b> HT. The Hebrew verse numbers in the remainder of the chapter differ from the verse numbers in the English Bible. Beginning with <b>42:1</b> the verse numbers in the ET and HT are again the same.</p>
<A NAME="412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2358><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mashakh</font>) means &#8220;to extract from the water; to fish.&#8221; The question here includes the use of a hook to fish the creature out of the water so that its jaws can be tied safely.</p>
<A NAME="413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2359><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shaqa</font>&#8217;) means &#8220;to cause to sink,&#8221; if it is connected with the word in Amos 8:8 and 9:5. But it may have the sense of &#8220;to tie; to bind.&#8221; If the rope were put around the tongue and jaw, binding tightly would be the sense.</p>
<A NAME="414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2360><b>tn</b> The line asks if the animal, when caught and tied and under control, would keep on begging for mercy. Absolutely not. It is not in the nature of the beast. The construction uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yarbeh</font>, &#8220;[will] he multiply&#8221; [= &#8220;make numerous&#8221;]), with the object, &#8220;supplications&#8221; i.e., prayers for mercy.</p>
<A NAME="415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2361><b>tn</b> The rhetorical question again affirms the opposite. The poem is portraying the creature as powerful and insensitive.</p>
<A NAME="416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2362><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;will he cut a covenant.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2363><b>tn</b> The imperfect verb serves to express what the covenant pact would cover, namely, &#8220;that you take.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2364><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sakhaq</font>, &#8220;to sport; to trifle; to play,&#8221; Ps 104:26).</p>
<A NAME="419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2365><b>tn</b> The idea may include putting Leviathan on a leash. D. W. Thomas suggested on the basis of an Arabic cognate that it could be rendered &#8220;tie him with a string like a young sparrow&#8221; (<i>VT</i> 14 [1964]: 114ff.).</p>
<A NAME="4110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2366><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khabbar</font>) is a <i>hapax legomenon</i>, but the meaning is &#8220;to associate&#8221; since it is etymologically related to the verb &#8220;to join together.&#8221; The idea is that fishermen usually work in companies or groups, and then divide up the catch when they come ashore &#8211; which involves bargaining.</p>
<A NAME="4111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2367><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">karah</font>) means &#8220;to sell.&#8221; With the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>, &#8220;upon&#8221;) it has the sense &#8220;to bargain over something.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2368><b>tn</b> The verb means &#8220;to cut up; to divide up&#8221; in the sense of selling the dead body (see Exod 21:35). This will be between them and the merchants (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kÿna</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anim</font>).</p>
<A NAME="4113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2369><b>tn</b> The verse uses two imperatives which can be interpreted in sequence: do this, and then this will happen.</p>
<A NAME="4114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2370><b>sn</b> Job <b>41:9</b> in the English Bible is <b>41:1</b> in the Hebrew text (<i>BHS)</i>. From here to the end of the chapter the Hebrew verse numbers differ from those in the English Bible, with <b>41:10</b> ET = <b>41:2</b> HT, <b>41:11</b> ET = <b>41:3</b> HT, etc. See also the note on <b>41:1</b>.</p>
<A NAME="4115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2371><b>tn</b> The line is difficult. &#8220;His hope [= expectation]&#8221; must refer to any assailant who hopes or expects to capture the creature. Because there is no antecedent, Dhorme and others transpose it with the next verse. The point is that the man who thought he was sufficient to confront Leviathan soon finds his hope &#8211; his expectation &#8211; false (a derivative from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1489;</font> [<font face="Scholar">kazab</font>, &#8220;lie&#8221;] is used for a mirage).</p>
<A NAME="4116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2372><b>tn</b> There is an interrogative particle in this line, which most commentators ignore. But others freely emend the MT. Gunkel, following the mythological approach, has &#8220;his appearance casts down even a god.&#8221; Cheyne likewise has: &#8220;even divine beings the fear of him brings low&#8221; (<i>JQR </i>9 [1896/97]: 579). Pope has, &#8220;Were not the gods cast down at the sight of him?&#8221; There is no need to bring in this mythological element.</p>
<A NAME="4117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2373><b>sn</b> The description is of the animal, not the hunter (or fisherman). Leviathan is so fierce that no one can take him on alone.</p>
<A NAME="4118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2374><b>tc</b> MT has &#8220;before me&#8221; and can best be rendered as &#8220;Who then is he that can stand before me?&#8221; (ESV, NASB, NIV, NLT, NJPS). The following verse (11) favors the MT since both express the lesson to be learned from Leviathan: If a man cannot stand up to Leviathan, how can he stand up to its creator? The translation above has chosen to read the text as &#8220;before him&#8221; (cf. NRSV, NJB).</p>
<A NAME="4119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2375><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qadam</font>) means &#8220;to come to meet; to come before; to confront&#8221; to the face.</p>
<A NAME="4120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2376><b>sn</b> The verse seems an intrusion (and so E. Dhorme, H. H. Rowley, and many others change the pronouns to make it refer to the animal). But what the text is saying is that it is more dangerous to confront God than to confront this animal.</p>
<A NAME="4121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2377><b>tn</b> This line also focuses on the sovereign God rather than Leviathan. H. H. Rowley, however, wants to change <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">li-hu</font>&#8217;, &#8220;it [belongs] to me&#8221;) into <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> hu</font>&#8217;, &#8220;there is no one&#8221;). So it would say that there is no one under the whole heaven who could challenge Leviathan and live, rather than saying it is more dangerous to challenge God to make him repay.</p>
<A NAME="4122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2378><b>tn</b> Dhorme changes the noun into a verb, &#8220;I will tell,&#8221; and the last two words into <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1503; &#1506;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">en </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">erekh</font>, &#8220;there is no comparison&#8221;). The result is &#8220;I will tell of his incomparable might.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2379><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the face of his garment,&#8221; referring to the outer garment or covering. Some take it to be the front as opposed to the back.</p>
<A NAME="4124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2380><b>tc</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">resen</font>) has often been rendered &#8220;bridle&#8221; (cf. ESV), but that leaves a number of unanswered questions. The LXX reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">siryon</font>), with the transposition of letters, but that means &#8220;coat of armor.&#8221; If the metathesis stands, there is also support from the cognate Akkadian.</p>
<A NAME="4125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2381><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his face.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2382><b>tc</b> The MT has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ga</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avah</font>, &#8220;his pride&#8221;), but the LXX, Aquila, and the Vulgate all read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1493;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gavvo</font>, &#8220;his back&#8221;). Almost all the modern English versions follow the variant reading, speaking about &#8220;his [or its] back.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2383><b>tn</b> Instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsar</font>, &#8220;closely&#8221;) the LXX has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsor</font>, &#8220;stone&#8221;) to say that the seal was rock hard.</p>
<A NAME="4128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2384><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;each one&#8230;to the next&#8221; is literally &#8220;one with one.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2385><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a man with his brother.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4130"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2386><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the eyelids,&#8221; but it represents the early beams of the dawn as the cover of night lifts.</p>
<A NAME="4131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2387><b>sn</b> For the animal, the image is that of pent-up breath with water in a hot steam jet coming from its mouth, like a stream of fire in the rays of the sun. The language is hyperbolic, probably to reflect the pagan ideas of the dragon of the deep in a polemical way &#8211; they feared it as a fire breathing monster, but in reality it might have been a steamy crocodile.</p>
<A NAME="4132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2388><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;burning&#8221; is supplied. The Syriac and Vulgate have &#8220;a seething and boiling pot&#8221; (reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1465;&#1490;&#1461;&#1501;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ogem</font>] for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1490;&#1456;&#1502;&#1465;&#1503;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">agmon</font>]). This view is widely accepted.</p>
<A NAME="4133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2389><b>tn</b> This word, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avah</font>) is a <i>hapax legomenon</i>. But the verbal root means &#8220;to languish; to pine.&#8221; A related noun talks of dejection and despair in Deut 28:65. So here &#8220;despair&#8221; as a translation is preferable to &#8220;terror.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2390><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fallings.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4135"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2391><b>tn</b> The last clause says &#8220;it cannot be moved.&#8221; But this part will function adverbially in the sentence.</p>
<A NAME="4136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2392><b>tn</b> The description of his heart being &#8220;hard&#8221; means that he is cruel and fearless. The word for &#8220;hard&#8221; is the word encountered before for molten or cast metal.</p>
<A NAME="4137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2393><b>tc</b> This verse has created all kinds of problems for the commentators. The first part is workable: &#8220;when he raises himself up, the mighty [the gods] are terrified.&#8221; The mythological approach would render <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elim</font>) as &#8220;gods.&#8221; But the last two words, which could be rendered &#8220;at the breaking [crashing, or breakers] they fail,&#8221; receive much attention. E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 639) suggests &#8220;majesty&#8221; for &#8220;raising up&#8221; and &#8220;billows&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">gallim</font>) for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elim</font>), and gets a better parallelism: &#8220;the billows are afraid of his majesty, and the waves draw back.&#8221; But H. H. Rowley (<i>Job</i> [NCBC], 263) does not think this is relevant to the context, which is talking about the creature&#8217;s defense against attack. The RSV works well for the first part, but the second part need some change; so Rowley adopts &#8220;in their dire consternation they are beside themselves.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2394><b>tn</b> This is the clearest reading, following A. B. Davidson, <i>Job</i>, 285. The versions took different readings of the construction.</p>
<A NAME="4139"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2395><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qum</font>, &#8220;stand&#8221;) with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿli</font>, &#8220;not&#8221;) has the sense of &#8220;does not hold firm,&#8221; or &#8220;gives way.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4140"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=2396><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the son of the bow.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4141"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=2397><b>tn</b> The verb is plural, but since there is no expressed subject it is translated as a passive here.</p>
<A NAME="4142"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=2398><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;under him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4143"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2399><b>tn</b> Here only the word &#8220;sharp&#8221; is present, but in passages like Isa 41:15 it is joined with &#8220;threshing sledge.&#8221; Here and in Amos 1:3 and Isa 28:27 the word stands alone, but represents the &#8220;sledge.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=2400><b>sn</b> The idea is either that the sea is stirred up like the foam from beating the ingredients together, or it is the musk-smell that is the point of comparison.</p>
<A NAME="4145"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=2401><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;one who was made.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="4146"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=2402><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the sons of pride.&#8221; Dhorme repoints the last word to get &#8220;all the wild beasts,&#8221; but this misses the point of the verse. This animal looks over every proud creature &#8211; but he is king of them all in that department.</p>
