<A NAME="231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1554><b>sn</b> Job answers Eliphaz, but not until he introduces new ideas for his own case with God. His speech unfolds in three parts: Job&#8217;s longing to meet God (23:2-7), the inaccessibility and power of God (23:8-17), the indifference of God (24:1-25).</p>
<A NAME="232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1555><b>tc</b> The MT reads here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿri</font>, &#8220;rebellious&#8221;). The word is related to the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">marah</font>, &#8220;to revolt&#8221;). Many commentators follow the Vulgate, Targum Job, and the Syriac to read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mar</font>, &#8220;bitter&#8221;). The LXX offers no help here. </p>
<A NAME="233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1556><b>tc</b> The MT (followed by the Vulgate and Targum) has &#8220;my hand is heavy on my groaning.&#8221; This would mean &#8220;my stroke is heavier than my groaning&#8221; (an improbable view from Targum Job). A better suggestion is that the meaning would be that Job tries to suppress his groans but the hand with which he suppresses them is too heavy (H. H. Rowley, <i>Job</i> [NCBC], 159). Budde, E. Dhorme, J. E. Hartley, and F. I. Andersen all maintain the MT as the more difficult reading. F. I. Andersen (<i>Job </i>[TOTC], 208) indicates that the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew"> &#1460;&#1497;</font>(<font face="Scholar">i</font>) suffix could be an example of an unusual third masculine singular. Both the LXX and the Syriac versions have &#8220;his hand,&#8221; and many modern commentators follow this, along with the present translation. In this case the referent of &#8220;his&#8221; would be God, whose hand is heavy upon Job in spite of Job&#8217;s groaning.</p>
<A NAME="234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1557><b>tn</b> The preposition can take this meaning; it could be also translated simply &#8220;upon.&#8221; R. Gordis (<i>Job</i>, 260) reads the preposition &#8220;more than,&#8221; saying that Job had been defiant (he takes that view) but God&#8217;s hand had been far worse.</p>
<A NAME="235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1558><b>tn</b> The optative here is again expressed with the verbal clause, &#8220;who will give [that] I knew&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1559><b>tn</b> The form in Hebrew is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1502;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">emtsa</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ehu</font>), simply &#8220;and I will find him.&#8221; But in the optative clause this verb is subordinated to the preceding verb: &#8220;O that I knew where [and] I might find him.&#8221; It is not unusual to have the perfect verb followed by the imperfect in such coordinate clauses (see GKC 386 §120.<i>e</i>). This could also be translated making the second verb a complementary infinitive: &#8220;knew how to find him.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> H. H. Rowley (<i>Job</i> [NCBC], 159) quotes Strahan without reference: &#8220;It is the chief distinction between Job and his friends that he desires to meet God and they do not.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1560><b>tn</b> This verb also depends on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mi-yitten</font>, &#8220;who will give&#8221;) of the first part, forming an additional clause in the wish formula.</p>
<A NAME="238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1561><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;his place of judgment.&#8221; The word is from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kun</font>, &#8220;to prepare; to arrange&#8221;) in the Polel and the Hiphil conjugations. The noun refers to a prepared place, a throne, a seat, or a sanctuary. A. B. Davidson (<i>Job</i>, 169) and others take the word to mean &#8220;judgment seat&#8221; or &#8220;tribunal&#8221; in this context.</p>
<A NAME="239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1562><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mishpat</font>) is normally &#8220;judgment; decision.&#8221; But in these contexts it refers to the legal case that Job will bring before God. With the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arakh</font>, &#8220;to set in order; to lay out&#8221;) the whole image of drawing up a lawsuit is complete.</p>
<A NAME="2310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1563><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the words he would answer me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1564><b>tn</b> The verb is now <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">riv</font>) and not <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yakhakh</font>, &#8220;contend&#8221;); <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">riv</font>) means &#8220;to quarrel; to dispute; to contend,&#8221; often in a legal context. Here it is still part of Job&#8217;s questioning about this hypothetical meeting &#8211; would God contend with all his power?</p>
<A NAME="2312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1565><b>tn</b> The verbal clause <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yasim bi</font>) has been translated &#8220;he would pay [attention] to me.&#8221; Job is saying that God will not need all his power &#8211; he will just have pay attention to Job&#8217;s complaint. Job does not need the display of power &#8211; he just wants a hearing.</p>
<A NAME="2313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1566><b>tn</b> The adverb &#8220;there&#8221; has the sense of &#8220;then&#8221; &#8211; there in the future.</p>
<A NAME="2314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1567><b>tn</b> The form of the verb is the Niphal <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1499;&#1464;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nokkakh</font>, &#8220;argue, present a case&#8221;). E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 346) is troubled by this verbal form and so changes it and other things in the line to say, &#8220;he would observe the upright man who argues with him.&#8221; The Niphal is used for &#8220;engaging discussion,&#8221; &#8220;arguing a case,&#8221; and &#8220;settling a dispute.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1568><b>sn</b> The text has &#8220;the left hand,&#8221; the Semitic idiom for directions. One faces the rising sun, and so left is north, right is south.</p>
<A NAME="2316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1569><b>tc</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1465;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asoto</font>) would be the temporal clause using the infinitive construct with a pronoun (subject genitive). This would be &#8220;when he works.&#8221; Several follow the Syriac with &#8220;I seek him.&#8221; The LXX has &#8220;[when] he turns.&#8221; R. Gordis (<i>Job</i>, 261) notes that there is no need to emend the text; he shows a link to the Arabic cognate <i>ghasa</i>, &#8220;to cover.&#8221; To him this is a perfect parallel to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1496;&#1465;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">tof</font>, &#8220;covers himself&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="2317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1570><b>tn</b> The verb is the apocopated form of the imperfect. The object is supplied.</p>
<A NAME="2318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1571><b>tn</b> The MT has &#8220;he turns,&#8221; but the Syriac and Vulgate have &#8220;I turn.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1572><b>tn</b> The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456; &#1506;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">derekh </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">immadi</font>) means &#8220;the way with me,&#8221; i.e., &#8220;the way that I take.&#8221; The Syriac has &#8220;my way and my standing.&#8221; Several commentators prefer &#8220;the way of my standing,&#8221; meaning where to look for me. J. Reider offers &#8220;the way of my life&#8221; (&#8220;Some notes to the text of the scriptures,&#8221; <i>HUCA</i> 3 [1926]: 115). Whatever the precise wording, Job knows that God can always find him.</p>
<A NAME="2320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1573><b>tn</b> There is a perfect verb followed by an imperfect in this clause with the protasis and apodosis relationship (see GKC 493 §159.<i>b</i>).</p>
<A NAME="2321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1574><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my foot.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1575><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;held fast.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1576><b>tn</b> The last clause, &#8220;and I have not turned aside,&#8221; functions adverbially in the sentence. The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1496;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">at</font>) is a pausal form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">atteh</font>), the Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">natah</font>, &#8220;stretch out&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="2324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1577><b>tc</b> The form in the MT (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1495;&#1467;&#1511;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mekhuqqi</font>) means &#8220;more than my portion&#8221; or &#8220;more than my law.&#8221; An expanded meaning results in &#8220;more than my necessary food&#8221; (see Ps 119:11; cf. KJV, NASB, ESV). <i>HALOT</i> 346 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1511;</font> 1 indicates that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khoq</font>) has the meaning of &#8220;portion&#8221; and is here a reference to &#8220;what is appointed for me.&#8221; The LXX and the Latin versions, along with many commentators, have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1461;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿkheqi</font>, &#8220;in my bosom&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="2325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1578><b>tc</b> The MT has &#8220;But he [is] in one.&#8221; Many add the word &#8220;mind&#8221; to capture the point that God is resolute and unchanging. Some commentators find this too difficult, and so change the text from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ekhad</font>, here &#8220;unchangeable&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bakhar</font>, &#8220;he has chosen&#8221;). The wording in the text is idiomatic and should be retained. R. Gordis (<i>Job</i>, 262) translates it &#8220;he is one, i.e., unchangeable, fixed, determined.&#8221; The preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet</font>) is a <i>bet essentiae</i> &#8211; &#8220;and he [is] as one,&#8221; or &#8220;he is one&#8221; (see GKC 379 §119.<i>i</i>).</p>
<A NAME="2326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1579><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;cause him to return.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1580><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;his soul.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1581><b>tn</b> The text has &#8220;my decree,&#8221; which means &#8220;the decree [plan] for/against me.&#8221; The suffix is objective, equivalent to a dative of disadvantage. The Syriac and the Vulgate actually have &#8220;his decree.&#8221; R. Gordis (<i>Job</i>, 262) suggests taking it in the same sense as in Job 14:5: &#8220;my limit.&#8221;.</p>
<A NAME="2329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1582><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and many such [things] are with him.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The text is saying that many similar situations are under God&#8217;s rule of the world &#8211; his plans are infinite.</p>
<A NAME="2330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1583><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1461;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kherakh</font>) means &#8220;to be tender&#8221;; in the Piel it would have the meaning &#8220;to soften.&#8221; The word is used in parallel constructions with the verbs for &#8220;fear.&#8221; The implication is that God has made Job fearful.</p>
<A NAME="2331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1584><b>tn</b> This is a very difficult verse. The Hebrew text literally says: &#8220;for I have not been destroyed because of darkness, and because of my face [which] gloom has covered.&#8221; Most commentators omit the negative adverb, which gives the meaning that Job is enveloped in darkness and reduced to terror. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nitsmatti</font>) means &#8220;I have been silent&#8221; (as in Arabic and Aramaic), and so obviously the negative must be retained &#8211; he has not been silent.</p>
