<A NAME="3729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2227><b>tn</b> The MT has &#8220;out of the north comes gold.&#8221; Left in that sense the line seems irrelevant. The translation &#8220;golden splendor&#8221; (with RV, RSV, NRSV, NIV) depends upon the context of theophany. Others suggest &#8220;golden rays&#8221; (Dhorme), the aurora borealis (Graetz, Gray), or some mythological allusion (Pope), such as Baal&#8217;s palace. Golden rays or splendor is what is intended, although the reference is not to a natural phenomenon &#8211; it is something that would suggest the glory of God. </p>
