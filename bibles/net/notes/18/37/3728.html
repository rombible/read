<A NAME="3728"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2226><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and cleaned them.&#8221; The referent is the clouds (v. 18), which has been supplied in the translation for clarity. There is another way of reading this verse: the word translated &#8220;bright&#8221; means &#8220;dark; obscured&#8221; in Syriac. In this interpretation the first line would mean that they could not see the sun, because it was darkened by the clouds, but then the wind came and blew the clouds away. Dhorme, Gray, and several others take it this way, as does the NAB.</p>
