<A NAME="3731"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2229><b>tn</b> The MT places the major disjunctive accent (the <font face="Scholar">atnach</font>) under &#8220;power,&#8221; indicating that &#8220;and justice&#8221; as a disjunctive clause starting the second half of the verse (with ESV, NASB, NIV, NLT). Ignoring the Masoretic accent, NRSV has &#8220;he is great in power and justice.&#8221;</p>
