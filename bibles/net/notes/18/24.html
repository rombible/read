<A NAME="241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1585><b>tn</b> The preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">min</font>) is used to express the cause (see GKC 389 §121.<i>f</i>).</p>
<A NAME="242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1586><b>tc</b> The LXX reads &#8220;Why are times hidden from the Almighty?&#8221; as if to say that God is not interested in the events on the earth. The MT reading is saying that God fails to set the times for judgment and vindication and makes good sense as it stands.</p>
<A NAME="243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1587><b>tn</b> The line is short: &#8220;they move boundary stones.&#8221; So some commentators have supplied a subject, such as &#8220;wicked men.&#8221; The reason for its being wicked men is that to move the boundary stone was to encroach dishonestly on the lands of others (Deut 19:14; 27:17).</p>
<A NAME="244"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1588><b>tc</b> The LXX reads &#8220;and their shepherd.&#8221; Many commentators accept this reading. But the MT says that they graze the flocks that they have stolen. The difficulty with the MT reading is that there is no suffix on the final verb &#8211; but that is not an insurmountable difference.</p>
<A NAME="245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1589><b>sn</b> Because of the violence and oppression of the wicked, the poor and needy, the widows and orphans, all are deprived of their rights and forced out of the ways and into hiding just to survive.</p>
<A NAME="246"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1590><b>tc</b> The verse begins with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hen</font>); but the LXX, Vulgate, and Syriac all have &#8220;like.&#8221; R. Gordis (<i>Job</i>, 265) takes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hen</font>) as a pronoun &#8220;they&#8221; and supplies the comparative. The sense of the verse is clear in either case.</p>
<A NAME="247"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1591><b>tn</b> That is, &#8220;the poor.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1592><b>tc</b> The MT has &#8220;in the working/labor of them,&#8221; or &#8220;when they labor.&#8221; Some commentators simply omit these words. Dhorme retains them and moves them to go with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1512;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aravah</font>), which he takes to mean &#8220;evening&#8221;; this gives a clause, &#8220;although they work until the evening.&#8221; Then, with many others, he takes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>) to be a negative and finishes the verse with &#8220;no food for the children.&#8221; Others make fewer changes in the text, and as a result do not come out with such a hopeless picture &#8211; there is some food found. The point is that they spend their time foraging for food, and they find just enough to survive, but it is a day-long activity. For Job, this shows how unrighteous the administration of the world actually is.</p>
<A NAME="249"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1593><b>tn</b> The verb is not included in the Hebrew text but is supplied in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="2410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1594><b>tc</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿlilo</font>) means &#8220;his fodder.&#8221; It is unclear to what this refers. If the suffix is taken as a collective, then it can be translated &#8220;they gather/reap their fodder.&#8221; The early versions all have &#8220;they reap in a field which is not his&#8221; (taking it as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497; &#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bÿli lo</font>). A conjectural emendation would change the word to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ballaylah</font>, &#8220;in the night&#8221;). But there is no reason for this.</p>
<A NAME="2411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1595><b>tn</b> The verbs in this verse are uncertain. In the first line &#8220;reap&#8221; is used, and that would be the work of a hired man (and certainly not done at night). The meaning of this second verb is uncertain; it has been taken to mean &#8220;glean,&#8221; which would be the task of the poor. </p>
<A NAME="2412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1596><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;embrace&#8221; or &#8220;hug.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1597><b>tn</b> The verb with no expressed subject is here again taken in the passive: &#8220;they snatch&#8221; becomes &#8220;[child] is snatched.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1598><b>tn</b> This word is usually defined as &#8220;violence; ruin.&#8221; But elsewhere it does mean &#8220;breast&#8221; (Isa 60:16; 66:11), and that is certainly what it means here.</p>
<A NAME="2415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1599><b>tc</b> The MT has a very brief and strange reading: &#8220;they take as a pledge upon the poor.&#8221; This could be taken as &#8220;they take a pledge against the poor&#8221; (ESV). Kamphausen suggested that instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>, &#8220;against&#8221;) one should read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ul</font>, &#8220;suckling&#8221;). This is supported by the parallelism. &#8220;They take as pledge&#8221; is also made passive here. </p>
<A NAME="2416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1600><b>sn</b> The point should not be missed &#8211; amidst abundant harvests, carrying sheaves about, they are still going hungry.</p>
<A NAME="2417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1601><b>tc</b> The Hebrew term is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shurotam</font>), which may be translated &#8220;terraces&#8221; or &#8220;olive rows.&#8221; But that would not be the proper place to have a press to press the olives and make oil. E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 360-61) proposes on the analogy of an Arabic word that this should be read as &#8220;millstones&#8221; (which he would also write in the dual). But the argument does not come from a clean cognate, but from a possible development of words. The meaning of &#8220;olive rows&#8221; works well enough.</p>
<A NAME="2418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1602><b>tn</b> The final verb, a preterite with the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vav</font>) consecutive, is here interpreted as a circumstantial clause.</p>
<A NAME="2419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1603><b>tc</b> The MT as pointed reads &#8220;from the city of men they groan.&#8221; Most commentators change one vowel in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿtim</font>) to get <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">metim</font>) to get the active participle, &#8220;the dying.&#8221; This certainly fits the parallelism better, although sense could be made out of the MT.</p>
<A NAME="2420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1604><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the souls of the wounded,&#8221; which here refers to the wounded themselves.</p>
<A NAME="2421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1605><b>tc</b> The MT has the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tiflah</font>) which means &#8220;folly; tastelessness&#8221; (cf. 1:22). The verb, which normally means &#8220;to place; to put,&#8221; would then be rendered &#8220;to impute; to charge.&#8221; This is certainly a workable translation in the context. Many commentators have emended the text, changing the noun to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1508;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tÿfillah</font>, &#8220;prayer&#8221;), and so then also the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yasim</font>, here &#8220;charges&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yishma</font>&#8217;, &#8220;hears&#8221;). It reads: &#8220;But God does not hear the prayer&#8221; &#8211; referring to the groans.</p>
<A NAME="2422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1606><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;They are among those who.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1607><b>tn</b> The text simply has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">la</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">or</font>, &#8220;at light&#8221; or &#8220;at daylight&#8221;), probably meaning just at the time of dawn.</p>
<A NAME="2424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1608><b>tn</b> In a few cases the jussive is used without any real sense of the jussive being present (see GKC 323 §109.<i>k</i>).</p>
<A NAME="2425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1609><b>sn</b> The point is that he is like a thief in that he works during the night, just before the daylight, when the advantage is all his and the victim is most vulnerable.</p>
<A NAME="2426"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1610><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;saying.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2427"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1611><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;the robber&#8221; has been supplied in the English translation for clarification.</p>
<A NAME="2428"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1612><b>tc</b> This is not the idea of the adulterer, but of the thief. So some commentators reverse the order and put this verse after v. 14.</p>
<A NAME="2429"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1613><b>tc</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khittÿmu</font>) is the Piel from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khatam</font>, &#8220;to seal&#8221;). The verb is now in the plural, covering all the groups mentioned that work under the cover of darkness. The suggestion that they &#8220;seal,&#8221; i.e., &#8220;mark&#8221; the house they will rob, goes against the meaning of the word &#8220;seal.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2430"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1614><b>tc</b> Some commentators join this very short colon to the beginning of v. 17: &#8220;they do not know the light. For together&#8230;&#8221; becomes &#8220;for together they have not known the light.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2431"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1615><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;together.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2432"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1616><b>tc</b> Many commentators find vv. 18-24 difficult on the lips of Job, and so identify this unit as a misplaced part of the speech of Zophar. They describe the enormities of the wicked. But a case can also be made for retaining it in this section. Gordis thinks it could be taken as a quotation by Job of his friends&#8217; ideas.</p>
<A NAME="2433"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1617><b>tn</b> The verb &#8220;say&#8221; is not in the text; it is supplied here to indicate that this is a different section.</p>
<A NAME="2434"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1618><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;is swift.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2435"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1619><b>sn</b> The wicked person is described here as a spray or foam upon the waters, built up in the agitation of the waters but dying away swiftly.</p>
<A NAME="2436"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1620><b>tn</b> The text reads, &#8220;he does not turn by the way of the vineyards.&#8221; This means that since the land is cursed, he/one does not go there. Bickell emended &#8220;the way of the vineyards&#8221; to &#8220;the treader of the vineyard&#8221; (see RSV, NRSV). This would mean that &#8220;no wine-presser would turn towards&#8221; their vineyards.</p>
<A NAME="2437"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1621><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the waters of the snow.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2438"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1622><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;so Sheol.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2439"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1623><b>tn</b> This is the meaning of the verse, which in Hebrew only has &#8220;The grave / they have sinned.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2440"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1624><b>tn</b> Here &#8220;womb&#8221; is synecdoche, representing one&#8217;s mother.</p>
<A NAME="2441"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1625><b>tc</b> The form in the text is the active participle, &#8220;feed; graze; shepherd.&#8221; The idea of &#8220;prey&#8221; is not natural to it. R. Gordis (<i>Job</i>, 270) argues that third <font face="Scholar">he</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;</font>) verbs are often by-forms of geminate verbs, and so the meaning here is more akin to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">a</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to crush&#8221;). The LXX seems to have read something like <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1461;&#1512;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hera</font>&#8217;, &#8220;oppressed&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="2442"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1626><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the childless [woman], she does not give birth.&#8221; The verbal clause is intended to serve as a modifier here for the woman. See on subordinate verbal clauses GKC 490 §156.<i>d</i>, <i>f</i>.</p>
<A NAME="2443"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1627><b>tn</b> God has to be the subject of this clause. None is stated in the Hebrew text, but &#8220;God&#8221; has been supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2444"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1628><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (God) has been specified in the translation for clarity. See the note on the word &#8220;life&#8221; at the end of the line.</p>
<A NAME="2445"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1629><b>tn</b> This line has been given a number of interpretations due to its cryptic form. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yaqum</font>) means &#8220;he rises up.&#8221; It probably is meant to have God as the subject, and be subordinated as a temporal clause to what follows. The words &#8220;against him&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text, but have been supplied in the translation to specify the object and indicate that &#8220;rise up&#8221; is meant in a hostile sense. The following verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;&#1497;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿlo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">-ya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amin</font>), by its very meaning of &#8220;and he does not believe,&#8221; cannot have God as the subject, but must refer to the wicked.</p>
<A NAME="2446"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1630><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (God) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2447"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1631><b>tn</b> The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1489;&#1462;&#1496;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lavetakh</font>, &#8220;in security&#8221;) precedes the verb that it qualifies &#8211; God &#8220;allows him to take root in security.&#8221; For the meaning of the verb, see Job 8:15.</p>
<A NAME="2448"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1632><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his eyes are on.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2449"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1633><b>sn</b> The meaning of the verse is that God may allow the wicked to rest in comfort and security, but all the time he is watching them closely with the idea of bringing judgment on them.</p>
<A NAME="2450"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1634><b>tn</b> The Hebrew throughout this section (vv. 18-24) interchanges the singular and the plural. Here again we have &#8220;they are exalted&#8230;but he is not.&#8221; The verse is clear nonetheless: the wicked rise high, and then suddenly they are gone.</p>
<A NAME="2451"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1635><b>tn</b> The verb is the Hophal of the rare verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">makhakh</font>), which seems to mean &#8220;to bend; to collapse.&#8221; The text would read &#8220;they are made to collapse like all others.&#8221; There is no reason here to change &#8220;like others&#8221; just because the MT is banal. But many do, following the LXX with &#8220;like mallows.&#8221; The LXX was making a translation according to sense. R. Gordis (<i>Job</i>, 271) prefers &#8220;like grass.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2452"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=1636><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qafats</font>) actually means &#8220;to shut in,&#8221; which does not provide exactly the idea of being gathered, not directly at least. But a change to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1496;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qataf</font>, &#8220;pluck&#8221;) while attractive, is not necessary.</p>
<A NAME="2453"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1637><b>sn</b> This marks the end of the disputed section, taken here to be a quotation by Job of their sentiments.</p>
<A NAME="2454"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1638><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>, &#8220;not&#8221;) is used here substantivally (&#8220;nothing&#8221;).</p>
