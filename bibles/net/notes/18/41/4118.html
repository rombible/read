<A NAME="4118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2374><b>tc</b> MT has &#8220;before me&#8221; and can best be rendered as &#8220;Who then is he that can stand before me?&#8221; (ESV, NASB, NIV, NLT, NJPS). The following verse (11) favors the MT since both express the lesson to be learned from Leviathan: If a man cannot stand up to Leviathan, how can he stand up to its creator? The translation above has chosen to read the text as &#8220;before him&#8221; (cf. NRSV, NJB).</p>
