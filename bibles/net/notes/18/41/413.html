<A NAME="413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2359><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shaqa</font>&#8217;) means &#8220;to cause to sink,&#8221; if it is connected with the word in Amos 8:8 and 9:5. But it may have the sense of &#8220;to tie; to bind.&#8221; If the rope were put around the tongue and jaw, binding tightly would be the sense.</p>
