<A NAME="4116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2372><b>tn</b> There is an interrogative particle in this line, which most commentators ignore. But others freely emend the MT. Gunkel, following the mythological approach, has &#8220;his appearance casts down even a god.&#8221; Cheyne likewise has: &#8220;even divine beings the fear of him brings low&#8221; (<i>JQR </i>9 [1896/97]: 579). Pope has, &#8220;Were not the gods cast down at the sight of him?&#8221; There is no need to bring in this mythological element.</p>
