<A NAME="4137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2393><b>tc</b> This verse has created all kinds of problems for the commentators. The first part is workable: &#8220;when he raises himself up, the mighty [the gods] are terrified.&#8221; The mythological approach would render <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elim</font>) as &#8220;gods.&#8221; But the last two words, which could be rendered &#8220;at the breaking [crashing, or breakers] they fail,&#8221; receive much attention. E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 639) suggests &#8220;majesty&#8221; for &#8220;raising up&#8221; and &#8220;billows&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">gallim</font>) for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elim</font>), and gets a better parallelism: &#8220;the billows are afraid of his majesty, and the waves draw back.&#8221; But H. H. Rowley (<i>Job</i> [NCBC], 263) does not think this is relevant to the context, which is talking about the creature&#8217;s defense against attack. The RSV works well for the first part, but the second part need some change; so Rowley adopts &#8220;in their dire consternation they are beside themselves.&#8221;</p>
