<A NAME="3410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2063><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has only &#8220;my arrow.&#8221; Some commentators emend that word slightly to get &#8220;my wound.&#8221; But the idea could be derived from &#8220;arrows&#8221; as well, the wounds caused by the arrows. The arrows are symbolic of God&#8217;s affliction.</p>
