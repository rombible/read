<A NAME="3453"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=2106><b>tn</b> The word translated &#8220;alike&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;together&#8221;) has bothered some interpreters. In the reading taken here it is acceptable. But others have emended it to gain a verb, such as &#8220;he visits&#8221; (Beer), &#8220;he watches over&#8221; (Duhm), &#8220;he is compassionate&#8221; (Kissane), etc. But it is sufficient to say &#8220;he is over.&#8221;</p>
