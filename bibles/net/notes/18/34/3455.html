<A NAME="3455"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=2108><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has only &#8220;I lift up&#8221; or &#8220;I bear&#8221; (= I endure). The reading &#8220;I have been led astray&#8221; is obtained by changing the vowels to read a passive. If the MT is retained, an object has to be supplied, such as &#8220;chastisement&#8221; (so RSV, NASB) or &#8220;punishment&#8221; (NRSV). If not, then a different reading would be followed (e.g., &#8220;I was misguided&#8221; [NAB]; &#8220;I am guilty&#8221; [NIV]).</p>
