<A NAME="3426"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2079><b>tc</b> This is the reading following the <i>Qere</i>. The <i>Kethib</i> and the Syriac and the LXX suggest a reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yasim</font>, &#8220;if he [God] recalls&#8221;). But this would require leaving out &#8220;his heart,&#8221; and would also require redividing the verse to make &#8220;his spirit&#8221; the object. It makes better parallelism, but may require too many changes.</p>
