<A NAME="349"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2062><b>tn</b> The verb is the Piel imperfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kazav</font>), meaning &#8220;to lie.&#8221; It could be a question: &#8220;Should I lie [against my right?] &#8211; when I am innocent. If it is repointed to the Pual<i>,</i> then it can be &#8220;I am made to lie,&#8221; or &#8220;I am deceived.&#8221; Taking it as a question makes good sense here, and so emendations are unnecessary.</p>
