<A NAME="3445"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=2098><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;under wicked men,&#8221; or &#8220;under wickednesses.&#8221; J. C. Greenfield shows that the preposition can mean &#8220;among&#8221; as well (&#8220;Prepositions B Tachat in Jes 57:5,&#8221; <i>ZAW </i>32 [1961]: 227). That would allow &#8220;among wicked men.&#8221; It could also be &#8220;instead of&#8221; or even &#8220;in return for [their wickedness]&#8221; which is what the RSV does.</p>
