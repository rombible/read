<A NAME="3462"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=2115><b>tc</b> The MT reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avi</font>, &#8220;my father&#8221;), which makes no sense. Some follow the KJV and emend the word to make a verb &#8220;I desire&#8221; or use the noun &#8220;my desire of it.&#8221; Others follow an Arabic word meaning &#8220;entreat, I pray&#8221; (cf. ESV, &#8220;Would that Job were tried&#8221;). The LXX and the Syriac versions have &#8220;but&#8221; and &#8220;surely&#8221; respectively. Since this is the only <sc>ms support, albeit weak, it may be the best choice. In this sense Elihu would be saying that because of Job&#8217;s attitude God will continue to test him.</p>
