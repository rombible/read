<A NAME="3423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2076><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">paqad</font>) means &#8220;to visit; to appoint; to number.&#8221; Here it means &#8220;to entrust&#8221; for care and governing. The implication would be that there would be someone higher than God &#8211; which is what Elihu is repudiating by the rhetorical question. No one entrusted God with this.</p>
