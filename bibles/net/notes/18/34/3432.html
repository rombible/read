<A NAME="3432"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2085><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Does one say,&#8221; although some smooth it out to say &#8220;Is it fit to say?&#8221; For the reading &#8220;who says,&#8221; the form has to be repointed to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1488;&#1465;&#1502;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">omer</font>) meaning, &#8220;who is the one saying.&#8221; This reading is supported by the LXX, Vulgate, and Syriac. Also it seems to flow better with the following verse. It would be saying that God is over the rulers and can rebuke them. The former view is saying that no one rebukes kings, much less Job rebuking God.</p>
