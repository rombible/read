<A NAME="3441"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=2094><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for he does not put upon man yet.&#8221; This has been given a wide variety of interpretations, all of which involve a lot of additional thoughts. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">od</font>, &#8220;yet, still&#8221;) has been replaced with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1506;&#1461;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ed</font>, &#8220;an appointed time,&#8221; Reiske and Wright), with the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mem</font>) having dropped out by haplography. This makes good sense. If the MT is retained, the best interpretation would be that God does not any more consider (from &#8220;place upon the heart&#8221;) man, that he might appear in judgment.</p>
