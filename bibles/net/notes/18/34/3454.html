<A NAME="3454"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=2107><b>tn</b> This last verse is difficult because it is unbalanced and cryptic. Some have joined the third line of v. 29 with this entire verse to make a couplet. But the same result is achieved by simply regarding this verse as the purpose of v. 29. But there still are some words that must be added. In the first colon, &#8220;[he is over the nations]&#8230;<i>preventing</i> from ruling.&#8221; And in the second colon, &#8220;laying&#8221; has to be supplied before &#8220;snares.&#8221;</p>
