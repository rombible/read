<A NAME="1122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=837><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;deeper than hell.&#8221; The word &#8220;Sheol&#8221; always poses problems for translation. Here because it is the opposite of heaven in this merism, &#8220;hell&#8221; would be a legitimate translation. It refers to the realm of the dead &#8211; the grave and beyond. The language is excessive; but the point is that God&#8217;s wisdom is immeasurable &#8211; and Job is powerless before it.</p>
