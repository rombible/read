<A NAME="1124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=839><b>tn</b> The verb is the Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sagar</font>, &#8220;to close; to shut&#8221;) and so here in this context it probably means something like &#8220;to shut in; to confine.&#8221; But this is a difficult meaning, and the sentence is cryptic. E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 162) thinks this word and the next have to be antithetical, and so he suggests from a meaning &#8220;to keep confined&#8221; the idea of keeping a matter secret; and with the next verb, &#8220;to convene an assembly,&#8221; he offers &#8220;to divulge it.&#8221;</p>
