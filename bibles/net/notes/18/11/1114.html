<A NAME="1114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=829><b>tn</b> The text seems to be saying &#8220;that it [wisdom] is double in understanding.&#8221; The point is that it is different than Job conceived it &#8211; it far exceeded all perception. But some commentators have thought this still too difficult, and so have replaced the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khiflayim</font>, &#8220;two sides&#8221;) with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khifla</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>, &#8220;like wonders,&#8221; or, more simply, &#8220;wonders&#8221; without the preposition). But it is still a little strange to talk about God&#8217;s wisdom being like wonders. Others have had more radical changes in the text; J. J. Slotki has &#8220;for sound wisdom is his. And know that double [punishment] shall God exact of you&#8221; (&#8220;Job 11:6,&#8221; <i>VT </i>35 [1985]: 229-30).</p>
