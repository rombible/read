<A NAME="1138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=853><b>tn</b> Many commentators follow the Vulgate and read the line &#8220;if you put away the sin that is in your hand.&#8221; They do this because the imperative comes between the protasis (v. 13) and the apodosis (v. 15) and does not appear to be clearly part of the protasis. The idea is close to the MT, but the MT is much more forceful &#8211; if you find sin in your hand, get rid of it.</p>
