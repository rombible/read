<A NAME="112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=817><b>tc</b> The LXX, Targum Job, Symmachus, and Vulgate all assume that the vocalization of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1465;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rov</font>, &#8220;abundance&#8221;) should be <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rav</font>, &#8220;great&#8221;): &#8220;great of words.&#8221; This would then mean &#8220;one who is abundant of words,&#8221; meaning, &#8220;a man of many words,&#8221; and make a closer parallel to the second half. But the MT makes good sense as it stands.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> There is no article or demonstrative with the word; it has been added here simply to make a smoother connection between the chapters.</p>
