<A NAME="1131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=846><b>tn</b> Some commentators do not take this last clause as a question, but simply as a statement, namely, that when God sees evil he does not need to ponder or consider it &#8211; he knows it instantly. In that case it would be a circumstantial clause: &#8220;without considering it.&#8221; D. J. A. Clines lists quite an array of other interpretations for the line (<i>Job </i>[WBC], 255); for example, &#8220;and he is himself unobserved&#8221;; taking the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;) as an emphatic; taking the negative as a noun, &#8220;considering them as nothing&#8221;; and others that change the verb to &#8220;they do not understand it.&#8221; But none of these are compelling; they offer no major improvement.</p>
