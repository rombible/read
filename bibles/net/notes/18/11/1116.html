<A NAME="1116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=831><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;God causes to be forgotten for you part of your iniquity.&#8221; The meaning is that God was exacting less punishment from Job than Job deserved, for Job could not remember all his sins. This statement is fitting for Zophar, who is the cruelest of Job&#8217;s friends (see H. H. Rowley, <i>Job</i> [NCBC], 88). Others in an attempt to improve the text make too many unwarranted changes. Some would read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1500;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yish</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alkha</font>, &#8220;he asks of you&#8221;) instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492; &#1500;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yasseh lÿka</font>, &#8220;he causes to be forgotten for you&#8221;). This would mean that God demands an account of Job&#8217;s sin. But, as D. J. A. Clines says, this change is weak and needless (<i>Job </i>[WBC], 254-55).</p>
