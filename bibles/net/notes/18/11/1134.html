<A NAME="1134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=849><b>tn</b> The Hebrew uses the perfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kun</font>, &#8220;establish&#8221;) with the object &#8220;your heart.&#8221; The verb can be translated &#8220;prepare, fix, make firm&#8221; your heart. To fix the heart is to make it faithful and constant, the heart being the seat of the will and emotions. The use of the perfect here does not refer to the past, but should be given a future perfect sense &#8211; if you shall have fixed your heart, i.e., prove faithful. Job would have to make his heart secure, so that he was no longer driven about by differing views.</p>
