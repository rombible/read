<A NAME="1136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=851><b>sn</b> This is the posture of prayer (see Isa 1:15). The expression means &#8220;spread out your palms,&#8221; probably meaning that the one praying would fall to his knees, put his forehead to the ground, and spread out his hands in front of him on the ground.</p>
