<A NAME="1032"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=789><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1511;&#1467;&#1464;&#1464;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pÿquddah</font>), originally translated &#8220;visitation,&#8221; actually refers to any divine intervention for blessing on the life. Here it would include the care and overseeing of the life of Job. &#8220;Providence&#8221; may be too general for the translation, but it is not far from the meaning of this line. The LXX has &#8220;your oversight.&#8221;</p>
