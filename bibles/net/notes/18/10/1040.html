<A NAME="1040"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=797><b>tn</b> The last clause is difficult to fit into the verse. It translates easily enough: &#8220;and see my affliction.&#8221; Many commentators follow the suggestion of Geiger to read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1456;&#1493;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rÿveh</font>, &#8220;watered with&#8221;) instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eh</font>, &#8220;see&#8221;). This could then be interpreted adjectivally and parallel to the preceding line: &#8220;steeped/saturated with affliction.&#8221; This would also delete the final <i>yod</i> as dittography (E. Dhorme, <i>Job</i>, 152). But D. J. A. Clines notes more recent interpretations that suggest the form in the text is an orthographic variant of <i>raweh</i> meaning &#8220;satiated.&#8221; This makes any emendation unnecessary (and in fact that idea of &#8220;steeped&#8221; was not helpful any way because it indicated imbibing rather than soaking). The NIV renders it &#8220;and drowned in my affliction&#8221; although footnoting the other possibility from the MT, &#8220;aware of my affliction&#8221; (assuming the form could be adjectival). The LXX omits the last line.</p>
