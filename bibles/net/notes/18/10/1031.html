<A NAME="1031"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=788><b>tn</b> E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 150) suggests that the relation between these two words is like a hendiadys. In other words, &#8220;life,&#8221; which he says is made prominent by the shift of the copula, specifies the nature of the grace. He renders it &#8220;the favor of life.&#8221; D. J. A. Clines at least acknowledges that the expression &#8220;you showed loyal love with me&#8221; is primary. There are many other attempts to improve the translation of this unusual combination.</p>
