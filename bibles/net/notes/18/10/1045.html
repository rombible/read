<A NAME="1045"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=802><b>tn</b> The text has &#8220;you renew/increase your witnesses.&#8221; This would probably mean Job&#8217;s sufferings, which were witness to his sins. But some suggested a different word here, one that is cognate to Arabic &#8217;<font face="Scholar">adiya</font><i>,</i> &#8220;to be an enemy; to be hostile&#8221;: thus &#8220;you renew your hostility against me.&#8221; Less convincing are suggestions that the word is cognate to Ugaritic &#8220;troops&#8221; (see W. G. E. Watson, &#8220;The Metaphor in Job 10,17,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 63 [1982]: 255-57).</p>
