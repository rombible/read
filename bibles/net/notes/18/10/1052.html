<A NAME="1052"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=809><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;put from me,&#8221; an expression found nowhere else. The <i>Qere</i> has a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vav</font>) and not a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yod</font>), forming an imperative rather than an imperfect. H. H. Rowley suggests that there is an ellipsis here, &#8220;hand&#8221; needing to be supplied. Job wanted God to take his hand away from him. That is plausible, but difficult.</p>
