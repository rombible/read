<A NAME="1054"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=811><b>sn</b> The verbs are simple, &#8220;I go&#8221; and &#8220;I return&#8221;; but Job clearly means before he dies. A translation of &#8220;depart&#8221; comes closer to communicating this. The second verb may be given a potential imperfect translation to capture the point. The NIV offered more of an interpretive paraphrase: &#8220;before I go to the place of no return.&#8221;</p>
