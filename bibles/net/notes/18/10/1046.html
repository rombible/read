<A NAME="1046"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=803><b>tn</b> The Hebrew simply says &#8220;changes and a host are with me.&#8221; The &#8220;changes and a host&#8221; is taken as a hendiadys, meaning relieving troops (relief troops of the army). The two words appear together again in 14:14, showing that emendation is to be avoided. The imagery depicts blow after blow from God &#8211; always fresh attacks.</p>
