<A NAME="1041"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=798><b>tn</b> The MT has the 3rd person of the verb, &#8220;and he lifts himself up.&#8221; One might assume that the subject is &#8220;my head&#8221; &#8211; but that is rather far removed from the verb. It appears that Job is talking about himself in some way. Some commentators simply emend the text to make it first person. This has the support of Targum Job, which would be expected since it would be interpreting the passage in its context (see D. M. Stec, &#8220;The Targum Rendering of WYG&#8217;H in Job X 16,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 34 [1984]: 367-8). Pope and Gordis make the word adjectival, modifying the subject: &#8220;proudly you hunt me,&#8221; but support is lacking. E. Dhorme thinks the line should be parallel to the two preceding it, and so suggests <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1490;&#1468;&#1461;&#1506;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yagea</font>&#8217;,<i> </i>&#8220;exhausted&#8221;) for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yig</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eh</font>, &#8220;lift up&#8221;). The contextual argument is that Job has said that he cannot raise his head, but if he were to do so, God would hunt him down. God could be taken as the subject of the verb if the text is using enallage (shifting of grammatical persons within a discourse) for dramatic effect. Perhaps the initial 3rd person was intended with respect within a legal context of witnesses and a complaint, but was switched to 2nd person for direct accusation.</p>
