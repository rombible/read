<A NAME="1022"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=779><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;together round about and you destroy me.&#8221; The second half of this verse is very difficult. Most commentators follow the LXX and connect the first two words with the second colon as the MT accents indicate (NJPS, &#8220;then destroyed every part of me&#8221;), rather than with the first colon (&#8220;and made me complete,&#8221; J. E. Hartley, <i>Job</i> [NICOT], 185). Instead of &#8220;together&#8221; some read &#8220;after.&#8221; Others see in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">saviv</font>) not so much an adjectival use but a verbal or adverbial use: &#8220;you turn and destroy&#8221; or &#8220;you destroy utterly (all around).&#8221; This makes more sense than &#8220;turn.&#8221; In addition, the verb form in the line is the preterite with <i>vav</i> consecutive; this may be another example of the transposition of the copula (see 4:6). For yet another option (&#8220;You have engulfed me about altogether&#8221;), see R. Fuller, &#8220;Exodus 21:22: The Miscarriage Interpretation and the Personhood of the Fetus,&#8221; <i>JETS</i> 37 (1994): 178. </p>
