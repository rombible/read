<A NAME="1014"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=771><b>sn</b> In this verse Job asks whether or not God is liable to making mistakes or errors of judgment. He wonders if God has no more insight than his friends have. Of course, the questions are rhetorical, for he knows otherwise. But his point is that God seems to be making a big mistake here.</p>
