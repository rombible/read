<A NAME="1023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=780><b>tn</b> The preposition &#8220;like&#8221; creates a small tension here. So some ignore the preposition and read &#8220;clay&#8221; as an adverbial accusative of the material (GKC 371 §117.<i>hh</i> but cf. 379 §119.<i>i</i> with reference to <i>beth essentiae</i>: &#8220;as it were, by clay&#8221;). The NIV gets around the problem with a different meaning for the verb: &#8220;you molded me like clay.&#8221; Some suggest the meaning was &#8220;as [with] clay&#8221; (in the same manner that we have &#8220;as [in] the day of Midian&#8221; [Isa 9:4]).</p>
