<A NAME="108"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=765><b>tn</b> The construction uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) with the imperfect verb &#8211; &#8220;that you oppress.&#8221; Technically, this clause serves as the subject, and &#8220;good&#8221; is the predicate adjective. In such cases one often uses an English infinitive to capture the point: &#8220;Is it good for you to oppress?&#8221; The LXX changes the meaning considerably: &#8220;Is it good for you if I am unrighteous, for you have disowned the work of your hands.&#8221;</p>
