<A NAME="41"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=235><b>sn</b> The speech of Eliphaz can be broken down into three main sections. In 4:1-11 he wonders that Job who had comforted so many people in trouble, and who was so pious, should fall into such despair, forgetting the great truth that the righteous never perish under affliction &#8211; calamity only destroys the wicked. Then in 4:12&#8211;5:7 Eliphaz tries to warn Job about complaining against God because only the ungodly resent the dealings of God and by their impatience bring down his wrath upon them. Finally in 5:8-27 Eliphaz appeals to Job to follow a different course, to seek after God, for God only smites to heal or to correct, to draw people to himself and away from evil. See K. Fullerton, &#8220;Double Entendre in the First Speech of Eliphaz,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 49 (1930): 320-74; J. C. L. Gibson, &#8220;Eliphaz the Temanite: A Portrait of a Hebrew Philosopher,&#8221; <i>SJT</i> 28 (1975): 259-72; and J.
