<A NAME="45"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=239><b>tn</b> The verb means &#8220;to be weary.&#8221; But it can have the extended sense of being either exhausted or impatient (see v. 5). A. B. Davidson (<i>Job</i>, 29) takes it in the sense of &#8220;will it be too much for you?&#8221; There is nothing in the sentence that indicates this should be an interrogative clause; it is simply an imperfect. But in view of the juxtaposition of the first part, this seems to make good sense. E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 42) has &#8220;Shall we address you? You are dejected.&#8221;</p>
