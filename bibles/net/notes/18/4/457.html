<A NAME="457"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=291><b>tn</b> The classification of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">min</font>) as a comparative in this verse (NIV, &#8220;more righteous than God&#8221;; cf. also KJV, ASV, NCV) does not seem the most probable. The idea of someone being more righteous than God is too strong to be reasonable. Job will not do that &#8211; but he will imply that God is unjust. In addition, Eliphaz had this vision before hearing of Job&#8217;s trouble and so is not addressing the idea that Job is making himself more righteous than God. He is stating that no man is righteous before God. Verses 18-21 will show that no one can claim righteousness before God. In 9:2 and 25:4 the preposition &#8220;with&#8221; is used. See also Jer 51:5 where the preposition should be rendered &#8220;before&#8221; [the Holy One].</p>
