<A NAME="473"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=307><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yeter</font>, here with the suffix, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1501;</font> [<font face="Scholar">yitram</font>]) can mean &#8220;what remains&#8221; or &#8220;rope.&#8221; Of the variety of translations, the most frequently used idea seems to be &#8220;their rope,&#8221; meaning their tent cord. This would indicate that their life was compared to a tent &#8211; perfectly reasonable in a passage that has already used the image &#8220;houses of clay.&#8221; The difficulty is that the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nasa</font>&#8217;) means more properly &#8220;to tear up; to uproot.&#8221; and not &#8220;to cut off.&#8221; A similar idea is found in Isa 38:12, but there the image is explicitly that of cutting the life off from the loom. Some have posited that the original must have said their tent peg was pulled up&#8221; as in Isa 33:20 (A. B. Davidson, <i>Job</i>, 34; cf. NAB). But perhaps the idea of &#8220;what remains&#8221; would be easier to defend here. Besides, it is used in 22:20. The wealth of an individual is what has been acquired and usually is left over when he dies. Here it would mean that the superfluous wealth would be snatched away. The preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet</font>) would carry the meaning &#8220;from&#8221; with this verb.</p>
