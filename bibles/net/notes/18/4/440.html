<A NAME="440"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=274><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ganav</font>) means &#8220;to steal.&#8221; The Pual form in this verse is probably to be taken as a preterite since it requires a past tense translation: &#8220;it was stolen for me&#8221; meaning it was brought to me stealthily (see 2 Sam 19:3).</p>
