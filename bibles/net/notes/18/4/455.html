<A NAME="455"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=289><b>tn</b> The word for man here is first <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">enosh</font>), stressing man in all his frailty, his mortality. This is paralleled with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gever</font>), a word that would stress more of the strength or might of man. The verse is not making a great contrast between the two, but it is rhetorical question merely stating that no human being of any kind is righteous or pure before God the Creator. See H. Kosmala, &#8220;The Term <i>geber</i> in the OT and in the Scrolls,&#8221; VTSup 17 (1969): 159-69; and E. Jacob, <i>Theology of the Old Testament</i>, 156-57.</p>
