<A NAME="468"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=302><b>tn</b> The prepositional compound <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lifne</font>) normally has the sense of &#8220;before,&#8221; but it has been used already in 3:24 in the sense of &#8220;like.&#8221; That is the most natural meaning of this line. Otherwise, the interpretation must offer some explanation of a comparison between how quickly a moth and a human can be crushed. There are suggestions for different readings here; see for example G. R. Driver, &#8220;Linguistic and Textual Problems: Jeremiah,&#8221; <i>JQR</i> 28 (1937/38): 97-129 for a change to &#8220;bird&#8217;s nest&#8221;; and J. A. Rimbach, &#8220;&#8216;Crushed before the Moth&#8217; (Job 4:19),&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 100 (1981): 244-46, for a change of the verb to &#8220;they are pure before their Maker.&#8221; However, these are unnecessary emendations.</p>
