<A NAME="465"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=299><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1459;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">toholah</font>) is a <i>hapax legomenon</i>, and so has created some confusion in the various translations. It seems to mean &#8220;error; folly.&#8221; The word is translated &#8220;perverseness&#8221; in the LXX; but Symmachus connects it with the word for &#8220;madness.&#8221; &#8220;Some commentators have repointed the word to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tÿhillah</font>, &#8220;praise&#8221;) making the line read: &#8220;he finds no [cause for] praise in his angels.&#8221; Others suggest <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tiflah</font>, &#8220;offensiveness, silliness&#8221;) a bigger change; this matches the idiom in Job 24:12. But if the etymology of the word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">halal</font>, &#8220;to be mad&#8221;) then that change is not necessary. The feminine noun &#8220;madness&#8221; still leaves the meaning of the line a little uncertain: &#8220;[if] he does not impute madness to his angels.&#8221; The point of the verse is that God finds flaws in his angels and does not put his trust in them.</p>
