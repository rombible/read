<A NAME="433"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=267><b>sn</b> Eliphaz takes up a new image here to make the point that the wicked are destroyed &#8211; the breaking up and scattering of a den of lions. There are several words for &#8220;lion&#8221; used in this section. D. J. A. Clines observes that it is probably impossible to distinguish them (<i>Job </i>[WBC], 109, 110, which records some bibliography of those who have tried to work on the etymologies and meanings). The first is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1497;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aryeh</font>) the generic term for &#8220;lion.&#8221; It is followed by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shakhal</font>) which, like <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1508;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kÿfir</font>), is a &#8220;young lion.&#8221; Some have thought that the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shakhal</font>) is a lion-like animal, perhaps a panther or leopard. KBL takes it by metathesis from Arabic &#8220;young one.&#8221; The LXX for this verse has &#8220;the strength of the lion, and the voice of the lioness and the exulting cry of serpents are quenched.&#8221;</p>
