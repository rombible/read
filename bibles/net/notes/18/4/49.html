<A NAME="49"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=243><b>tn</b> The parallelism again uses a perfect verb in the first colon and an imperfect in the second; but since the sense of the line is clearly what Job has done in the past, the second verb may be treated as a preterite, or a customary imperfect &#8211; what Job repeatedly did in the past (GKC 315 §107.<i>e</i>). The words in this verse may have double meanings. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yasar</font>, &#8220;teach, discipline&#8221;) may have the idea of instruction and correction, but also the connotation of strength (see Y. Hoffmann, &#8220;The Use of Equivocal Words in the First Speech of Eliphaz [Job IV&#8211;V],&#8221; <i>VT</i> 30 [1980]: 114-19).</p>
