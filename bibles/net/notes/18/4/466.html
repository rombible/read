<A NAME="466"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=300><b>sn</b> <i>Those who live in houses of clay</i> are human beings, for the human body was made of clay (Job 10:9; 33:6; and Isa 64:7). In 2 Cor 4:7 the body is an &#8220;earthen vessel&#8221; &#8211; a clay pot. The verse continues the analogy: houses have foundations, and the house of clay is founded on dust, and will return to dust (Gen 3:19; Ps 103:14). The reasoning is that if God finds defects in angels, he will surely find them in humans who are inferior to the angels because they are but dust. In fact, they are easily crushed like the moth.</p>
