<A NAME="450"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=284><b>tn</b> The subject of this verb is also <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ruakh</font>, &#8220;spirit&#8221;), since it can assume either gender. The &#8220;hair of my flesh&#8221; is the complement and not the subject; therefore the Piel is to be retained and not changed to a Qal as some suggest (and compare with Ps 119:120).</p>
