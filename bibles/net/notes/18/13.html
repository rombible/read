<A NAME="131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=936><b>sn</b> Chapter 13 records Job&#8217;s charges against his friends for the way they used their knowledge (1-5), his warning that God would find out their insincerity (6-12), and his pleading of his cause to God in which he begs for God to remove his hand from him and that he would not terrify him with his majesty and that he would reveal the sins that caused such great suffering (13-28).</p>
<A NAME="132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=937><b>tn</b> Hebrew has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kol</font>, &#8220;all&#8221;); there is no reason to add anything to the text to gain a meaning &#8220;all this.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=938><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Like your knowledge&#8221;; in other words Job is saying that his knowledge is like their knowledge.</p>
<A NAME="134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=939><b>tn</b> The pronoun makes the subject emphatic and stresses the contrast: &#8220;I know &#8211; I also.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="135"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=940><b>tn</b> The verb &#8220;fall&#8221; is used here as it was in Job 4:13 to express becoming lower than someone, i.e., inferior.</p>
<A NAME="136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=941><b>tn</b> The verb is simply the Piel imperfect <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adabber</font>, &#8220;I speak&#8221;)<i>.</i> It should be classified as a desiderative imperfect, saying, &#8220;I desire to speak.&#8221; This is reinforced with the verb &#8220;to wish, desire&#8221; in the second half of the verse.</p>
<A NAME="137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=942><b>tn</b> The Hebrew title for God here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el shadday</font>, &#8220;El Shaddai&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=943><b>tn</b> The infinitive absolute functions here as the direct object of the verb &#8220;desire&#8221; (see GKC 340 §113.<i>b</i>).</p>
<A NAME="139"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=944><b>tn</b> The infinitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1499;&#1461;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hokheakh</font>) is from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yakhakh</font>), which means &#8220;to argue, plead, debate.&#8221; It has the legal sense here of arguing a case (cf. 5:17).</p>
<A NAME="1310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=945><b>tn</b> The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1465;&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1511;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tofÿle shaqer</font>) are &#8220;plasterers of lies&#8221; (Ps 119:69). The verb means &#8220;to coat, smear, plaster.&#8221; The idea is that of imputing something that is not true. Job is saying that his friends are inventors of lies. The LXX was influenced by the next line and came up with &#8220;false physicians.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=946><b>tn</b> The literal rendering of the construct would be &#8220;healers of worthlessness.&#8221; Ewald and Dillmann translated it &#8220;patchers&#8221; based on a meaning in Arabic and Ethiopic; this would give the idea &#8220;botchers.&#8221; But it makes equally good sense to take &#8220;healers&#8221; as the meaning, for Job&#8217;s friends came to minister comfort and restoration to him &#8211; but they failed. See P. Humbert, &#8220;Maladie et medicine dans l&#8217;AT,&#8221; <i>RHPR</i> 44 (1964): 1-29. </p>
<A NAME="1312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=947><b>tn</b> The construction is the imperfect verb in the wish formula preceded by the infinitive that intensifies it. The Hiphil is not directly causative here, but internally &#8211; &#8220;keep silent.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=948><b>tn</b> The text literally reads, &#8220;and it would be for you for wisdom,&#8221; or &#8220;that it would become your wisdom.&#8221; Job is rather sarcastic here, indicating if they shut up they would prove themselves to be wise (see Prov 17:28).</p>
<A NAME="1314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=949><b>sn</b> Job first will argue with his friends. His cause that he will plead with God begins in v. 13. The same root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yakhakh</font>, &#8220;argue, plead&#8221;) is used here as in v. 3b (see note). Synonymous parallelism between the two halves of this verse supports this translation.</p>
<A NAME="1315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=950><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1460;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rivot</font>, &#8220;disputes, contentions&#8221;) continues the imagery of presenting a legal case. The term is used of legal disputations and litigation. See, also, v. 19a.</p>
<A NAME="1316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=951><b>tn</b> The construction literally reads &#8220;speak iniquity.&#8221; The form functions adverbially. The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avlah</font>) means &#8220;perversion; injustice; iniquity; falsehood.&#8221; Here it is parallel to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rÿmiyyah</font>, &#8220;fraud; deceit; treachery&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=952><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;for God&#8221; means &#8220;in favor of God&#8221; or &#8220;on God&#8217;s behalf.&#8221; Job is amazed that they will say false things on God&#8217;s behalf.</p>
<A NAME="1318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=953><b>sn</b> The idiom used here is &#8220;Will you lift up his face?&#8221; Here Job is being very sarcastic, for this expression usually means that a judge is taking a bribe. Job is accusing them of taking God&#8217;s side.</p>
<A NAME="1319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=954><b>tn</b> The same root is used here (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;</font>, <font face="Scholar">riv</font>, &#8220;dispute, contention&#8221;) as in v. 6b (see note).</p>
<A NAME="1320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=955><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khafar</font>) means &#8220;to search out, investigate, examine.&#8221; In the conditional clause the imperfect verb expresses the hypothetical case.</p>
<A NAME="1321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=956><b>tn</b> Both the infinitive and the imperfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">talal</font>, &#8220;deceive, mock&#8221;) retain the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">he</font>) (GKC 148 §53.<i>q</i>). But for the alternate form, see F. C. Fensham, &#8220;The Stem HTL in Hebrew,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 9 (1959): 310-11. The infinitive is used here in an adverbial sense after the preposition.</p>
<A NAME="1322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=957><b>tn</b> The verbal idea is intensified with the infinitive absolute. This is the same verb used in v. 3; here it would have the sense of &#8220;rebuke, convict.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Peake&#8217;s observation is worth noting, namely, that as Job attacks the unrighteousness of God boldly he nonetheless has confidence in God&#8217;s righteousness that would not allow liars to defend him.</p>
<A NAME="1323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=958><b>sn</b> The use of the word &#8220;in secret&#8221; or &#8220;secretly&#8221; suggests that what they do is a guilty action (31:27a).</p>
<A NAME="1324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=959><b>sn</b> The word translated &#8220;his majesty&#8221; or &#8220;his splendor&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;</font>, <font face="Scholar">sÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eto</font>) forms a play on the word &#8220;show partiality&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tissa</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">un</font>) in the last verse. They are both from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1463;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nasa</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to lift up&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=960><b>tn</b> On this verb in the Piel, see 7:14.</p>
<A NAME="1326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=961><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;His dread&#8221;; the suffix is a subjective genitive.</p>
<A NAME="1327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=962><b>tn</b> The word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1512;&#1465;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1499;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zikhronekhem</font><i>,</i> &#8220;your remembrances&#8221;). The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zikkaron</font>) not only can mean the act of remembering, but also what is remembered &#8211; what provokes memory or is worth being remembered. In the plural it can mean all the memorabilia, and in this verse all the sayings and teachings. H. H. Rowley (<i>Job</i> [NCBC], 99) suggests that in Job&#8217;s speech it could mean &#8220;all your memorized sayings.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=963><b>tn</b> The parallelism of &#8220;dust&#8221; and &#8220;ashes&#8221; is fairly frequent in scripture. But &#8220;proverbs of ashes&#8221; is difficult. The genitive is certainly describing the proverbs; it could be classified as a genitive of apposition, proverbs that are/have become ashes. Ashes represent something that at one time may have been useful, but now has been reduced to what is worthless.</p>
<A NAME="1329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=964><b>tn</b> There is a division of opinion on the source of this word. Some take it from &#8220;answer&#8221;, related to Arabic, Aramaic, and Syriac words for &#8220;answer,&#8221; and so translate it &#8220;responses&#8221; (JB). Others take it from a word for &#8220;back,&#8221; with a derived meaning of the &#8220;boss&#8221; of the shield, and translate it bulwark or &#8220;defenses&#8221; (NEB, RSV, NIV). The idea of &#8220;answers&#8221; may fit the parallelism better, but &#8220;defenses&#8221; can be taken figuratively to refer to verbal defenses.</p>
<A NAME="1330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=965><b>sn</b> Any defense made with clay would crumble on impact.</p>
<A NAME="1331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=966><b>tn</b> The Hebrew has a pregnant construction: &#8220;be silent from me,&#8221; meaning &#8220;stand away from me in silence,&#8221; or &#8220;refrain from talking with me.&#8221; See GKC 384 §119.<i>ff</i>. The LXX omits &#8220;from me,&#8221; as do several commentators.</p>
<A NAME="1332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=967><b>tn</b> The verb is the Piel cohortative; following the imperative of the first colon this verb would show purpose or result. The inclusion of the independent personal pronoun makes the focus emphatic &#8211; &#8220;so that I (in my turn) may speak.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=968><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avar</font>, &#8220;pass over&#8221;) is used with the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>, &#8220;upon&#8221;) to express the advent of misfortune, namely, something coming against him.</p>
<A NAME="1334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=969><b>tn</b> The interrogative pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mah</font>) is used in indirect questions, here introducing a clause [with the verb understood] as the object &#8211; &#8220;whatever it be&#8221; (see GKC 443-44 §137.<i>c</i>).</p>
<A NAME="1335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=970><b>tc</b> Most editors reject <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al mah</font>) as dittography from the last verse.</p>
<A NAME="1336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=971><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;why do I take my flesh in my teeth?&#8221; This expression occurs nowhere else. It seems to be drawn from animal imagery in which the wild beast seizes the prey and carries it off to a place of security. The idea would then be that Job may be destroying himself. An animal that fights with its flesh (prey) in its mouth risks losing it. Other commentators do not think this is satisfactory, but they are unable to suggest anything better.</p>
<A NAME="1337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=972><b>tn</b> There is a textual difficulty here that factors into the interpretation of the verse. The <i>Kethib</i> is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;, &#8220;not&#8221;), but the <i>Qere</i> is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>, &#8220;to him&#8221;). The RSV takes the former: &#8220;Behold, he will slay me, I have no hope.&#8221; The NIV takes it as &#8220;though he slay me, yet will I hope in him.&#8221; Job is looking ahead to death, which is not an evil thing to him. The point of the verse is that he is willing to challenge God at the risk of his life; and if God slays him, he is still confident that he will be vindicated &#8211; as he says later in this chapter. Other suggestions are not compelling. E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 187) makes a slight change of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1497;&#1463;&#1495;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ayakhel</font>, &#8220;I will hope&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akhil</font>, &#8220;I will [not] tremble&#8221;). A. B. Davidson (<i>Job</i>, 98) retains the MT, but interprets the verb more in line with its use in the book: &#8220;I will not wait&#8221; (cf. NLT).</p>
<A NAME="1338"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=973><b>tn</b> On <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akh</font>, &#8220;surely&#8221;) see GKC 483 §153 on intensive clauses.</p>
<A NAME="1339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=974><b>tn</b> The verb once again is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yakhah</font>, in the Hiphil, &#8220;argue a case, plead, defend, contest&#8221;). But because the word usually means &#8220;accuse&#8221; rather than &#8220;defend,&#8221; I. L. Seeligmann proposed changing &#8220;my ways&#8221; to &#8220;his ways&#8221; (&#8220;Zur Terminologie für das Gerichtsverfahren im Wortschatz des biblischen Hebräisch,&#8221; VTSup 16 [1967]: 251-78). But the word can be interpreted appropriately in the context without emendation.</p>
<A NAME="1340"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=975><b>sn</b> The fact that Job will dare to come before God and make his case is evidence &#8211; to Job at least &#8211; that he is innocent.</p>
<A NAME="1341"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=976><b>tn</b> The infinitive absolute intensifies the imperative, which serves here with the force of an immediate call to attention. In accordance with GKC 342 §113.<i>n</i>, the construction could be translated, &#8220;Keep listening&#8221; (so ESV).</p>
<A NAME="1342"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=977><b>tn</b> The verb has to be supplied in this line, for the MT has &#8220;and my explanation in your ears.&#8221; In the verse, both &#8220;word&#8221; and &#8220;explanation&#8221; are Aramaisms (the latter appearing in Dan 5:12 for the explanation of riddles).</p>
<A NAME="1343"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=978><b>tn</b> The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hinneh</font>) functions almost as an imperative here, calling attention to what follows: &#8220;look&#8221; (archaic: behold).</p>
<A NAME="1344"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=979><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arakh</font>) means &#8220;to set in order, set in array [as a battle], prepare&#8221; in the sense here of arrange and organize a lawsuit.</p>
<A NAME="1345"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=980><b>tn</b> The pronoun is added because this is what the verse means.</p>
<A NAME="1346"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=981><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mishpat</font>) usually means &#8220;judgment; decision.&#8221; Here it means &#8220;lawsuit&#8221; (and so a metonymy of effect gave rise to this usage; see Num 27:5; 2 Sam 15:4).</p>
<A NAME="1347"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=982><b>tn</b> The pronoun is emphatic before the verb: &#8220;I know that <i>it is I who am right</i>.&#8221; The verb means &#8220;to be right; to be righteous.&#8221; Some have translated it &#8220;vindicated,&#8221; looking at the outcome of the suit.</p>
<A NAME="1348"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=983><b>tn</b> The interrogative is joined with the emphatic pronoun, stressing &#8220;who is he [who] will contend,&#8221; or more emphatically, &#8220;who in the world will contend.&#8221; Job is confident that no one can bring charges against him. He is certain of success.</p>
<A NAME="1349"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=984><b>sn</b> Job is confident that he will be vindicated. But if someone were to show up and have proof of sin against him, he would be silent and die (literally &#8220;keep silent and expire&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1350"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=985><b>tn</b> The line reads &#8220;do not do two things.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1351"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=986><b>tn</b> &#8220;God&#8221; is supplied to the verse, for the address is now to him. Job wishes to enter into dispute with God, but he first appeals that God not take advantage of him with his awesome power. </p>
<A NAME="1352"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=987><b>tn</b> The imperative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">harkhaq</font>, &#8220;remove&#8221;; GKC 98 §29.<i>q</i>)<i>,</i> from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rakhaq</font>, &#8220;far, be far&#8221;) means &#8220;take away [far away]; to remove.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1353"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=988><b>sn</b> This is a common, but bold, anthropomorphism.

<A NAME="1354"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=989><b>tn</b> See Job 9:34.</p>
<A NAME="1355"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=990><b>tn</b> The imperatives in the verse function like the future tense in view of their use for instruction or advice. The chiastic arrangement of the verb forms is interesting: imperative + imperfect, imperfect + imperative. The imperative is used for God, but the imperfect is used when Job is the subject. Job is calling for the court to convene &#8211; he will be either the defendant or the prosecutor.</p>
<A NAME="1356"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=991><b>tn</b> The pronoun &#8220;my&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but has been supplied here in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="1357"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=992><b>sn</b> Job uses three words for sin here: &#8220;iniquities,&#8221; which means going astray, erring; &#8220;sins,&#8221; which means missing the mark or the way; and &#8220;transgressions,&#8221; which are open rebellions. They all emphasize different kinds of sins and different degrees of willfulness. Job is demanding that any sins be brought up. Both Job and his friends agree that great afflictions would have to indicate great offenses &#8211; he wants to know what they are.</p>
<A NAME="1358"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=993><b>sn</b> The anthropomorphism of &#8220;hide the face&#8221; indicates a withdrawal of favor and an outpouring of wrath (see Ps 30:7 [8]; Isa 54:8; Ps 27:9). Sometimes God &#8220;hides his face&#8221; to make himself invisible or aloof (see 34:29). In either case, if God covers his face it is because he considers Job an enemy &#8211; at least this is what Job thinks.</p>
<A NAME="1359"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=994><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ta</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arots</font>, &#8220;you torment&#8221;) is from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arats</font>), which usually means &#8220;fear; dread,&#8221; but can also mean &#8220;to make afraid; to terrify&#8221; (Isa 2:19,21). The imperfect is here taken as a desiderative imperfect: &#8220;why do you want to&#8221;; but it could also be a simple future: &#8220;will you torment.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1360"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=995><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">niddaf</font>) is &#8220;driven&#8221; from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nadaf</font>, &#8220;drive&#8221;)<i>. </i>The words &#8220;by the wind&#8221; or the interpretation &#8220;windblown&#8221; has to be added for the clarification. Job is comparing himself to this leaf (so an implied comparison, called hypocatastasis) &#8211; so light and insubstantial that it is amazing that God should come after him. Guillaume suggests that the word is not from this root, but from a second root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nadaf)</font>,<i> </i>cognate to Arabic <i>nadifa,</i> &#8220;to dry up&#8221; (A. Guillaume, &#8220;A Note on Isaiah 19:7,&#8221; <i>JTS </i>14 [1963]: 382-83). But as D. J. A. Clines notes (<i>Job </i>[WBC], 283), a dried leaf is a driven leaf &#8211; a point Guillaume allows as he says there is ambiguity in the term.</p>
<A NAME="1361"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=996><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qash</font>) means &#8220;chaff; stubble,&#8221; or a wisp of straw. It is found in Job 41:20-21 for that which is so worthless and insignificant that it is hardly worth mentioning. If dried up or withered, it too will be blown away in the wind.</p>
<A NAME="1362"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=997><b>tn</b> The meaning is that of writing down a formal charge against someone (cf. Job 31:15).</p>
<A NAME="1363"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=998><b>sn</b> Job acknowledges sins in his youth, but they are trifling compared to the suffering he now endures. Job thinks it unjust of God to persecute him now for those &#8211; if that is what is happening.</p>
<A NAME="1364"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=999><b>tn</b> The word occurs here and in Job 33:11. It could be taken as &#8220;stocks,&#8221; in which the feet were held fast; or it could be &#8220;shackles,&#8221; which allowed the prisoner to move about. The parallelism favors the latter, if the two lines are meant to be referring to the same thing.</p>
<A NAME="1365"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=1000><b>tn</b> The word means &#8220;ways; roads; paths,&#8221; but it is used here in the sense of the &#8220;way&#8221; in which one goes about his activities.</p>
<A NAME="1366"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=1001><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">titkhaqqeh</font>) is a Hitpael from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khaqah</font>, parallel to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1511;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khaqaq</font>). The word means &#8220;to engrave&#8221; or &#8220;to carve out.&#8221; This Hitpael would mean &#8220;to imprint something on oneself&#8221; (E. Dhorme [<i>Job</i>, 192] says on one&#8217;s mind, and so derives the meaning &#8220;examine.&#8221;). The object of this is the expression &#8220;on the roots of my feet,&#8221; which would refer to where the feet hit the ground. Since the passage has more to do with God&#8217;s restricting Job&#8217;s movement, the translation &#8220;you set a boundary to the soles of my feet&#8221; would be better than Dhorme&#8217;s view. The image of inscribing or putting marks on the feet is not found elsewhere. It may be, as Pope suggests, a reference to marking the slaves to make tracking them easier. The LXX has &#8220;you have penetrated to my heels.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1367"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=1002><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he.&#8221; Some of the commentators move the verse and put it after Job 14:2, 3 or 6.</p>
<A NAME="1368"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=1003><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">raqav</font>) is used elsewhere in the Bible of dry rot in a house, or rotting bones in a grave. It is used in parallelism with &#8220;moth&#8221; both here and in Hos 5:12. The LXX has &#8220;like a wineskin.&#8221; This would be from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1465;&#1511;&#1462;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">roqev</font>,<i> </i>&#8220;wineskin&#8221;). This word does not occur in the Hebrew Bible, but is attested in Sir 43:20 and in Aramaic. The change is not necessary.</p>
