<A NAME="1925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1310><b>tn</b> The metaphors are changed now to a demolished building and an uprooted tree. The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">natats</font>, &#8220;to demolish&#8221;). Since it is Job himself who is the object, the meaning cannot be &#8220;demolish&#8221; (as of a house so that an inhabitant has to leave), but more of the attack or the battering.</p>
