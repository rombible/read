<A NAME="1944"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1329><b>tn</b> The normal meaning here would be based on the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khanan</font>, &#8220;to be gracious&#8221;). And so we have versions reading &#8220;although I entreated&#8221; or &#8220;my supplication.&#8221; But it seems more likely it is to be connected to another root meaning &#8220;to be offensive; to be loathsome.&#8221; For the discussion of the connection to the Arabic, see E. Dhorme, <i>Job</i>, 278.</p>
