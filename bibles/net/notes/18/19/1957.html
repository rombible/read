<A NAME="1957"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=1342><b>tn</b> While the sense of this line is clear, there is a small problem and a plausible solution. The last word is indeed <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sefer</font>, &#8220;book&#8221;), usually understood here to mean &#8220;scroll.&#8221; But the verb that follows it in the verse is <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1467;&#1495;&#1464;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;</font></i> (<font face="Scholar">yukhaqu</font>), from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khaqaq</font>, &#8220;to engrave; to carve&#8221;). While the meaning is clearly that Job wants his words to be retained, the idea of engraving in a book, although not impossible, is unusual. And so many have suggested that the Akkadian word <i>siparru</i>, &#8220;copper; brass,&#8221; is what is meant here (see Isa 30:8; Judg 5:14). The consonants are the same, and the vowel pattern is close to the original vowel pattern of this segholate noun. Writing on copper or bronze sheets has been attested from the 12th to the 2nd centuries, notably in the copper scroll, which would allow the translation &#8220;scroll&#8221; in our text (for more bibliography see D. J. A. Clines, <i>Job </i>[WBC], 432). But H. S. Gehman notes that in Phoenician our word can mean &#8220;inscription&#8221; (&#8220;<font face="Scholar">SEÝFER</font>, an inscription, in the book of Job,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 63 [1944]: 303-7), making the proposed substitution unnecessary.</p>
