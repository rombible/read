<A NAME="191"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1286><b>sn</b> Job is completely stunned by Bildad&#8217;s speech, and feels totally deserted by God and his friends. Yet from his despair a new hope emerges with a stronger faith. Even though he knows he will die in his innocence, he knows that God will vindicate him and that he will be conscious of the vindication. There are four parts to this reply: Job&#8217;s impatience with the speeches of his friends (2-6), God&#8217;s abandonment of Job and his attack (7-12), Job&#8217;s forsaken state and appeal to his friends (13-22), and Job&#8217;s confidence that he will be vindicated (23-29).</p>
