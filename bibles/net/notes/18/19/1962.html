<A NAME="1962"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=1347><b>tn</b> This verse on the whole has some serious interpretation problems that have allowed commentators to go in several directions. The verbal clause is &#8220;they strike off this,&#8221; which is then to be taken as a passive in view of the fact that there is no expressed subject. Some have thought that Job was referring to this life, and that after his disease had done its worst he would see his vindication (see T. J. Meek, &#8220;Job 19:25-27,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 6 [1956]: 100-103; E. F. Sutcliffe, &#8220;Further notes on Job, textual and exegetical,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 31 [1950]: 377; and others). But Job has been clear &#8211; he does not expect to live and see his vindication in this life. There are a host of other interpretations that differ greatly from the sense expressed in the MT. Duhm, for example, has &#8220;and another shall arise as my witness.&#8221; E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 284-85) argues that the vindication comes after death; he emends the verb to get a translation: &#8220;and that, behind my skin, I shall stand up.&#8221; He explains this to mean that it will be Job in person who will be present at the ultimate drama. But the interpretation is forced, and really unnecessary.</p>
