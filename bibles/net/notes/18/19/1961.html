<A NAME="1961"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=1346><b>tn</b> The Hebrew has &#8220;and he will rise/stand upon [the] dust.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qum</font>) is properly &#8220;to rise; to arise,&#8221; and certainly also can mean &#8220;to stand.&#8221; Both English ideas are found in the verb. The concept here is that of God rising up to mete out justice. And so to avoid confusion with the idea of resurrection (which although implicit in these words which are pregnant with theological ideas yet to be revealed, is not explicitly stated or intended in this context) the translation &#8220;stand&#8221; has been used. The Vulgate had &#8220;I will rise,&#8221; which introduced the idea of Job&#8217;s resurrection. The word &#8220;dust&#8221; is used as in 41:33. The word &#8220;dust&#8221; is associated with death and the grave, the very earthly particles. Job assumes that God will descend from heaven to bring justice to the world. The use of the word also hints that this will take place after Job has died and returned to dust. Again, the words of Job come to mean far more than he probably understood.</p>
