<A NAME="1958"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=1343><b>sn</b> There is some question concerning the use of the lead. It surely cannot be a second description of the tool, for a lead tool would be of no use in chiseling words into a rock. It was Rashi&#8217;s idea, followed by Dillmann and Duhm, that lead was run into the cut-out letters. The suggestion that they wrote on lead tablets does not seem to fit the verse (cf. NIV). See further A. Baker, &#8220;The Strange Case of Job&#8217;s Chisel,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 31 (1969): 370-79.</p>
