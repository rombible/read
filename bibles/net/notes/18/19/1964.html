<A NAME="1964"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=1349><b>tn</b> H. H. Rowley (<i>Job</i> [NCBC], 140) says, &#8220;The text of this verse is so difficult, and any convincing reconstruction is so unlikely, that it seems best not to attempt it.&#8221; His words have gone unheeded, even by himself, and rightly so. There seem to be two general interpretations, the details of some words notwithstanding. An honest assessment of the evidence would have to provide both interpretations, albeit still arguing for one. Here Job says he will see God. This at the least means that he will witness his vindication, which it seems clear from the other complaints of Job will occur after his death (it is his blood that must be vindicated). But in what way, exactly, Job will see God is not clarified. In this verse the verb that is used is often used of prophetic visions; but in the next verse the plain word for seeing &#8211; with his eye &#8211; is used. The fulfillment will be more precise than Job may have understood. Rowley does conclude: &#8220;Though there is no full grasping of a belief in a worthwhile Afterlife with God, this passage is a notable landmark in the program toward such a belief.&#8221; The difficulty is that Job expects to die &#8211; he would like to be vindicated in this life, but is resolved that he will die. (1) Some commentators think that vv. 25 and 26 follow the wish for vindication now; (2) others (traditionally) see it as in the next life. Some of the other interpretations that take a different line are less impressive, such as Kissane&#8217;s, &#8220;did I but see God&#8230;were I to behold God&#8221;; or L. Waterman&#8217;s translation in the English present, making it a mystic vision in which Job already sees that God is his vindicator (&#8220;Note on Job 19:23-27: Job&#8217;s Triumph of Faith,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 69 [1950]: 379-80).</p>
