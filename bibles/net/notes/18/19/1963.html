<A NAME="1963"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=1348><b>tn</b> The Hebrew phrase is &#8220;and from my flesh.&#8221; This could mean &#8220;without my flesh,&#8221; i.e., separated from my flesh, or &#8220;from my flesh,&#8221; i.e., in or with my flesh. The former view is taken by those who think Job&#8217;s vindication will come in this life, and who find the idea of a resurrection unlikely to be in Job&#8217;s mind. The latter view is taken by those who interpret the preceding line as meaning death and the next verse underscoring that it will be his eye that will see. This would indicate that Job&#8217;s faith rises to an unparalleled level at this point.</p>
