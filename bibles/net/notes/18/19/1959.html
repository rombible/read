<A NAME="1959"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=1344><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;my Vindicator.&#8221; The word is the active participle from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ga</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>, &#8220;to redeem, protect, vindicate&#8221;). The word is well-known in the OT because of its identification as the kinsman-redeemer (see the Book of Ruth). This is the near kinsman who will pay off one&#8217;s debts, defend the family, avenge a killing, marry the widow of the deceased. The word &#8220;redeemer&#8221; evokes the wrong connotation for people familiar with the NT alone; a translation of &#8220;Vindicator&#8221; would capture the idea more. The concept might include the description of the mediator already introduced in Job 16:19, but surely here Job is thinking of God as his vindicator. The interesting point to be stressed here is that Job has said clearly that he sees no vindication in this life, that he is going to die. But he knows he will be vindicated, and even though he will die, his vindicator lives. The dilemma remains though: his distress lay in God&#8217;s hiding his face from him, and his vindication lay only in beholding God in peace.</p>
