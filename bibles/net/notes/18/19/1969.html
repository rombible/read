<A NAME="1969"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=1354><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;in me.&#8221; If that is retained, then the question would be in the first colon, and the reasoning of the second colon would be Job&#8217;s. But over 100 <sc>mss have &#8220;in him,&#8221; and so this reading is accepted by most editors. The verse is a little difficult, but it seems to form a warning by Job that God&#8217;s appearance which will vindicate Job will bring judgment on those who persecute him and charge him falsely.</p>
