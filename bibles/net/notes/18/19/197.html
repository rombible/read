<A NAME="197"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1292><b>tn</b> The second half of the verse uses two verbs, the one dependent on the other. It could be translated &#8220;you are not ashamed to attack me&#8221; (see GKC 385-86 §120.<i>c</i>), or &#8220;you attack me shamelessly.&#8221; The verb <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1512;</font> </i>(<font face="Scholar">hakhar</font>) poses some difficulties for both the ancient versions and the modern commentators. The verb seems to be cognate to Arabic <i>hakara,</i> &#8220;to oppress; to ill-treat.&#8221; This would mean that there has been a transformation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khet</font>) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">he</font>). Three Hebrew <sc>mss actually have the <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;</font></i> (<font face="Scholar">khet</font>). This has been widely accepted; other suggestions are irrelevant.</p>
