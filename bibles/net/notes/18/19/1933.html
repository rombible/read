<A NAME="1933"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1318><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they throw up their way against me.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">salal</font>) means &#8220;to build a siege ramp&#8221; or &#8220;to throw up a ramp&#8221;; here the object is &#8220;their way.&#8221; The latter could be taken as an adverbial accusative, &#8220;as their way.&#8221; But as the object it fits just as well. Some delete the middle clause; the LXX has &#8220;Together his troops fell upon me, they beset my ways with an ambush.&#8221;</p>
