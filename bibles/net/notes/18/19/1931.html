<A NAME="1931"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1316><b>tn</b> This second half of the verse is a little difficult. The Hebrew has &#8220;and he reckons me for him like his adversaries.&#8221; Most would change the last word to a singular in harmony with the versions, &#8220;as his adversary.&#8221; But some retain the MT pointing and try to explain it variously: Weiser suggests that the plural might have come from a cultic recitation of Yahweh&#8217;s deeds against his enemies; Fohrer thinks it refers to the primeval enemies; Gordis takes it as distributive, &#8220;as one of his foes.&#8221; If the plural is retained, this latter view makes the most sense.</p>
