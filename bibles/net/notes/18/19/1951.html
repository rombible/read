<A NAME="1951"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1336><b>tn</b> The meaning would be &#8220;I am nothing but skin and bones&#8221; in current English idiom. Both lines of this verse need attention. The first half seems to say, &#8220;My skin and my flesh sticks to my bones.&#8221; Some think that this is too long, and that the bones can stick to the skin, or the flesh, but not both. Dhorme proposes &#8220;in my skin my flesh has rotted away&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1489;</font>, <font face="Scholar">raqav</font>). This involves several changes in the line, however. He then changes the second line to read &#8220;and I have gnawed my bone with my teeth&#8221; (transferring &#8220;bone&#8221; from the first half and omitting &#8220;skin&#8221;). There are numerous other renderings of this; some of the more notable are: &#8220;I escape, my bones in my teeth&#8221; (Merx); &#8220;my teeth fall out&#8221; (Duhm); &#8220;my teeth fall from my gums&#8221; (Pope); &#8220;my bones protrude in sharp points&#8221; (Kissane). A. B. Davidson retains &#8220;the skin of my teeth,&#8221; meaning &#8220;gums. This is about the last thing that Job has, or he would not be able to speak. For a detailed study of this verse, D. J. A. Clines devotes two full pages of textual notes (<i>Job </i>[WBC], 430-31). He concludes with &#8220;My bones hang from my skin and my flesh, I am left with only the skin of my teeth.&#8221;</p>
