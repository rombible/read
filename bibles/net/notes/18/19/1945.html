<A NAME="1945"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1330><b>tn</b> The text has &#8220;the sons of my belly [= body].&#8221; This would normally mean &#8220;my sons.&#8221; But they are all dead. And there is no suggestion that Job had other sons. The word &#8220;my belly&#8221; will have to be understood as &#8220;my womb,&#8221; i.e., the womb I came from. Instead of &#8220;brothers,&#8221; the sense could be &#8220;siblings&#8221; (both brothers and sisters; G. R. Driver and G. B. Gray, <i>Job</i> [ICC], 2:168).</p>
