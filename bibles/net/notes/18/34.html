<A NAME="341"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2054><b>sn</b> This speech of Elihu focuses on defending God. It can be divided into these sections: Job is irreligious (2-9), God is just (10-15), God is impartial and omniscient (16-30), Job is foolish to rebel (31-37).</p>
<A NAME="342"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2055><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;give ear to me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="343"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2056><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word means &#8220;the men who know,&#8221; and without a complement it means &#8220;to possess knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="344"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2057><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;examines; tests; tries; discerns.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="345"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2058><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;palate&#8221;; the Hebrew term refers to the tongue or to the mouth in general.</p>
<A NAME="346"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2059><b>sn</b> Elihu means &#8220;choose after careful examination.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="347"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2060><b>tn</b> The word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mishpat</font>) again, with the sense of what is right or just.</p>
<A NAME="348"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2061><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;righteous,&#8221; but in this context it means to be innocent or in the right.</p>
<A NAME="349"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2062><b>tn</b> The verb is the Piel imperfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kazav</font>), meaning &#8220;to lie.&#8221; It could be a question: &#8220;Should I lie [against my right?] &#8211; when I am innocent. If it is repointed to the Pual<i>,</i> then it can be &#8220;I am made to lie,&#8221; or &#8220;I am deceived.&#8221; Taking it as a question makes good sense here, and so emendations are unnecessary.</p>
<A NAME="3410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2063><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has only &#8220;my arrow.&#8221; Some commentators emend that word slightly to get &#8220;my wound.&#8221; But the idea could be derived from &#8220;arrows&#8221; as well, the wounds caused by the arrows. The arrows are symbolic of God&#8217;s affliction.</p>
<A NAME="3411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2064><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;without transgression&#8221;; but this is parallel to the first part where the claim is innocence.</p>
<A NAME="3412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2065><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he drinks,&#8221; but coming after the question this clause may be subordinated.</p>
<A NAME="3413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2066><b>tn</b> The scorn or derision mentioned here is not against Job, but against God. Job scorns God so much, he must love it. So to reflect this idea, Gordis has translated it &#8220;blasphemy&#8221; (cf. NAB).</p>
<A NAME="3414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2067><b>tn</b> The perfect verb with the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive carries the sequence forward from the last description.</p>
<A NAME="3415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2068><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khevrah</font>, &#8220;company&#8221;) is a <i>hapax legomenon</i>. But its meaning is clear enough from the connections to related words and this context as well.</p>
<A NAME="3416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2069><b>tn</b> The infinitive construct with the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lamed</font>) preposition may continue the clause with the finite verb (see GKC 351 §114.<i>p</i>).</p>
<A NAME="3417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2070><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;men of wickedness&#8221;; the genitive is attributive (= &#8220;wicked men&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="3418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2071><b>tn</b> Gordis, however, takes this expression in the sense of &#8220;being in favor with God.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2072><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;men of heart.&#8221; The &#8220;heart&#8221; is used for the capacity to understand and make the proper choice. It is often translated &#8220;mind.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2073><b>tn</b> For this construction, see Job 27:5.</p>
<A NAME="3421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2074><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for the work of man, he [= God] repays him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2075><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he causes it to find him.&#8221; The text means that God will cause a man to find (or receive) the consequences of his actions.</p>
<A NAME="3423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2076><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">paqad</font>) means &#8220;to visit; to appoint; to number.&#8221; Here it means &#8220;to entrust&#8221; for care and governing. The implication would be that there would be someone higher than God &#8211; which is what Elihu is repudiating by the rhetorical question. No one entrusted God with this.</p>
<A NAME="3424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2077><b>tn</b> The preposition is implied from the first half of the verse.</p>
<A NAME="3425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2078><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (God) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3426"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2079><b>tc</b> This is the reading following the <i>Qere</i>. The <i>Kethib</i> and the Syriac and the LXX suggest a reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yasim</font>, &#8220;if he [God] recalls&#8221;). But this would require leaving out &#8220;his heart,&#8221; and would also require redividing the verse to make &#8220;his spirit&#8221; the object. It makes better parallelism, but may require too many changes.</p>
<A NAME="3427"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2080><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;you have&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but is implied.</p>
<A NAME="3428"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2081><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the sound of my words.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3429"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2082><b>tn</b> The force of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1488;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">af</font>) is &#8220;Is it truly the case?&#8221; The point is being made that if Job were right God could not be judging the world.</p>
<A NAME="3430"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2083><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khavash</font>) has the basic idea of &#8220;to bind,&#8221; as in binding on the yoke, and then in the sense of subduing people under authority (cf. Assyrian <i>absanu</i>)<i>.</i> The imperfect verb here is best expressed with the potential nuance.</p>
<A NAME="3431"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2084><b>tn</b> The two words could be taken separately, but they seem to form a fine nominal hendiadys, because the issue is God&#8217;s justice. So the word for power becomes the modifier.</p>
<A NAME="3432"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2085><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Does one say,&#8221; although some smooth it out to say &#8220;Is it fit to say?&#8221; For the reading &#8220;who says,&#8221; the form has to be repointed to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1488;&#1465;&#1502;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">omer</font>) meaning, &#8220;who is the one saying.&#8221; This reading is supported by the LXX, Vulgate, and Syriac. Also it seems to flow better with the following verse. It would be saying that God is over the rulers and can rebuke them. The former view is saying that no one rebukes kings, much less Job rebuking God.</p>
<A NAME="3433"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2086><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿliyya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) means both &#8220;worthless&#8221; and &#8220;wicked.&#8221; It is common in proverbial literature, and in later writings it became a description of Satan. It is usually found with &#8220;son of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3434"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2087><b>tn</b> The verb means &#8220;to give recognition; to take note of&#8221; and in this passage with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lifne</font>, &#8220;before&#8221;) it means to show preferential treatment to the rich before the poor. The word for &#8220;rich&#8221; here is an unusual word, found parallel to &#8220;noble&#8221; (Isa 32:2). P. Joüon thinks it is a term of social distinction (<i>Bib</i> 18 [1937]: 207-8).</p>
<A NAME="3435"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2088><b>tn</b> Dhorme transposes &#8220;in the middle of the night&#8221; with &#8220;they pass away&#8221; to get a smoother reading. But the MT emphasizes the suddenness by putting both temporal ideas first. E. F. Sutcliffe leaves the order as it stands in the text, but adds a verb &#8220;they expire&#8221; after &#8220;in the middle of the night&#8221; (&#8220;Notes on Job, textual and exegetical,&#8221; <i>Bib </i>30 [1949]: 79ff.).</p>
<A NAME="3436"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2089><b>tn</b> R. Gordis (<i>Job</i>, 389) thinks &#8220;people&#8221; here mean the people who count, the upper class.</p>
<A NAME="3437"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2090><b>tn</b> The verb means &#8220;to be violently agitated.&#8221; There is no problem with the word in this context, but commentators have made suggestions for improving the idea. The proposal that has the most to commend it, if one were inclined to choose a new word, is the change to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1493;&#1464;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yigva</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">u</font>, &#8220;they expire&#8221;; so Ball, Holscher, Fohrer, and others).</p>
<A NAME="3438"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2091><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;not by hand.&#8221; This means without having to use force.</p>
<A NAME="3439"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2092><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his&#8221;; the referent (a person) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3440"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=2093><b>tn</b> The construction of this colon uses the Niphal<i> </i>infinitive construct from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">satar</font>, &#8220;to be hidden; to hide&#8221;). The resumptive adverb makes this a relative clause in its usage: &#8220;where the evildoers can hide themselves.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3441"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=2094><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for he does not put upon man yet.&#8221; This has been given a wide variety of interpretations, all of which involve a lot of additional thoughts. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">od</font>, &#8220;yet, still&#8221;) has been replaced with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1506;&#1461;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ed</font>, &#8220;an appointed time,&#8221; Reiske and Wright), with the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mem</font>) having dropped out by haplography. This makes good sense. If the MT is retained, the best interpretation would be that God does not any more consider (from &#8220;place upon the heart&#8221;) man, that he might appear in judgment.</p>
<A NAME="3442"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=2095><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[with] no investigation.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3443"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2096><b>tn</b> The direct object &#8220;them&#8221; is implied and has been supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3444"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=2097><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term &#8220;night&#8221; is an accusative of time.</p>
<A NAME="3445"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=2098><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;under wicked men,&#8221; or &#8220;under wickednesses.&#8221; J. C. Greenfield shows that the preposition can mean &#8220;among&#8221; as well (&#8220;Prepositions B Tachat in Jes 57:5,&#8221; <i>ZAW </i>32 [1961]: 227). That would allow &#8220;among wicked men.&#8221; It could also be &#8220;instead of&#8221; or even &#8220;in return for [their wickedness]&#8221; which is what the RSV does.</p>
<A NAME="3446"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=2099><b>tn</b> The text simply uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1465;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ro</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>): &#8220;[in the place where there are] seers,&#8221; i.e., spectators.</p>
<A NAME="3447"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=2100><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hiskilu</font>) means &#8220;to be prudent; to be wise.&#8221; From this is derived the idea of &#8220;be wise in understanding God&#8217;s will,&#8221; and &#8220;be successful because of prudence&#8221; &#8211; i.e., successful with God.</p>
<A NAME="3448"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=2101><b>tn</b> The verse begins with the infinitive construct of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bo</font>&#8217;, &#8220;go&#8221;), showing the result of their impious actions.</p>
<A NAME="3449"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=2102><b>tn</b> The verb here is an imperfect; the clause is circumstantial to the preceding clause, showing either the result, or the concomitant action.</p>
<A NAME="3450"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=2103><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (God) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3451"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=2104><b>tn</b> The verb in this position is somewhat difficult, although it does make good sense in the sentence &#8211; it is just not what the parallelism would suggest. So several emendations have been put forward, for which see the commentaries.</p>
<A NAME="3452"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=2105><b>tn</b> The line simply reads &#8220;and over a nation and over a man together.&#8221; But it must be the qualification for the points being made in the previous lines, namely, that even if God hides himself so no one can see, yet he is still watching over them all (see H. H. Rowley, <i>Job</i> [NCBC], 222).</p>
<A NAME="3453"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=2106><b>tn</b> The word translated &#8220;alike&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;together&#8221;) has bothered some interpreters. In the reading taken here it is acceptable. But others have emended it to gain a verb, such as &#8220;he visits&#8221; (Beer), &#8220;he watches over&#8221; (Duhm), &#8220;he is compassionate&#8221; (Kissane), etc. But it is sufficient to say &#8220;he is over.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3454"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=2107><b>tn</b> This last verse is difficult because it is unbalanced and cryptic. Some have joined the third line of v. 29 with this entire verse to make a couplet. But the same result is achieved by simply regarding this verse as the purpose of v. 29. But there still are some words that must be added. In the first colon, &#8220;[he is over the nations]&#8230;<i>preventing</i> from ruling.&#8221; And in the second colon, &#8220;laying&#8221; has to be supplied before &#8220;snares.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3455"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=2108><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has only &#8220;I lift up&#8221; or &#8220;I bear&#8221; (= I endure). The reading &#8220;I have been led astray&#8221; is obtained by changing the vowels to read a passive. If the MT is retained, an object has to be supplied, such as &#8220;chastisement&#8221; (so RSV, NASB) or &#8220;punishment&#8221; (NRSV). If not, then a different reading would be followed (e.g., &#8220;I was misguided&#8221; [NAB]; &#8220;I am guilty&#8221; [NIV]).</p>
<A NAME="3456"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=2109><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;what I do not see,&#8221; more specifically, &#8220;apart from [that which] I see.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3457"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=2110><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;is it from with you,&#8221; an idiomatic expression meaning &#8220;to suit you&#8221; or &#8220;according to your judgment.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3458"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=2111><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (God) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3459"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=2112><b>tn</b> There is no object on the verb, and the meaning is perhaps lost. The best guess is that Elihu is saying Job has rejected his teaching.</p>
<A NAME="3460"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=2113><b>tn</b> Adding &#8220;that&#8221; in the translation clarifies Elihu&#8217;s indirect citation of the wise individuals&#8217; words.</p>
<A NAME="3461"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=2114><b>tn</b> The Hiphil infinitive construct is here functioning as a substantive. The word means &#8220;prudence; understanding.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3462"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=2115><b>tc</b> The MT reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avi</font>, &#8220;my father&#8221;), which makes no sense. Some follow the KJV and emend the word to make a verb &#8220;I desire&#8221; or use the noun &#8220;my desire of it.&#8221; Others follow an Arabic word meaning &#8220;entreat, I pray&#8221; (cf. ESV, &#8220;Would that Job were tried&#8221;). The LXX and the Syriac versions have &#8220;but&#8221; and &#8220;surely&#8221; respectively. Since this is the only <sc>ms support, albeit weak, it may be the best choice. In this sense Elihu would be saying that because of Job&#8217;s attitude God will continue to test him.</p>
<A NAME="3463"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=2116><b>tn</b> Although frequently translated &#8220;rebellion,&#8221; the basic meaning of this Hebrew term is &#8220;transgression.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3464"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=2117><b>tc</b> If this reading stands, it would mean that Job shows contempt, meaning that he mocks them and accuses God. It is a bold touch, but workable. Of the many suggested emendations, Dhorme alters some of the vowels and obtains a reading &#8220;and casts doubt among us,&#8221; and then takes &#8220;transgression&#8221; from the first colon for the complement. Some commentators simply delete the line.</p>
