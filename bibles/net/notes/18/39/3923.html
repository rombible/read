<A NAME="3923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2308><b>tn</b> The second half of the verse contains this <i>hapax legomenon</i>, which is usually connected with the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">mah</font>, &#8220;thunder&#8221;). A. B. Davidson thought it referred to the quivering of the neck rather than the mane. Gray thought the sound and not the movement was the point. But without better evidence, a reading that has &#8220;quivering mane&#8221; may not be far off the mark. But it may be simplest to translate it &#8220;mane&#8221; and assume that the idea of &#8220;quivering&#8221; is part of the meaning.</p>
