<A NAME="3911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2296><b>tc</b> There is a textual problem here: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yashuv</font>) is the <i>Kethib</i>, meaning &#8220;[that] he will return&#8221;; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yashiv</font>) is the <i>Qere</i>, meaning &#8220;that he will bring in.&#8221; This is the preferred reading, since the object follows it. For commentators who think the line too unbalanced for this, the object is moved to the second colon, and the reading &#8220;returns&#8221; is taken for the first. But the MT is perfectly clear as it stands.</p>
