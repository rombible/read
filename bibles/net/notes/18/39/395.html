<A NAME="395"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2290><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they cast forth their labor pains.&#8221; This word usually means &#8220;birth pangs&#8221; but here can mean what caused the pains (metonymy of effect). This fits better with the parallelism, and the verb (&#8220;cast forth&#8221;). The words &#8220;their offspring&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarity; direct objects were often omitted when clear from the context, although English expects them to be included.</p>
