<A NAME="3927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2312><b>tn</b> The armies would prepare for battles that were usually fought in the valleys, and so the horse was ready to charge. But in Ugaritic the word <i>`mk</i> means &#8220;force&#8221; as well as &#8220;valley.&#8221; The idea of &#8220;force&#8221; would fit the parallelism here well (see M. Dahood, &#8220;Value of Ugaritic for textual criticism,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 40 [1959]: 166).</p>
