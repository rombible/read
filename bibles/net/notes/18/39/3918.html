<A NAME="3918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2303><b>tn</b> The point of this statement would be that the ostrich cannot compare to the stork. But there are many other proposals for this line &#8211; just about every commentator has a different explanation for it. Of the three words here, the first means &#8220;pinion,&#8221; the third &#8220;plumage,&#8221; and the second probably &#8220;stork,&#8221; although the LXX has &#8220;heron.&#8221; The point of this whole section is that the ostrich is totally lacking in parental care, whereas the stork is characterized by it. The Hebrew word for &#8220;stork&#8221; is the same word for &#8220;love&#8221;: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1458;&#1505;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khasidah</font>), an interpretation followed by the NASB. The most likely reading is &#8220;or are they the pinions and plumage of the stork?&#8221; The ostrich may flap about, but cannot fly and does not care for its young.</p>
