<A NAME="398"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2293><b>tn</b> Some commentators think that the addition of the &#8220;wild ox&#8221; here is a copyist&#8217;s error, making the stich too long. They therefore delete it. Also, binding an animal to the furrow with ropes is unusual. So with a slight emendation Kissane came up with &#8220;Will you bind him with a halter of cord?&#8221; While the MT is unusual, the sense is understandable, and no changes, even slight ones, are absolutely necessary.</p>
