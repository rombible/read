<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1496><b>sn</b> The third and final cycle of speeches now begins with Eliphaz&#8217; final speech. Eliphaz will here underscore the argument that man&#8217;s ills are brought about by sin; he will then deduce from Job&#8217;s sufferings the sins he must have committed and the sinful attitude he has about God. The speech has four parts: Job&#8217;s suffering is proof of his sin (2-5), Job&#8217;s sufferings demonstrate the kinds of sin Job committed (6-11), Job&#8217;s attitude about God (12-20), and the final appeal and promise to Job (21-30).</p>
