<A NAME="229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1504><b>tn</b> The &#8220;naked&#8221; here refers to people who are poorly clothed. Otherwise, a reading like the NIV would be necessary: &#8220;you stripped the clothes&#8230;[leaving them] naked.&#8221; So either he made them naked by stripping their garments off, or they were already in rags.</p>
