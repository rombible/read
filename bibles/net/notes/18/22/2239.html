<A NAME="2239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1534><b>tc</b> The word translated &#8220;our enemies&#8221; is found only here. The word means &#8220;hostility,&#8221; but used here as a collective for those who are hostile &#8211; &#8220;enemies.&#8221; Some commentators follow the LXX and read &#8220;possessions,&#8221; explaining its meaning and derivation in different ways. Gordis simply takes the word in the text and affirms that this is the meaning. On the other hand, to get this, E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 336) repoints <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1502;&#1464;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qimanu</font>) of the MT to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿqumam</font>), arguing that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿqum</font>) means &#8220;what exists [or has substance]&#8221; (although that is used of animals). He translates: &#8220;have not their possessions been destroyed.&#8221;</p>
