<A NAME="111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=816><b>sn</b> Zophar begins with a strong rebuke of Job with a wish that God would speak (2-6); he then reflects for a few verses on the unsearchable wisdom of God (7-12); and finally, he advises Job that the way to restoration is repentance (13-20).</p>
<A NAME="112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=817><b>tc</b> The LXX, Targum Job, Symmachus, and Vulgate all assume that the vocalization of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1465;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rov</font>, &#8220;abundance&#8221;) should be <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rav</font>, &#8220;great&#8221;): &#8220;great of words.&#8221; This would then mean &#8220;one who is abundant of words,&#8221; meaning, &#8220;a man of many words,&#8221; and make a closer parallel to the second half. But the MT makes good sense as it stands.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> There is no article or demonstrative with the word; it has been added here simply to make a smoother connection between the chapters.</p>
<A NAME="113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=818><b>tn</b> The Niphal verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1461;&#1506;&#1464;&#1504;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ye</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aneh</font>, &#8220;he answered&#8221;) would normally require a personal subject, but &#8220;abundance&#8221; functions as the subject in this sentence. The nuance of the imperfect is obligatory.</p>
<A NAME="114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=819><b>tn</b> The word is supplied here also for clarification.</p>
<A NAME="115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=820><b>tn</b> The bound construction &#8220;man of lips&#8221; means &#8220;a boaster&#8221; or &#8220;proud talker&#8221; (attributive genitive; and see GKC 417 §128.<i>t</i>). Zophar is saying that Job pours out this stream of words, but he is still not right.</p>
<A NAME="116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=821><b>tn</b> The word is literally &#8220;be right, righteous.&#8221; The idea of being right has appeared before for this word (cf. 9:15). The point here is that just because Job talks a lot does not mean he is right or will be shown to be right through it all.</p>
<A NAME="117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=822><b>tn</b> The word means &#8220;chatter, pratings, boastings&#8221; (see Isa 16:6; Jer 48:30).</p>
<A NAME="118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=823><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kharash</font>) in the Hiphil means &#8220;to silence&#8221; (41:4); here it functions in a causative sense, &#8220;reduce to silence.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=824><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1499;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">makhlim</font>, &#8220;humiliating, mocking&#8221;) is the Hiphil participle. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kalam</font>) has the meaning &#8220;cover with shame, insult&#8221; (Job 20:3).</p>
<A NAME="1110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=825><b>tn</b> The construction shows the participle to be in the circumstantial clause: &#8220;will you mock &#8211; and [with] no one rebuking.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=826><b>tn</b> The word translated &#8220;teaching&#8221; is related etymologically to the Hebrew word &#8220;receive,&#8221; but that does not restrict the teaching to what is received.</p>
<A NAME="1112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=827><b>tn</b> The wish formula <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mi yitten</font>, &#8220;who will give&#8221;; see GKC 477 §151.<i>b</i>) is followed here by an infinitive (Exod 16:3; 2 Sam 19:1).</p>
<A NAME="1113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=828><b>sn</b> Job had expressed his eagerness to challenge God; Zophar here wishes that God would take up that challenge.</p>
<A NAME="1114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=829><b>tn</b> The text seems to be saying &#8220;that it [wisdom] is double in understanding.&#8221; The point is that it is different than Job conceived it &#8211; it far exceeded all perception. But some commentators have thought this still too difficult, and so have replaced the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khiflayim</font>, &#8220;two sides&#8221;) with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khifla</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>, &#8220;like wonders,&#8221; or, more simply, &#8220;wonders&#8221; without the preposition). But it is still a little strange to talk about God&#8217;s wisdom being like wonders. Others have had more radical changes in the text; J. J. Slotki has &#8220;for sound wisdom is his. And know that double [punishment] shall God exact of you&#8221; (&#8220;Job 11:6,&#8221; <i>VT </i>35 [1985]: 229-30).</p>
<A NAME="1115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=830><b>tn</b> The verb is the imperative with a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vav</font>). Following the jussive, this clause would be subordinated to the preceding (see GKC 325 §110.<i>i</i>).</p>
<A NAME="1116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=831><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;God causes to be forgotten for you part of your iniquity.&#8221; The meaning is that God was exacting less punishment from Job than Job deserved, for Job could not remember all his sins. This statement is fitting for Zophar, who is the cruelest of Job&#8217;s friends (see H. H. Rowley, <i>Job</i> [NCBC], 88). Others in an attempt to improve the text make too many unwarranted changes. Some would read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1500;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yish</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alkha</font>, &#8220;he asks of you&#8221;) instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492; &#1500;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yasseh lÿka</font>, &#8220;he causes to be forgotten for you&#8221;). This would mean that God demands an account of Job&#8217;s sin. But, as D. J. A. Clines says, this change is weak and needless (<i>Job </i>[WBC], 254-55).</p>
<A NAME="1117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=832><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">matsa</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to find; to discover&#8221;). Here it should be given the nuance of potential imperfect. And, in the rhetorical question it is affirming that Job cannot find out the essence of God.</p>
<A NAME="1118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=833><b>tn</b> The word means &#8220;search; investigation&#8221;; but it here means what is discovered in the search (so a metonymy of cause for the effect). </p>
<A NAME="1119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=834><b>tn</b> The same verb is now found in the second half of the verse, with a slightly different sense &#8211; &#8220;attain, reach.&#8221; A. R. Ceresko notes this as an example of antanaclasis (repetition of a word with a lightly different sense &#8211; &#8220;find/attain&#8221;). See &#8220;The Function of Antanaclasis in Hebrew Poetry,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 44 (1982): 560-61.</p>
<A NAME="1120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=835><b>tn</b> The abstract <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1499;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">takhlit</font>) from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kalah</font>,<i> </i>&#8220;to be complete; to be perfect&#8221;) may mean the end or limit of something, perhaps to perfection. So the NIV has &#8220;can you probe the limits of the Almighty?&#8221; The LXX has: &#8220;have you come to the end of that which the Almighty has made?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=836><b>tn</b> The Hebrew says &#8220;heights of heaven, what can you do?&#8221; A. B. Davidson suggested this was an exclamation and should be left that way. But most commentators will repoint <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1456;&#1492;&#1461;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">govhe shamayim</font>, &#8220;heights of heaven&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1465;&#1492;&#1464;&#1492; &#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gÿvohah mishamayim</font>, &#8220;higher than the heavens&#8221;) to match the parallel expression. The LXX may have rearranged the text: &#8220;heaven is high.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=837><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;deeper than hell.&#8221; The word &#8220;Sheol&#8221; always poses problems for translation. Here because it is the opposite of heaven in this merism, &#8220;hell&#8221; would be a legitimate translation. It refers to the realm of the dead &#8211; the grave and beyond. The language is excessive; but the point is that God&#8217;s wisdom is immeasurable &#8211; and Job is powerless before it.</p>
<A NAME="1123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=838><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1465;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yakhalof</font>) is literally &#8220;passes by/through&#8221; (NIV &#8220;comes along&#8221; in the sense of &#8220;if it should so happen&#8221;). Many accept the emendation to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yakhtof</font>, &#8220;he seizes,&#8221; cf. Gordis, Driver), but there is not much support for these.</p>
<A NAME="1124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=839><b>tn</b> The verb is the Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sagar</font>, &#8220;to close; to shut&#8221;) and so here in this context it probably means something like &#8220;to shut in; to confine.&#8221; But this is a difficult meaning, and the sentence is cryptic. E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 162) thinks this word and the next have to be antithetical, and so he suggests from a meaning &#8220;to keep confined&#8221; the idea of keeping a matter secret; and with the next verb, &#8220;to convene an assembly,&#8221; he offers &#8220;to divulge it.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=840><b>tn</b> The pronoun &#8220;you&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text but has been supplied in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="1126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=841><b>tn</b> The denominative Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qahal</font>, &#8220;an assembly&#8221;) has the idea of &#8220;to convene an assembly.&#8221; In this context there would be the legal sense of convening a court, i.e., calling Job to account (D. J. A. Clines, <i>Job </i>[WBC], 255). See E. Ullendorff, &#8220;The Meaning of <i>QHLT</i>,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 12 (1962): 215; he defines the verb also as &#8220;argue, rebuke.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=842><b>tn</b> The verb means &#8220;turn him back.&#8221; Zophar uses Job&#8217;s own words (see 9:12).</p>
<A NAME="1128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=843><b>tn</b> The pronoun is emphatic implying that Zophar indicates that God indeed knows Job&#8217;s sin even if Job does not. </p>
<A NAME="1129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=844><b>tn</b> The expression is literally &#8220;men of emptiness&#8221; (see Ps 26:4). These are false men, for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shavÿ</font>&#8217;) can mean &#8220;vain, empty, or false, deceitful.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1130"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=845><b>tn</b> E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 162) reads the prepositional phrase &#8220;to him&#8221; rather than the negative; he translates the line as &#8220;he sees iniquity and observes it closely.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=846><b>tn</b> Some commentators do not take this last clause as a question, but simply as a statement, namely, that when God sees evil he does not need to ponder or consider it &#8211; he knows it instantly. In that case it would be a circumstantial clause: &#8220;without considering it.&#8221; D. J. A. Clines lists quite an array of other interpretations for the line (<i>Job </i>[WBC], 255); for example, &#8220;and he is himself unobserved&#8221;; taking the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;) as an emphatic; taking the negative as a noun, &#8220;considering them as nothing&#8221;; and others that change the verb to &#8220;they do not understand it.&#8221; But none of these are compelling; they offer no major improvement.</p>
<A NAME="1132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=847><b>tn</b> As A. B. Davidson (<i>Job</i>, 84) says, the one thing will happen when the other happens &#8211; which is never. The word &#8220;empty&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">navuv</font>) means &#8220;hollow; witless,&#8221; and &#8220;become wise&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1461;&#1489;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yillavev</font>) is &#8220;will get heart&#8221; (not to &#8220;lack heart&#8221; as Driver suggested&#8221;). Many commentators do not like the last line of the verse, and so offer even more emendations. E. F. Sutcliffe wanted to change <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pere</font>&#8217;, &#8220;donkey&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pered</font>, &#8220;stallion&#8221;), rendering &#8220;a witless wight may get wit when a mule is born a stallion&#8221; (&#8220;Notes on Job, textual and exegetical,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 30 [1949]: 70-71); and others approached the verse by changing the verb from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1493;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1461;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yivvaled</font>, &#8220;is born&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1461;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yillamed</font>, &#8220;is taught&#8221;), resulting in &#8220;a hollow man may get understanding, and a wild donkey&#8217;s colt may be taught [= tamed]&#8221; (cf. NAB).</p>
<A NAME="1133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=848><b>tn</b> The pronoun is emphatic, designed to put Job in a different class than the hollow men &#8211; at least to raise the possibility of his being in a different class.</p>
<A NAME="1134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=849><b>tn</b> The Hebrew uses the perfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kun</font>, &#8220;establish&#8221;) with the object &#8220;your heart.&#8221; The verb can be translated &#8220;prepare, fix, make firm&#8221; your heart. To fix the heart is to make it faithful and constant, the heart being the seat of the will and emotions. The use of the perfect here does not refer to the past, but should be given a future perfect sense &#8211; if you shall have fixed your heart, i.e., prove faithful. Job would have to make his heart secure, so that he was no longer driven about by differing views.</p>
<A NAME="1135"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=850><b>tn</b> This half-verse is part of the protasis and not, as in the RSV, the apodosis to the first half. The series of &#8220;if&#8221; clauses will continue through these verses until v. 15.</p>
<A NAME="1136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=851><b>sn</b> This is the posture of prayer (see Isa 1:15). The expression means &#8220;spread out your palms,&#8221; probably meaning that the one praying would fall to his knees, put his forehead to the ground, and spread out his hands in front of him on the ground.</p>
<A NAME="1137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=852><b>tn</b> Verse 14 should be taken as a parenthesis and not a continuation of the protasis, because it does not fit with v. 13 in that way (D. J. A. Clines, <i>Job </i>[WBC], 256).</p>
<A NAME="1138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=853><b>tn</b> Many commentators follow the Vulgate and read the line &#8220;if you put away the sin that is in your hand.&#8221; They do this because the imperative comes between the protasis (v. 13) and the apodosis (v. 15) and does not appear to be clearly part of the protasis. The idea is close to the MT, but the MT is much more forceful &#8211; if you find sin in your hand, get rid of it.</p>
<A NAME="1139"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=854><b>tn</b> The absolute certainty of the statement is communicated with the addition of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) (see GKC 498 §159.<i>ee</i>).</p>
<A NAME="1140"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=855><b>tn</b> For this use of the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">min</font>) see GKC 382 §119.<i>w</i>.</p>
<A NAME="1141"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=856><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;lift up&#8221; is chosen to recall Job&#8217;s statement that he could not lift up his head (10:15); and the words &#8220;without spot&#8221; recall his words &#8220;filled with shame.&#8221; The sentence here says that he will lift up his face in innocence and show no signs of God&#8217;s anger on him.</p>
<A NAME="1142"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=857><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1467;&#1510;&#1464;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mutsaq</font>) is a Hophal participle from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatsaq</font>, &#8220;to pour&#8221;). The idea is that of metal being melted down and then poured to make a statue, and so hard, firm, solid. The LXX reads the verse, &#8220;for thus your face shall shine again, like pure water, and you shall divest yourself of uncleanness, and shall not fear.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1143"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=858><b>tn</b> For a second time (see v. 13) Zophar employs the emphatic personal pronoun. Could he be providing a gentle reminder that Job might have forgotten the sin that has brought this trouble? After all, there will come a time when Job will not remember this time of trial.</p>
<A NAME="1144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=859><b>sn</b> It is interesting to note in the book that the resolution of Job&#8217;s trouble did not come in the way that Zophar prescribed it.</p>
<A NAME="1145"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=860><b>tn</b> The perfect verb forms an abbreviated relative clause (without the pronoun) modifying &#8220;water.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1146"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=861><b>tn</b> Some translations add the pronoun to make it specifically related to Job (&#8220;your life&#8221;), but this is not necessary. The word used here has the nuance of lasting life.</p>
<A NAME="1147"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=862><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and more than the noonday life will arise.&#8221; The present translation is an interpretation in the context. The connotation of &#8220;arise&#8221; in comparison with the noonday, and in contrast with the darkness, supports the interpretation.</p>
<A NAME="1148"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=863><b>tn</b> The form in the MT is the 3fsg imperfect verb, &#8220;[though] it be dark.&#8221; Most commentators revocalize the word to make it a noun (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1467;&#1508;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ufah</font>), giving the meaning &#8220;the darkness [of your life] will be like the morning.&#8221; The contrast is with Job 10:22; here the darkness will shine like the morning. </p>
<A NAME="1149"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=864><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb means &#8220;to dig&#8221;; but this does not provide a good meaning for the verse. A. B. Davidson offers an interpretation of &#8220;search,&#8221; suggesting that before retiring at night Job would search and find everything in order. Some offer a better solution, namely, redefining the word on the basis of Arabic <i>hafara</i>, &#8220;to protect&#8221; and repointing it to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1495;&#1467;&#1508;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿkhufarta</font>, &#8220;you will be protected&#8221;). Other attempts to make sense of the line have involved the same process, but they are less convincing (for some of the more plausible proposals, see D. J. A. Clines, <i>Job </i>[WBC], 257).</p>
<A NAME="1150"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=865><b>tn</b> The clause that reads &#8220;and there is no one making you afraid,&#8221; is functioning circumstantially here (see 5:4; 10:7).</p>
<A NAME="1151"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=866><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they will stroke your face,&#8221; a picture drawn from the domestic scene of a child stroking the face of the parent. The verb is a Piel, meaning &#8220;stroke, make soft.&#8221; It is used in the Bible of seeking favor from God (supplication); but it may on the human level also mean seeking to sway people by flattery. See further D. R. Ap-Thomas, &#8220;Notes on Some Terms Relating to Prayer,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 6 (1956): 225-41.</p>
<A NAME="1152"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=867><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kalah</font>) means &#8220;to fail, cease, fade away.&#8221; The fading of the eyes, i.e., loss of sight, loss of life&#8217;s vitality, indicates imminent death.</p>
<A NAME="1153"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=868><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> a &#8220;place of escape&#8221; (with this noun pattern). There is no place to escape to because they all perish.</p>
<A NAME="1154"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=869><b>tn</b> The word is to be interpreted as a metonymy; it represents what is hoped for.</p>
<A NAME="1155"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=870><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the breathing out of the soul&#8221;; cf. KJV, ASV &#8220;the giving up of the ghost.&#8221; The line is simply saying that the brightest hope that the wicked have is death.</p>
