<a name="134"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=34><b>sn</b> The meanings of the Babylonian names are more conjectural than is the case with the Hebrew names. The probable etymologies are as follows: <i>Belteshazzar</i> means &#8220;protect his life,&#8221; although the MT vocalization may suggest &#8220;Belti, protect the king&#8221; (cf. Dan 4:8); <i>Shadrach</i> perhaps means &#8220;command of Aku&#8221;; <i>Meshach</i> is of uncertain meaning; <i>Abednego</i> means &#8220;servant of Nego.&#8221; Assigning Babylonian names to the Hebrew youths may have been an attempt to erase from their memory their Israelite heritage.</p>
