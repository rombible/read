<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1><b>sn</b> The <i>third year of the reign of Jehoiakim</i> would be ca. 605 <span class="smallcaps">B.C</span>. At this time Daniel would have been a teenager. The reference to Jehoiakim&#8217;s third year poses a serious <i>crux interpretum</i>, since elsewhere these events are linked to his fourth year (Jer 25:1; cf. 2 Kgs 24:1; 2 Chr 36:5-8). Apparently Daniel is following an accession year chronology, whereby the first partial year of a king&#8217;s reign was reckoned as the accession year rather than as the first year of his reign. Jeremiah, on the other hand, is following a nonaccession year chronology, whereby the accession year is reckoned as the first year of the king&#8217;s reign. In that case, the conflict is only superficial. Most modern scholars, however, have concluded that Daniel is historically inaccurate here.</p>
