<a name="115"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=15><b>sn</b> The word <i>court official </i>(Hebrew <font face="Scholar">saris</font>) need not mean &#8220;eunuch&#8221; in a technical sense (see Gen 37:36, where the term refers to Potiphar, who had a wife), although in the case of the book of Daniel there was in Jewish literature a common tradition to that effect. On the OT usage of this word see <i>HALOT</i> 769-70 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1512;&#1465;&#1497;&#1505;</font>.</p>
