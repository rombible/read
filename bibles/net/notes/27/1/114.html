<a name="114"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=14><b>sn</b> It is possible that the word <i>Ashpenaz</i> is not a proper name at all, but a general term for &#8220;innkeeper.&#8221; See J. J. Collins, <i>Daniel </i>(Hermeneia), 127, n. 9. However, the ancient versions understand the term to be a name, and the present translation (along with most English versions) understands the word in this way.</p>
