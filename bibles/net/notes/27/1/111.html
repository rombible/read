<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;gods&#8221; (NCV, NRSV, TEV; also later in this verse). The Hebrew term can be used as a numerical plural for many gods or as a plural of majesty for one particular god. Since Nebuchadnezzar was a polytheist, it is not clear if the reference here is to many gods or one particular deity. The plural of majesty, while normally used for Israel&#8217;s God, is occasionally used of foreign gods (cf. BDB 43 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> 1, 2). See Judg 11:24 (of the Moabite god Chemosh); 1 Sam 5:7 (of the Philistine god Dagon); 1 Kgs 11:33 (of the Canaanite goddess Astarte, the Moabite god Chemosh, and the Ammonite god Milcom); 2 Kgs 19:37 (of the Assyrian god Nisroch). Since gods normally had their own individual temples, Dan 1:2 probably refers to a particular deity, perhaps Marduk, the supreme god of Babylon, or Marduk&#8217;s son Nabu, after whom Nebuchadnezzar was named. The name Nebuchadnezzar means &#8220;Nabu has protected the son who will inherit&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 660 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1512;&#1462;&#1488;&#1510;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;</font>).
