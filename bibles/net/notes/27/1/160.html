<a name="160"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=60><b>sn</b> The Persian king Cyrus&#8217; <i>first year</i> in control of Babylon was 539 <span class="smallcaps">B.C</span>. Daniel actually lived beyond the first year of Cyrus, as is clear from 10:1. The purpose of the statement in 1:21 is merely to say that Daniel&#8217;s life spanned the entire period of the neo-Babylonian empire. His life span also included the early years of the Persian control of Babylon. However, by that time his age was quite advanced; he probably died sometime in the 530&#8217;s <span class="smallcaps">B.C</span>.</p>
