<A NAME="106"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=563><b>sn</b> Anointing oneself with oil (usually olive oil) was a common OT practice due to the severity of the Middle Eastern sun (cf. Ps 121:6). It was also associated with rejoicing (e.g., Prov 27:9) and was therefore usually not practiced during a period of mourning.</p>
