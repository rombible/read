<A NAME="103"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=560><b>tn</b> The meaning of the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsava</font>&#8217;) is uncertain in this context. The word most often refers to an army or warfare. It may also mean &#8220;hard service,&#8221; and many commentators take that to be the sense here (i.e., &#8220;the service was great&#8221;). The present translation assumes the reference to be to the spiritual conflicts described, for example, in 10:16&#8211;11:1.</p>
