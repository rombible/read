<A NAME="108"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=565><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hiddaqel</font>). &#8220;Tigris&#8221; appears here in the LXX, since it is the Greek name for this river. Elsewhere in the OT &#8220;the great river&#8221; refers to the Euphrates (e.g., Gen 15:18; Josh 1:4), leading some interpreters to think that a mistake is involved in using the expression to refer to the Tigris. But it is doubtful that the expression had such a fixed and limited usage. The Syriac, however, does render the word here by &#8220;Euphrates&#8221; (Syr. <font face="Scholar">perat</font>) in keeping with biblical usage elsewhere.</p>
