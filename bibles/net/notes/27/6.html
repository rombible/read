<A NAME="61"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=310><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;It was pleasing before Darius.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="62"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=311><b>tn</b> This is a technical term for an official placed in charge of a region of the empire (cf. KJV, NLT &#8220;prince[s]&#8221;; NCV, TEV &#8220;governors&#8221;). These satraps were answerable to a supervisor, who in turn answered to Darius. </p>
<A NAME="63"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=312><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;giving an account.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="64"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=313><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;looking to find.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="65"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=314><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;from the side of the kingdom.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="66"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=315><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;pretext and corruption.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="67"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=316><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;no negligence or corruption was found in him.&#8221; The Greek version of Theodotion lacks the phrase &#8220;and no negligence or corruption was found in him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="68"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=317><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;were saying.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="69"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=318><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;unless we find [it] against him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=319><b>tn</b> The Aramaic verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1456;&#1490;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rÿgash</font>) occurs three times in this chapter (vv. 7, 12, 16). Its meaning is widely disputed by commentators, and the versions vary considerably in how they render the word. The suggestion that it means &#8220;to come thronging&#8221; (BDB 1112 s.v.; cf. NAB) seems inappropriate, since it is unlikely that subordinates would enter a royal court in such a reckless fashion. The ancient versions struggled with the word and are not in agreement in their understanding of its meaning. In this chapter the word apparently means to act in agreement with other parties in the pursuit of a duplicitous goal, namely the entrapment of Daniel. Cf. NIV, NCV &#8220;went as a group&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;conspired and came to the king.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=320><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;thus they were saying.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=321><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;prays a prayer.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=322><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;establish a written interdict and inscribe a written decree.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=323><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;removed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=324><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;knew.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=325><b>sn</b> In later rabbinic thought this verse was sometimes cited as a proof text for the notion that one should pray only in a house with windows. See <i>b. Berakhot</i> 34b.</p>
<A NAME="617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=326><b>map</b> For the location of Jerusalem see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=327><b>sn</b> This is apparently the only specific mention in the OT of prayer being regularly offered three times a day. The practice was probably not unique to Daniel, however.</p>
<A NAME="619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=328><b>tc</b> Read with several medieval Hebrew <sc>MSS and printed editions <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1458;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">havah</font>) rather than the MT <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hu</font>&#8217;). </p>
<A NAME="620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=329><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;kneeling on his knees&#8221; (so NASB).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> No specific posture for <i>offering prayers</i> is prescribed in the OT. Kneeling, as here, and standing were both practiced.</p>
<A NAME="621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=330><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;those men&#8221;; the referent (the administrative officials who had earlier approached the king about the edict) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=331><b>tc</b> The MT also has &#8220;about the edict of the king,&#8221; but this phrase is absent in the LXX and the Syriac. The present translation deletes the expression.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;before the king.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=332><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;the word is true.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=333><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;from the sons of the captivity [of].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="625"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=334><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;prays his prayer.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="626"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=335><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;the word.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="627"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=336><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;placed his mind on.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="628"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=337><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;the entrances of the sun.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="629"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=338><b>tc</b> Theodotion lacks the words &#8220;came by collusion to the king and.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="630"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=339><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;the king.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="631"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=340><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;know&#8221;; NAB &#8220;Keep in mind&#8221;; NASB &#8220;Recognize&#8221;; NIV, NCV &#8220;Remember.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="632"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=341><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;said.&#8221; So also in vv. 24, 25.</p>
<A NAME="633"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=342><b>sn</b> The <i>den</i> was perhaps a pit below ground level which could be safely observed from above.</p>
<A NAME="634"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=343><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;answered and said [to Daniel].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="635"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=344><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;mouth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="636"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=345><b>sn</b> The purpose of the den being <i>sealed</i> was to prevent unauthorized tampering with the opening of the den. Any disturbance of the seal would immediately alert the officials to improper activity of this sort.</p>
<A NAME="637"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=346><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;the signet rings.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="638"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=347><b>tn</b> The meaning of Aramaic <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dakhavah</font>) is a <i>crux interpretum</i>. Suggestions include &#8220;music,&#8221; &#8220;dancing girls,&#8221; &#8220;concubines,&#8221; &#8220;table,&#8221; &#8220;food&#8221; &#8211; all of which are uncertain. The translation employed here, suggested by earlier scholars, is deliberately vague. A number of recent English versions follow a similar approach with &#8220;entertainment&#8221; (e.g., NASB, NIV, NCV, TEV, CEV, NLT). On this word see further, <i>HALOT</i> 1849-50 s.v.; E. Vogt, <i>Lexicon linguae aramaicae</i>, 37.</p>
<A NAME="639"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=348><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;his sleep fled from him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="640"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=349><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;The king answered and said to Daniel.&#8221; This phrase has not been included in the translation for stylistic reasons; it is redundant in English.</p>
<A NAME="641"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=350><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;with.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="642"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=351><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="643"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=352><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;had eaten the pieces of.&#8221; The Aramaic expression is ironic, in that the accusers who had figuratively &#8220;eaten the pieces of Daniel&#8221; are themselves literally devoured by the lions.</p>
<A NAME="644"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=353><b>tn</b> The Aramaic active impersonal verb is often used as a substitute for the passive.</p>
<A NAME="645"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=354><b>tc</b> The LXX specifies only the two overseers, together with their families, as those who were cast into the lions&#8217; den.</p>
<A NAME="646"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=355><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;May your peace be increased!&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="647"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=356><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;until the end.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="648"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=357><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;hand.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="649"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=358><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;in the reign of Darius, even in the reign of Cyrus.&#8221; The identity of this Darius is disputed. Some take the name to be referring to Cyrus, understanding the following <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>, &#8220;and&#8221;) in an epexegetical sense (&#8220;even&#8221;). Others identify Darius with a governor of Babylon known from extra-biblical records as Gubaru, or with Cambyses, son of Cyrus. Many scholars maintain that the reference is historically inaccurate.</p>
