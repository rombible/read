<A NAME="649"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=358><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;in the reign of Darius, even in the reign of Cyrus.&#8221; The identity of this Darius is disputed. Some take the name to be referring to Cyrus, understanding the following <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>, &#8220;and&#8221;) in an epexegetical sense (&#8220;even&#8221;). Others identify Darius with a governor of Babylon known from extra-biblical records as Gubaru, or with Cambyses, son of Cyrus. Many scholars maintain that the reference is historically inaccurate.</p>
