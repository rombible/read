<A NAME="610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=319><b>tn</b> The Aramaic verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1456;&#1490;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rÿgash</font>) occurs three times in this chapter (vv. 7, 12, 16). Its meaning is widely disputed by commentators, and the versions vary considerably in how they render the word. The suggestion that it means &#8220;to come thronging&#8221; (BDB 1112 s.v.; cf. NAB) seems inappropriate, since it is unlikely that subordinates would enter a royal court in such a reckless fashion. The ancient versions struggled with the word and are not in agreement in their understanding of its meaning. In this chapter the word apparently means to act in agreement with other parties in the pursuit of a duplicitous goal, namely the entrapment of Daniel. Cf. NIV, NCV &#8220;went as a group&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;conspired and came to the king.&#8221;</p>
