<A NAME="73"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=361><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;and visions of his head.&#8221; The Aramaic is difficult here. Some scholars add a verb thought to be missing (e.g., &#8220;the visions of his head [were alarming him]&#8221;), but there is no external evidence to support such a decision and the awkwardness of the text at this point may be original.</p>
