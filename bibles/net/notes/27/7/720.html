<A NAME="720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=378><b>sn</b> The <i>fourth animal</i> differs from the others in that it is nondescript. Apparently it was so fearsome that Daniel could find nothing with which to compare it. Attempts to identify this animal as an elephant or other known creature are conjectural.</p>
