<A NAME="739"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=397><b>tn</b> The Aramaic text includes the phrase &#8220;in its sheath,&#8221; apparently viewing the body as a container or receptacle for the spirit somewhat like a sheath or scabbard is for a knife or a sword (cf. NAB &#8220;within its sheath of flesh&#8221;). For this phrase the LXX and Vulgate have &#8220;in these things.&#8221;</p>
