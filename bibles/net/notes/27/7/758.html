<A NAME="758"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=416><b>tn</b> If the &#8220;holy ones&#8221; are angels, then this probably refers to the angels as protectors of God&#8217;s people. If the &#8220;holy ones&#8221; are God&#8217;s people, then this is an appositional construction, &#8220;the people who are the holy ones.&#8221; See 8:24 for the corresponding Hebrew phrase and the note there.</p>
