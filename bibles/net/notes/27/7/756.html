<A NAME="756"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=414><b>sn</b> Although the word <i>times </i>is vocalized in the MT as a plural, it probably should be regarded as a dual. The Masoretes may have been influenced here by the fact that in late Aramaic (and Syriac) the dual forms fall out of use. The meaning would thus be three and a half &#8220;times.&#8221;</p>
