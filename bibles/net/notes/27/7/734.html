<A NAME="734"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=392><b>sn</b> This text is probably the main OT background for Jesus&#8217; use of the term &#8220;son of man.&#8221; In both Jewish and Christian circles the reference in the book of Daniel has traditionally been understood to refer to an individual, usually in a messianic sense. Many modern scholars, however, understand the reference to have a corporate identity. In this view, the &#8220;son of man&#8221; is to be equated with the &#8220;holy ones&#8221; (vv. 18, 21, 22, 25) or the &#8220;people of the holy ones&#8221; (v. 27) and understood as a reference to the Jewish people. Others understand Daniel&#8217;s reference to be to the angel Michael.</p>
