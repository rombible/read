<A NAME="1181"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">81</span><note=670><b>sn</b> The name <i>Kittim</i> has various designations in extra-biblical literature. It can refer to a location on the island of Cyprus, or more generally to the island itself, or it can be an inclusive term to refer to parts of the Mediterranean world that lay west of the Middle East (e.g., Rome). For <i>ships of Kittim</i> the Greek OT (LXX) has &#8220;Romans,&#8221; an interpretation followed by a few English versions (e.g., TEV). A number of times in the Dead Sea Scrolls the word is used in reference to the Romans. Other English versions are more generic: &#8220;[ships] of the western coastlands&#8221; (NIV, NLT); &#8220;from the west&#8221; (NCV, CEV).</p>
