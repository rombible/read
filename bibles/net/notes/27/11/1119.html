<A NAME="1119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=608><b>tn</b> The text is difficult. The Hebrew has here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et</font>), the marker of a definite direct object. As it stands, this would suggest the meaning that &#8220;he will arouse everyone, that is, the kingdom of Greece.&#8221; The context, however, seems to suggest the idea that this Persian king will arouse in hostility against Greece the constituent elements of his own empire. This requires supplying the word &#8220;against,&#8221; which is not actually present in the Hebrew text.</p>
