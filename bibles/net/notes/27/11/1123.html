<A NAME="1123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=612><b>sn</b> The <i>king of the south</i> is Ptolemy I Soter (ca. 323-285 <sc>B.C.). The following reference to <i>one of his subordinates</i> apparently has in view Seleucus I Nicator (ca. 311-280 <sc>B.C.). Throughout the remainder of chap. 11 the expressions &#8220;king of the south&#8221; and &#8220;king of the north&#8221; repeatedly occur. It is clear, however, that these terms are being used generically to describe the Ptolemaic king (i.e., &#8220;of the south&#8221;) or the Seleucid king (i.e., &#8220;of the north&#8221;) who happens to be in power at any particular time. The specific identity of these kings can be established more or less successfully by a comparison of this chapter with the available extra-biblical records that discuss the history of the intertestamental period. In the following notes the generally accepted identifications are briefly mentioned.</p>
