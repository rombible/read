<A NAME="1115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=604><b>sn</b> The antecedent of the pronoun &#8220;I&#8221; is the angel, not Daniel. The traditional chapter division at this point, and the presence of a chronological note in the verse similar to ones used elsewhere in the book to position Daniel&#8217;s activities in relation to imperial affairs, sometimes lead to confusion on this matter.</p>
