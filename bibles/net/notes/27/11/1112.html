<A NAME="1112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=601><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a book of truth.&#8221; Several English versions treat this as a title of some sort (cf. NIV, NCV, TEV, CEV, NLT), although the NAB&#8217;s rendering &#8220;the truthful book&#8221; regards &#8220;truth&#8221; as an attributive adjective, as does the present translation.</p>
