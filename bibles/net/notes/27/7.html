<A NAME="71"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=359><b>sn</b> The <i>first year</i> of Belshazzar&#8217;s reign would have been ca. 553 <sc>B.C. Daniel would have been approximately 67 years old at the time of this vision.</p>
<A NAME="72"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=360><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;saw.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="73"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=361><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;and visions of his head.&#8221; The Aramaic is difficult here. Some scholars add a verb thought to be missing (e.g., &#8220;the visions of his head [were alarming him]&#8221;), but there is no external evidence to support such a decision and the awkwardness of the text at this point may be original.</p>
<A NAME="74"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=362><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;head of words.&#8221; The phrase is absent in Theodotion. Cf. NIV &#8220;the substance of his dream.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="75"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=363><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;answered and said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="76"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=364><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;and behold.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="77"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=365><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the heavens.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shamayim</font>) may be translated &#8220;heavens&#8221; or &#8220;sky&#8221; depending on the context.</p>
<A NAME="78"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=366><b>sn</b> The referent of <i>the great sea</i> is unclear. The common view that the expression refers to the Mediterranean Sea is conjectural.</p>
<A NAME="79"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=367><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;heart of a man.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=368><b>sn</b> The identity of the first animal, derived from v. 17 and the parallels in chap. 2, is Babylon. The reference to the plucking of its wings is probably a reference to the time of Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s insanity (cf. chap. 4). The latter part of v. 4 then describes the restoration of Nebuchadnezzar. The other animals have traditionally been understood to represent respectively Media-Persia, Greece, and Rome, although most of modern scholarship identifies them as Media, Persia, and Greece. For a biblical parallel to the mention of lion, bear, and leopard together, see Hos 13:7-8.</p>
<A NAME="711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=369><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;and behold.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=370><b>sn</b> The <i>three ribs</i> held securely in the mouth of the bear, perhaps representing Media-Persia, apparently symbolize military conquest, but the exact identity of the &#8220;ribs&#8221; is not clear. Possibly it is a reference to the Persian conquest of Lydia, Egypt, and Babylonia.</p>
<A NAME="713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=371><b>tc</b> The LXX lacks the phrase &#8220;between its teeth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=372><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;and thus they were saying to it.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=373><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;this.&#8221; So also in v. 7.</p>
<A NAME="716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=374><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;and behold, another one.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=375><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;sides.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=376><b>sn</b> If the third animal is Greece, the most likely identification of these <i>four heads</i> is the four-fold division of the empire of Alexander the Great following his death. See note on Dan 8:8.</p>
<A NAME="719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=377><b>tn</b> The Aramaic text has also &#8220;and behold.&#8221; So also in vv. 8, 13.</p>
<A NAME="720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=378><b>sn</b> The <i>fourth animal</i> differs from the others in that it is nondescript. Apparently it was so fearsome that Daniel could find nothing with which to compare it. Attempts to identify this animal as an elephant or other known creature are conjectural.</p>
<A NAME="721"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=379><b>tn</b> The Aramaic word for &#8220;teeth&#8221; is dual rather than plural, suggesting two rows of teeth.</p>
<A NAME="722"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=380><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;were uprooted from before it.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=381><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;great.&#8221; So also in vv. 11, 20.</p>
<A NAME="724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=382><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the Ancient One&#8221; (NAB, NRSV, NLT), although the traditional expression has been retained in the present translation because it is familiar to many readers. Cf. TEV &#8220;One who had been living for ever&#8221;; CEV &#8220;the Eternal God.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=383><b>tn</b> Traditionally the Aramaic word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1511;&#1461;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nÿqe</font>&#8217;) has been rendered &#8220;pure,&#8221; but here it more likely means &#8220;of a lamb.&#8221; Cf. the Syriac <font face="Scholar">neqya</font>&#8217; (&#8220;a sheep, ewe&#8221;). On this word see further, M. Sokoloff, &#8220;&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amar neqe</font>&#8217;, &#8216;Lamb&#8217;s Wool&#8217; (Dan 7:9),&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 95 (1976): 277-79.</p>
<A NAME="726"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=384><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;a flaming fire.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="727"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=385><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;were standing before him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="728"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=386><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;judgment sat.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=387><b>tc</b> The LXX and Theodotion lack the words &#8220;I was watching&#8221; here. It is possible that these words in the MT are a dittography from the first part of the verse.</p>
<A NAME="730"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=388><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;and given over to&#8221; (so NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="731"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=389><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;a prolonging of life was granted to them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="732"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=390><b>tc</b> The LXX has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#943; </font>(<font face="Greektl">epi</font>, &#8220;upon&#8221;) here (cf. Matt 24:30; 26:64). Theodotion has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#940;</font> (<font face="Greektl">meta</font>, &#8220;with&#8221;) here (cf. Mark 14:62; Rev 1:7).</p>
<A NAME="733"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=391><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the heavens.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shamayim</font>) may be translated &#8220;heavens&#8221; or &#8220;sky&#8221; depending on the context.</p>
<A NAME="734"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=392><b>sn</b> This text is probably the main OT background for Jesus&#8217; use of the term &#8220;son of man.&#8221; In both Jewish and Christian circles the reference in the book of Daniel has traditionally been understood to refer to an individual, usually in a messianic sense. Many modern scholars, however, understand the reference to have a corporate identity. In this view, the &#8220;son of man&#8221; is to be equated with the &#8220;holy ones&#8221; (vv. 18, 21, 22, 25) or the &#8220;people of the holy ones&#8221; (v. 27) and understood as a reference to the Jewish people. Others understand Daniel&#8217;s reference to be to the angel Michael.</p>
<A NAME="735"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=393><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;they brought him near.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="736"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=394><b>tn</b> Some take &#8220;serving&#8221; here in the sense of &#8220;worshiping.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="737"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=395><b>tn</b> <i>Aram </i>&#8220;is an eternal authority which will not pass away.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="738"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=396><b>tn</b> <i>Aram </i>&#8220;is one which will not be destroyed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="739"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=397><b>tn</b> The Aramaic text includes the phrase &#8220;in its sheath,&#8221; apparently viewing the body as a container or receptacle for the spirit somewhat like a sheath or scabbard is for a knife or a sword (cf. NAB &#8220;within its sheath of flesh&#8221;). For this phrase the LXX and Vulgate have &#8220;in these things.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="740"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=398><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;head.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="741"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=399><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;what is certain.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="742"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=400><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;and made known.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="743"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=401><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;matter,&#8221; but the matter at hand is of course the vision.</p>
<A NAME="744"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=402><b>sn</b> The expression <i>holy ones</i> is either a reference to angels or to human beings devoted to God.</p>
<A NAME="745"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=403><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;to make certain.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="746"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=404><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;I also wanted to know&#8221; are added in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="747"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=405><b>tc</b> The conjunction in the MT before &#8220;eyes&#8221; is odd. The ancient versions do not seem to presuppose it.</p>
<A NAME="748"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=406><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;greater than its companions.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="749"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=407><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;prevailing against&#8221; (KJV and ASV both similar); NASB &#8220;overpowering them&#8221;; TEV &#8220;conquered them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="750"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=408><b>tc</b> In the LXX, Syriac, and Vulgate the verb is active, understanding &#8220;judgment&#8221; to be the object rather than the subject of the verb (i.e., &#8220;the Ancient of Days rendered judgment&#8221;). This presupposes a different vocalization of the verb ( <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;</font> [<font face="Scholar">yÿhav</font>] rather than the MT <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1489;</font> [<font face="Scholar">yÿhiv</font>]).</p>
<A NAME="751"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=409><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;thus he said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="752"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=410><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;subjugate&#8221;; KJV, NASB, NIV &#8220;subdue&#8221;; ASV, NRSV &#8220;put down.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="753"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=411><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;wear out&#8221; (so KJV, ASV, NRSV); NASB, NLT &#8220;wear down.&#8221; The word is a <i>hapax legomenon</i> in biblical Aramaic, but in biblical Hebrew it especially refers to wearing out such things as garments. Here it is translated &#8220;harass&#8230;continually.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="754"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=412><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;he will think.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="755"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=413><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;times and law.&#8221; The present translation is based on the understanding that the expression is a hendiadys.</p>
<A NAME="756"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=414><b>sn</b> Although the word <i>times </i>is vocalized in the MT as a plural, it probably should be regarded as a dual. The Masoretes may have been influenced here by the fact that in late Aramaic (and Syriac) the dual forms fall out of use. The meaning would thus be three and a half &#8220;times.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="757"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=415><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;judgment will sit&#8221; (KJV similar).</p>
<A NAME="758"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=416><b>tn</b> If the &#8220;holy ones&#8221; are angels, then this probably refers to the angels as protectors of God&#8217;s people. If the &#8220;holy ones&#8221; are God&#8217;s people, then this is an appositional construction, &#8220;the people who are the holy ones.&#8221; See 8:24 for the corresponding Hebrew phrase and the note there.</p>
<A NAME="759"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=417><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;my brightness was changing on me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="760"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=418><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;in my heart.&#8221;</p>
