<A NAME="967"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=549><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sevens&#8221; (also later in this line and in v. 26).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The accents in the MT indicate disjunction at this point, which would make it difficult, if not impossible, to identify the &#8220;anointed one/prince&#8221; of this verse as messianic. The reference in v. 26 to the sixty-two weeks as a unit favors the MT accentuation, not the traditional translation. If one follows the MT accentuation, one may translate &#8220;From the going forth of the message to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until an anointed one, a prince arrives, there will be a period of seven weeks. During a period of sixty-two weeks it will again be built, with plaza and moat, but in distressful times.&#8221; The present translation follows a traditional reading of the passage that deviates from the MT accentuation. </p>
