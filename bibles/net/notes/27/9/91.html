<A NAME="91"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=483><b>sn</b> The identity of this <i>Darius</i> is a major problem in correlating the biblical material with the extra-biblical records of this period. Most modern scholars treat the reference as a mistaken allusion to Darius Hystaspes (ca. 522-486 <sc>B.C.). Others have maintained instead that this name is a reference to the Persian governor Gubaru. Still others understand the reference to be to the Persian king Cyrus (cf. 6:28, where the <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) may be understood as <font face="Scholar">vav explicativum</font>, meaning &#8220;even&#8221;). Under either of these latter two interpretations, the <i>first year of Darius</i> would have been ca. 538 <sc>B.C. Daniel would have been approximately eighty-two years old at this time.</p>
