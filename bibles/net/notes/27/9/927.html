<A NAME="927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=509><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the curse and the oath which is written.&#8221; The term &#8220;curse&#8221; refers here to the judgments threatened in the Mosaic law (see Deut 28) for rebellion. The expression &#8220;the curse and the oath&#8221; is probably a hendiadys (cf. Num 5:21; Neh 10:29) referring to the fact that the covenant with its threatened judgments was ratified by solemn oath and made legally binding upon the covenant community. </p>
