<A NAME="531"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=281><b>tc</b> The MT includes a redundant reference to &#8220;your father the king&#8221; at the end of v. 11. None of the attempts to explain this phrase as original are very convincing. The present translation deletes the phrase, following Theodotion and the Syriac.</p>
