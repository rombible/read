<A NAME="51"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=251><b>sn</b> As is clear from the extra-biblical records, it was actually Nabonidus (ca. 556-539 <sc>B.C.) who was king of Babylon at this time. However, Nabonidus spent long periods of time at Teima, and during those times Belshazzar his son was <i>de facto</i> king of Babylon. This arrangement may help to explain why later in this chapter Belshazzar promises that the successful interpreter of the handwriting on the wall will be made<i> third</i> ruler in the kingdom. If Belshazzar was in effect second ruler in the kingdom, this would be the highest honor he could grant.</p>
