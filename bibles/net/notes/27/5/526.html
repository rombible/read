<A NAME="526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=276><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;the queen&#8221; (so NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV). In the following discourse this woman is able to recall things about Daniel that go back to the days of Nebuchadnezzar, things that Belshazzar does not seem to recollect. It is likely that she was the wife not of Belshazzar but of Nabonidus or perhaps even Nebuchadnezzar. In that case, &#8220;queen&#8221; here means &#8220;queen mother&#8221; (cf. NCV &#8220;the king&#8217;s mother&#8221;).</p>
