<A NAME="327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=160><b>tc</b> In the MT this word is understood to begin the following address (&#8220;answered and said to the king, &#8216;O Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;&#8221;). However, it seems unlikely that Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s subordinates would address the king in such a familiar way, particularly in light of the danger that they now found themselves in. The present translation implies moving the <i>atnach</i> from &#8220;king&#8221; to &#8220;Nebuchadnezzar.&#8221;</p>
