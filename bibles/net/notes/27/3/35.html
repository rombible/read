The ancient world knew of other tall statues. For example, the Colossus of Rhodes &#8211; the huge statue of Helios which stood (ca. 280-224 <sc>B.C.) at the entrance to the harbor at Rhodes and was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world &#8211; was said to be seventy cubits (105 ft or 32 m) in height, which would make it even taller than Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s image.</p>
