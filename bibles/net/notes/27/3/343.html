<A NAME="343"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=176><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>like that of a god</i> is in Aramaic &#8220;like that of a son of the gods.&#8221; Many patristic writers understood this phrase in a christological sense (i.e., &#8220;the Son of God&#8221;). But it should be remembered that these are words spoken by a pagan who is seeking to explain things from his own polytheistic frame of reference; for him the phrase &#8220;like a son of the gods&#8221; is equivalent to &#8220;like a divine being.&#8221;</p>
