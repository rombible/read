<A NAME="330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=163><b>tn</b> The Aramaic expression used here is very difficult to interpret. The question concerns the meaning and syntax of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1463;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">itay</font>, &#8220;is&#8221; or &#8220;exist&#8221;). There are several possibilities. (1) Some interpreters take this word closely with the participle later in the verse <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1499;&#1460;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yakhil</font>, &#8220;able&#8221;), understanding the two words to form a periphrastic construction (&#8220;if our God is&#8230;able&#8221;; cf. H. Bauer and P. Leander, <i>Grammatik des Biblisch-Aramäischen</i>, 365, §111b). But the separation of the two elements from one another is not an argument in favor of this understanding. (2) Other interpreters take the first part of v. 17 to mean &#8220;If it is so, then our God will deliver us&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV, RSV, NASB). However, the normal sense of <i>&#8217;</i><font face="Scholar">itay</font><i> </i>is existence; on this point see F. Rosenthal, <i>Grammar</i>, 45, §95. The present translation maintains the sense of existence for the verb (&#8220;If our God&#8230;exists&#8221;), even though the statement is admittedly difficult to understand in this light. The statement may be an implicit reference back to Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s comment in v. 15, which denies the existence of a god capable of delivering from the king&#8217;s power. </p>
