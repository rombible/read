At this time Daniel would have been a teenager. The reference to Jehoiakim&#8217;s third year poses a serious <i>crux interpretum</i>, since elsewhere these events are linked to his fourth year (Jer 25:1; cf. 2 Kgs 24:1; 2 Chr 36:5-8). Apparently Daniel is following an accession year chronology, whereby the first partial year of a king&#8217;s reign was reckoned as the accession year rather than as the first year of his reign. Jeremiah, on the other hand, is following a nonaccession year chronology, whereby the accession year is reckoned as the first year of the king&#8217;s reign. In that case, the conflict is only superficial. Most modern scholars, however, have concluded that Daniel is historically inaccurate here.</p>

<a name="110"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=10><b>sn</b> The <i>land of Babylonia</i> (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;the land of Shinar&#8221;) is another name for Sumer and Akkad, where Babylon was located (cf. Gen 10:10; 11:2; 14:1, 9; Josh 7:21; Isa 11:11; Zech 5:11).</p>
<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;gods&#8221; (NCV, NRSV, TEV; also later in this verse). The Hebrew term can be used as a numerical plural for many gods or as a plural of majesty for one particular god. Since Nebuchadnezzar was a polytheist, it is not clear if the reference here is to many gods or one particular deity. The plural of majesty, while normally used for Israel&#8217;s God, is occasionally used of foreign gods (cf. BDB 43 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> 1, 2). See Judg 11:24 (of the Moabite god Chemosh); 1 Sam 5:7 (of the Philistine god Dagon); 1 Kgs 11:33 (of the Canaanite goddess Astarte, the Moabite god Chemosh, and the Ammonite god Milcom); 2 Kgs 19:37 (of the Assyrian god Nisroch). Since gods normally had their own individual temples, Dan 1:2 probably refers to a particular deity, perhaps Marduk, the supreme god of Babylon, or Marduk&#8217;s son Nabu, after whom Nebuchadnezzar was named. The name Nebuchadnezzar means &#8220;Nabu has protected the son who will inherit&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 660 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1512;&#1462;&#1488;&#1510;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;</font>). For a discussion of how temples functioned in Babylonian religion see H. Ringgren, <i>Religions of the Ancient Near East</i>, 77-81. </p>

<a name="114"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=14><b>sn</b> It is possible that the word <i>Ashpenaz</i> is not a proper name at all, but a general term for &#8220;innkeeper.&#8221; See J. J. Collins, <i>Daniel </i>(Hermeneia), 127, n. 9. However, the ancient versions understand the term to be a name, and the present translation (along with most English versions) understands the word in this way.</p>
<a name="115"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=15><b>sn</b> The word <i>court official </i>(Hebrew <font face="Scholar">saris</font>) need not mean &#8220;eunuch&#8221; in a technical sense (see Gen 37:36, where the term refers to Potiphar, who had a wife), although in the case of the book of Daniel there was in Jewish literature a common tradition to that effect.

<a name="132"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=32><b>sn</b> The names reflect a Jewish heritage.

<a name="133"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=33><b>tc</b> The LXX and Vulgate lack the verb here.</p>
<a name="134"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=34><b>sn</b> The meanings of the Babylonian names are more conjectural than is the case with the Hebrew names. The probable etymologies are as follows: <i>Belteshazzar</i> means &#8220;protect his life,&#8221; although the MT vocalization may suggest &#8220;Belti, protect the king&#8221; (cf. Dan 4:8); <i>Shadrach</i> perhaps means &#8220;command of Aku&#8221;; <i>Meshach</i> is of uncertain meaning; <i>Abednego</i> means &#8220;servant of Nego.&#8221; Assigning Babylonian names to the Hebrew youths may have been an attempt to erase from their memory their Israelite heritage.</p>
<a name="135"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=35><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;placed on his heart.&#8221;</p>

Perhaps it had to do with violations of Mosaic law with regard to unclean foods, or perhaps it had to do with such food having been offered to idols. Daniel&#8217;s practice in this regard is strikingly different from that of Esther, who was able successfully to conceal her Jewish identity.</p>
<a name="137"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=37><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;with the delicacies of the king and with the wine of his drinking.&#8221;</p>
<a name="138"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=38><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Then God granted Daniel loyal love and compassion before the overseer of the court officials.&#8221; The expression &#8220;loyal love and compassion&#8221; is a hendiadys; the two words combine to express one idea.</p>
<a name="139"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=39><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;The overseer of the court officials.&#8221; The subject has been specified in the translation for the sake of clarity.</p>

<a name="141"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=41><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Why should he see your faces thin from the young men who are according to your age?&#8221; The term translated &#8220;thin&#8221; occurs only here and in Gen 40:6, where it appears to refer to a dejected facial expression. The word is related to an Arabic root meaning &#8220;be weak.&#8221; See <i>HALOT</i> 277 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1506;&#1507;</font>.</p>
<a name="142"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=42><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;if that happened&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text but have been added in the translation for clarity.</p>
<a name="143"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=43><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my head.&#8221; Presumably this is an implicit reference to capital punishment (cf. NCV, TEV, CEV, NLT), although this is not entirely clear.</p>
<a name="144"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=44><b>sn</b> Having failed to convince the overseer, Daniel sought the favor of the warden whom the overseer had appointed to care for the young men.</p>

<a name="151"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=51><b>sn</b> The number ten is sometimes used in the OT as an ideal number of completeness. Cf. v. 20; Zech 8:23; Rev 2:10.</p>
<a name="152"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=52><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fat of flesh&#8221;; KJV, ASV &#8220;fatter in flesh&#8221;; NASB, NRSV &#8220;fatter&#8221; (although this is no longer a sign of health in Western culture).</p>

<a name="158"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=58><b>tc</b> The MT lacks the conjunction, reading the first word in the phrase as a construct (&#8220;wisdom of insight&#8221;). While this reading is not impossible, it seems better to follow Theodotion, the Syriac, the Vulgate, and the Sahidic Coptic, all of which have the conjunction.</p>
<a name="159"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=59><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;hands.&#8221;</p>
<a name="160"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=60><b>sn</b> The Persian king Cyrus&#8217; <i>first year</i> in control of Babylon was 539 <span class="smallcaps">B.C</span>. Daniel actually lived beyond the first year of Cyrus, as is clear from 10:1. The purpose of the statement in 1:21 is merely to say that Daniel&#8217;s life spanned the entire period of the neo-Babylonian empire. His life span also included the early years of the Persian control of Babylon. However, by that time his age was quite advanced; he probably died sometime in the 530&#8217;s <span class="smallcaps">B.C</span>.</p>
