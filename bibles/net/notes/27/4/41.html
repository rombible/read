<A NAME="41"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=188><b>sn</b> Beginning with <b>4:1</b>, the verse numbers through <b>4:37</b> in the English Bible differ from the verse numbers in the Aramaic text (<i>BHS</i>), with <b>4:1</b> ET = <b>3:31</b> AT, <b>4:2</b> ET = <b>3:32</b> AT, <b>4:3</b> ET = <b>3:33</b> AT, <b>4:4</b> ET = <b>4:1</b> AT, etc., through <b>4:37</b> ET = <b>4:34</b> AT. Thus Dan 3:31-33 of the Aramaic text appears as Dan 4:1-3 in the English Bible, and the corresponding verses of ch. 4 differ accordingly. In spite of the division of the Aramaic text, a good case can be made that 3:31-33 AT (= 4:1-3 ET) is actually the introduction to ch. 4.</p>
