<A NAME="444"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=231><b>sn</b> The reference to <i>heaven</i> here is a circumlocution for God. There was a tendency in Jewish contexts to avoid direct reference to God. Cf. the expression &#8220;kingdom of heaven&#8221; in the NT and such statements as &#8220;I have sinned against heaven and in your sight&#8221; (Luke 15:21).</p>
