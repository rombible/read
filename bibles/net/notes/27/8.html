<A NAME="81"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=419><b>sn</b> Dan 8:1 marks the switch from Aramaic (= 2:4b-7:28) back to Hebrew as the language in which the book is written in its present form. The remainder of the book from this point on (8:1-12:13) is in Hebrew. The bilingual nature of the book has been variously explained, but it most likely has to do with the book&#8217;s transmission history.</p>
<A NAME="82"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=420><b>sn</b> The <i>third year of King Belshazzar&#8217;s reign</i> would have been ca. 551 <sc>B.C. Daniel would have been approximately 69 years old at the time of this vision. </p>
<A NAME="83"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=421><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the beginning.&#8221; This refers to the vision described in chapter seven.</p>
<A NAME="84"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=422><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="85"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=423><b>sn</b> <i>Susa</i> (Heb. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shushan</font>), located some 230 miles (380 km) east of Babylon, was a winter residence for Persian kings during the Achaemenid period. The language of v. 2 seems to suggest that Daniel may not have been physically present at Susa, but only saw himself there in the vision. However, the Hebrew is difficult, and some have concluded that the first four words of v. 2 in the MT are a later addition (cf. Theodotion).</p>
<A NAME="86"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=424><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font></i> (<font face="Scholar">birah</font>, &#8220;castle, palace&#8221;) usually refers to a fortified structure within a city, but here it is in apposition to the city name Susa and therefore has a broader reference to the entire city (against this view, however, see BDB 108 s.v. 2). Cf. NAB &#8220;the fortress of Susa&#8221;; TEV &#8220;the walled city of Susa.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="87"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=425><b>tn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">uval</font> = &#8220;stream, river&#8221;) is a relatively rare word in biblical Hebrew, found only here and in vv. 3 and 6. The Ulai was apparently a sizable artificial canal in Susa (cf. NASB, NIV, NCV), and not a river in the ordinary sense of that word.</p>
<A NAME="88"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=426><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lifted my eyes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="89"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=427><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and behold.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=428><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;one.&#8221; The Hebrew numerical adjective occasionally functions like an English indefinite article. See GKC 401 §125.<i>b</i>.</p>
<A NAME="811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=429><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;high&#8221; (also &#8220;higher&#8221; later in this verse).</p>
<A NAME="812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=430><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;beast&#8221; (NAB).</p>
<A NAME="813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=431><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;hand.&#8221; So also in v. 7.</p>
<A NAME="814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=432><b>tn</b> In the Hiphil the Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gadal</font>, &#8220;to make great; to magnify&#8221;) can have either a positive or a negative sense. For the former, used especially of God, see Ps 126:2, 3; Joel 2:21. In this chapter (8:4, 8, 11, 25) the word has a pejorative sense, describing the self-glorification of this king. The sense seems to be that of vainly assuming one&#8217;s own superiority through deliberate hubris.</p>
<A NAME="815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=433><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;all this&#8221; are added in the translation for stylistic reasons and for clarification.</p>
<A NAME="816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=434><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and behold, a he-goat of the goats.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=435><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;of the whole earth&#8221; (NAB, ASV, NASB, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=436><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a horn of vision&#8221; [or &#8220;conspicuousness&#8221;], i.e., &#8220;a conspicuous horn,&#8221; one easily seen.</p>
<A NAME="819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=437><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the wrath of its strength.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=438><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=439><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the ram.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=440><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;stand before him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=441><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he hurled him.&#8221; The referents of both pronouns (the male goat and the ram) have been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=442><b>sn</b> The <i>goat</i> of Daniel&#8217;s vision represents Greece; the <i>large horn</i> represents Alexander the Great. The <i>ram</i> stands for Media-Persia. Alexander&#8217;s rapid conquest of the Persians involved three battles of major significance which he won against overwhelming odds: Granicus (334 <sc>B.C.), Isus (333 <sc>B.C.), and Gaugemela (331 <sc>B.C.).</p>
<A NAME="825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=443><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;horns&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but is implied.</p>
<A NAME="826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=444><b>sn</b> The <i>four conspicuous horns</i> refer to Alexander&#8217;s successors. After his death, Alexander&#8217;s empire was divided up among four of his generals: Cassander, who took Macedonia and Greece; Lysimachus, who took Thrace and parts of Asia Minor; Seleucus, who took Syria and territory to its east; and Ptolemy, who took control of Egypt.</p>
<A NAME="827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=445><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the heavens.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shamayim</font>) may be translated &#8220;heavens&#8221; or &#8220;sky&#8221; depending on the context.</p>
<A NAME="828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=446><b>sn</b> This <i>small horn</i> is Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who controlled the Seleucid kingdom from ca. 175-164 <sc>B.C. Antiochus was extremely hostile toward the Jews and persecuted them mercilessly.</p>
<A NAME="829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=447><b>sn</b> The expression <i>the beautiful land</i> (Heb. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1462;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;</font> [<font face="Scholar">hatsÿvi</font>] = &#8220;the beauty&#8221;) is a cryptic reference to the land of Israel. Cf. 11:16, 41, where it is preceded by the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">erets</font>, &#8220;land&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=448><b>tn</b> Traditionally, &#8220;host.&#8221; The term refers to God&#8217;s heavenly angelic assembly, which he sometimes leads into battle as an army.</p>
<A NAME="831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=449><b>sn</b> In prescientific Israelite thinking the stars were associated with the angelic members of God&#8217;s heavenly assembly. See Judg 5:20; Job 38:7; Isa 40:26. In west Semitic mythology the stars were members of the high god&#8217;s divine assembly (see Isa 14:13). </p>
<A NAME="832"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=450><b>sn</b> The <i>prince of the army</i> may refer to God (cf. &#8220;whose sanctuary&#8221; later in the verse) or to the angel Michael (cf. 12:1). </p>
<A NAME="833"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=451><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;and by him,&#8221; referring to Antiochus rather than to God.</p>
<A NAME="834"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=452><b>sn</b> Here the <i>sanctuary</i> is a reference to the temple of God in Jerusalem.</p>
<A NAME="835"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=453><b>tc</b> The present translation reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;&#1468; &#1504;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">utsÿva</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah nittan</font>) for the MT <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1488; &#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿtsava</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> tinnaten</font>). The context suggests a perfect rather than an imperfect verb.</p>
<A NAME="836"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=454><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;in (the course of) rebellion.&#8221; The meaning of the phrase is difficult to determine. It could mean &#8220;due to rebellion,&#8221; referring to the failures of the Jews, but this is not likely since it is not a point made elsewhere in the book. The phrase more probably refers to the rebellion against God and the atrocities against the Jews epitomized by Antiochus.</p>
<A NAME="837"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=455><b>tc</b> Two medieval Hebrew <sc>MSS and the LXX have a passive verb here: &#8220;truth was hurled to the ground&#8221; (cf. NIV, NCV, TEV).</p>
<A NAME="838"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=456><b>sn</b> <i>Truth</i> here probably refers to the Torah. According to 1 Macc 1:56, Antiochus initiated destruction of the sacred books of the Jews.</p>
<A NAME="839"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=457><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;it acted and prospered.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="840"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=458><b>sn</b> The <i>holy one</i> referred to here is presumably an angel. Cf. 4:13[10], 23 [20].</p>
<A NAME="841"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=459><b>sn</b> The language of <i>evenings and mornings</i> is reminiscent of the creation account in Genesis 1. Since &#8220;evening and morning&#8221; is the equivalent of a day, the reference here would be to 2,300 days. However, some interpreters understand the reference to be to the evening sacrifice and the morning sacrifice, in which case the reference would be to only 1,150 days. Either way, the event that marked the commencement of this period is unclear. The event that marked the conclusion of the period is the rededication of the temple in Jerusalem following the atrocious and sacrilegious acts that Antiochus implemented. This took place on December 25, 165 <sc>B.C. The Jewish celebration of Hanukkah each year commemorates this victory.</p>
<A NAME="842"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=460><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;will be vindicated&#8221; or &#8220;will be justified.&#8221; This is the only occurrence of this verb in the Niphal in the OT. English versions interpret it as &#8220;cleansed&#8221; (KJV, ASV), &#8220;restored&#8221; (NASB, TEV, NLT), or &#8220;reconsecrated&#8221; (NIV).</p>
<A NAME="843"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=461><b>sn</b> The only angels whose names are given in the OT are <i>Gabriel</i> (Dan 8:16; 9:21; cf. Luke 1:19, 26) and <i>Michael</i> (Dan 10:13, 21; 12:1; cf. Jude 9; Rev 12:7). The name Gabriel means in Hebrew &#8220;man of God,&#8221; and Michael means &#8220;who is like God?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="844"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=462><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;on my face.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="845"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=463><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;human one.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="846"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=464><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;on my standing.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="847"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=465><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text does not actually state the referent (the vision Daniel saw in vv. 8-12; cf. also v. 13), which has been specified in the translation for clarity. Some Greek witnesses add &#8220;the vision&#8221; here.</p>
<A NAME="848"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=466><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the he-goat, the buck.&#8221; The expression is odd, and the second word may be an explanatory gloss.</p>
<A NAME="849"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=467><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Javan.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="850"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=468><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the broken one.&#8221; The word &#8220;horn&#8221; has been supplied in the translation to clarify the referent.</p>
<A NAME="851"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=469><b>tc</b> The present translation reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">happÿsha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>, &#8220;rebellious acts&#8221;) for the MT <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">happoshÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>, &#8220;rebels&#8221;). While the MT is understandable (cf. NIV, &#8220;when rebels have become completely wicked&#8221;), the filling up of transgressions is a familiar OT expression (cf. Gen 15:16) and fits this context well. Cf. the LXX, Theodotion, the Vulgate, and the Syriac.</p>
<A NAME="852"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=470><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;strong of face.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="853"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=471><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;understanding riddles.&#8221; Possible meanings include &#8220;double-dealing&#8221; (BDB 295 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font>; cf. TEV, CEV) and &#8220;with a good knowledge of intrigue&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 309 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font>; cf. NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="854"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=472><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;stand&#8221; or &#8220;stand up.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="855"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=473><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;extraordinarily he will destroy.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="856"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=474><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he will succeed and act.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="857"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=475><b>tn</b> See the corresponding Aramaic expression in 7:27. If the &#8220;holy ones&#8221; are angels, then this probably refers to the angels as protectors of God&#8217;s people. One could translate, &#8220;people belonging to (i.e., protected by) the holy ones.&#8221; If the &#8220;holy ones&#8221; are God&#8217;s people, then this is an appositional construction, &#8220;the people who are the holy ones.&#8221; One could translate simply &#8220;holy people.&#8221; For examples of a plural appositional genitive after &#8220;people,&#8221; see 11:15, 32. Because either interpretation is possible, the translation has deliberately preserved the ambiguity of the Hebrew grammar here. </p>
<A NAME="858"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=476><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term has a primary meaning of &#8220;skill, insight,&#8221; but here it has the connotation &#8220;cunning, treachery.&#8221; See BDB 968 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1461;&#1499;&#1462;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1499;&#1462;&#1500;</font>.</p>
<A NAME="859"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=477><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he will cause deceit to succeed by his hand.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="860"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=478><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;in his heart he will act arrogantly.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="861"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=479><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in peace.&#8221; The Hebrew word used here is difficult. It may refer to the <i>security</i> felt by those who did not realize the danger of imminent attack, or it may refer to the condition of being <i>unaware</i> of the impending danger. The latter idea is reflected in the present translation. See further, BDB 1017 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font>.</p>
<A NAME="862"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=480><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;with nothingness of hand.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="863"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=481><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;truth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="864"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=482><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nihyetiy</font>). Its meaning is not entirely clear. Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hayah</font>) normally has meanings such as &#8220;to be&#8221; or &#8220;become.&#8221; Here, however, it describes Daniel&#8217;s emotional and physical response to the enigmatic vision that he has seen. It is parallel to the following verb, which refers to illness, and seems to refer to a state of utter exhaustion due to the amazing things that Daniel has just seen. The LXX lacks the word. On the meaning of the word see further, BDB 227-28 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;</font> Niph.2; <i>DCH</i> 2:540 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;</font> I Ni.3.</p>
