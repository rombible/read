<A NAME="86"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=424><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font></i> (<font face="Scholar">birah</font>, &#8220;castle, palace&#8221;) usually refers to a fortified structure within a city, but here it is in apposition to the city name Susa and therefore has a broader reference to the entire city (against this view, however, see BDB 108 s.v. 2). Cf. NAB &#8220;the fortress of Susa&#8221;; TEV &#8220;the walled city of Susa.&#8221;</p>
