<A NAME="847"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=465><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text does not actually state the referent (the vision Daniel saw in vv. 8-12; cf. also v. 13), which has been specified in the translation for clarity. Some Greek witnesses add &#8220;the vision&#8221; here.</p>
