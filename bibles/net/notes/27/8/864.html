<A NAME="864"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=482><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nihyetiy</font>). Its meaning is not entirely clear. Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hayah</font>) normally has meanings such as &#8220;to be&#8221; or &#8220;become.&#8221; Here, however, it describes Daniel&#8217;s emotional and physical response to the enigmatic vision that he has seen. It is parallel to the following verb, which refers to illness, and seems to refer to a state of utter exhaustion due to the amazing things that Daniel has just seen. The LXX lacks the word. On the meaning of the word see further, BDB 227-28 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;</font> Niph.2; <i>DCH</i> 2:540 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;</font> I Ni.3.</p>
