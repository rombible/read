<A NAME="857"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=475><b>tn</b> See the corresponding Aramaic expression in 7:27. If the &#8220;holy ones&#8221; are angels, then this probably refers to the angels as protectors of God&#8217;s people. One could translate, &#8220;people belonging to (i.e., protected by) the holy ones.&#8221; If the &#8220;holy ones&#8221; are God&#8217;s people, then this is an appositional construction, &#8220;the people who are the holy ones.&#8221; One could translate simply &#8220;holy people.&#8221; For examples of a plural appositional genitive after &#8220;people,&#8221; see 11:15, 32. Because either interpretation is possible, the translation has deliberately preserved the ambiguity of the Hebrew grammar here. </p>
