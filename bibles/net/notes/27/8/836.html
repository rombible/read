<A NAME="836"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=454><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;in (the course of) rebellion.&#8221; The meaning of the phrase is difficult to determine. It could mean &#8220;due to rebellion,&#8221; referring to the failures of the Jews, but this is not likely since it is not a point made elsewhere in the book. The phrase more probably refers to the rebellion against God and the atrocities against the Jews epitomized by Antiochus.</p>
