<A NAME="81"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=419><b>sn</b> Dan 8:1 marks the switch from Aramaic (= 2:4b-7:28) back to Hebrew as the language in which the book is written in its present form. The remainder of the book from this point on (8:1-12:13) is in Hebrew. The bilingual nature of the book has been variously explained, but it most likely has to do with the book&#8217;s transmission history.</p>
