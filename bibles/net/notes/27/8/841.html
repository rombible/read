<A NAME="841"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=459><b>sn</b> The language of <i>evenings and mornings</i> is reminiscent of the creation account in Genesis 1. Since &#8220;evening and morning&#8221; is the equivalent of a day, the reference here would be to 2,300 days. However, some interpreters understand the reference to be to the evening sacrifice and the morning sacrifice, in which case the reference would be to only 1,150 days. Either way, the event that marked the commencement of this period is unclear. The event that marked the conclusion of the period is the rededication of the temple in Jerusalem following the atrocious and sacrilegious acts that Antiochus implemented. This took place on December 25, 165 <sc>B.C. The Jewish celebration of Hanukkah each year commemorates this victory.</p>
