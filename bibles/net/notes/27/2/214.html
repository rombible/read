<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=74><b>tn</b> It seems clear from what follows that Nebuchadnezzar clearly recalls the content of the dream, although obviously he does not know what to make of it. By not divulging the dream itself to the would-be interpreters, he intends to find out whether they are simply leading him on. If they can tell him the dream&#8217;s content, which he is able to verify, he then can have confidence in their interpretation, which is what eludes him. The translation &#8220;the matter is gone from me&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV), suggesting that the king had simply forgotten the dream, is incorrect. The Aramaic word used here (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1494;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">azda</font>&#8217;) is probably of Persian origin; it occurs in the OT only here and in v. 8. There are two main possibilities for the meaning of the word: &#8220;the matter is promulgated by me&#8221; (see KBL 1048 s.v.) and therefore &#8220;publicly known&#8221; (cf. NRSV; F. Rosenthal, <i>Grammar</i>, 62-63, §189), or &#8220;the matter is irrevocable&#8221; (cf. NAB, NIV, TEV, CEV, NLT; <i>HALOT</i> 1808 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1494;&#1491;</font>; cf. also BDB 1079 s.v.). The present translation reflects this latter option. See further E. Vogt, <i>Lexicon linguae aramaicae</i>, 3.</p>
