<A NAME="22"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=62><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;dreamed dreams.&#8221; The plural is used here and in v. 2, but the singular in v. 3. The plural &#8220;dreams&#8221; has been variously explained. Some interpreters take the plural as denoting an indefinite singular (so GKC 400 §124.<i>o</i>). But it may be that it is describing a stream of related dreams, or a dream state. In the latter case, one might translate: &#8220;Nebuchadnezzar was in a trance.&#8221; See further, J. A. Montgomery, <i>Daniel</i> (ICC), 142.</p>
