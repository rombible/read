<A NAME="31"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=134><b>sn</b> The LXX introduces this chapter with the following chronological note: &#8220;in the eighteenth year of.&#8221; Such a date would place these events at about the time of the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 <sc>B.C. (cf. 2 Kgs 25:8). However, there seems to be no real basis for associating the events of Daniel 3 with this date.</p>
<A NAME="32"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=135><b>sn</b> There is no need to think of Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s image as being solid gold. No doubt the sense is that it was overlaid with gold (cf. Isa 40:19; Jer 10:3-4), with the result that it presented a dazzling self-compliment to the greatness of Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s achievements.</p>
<A NAME="33"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=136><b>sn</b> According to a number of patristic authors, the image represented a deification of Nebuchadnezzar himself. This is not clear from the biblical text, however.</p>
<A NAME="34"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=137><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;sixty cubits.&#8221; Assuming a length of 18 inches for the standard cubit, the image would be 90 feet (27.4 m) high.</p>
<A NAME="35"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=138><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;six cubits.&#8221; Assuming a length of 18 inches for the standard cubit, the image would be 9 feet (2.74 m) wide.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The dimensions of the image (ninety feet high and nine feet wide) imply that it did not possess normal human proportions, unless a base for the image is included in the height dimension. The ancient world knew of other tall statues. For example, the Colossus of Rhodes &#8211; the huge statue of Helios which stood (ca. 280-224 <sc>B.C.) at the entrance to the harbor at Rhodes and was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world &#8211; was said to be seventy cubits (105 ft or 32 m) in height, which would make it even taller than Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s image.</p>
<A NAME="36"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=139><b>sn</b> The specific duties of the seven types of officials listed here (cf. vv. 3, 27) are unclear. The Aramaic words that are used are transliterations of Akkadian or Persian technical terms whose exact meanings are uncertain. The translations given here follow suggestions set forth in BDB.</p>
<A NAME="37"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=140><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;Nebuchadnezzar the king.&#8221; The proper name and title have been replaced by the relative pronoun (&#8220;he&#8221;) in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="38"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=141><b>tc</b> The LXX and Theodotion lack the words &#8220;that Nebuchadnezzar had erected.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="39"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=142><b>tn</b> According to BDB 1097 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1494;</font> the Aramaic word used here is a Greek loanword, but other scholars have argued instead for a Persian derivation (<i>HALOT</i> 1902 s.v. *<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1494;</font>).</p>
<A NAME="310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=143><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;in strength.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=144><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;they are saying.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=145><b>sn</b> The word <i>zither</i> (Aramaic <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1505;</font> [<font face="Scholar">qitaros</font>]), and the words for <i>harp</i> (Aramaic <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1505;&#1463;&#1504;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> [<font face="Scholar">pÿsanterin</font>]) and <i>pipes</i> (Aramaic <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1465;&#1504;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">sumponÿyah</font>]), are of Greek derivation. Though much has been made of this in terms of suggesting a date in the Hellenistic period for the writing of the book, it is not surprising that a few Greek cultural terms, all of them the names of musical instruments, should appear in this book. As a number of scholars have pointed out, the bigger surprise (if, in fact, the book is to be dated to the Hellenistic period) may be that there are so <i>few</i> Greek loanwords in Daniel. </p>
<A NAME="313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=146><b>tn</b> The imperfect Aramaic verbs have here an injunctive nuance.</p>
<A NAME="314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=147><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;in that hour.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=148><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;all the peoples.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=149><b>tc</b> Though not in the Aramaic text of <i>BHS</i>, this word appears in many medieval Hebrew <sc>MSS, some LXX <sc>MSS, and Vulgate. Cf. vv. 5, 10, 15.</p>
<A NAME="317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=150><b>tc</b> This expression is absent in Theodotion.</p>
<A NAME="318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=151><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;men.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=152><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;ate the pieces of.&#8221; This is a rather vivid idiom for slander.</p>
<A NAME="320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=153><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;answered and said,&#8221; a common Aramaic idiom that occurs repeatedly in this chapter.</p>
<A NAME="321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=154><b>sn</b> <i>O king, live forever!</i> is a comment of typical court courtesy that is not necessarily indicative of the real sentiments of the speaker. Ancient oriental court protocol could sometimes require a certain amount of hypocrisy.</p>
<A NAME="322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=155><b>sn</b> Daniel&#8217;s absence from this scene has sparked the imagination of commentators, some of whom have suggested that perhaps he was unable to attend the dedication due to sickness or due to being away on business. Hippolytus supposed that Daniel may have been watching from a distance.</p>
<A NAME="323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=156><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;in anger and wrath&#8221;; NASB &#8220;in rage and anger.&#8221; The expression is a hendiadys.</p>
<A NAME="324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=157><b>tn</b> The Aramaic infinitive is active.</p>
<A NAME="325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=158><b>tn</b> <i>Aram </i>&#8220;these men.&#8221; The pronoun is used in the translation to avoid undue repetition.</p>
<A NAME="326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=159><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;hand.&#8221; So also in v. 17.</p>
<A NAME="327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=160><b>tc</b> In the MT this word is understood to begin the following address (&#8220;answered and said to the king, &#8216;O Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;&#8221;). However, it seems unlikely that Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s subordinates would address the king in such a familiar way, particularly in light of the danger that they now found themselves in. The present translation implies moving the <i>atnach</i> from &#8220;king&#8221; to &#8220;Nebuchadnezzar.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=161><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;to return a word to you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=162><b>tc</b> The ancient versions typically avoid the conditional element of v. 17.</p>
<A NAME="330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=163><b>tn</b> The Aramaic expression used here is very difficult to interpret. The question concerns the meaning and syntax of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1463;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">itay</font>, &#8220;is&#8221; or &#8220;exist&#8221;). There are several possibilities. (1) Some interpreters take this word closely with the participle later in the verse <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1499;&#1460;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yakhil</font>, &#8220;able&#8221;), understanding the two words to form a periphrastic construction (&#8220;if our God is&#8230;able&#8221;; cf. H. Bauer and P. Leander, <i>Grammatik des Biblisch-Aramäischen</i>, 365, §111b). But the separation of the two elements from one another is not an argument in favor of this understanding. (2) Other interpreters take the first part of v. 17 to mean &#8220;If it is so, then our God will deliver us&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV, RSV, NASB). However, the normal sense of <i>&#8217;</i><font face="Scholar">itay</font><i> </i>is existence; on this point see F. Rosenthal, <i>Grammar</i>, 45, §95. The present translation maintains the sense of existence for the verb (&#8220;If our God&#8230;exists&#8221;), even though the statement is admittedly difficult to understand in this light. The statement may be an implicit reference back to Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s comment in v. 15, which denies the existence of a god capable of delivering from the king&#8217;s power. </p>
<A NAME="331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=164><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;the appearance of his face was altered&#8221;; cf. NLT &#8220;his face became distorted with rage&#8221;; NAB &#8220;[his] face became livid with utter rage.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=165><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;he answered and said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=166><b>tn</b> This is sometimes taken as a comparative: &#8220;[some of the] strongest.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=167><b>sn</b> There is a great deal of uncertainty with regard to the specific nature of these items of clothing.</p>
<A NAME="335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=168><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;into the midst of the furnace.&#8221; For stylistic reasons the words &#8220;the midst of&#8221; have been left untranslated.</p>
<A NAME="336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=169><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;caused to go up.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=170><b>tn</b> The Aramaic verb is active.</p>
<A NAME="338"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=171><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;the flame of the fire&#8221; (so KJV, ASV, NASB); NRSV &#8220;the raging flames.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=172><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;into the midst of the furnace.&#8221; For stylistic reasons the words &#8220;the midst of&#8221; have been left untranslated.</p>
<A NAME="340"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=173><b>sn</b> The deuterocanonical writings known as The Prayer of Azariah and The Song of the Three present at this point a confession and petition for God&#8217;s forgiveness and a celebration of God&#8217;s grace for the three Jewish youths in the fiery furnace. Though not found in the Hebrew/Aramaic text of Daniel, these compositions do appear in the ancient Greek versions. </p>
<A NAME="341"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=174><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;we threw&#8230;bound.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="342"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=175><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;into the midst of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="343"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=176><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>like that of a god</i> is in Aramaic &#8220;like that of a son of the gods.&#8221; Many patristic writers understood this phrase in a christological sense (i.e., &#8220;the Son of God&#8221;). But it should be remembered that these are words spoken by a pagan who is seeking to explain things from his own polytheistic frame of reference; for him the phrase &#8220;like a son of the gods&#8221; is equivalent to &#8220;like a divine being.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="344"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=177><b>tn</b> <i>Aram</i> &#8220;answered and said.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="349"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=182><b>sn</b> The king identifies the &#8220;son of the gods&#8221; (v. 25) as an angel. Comparable Hebrew expressions are used elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible for the members of God&#8217;s angelic assembly (see Gen 6:2, 4; Job 1:6; 2:1; 38:7; Pss 29:1; 89:6). An angel later comes to rescue Daniel from the lions (Dan 6:22).</p>
