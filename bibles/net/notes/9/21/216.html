<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=642><b>tn</b> The Hebrew expression here refers to a particular, but unnamed, place. It occurs in the OT only here, in 2 Kgs 6:8, and in Ruth 4:1, where Boaz uses it to refer to Naomi&#8217;s unnamed kinsman-redeemer. A contracted form of the expression appears in Dan 8:13. </p>
