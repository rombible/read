<A NAME="1543"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=432><b>sn</b> This observation marks the preceding statement (v. 28) as an unconditional, unalterable decree. When God makes such a decree he will not alter it or change his mind. This does not mean that God never deviates from his stated intentions or changes his mind. On the contrary, several passages describe him as changing his mind. In fact, his willingness to do so is one of his fundamental divine attributes (see Joel 2:13; Jonah 4:2). For a fuller discussion see R. B. Chisholm, Jr., &#8220;Does God Change His Mind?&#8221; <i>BSac</i> 152 (1995): 387-99.</p>
