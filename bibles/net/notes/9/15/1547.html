<A NAME="1547"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=436><b>tc</b> The text is difficult here. With the LXX, two Old Latin <sc>mss, and the Syriac Peshitta it is probably preferable to delete <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sar</font>, &#8220;is past&#8221;) of the MT; it looks suspiciously like a dittograph of the following word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mar</font>, &#8220;bitter&#8221;). This further affects the interpretation of Agag&#8217;s comment. In the MT he comes to Samuel confidently assured that the danger is over (cf. KJV, NASB, NIV &#8220;Surely the bitterness of death is past,&#8221; along with NLT, CEV). However, it seems more likely that Agag realized that his fortunes had suddenly taken a turn for the worse and that the clemency he had enjoyed from Saul would not be his lot from Samuel. The present translation thus understands Agag to approach not confidently but in the stark realization that his death is imminent (&#8220;Surely death is bitter!&#8221;). Cf. NAB &#8220;So it is bitter death!&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;Surely this is the bitterness of death&#8221;; TEV &#8220;What a bitter thing it is to die!&#8221;</p>
