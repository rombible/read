<a name="129"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=29><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;because from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> I asked him.&#8221; The name &#8220;Samuel&#8221; sounds like the Hebrew verb translated &#8220;asked.&#8221; The explanation of the meaning of the name &#8220;Samuel&#8221; that is provided in v. 20 is not a strict etymology. It seems to suggest that the first part of the name is derived from the Hebrew root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sh</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">l</font>, &#8220;to ask&#8221;), but the consonants do not support this. Nor is it likely that the name comes from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shm</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to hear&#8221;), for the same reason. It more probably derives from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shem</font>, &#8220;name&#8221;), so that &#8220;Samuel&#8221; means &#8220;name of God.&#8221; Verse 20 therefore does not set forth a linguistic explanation of the meaning of the name, but rather draws a parallel between similar sounds. This figure of speech is known as paronomasia.</p>
