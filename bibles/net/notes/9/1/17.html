<a name="17"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=7><b>tn</b> The MT has a masculine form of the verb here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aseh</font>, &#8220;he used to do&#8221;); the subject in that case would presumably be Elkanah. But this leads to an abrupt change of subject in the following part of the verse, where the subject is the rival wife who caused Hannah anxiety. In light of v. 6 one expects the statement of v. 7 to refer to the ongoing actions of the rival wife: &#8220;she used to behave in this way year after year.&#8221; Some scholars have proposed retaining the masculine form but changing the vocalization of the verb so as to read a Niphal rather than a Qal (i.e., <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1461;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ye</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aseh</font>, &#8220;so it used to be done&#8221;). But the problem here is lack of precedent for such a use of the Niphal of this verb. It seems best in light of the context to understand the reference to be to Hannah&#8217;s rival Peninnah and to read here, with the Syriac Peshitta, a feminine form of the verb (&#8220;she used to do&#8221;). In the translation the referent (Peninnah) has been specified for clarity.</p>
