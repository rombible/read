<a name="135"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=35><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the boy was a boy.&#8221; If the MT is correct the meaning apparently is that the boy was quite young at the time of these events. On the other hand, some scholars have suspected a textual problem, emending the text to read either &#8220;and the boy was with them&#8221; (so LXX) or &#8220;and the boy was with her&#8221; (a conjectural emendation). In spite of the difficulty it seems best to stay with the MT here.</p>
