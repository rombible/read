<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3><b>tn</b> The exact sense of the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">appayim</font>, &#8220;two faces&#8221;) is not certain here. It is most likely used with the preceding expression (&#8220;one portion of two faces&#8221;) to mean a portion double than normally received. Although evidence for this use of the word derives primarily from Aramaic rather than from Hebrew usage, it provides an understanding that fits the context here better than other suggestions for the word do. The meaning &#8220;double&#8221; is therefore adopted in the present translation. Other possibilities for the meaning of the word include the following: &#8220;heavily&#8221; (cf. Vulg., <font face="Scholar">tristis</font>) and &#8220;worthy&#8221; or &#8220;choice&#8221; (cf. KJV and Targum). Some scholars have followed the LXX here, emending the word to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1505;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">efes</font>) and translating it as &#8220;but&#8221; or &#8220;however.&#8221; This seems unnecessary. The translators of the LXX may simply have been struggling to make sense of the word rather than following a Hebrew text that was different from the MT here.</p>
