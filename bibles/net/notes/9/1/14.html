<a name="14"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for Hannah he loved.&#8221; Repetition of the proper name would seem redundant in contemporary English, so the pronoun (&#8220;her&#8221;) has been used here for clarity. The translation also adds the adverb &#8220;especially&#8221; to clarify the meaning of the text. Without this addition one might get the impression that only Hannah, not Peninnah, was loved by her husband. But the point of the text is that Hannah was his favorite.</p>
