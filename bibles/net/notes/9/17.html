<A NAME="171"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=473><b>tc</b> The content of 1 Sam 17&#8211;18, which includes the David and Goliath story, differs considerably in the LXX as compared to the MT, suggesting that this story circulated in ancient times in more than one form. The LXX for chs. 17&#8211;18 is much shorter than the MT, lacking almost half of the material (39 of a total of 88 verses). Many scholars (e.g., McCarter, Klein) think that the shorter text of the LXX is preferable to the MT, which in their view has been expanded by incorporation of later material. Other scholars (e.g., Wellhausen, Driver) conclude that the shorter Greek text (or the Hebrew text that underlies it) reflects an attempt to harmonize certain alleged inconsistencies that appear in the longer version of the story. Given the translation characteristics of the LXX elsewhere in this section, it does not seem likely that these differences are due to deliberate omission of these verses on the part of the translator. It seems more likely that the Greek translator has faithfully rendered here a Hebrew text that itself was much shorter than the MT in these chapters. Whether or not the shorter text represented by the LXX is to be preferred over the MT in 1 Sam 17&#8211;18 is a matter over which textual scholars are divided. For a helpful discussion of the major textual issues in this unit see D. Barthélemy, D. W. Gooding, J. Lust, and E. Tov, <i>The Story of David and Goliath</i> (OBO). Overall it seems preferable to stay with the MT, at least for the most part. However, the major textual differences between the LXX and the MT will be mentioned in the notes that accompany the translation so that the reader may be alert to the major problem passages.</p>

<A NAME="176"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=478><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the man of the space between the two [armies].&#8221; See v. 23.</p>
<A NAME="177"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=479><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his height was six cubits and a span&#8221; (cf. KJV, NASB, NRSV). A cubit was approximately eighteen inches, a span nine inches. So, according to the Hebrew tradition, Goliath was about nine feet, nine inches tall (cf. NIV, CEV, NLT &#8220;over nine feet&#8221;; NCV &#8220;nine feet, four inches&#8221;; TEV &#8220;nearly 3 metres&#8221;). However, some Greek witnesses, Josephus, and a manuscript of 1 Samuel from Qumran read &#8220;four cubits and a span&#8221; here, that is, about six feet, nine inches (cf. NAB &#8220;six and a half feet&#8221;). This seems more reasonable; it is likely that Goliath&#8217;s height was exaggerated as the story was retold. See P. K. McCarter, <i>I Samuel </i>(AB), 286, 291.</p>
<A NAME="178"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=480><b>sn</b> Although the exact weight of Goliath&#8217;s defensive <i>body armor</i> is difficult to estimate in terms of modern equivalency, it was obviously quite heavy. Driver, following Kennedy, suggests a modern equivalent of about 220 pounds (100 kg); see S. R. Driver, <i>Notes on the Hebrew Text and the Topography of the Books of Samuel</i>, 139. Klein, taking the shekel to be equal to .403 ounces, arrives at a somewhat smaller weight of about 126 pounds (57 kg); see R. W. Klein, <i>1 Samuel</i> (WBC), 175. But by any estimate it is clear that Goliath presented himself as a formidable foe indeed.</p>
<A NAME="179"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=481><b>sn</b> Or &#8220;greaves.&#8221; These were coverings (probably lined for comfort) that extended from about the knee to the ankle, affording protection for the shins of a warrior.</p>

<A NAME="1711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=483><b>sn</b> That is, about fifteen or sixteen pounds.</p>

<A NAME="1714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=486><b>tc</b> The translation follows the ancient versions in reading &#8220;choose,&#8221; (from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1495;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bkhr</font>), rather than the MT. The verb in MT (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1512;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">brh</font>) elsewhere means &#8220;to eat food&#8221;; the sense of &#8220;to choose,&#8221; required here by the context, is not attested for this root. The MT apparently reflects an early scribal error.</p>
<A NAME="1715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=487><b>tn</b> Following the imperative, the prefixed verbal form (either an imperfect or jussive) with the prefixed conjunction indicates purpose/result here.</p>

NIV &#8220;bring back some assurance&#8221;; NCV &#8220;some proof to show me they are all right&#8221;; NLT &#8220;bring me back a letter from them.&#8221;</p>
