<A NAME="612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=175><b>tc</b> The number 50,070 is surprisingly large, although it finds almost unanimous textual support in the MT and in the ancient versions. Only a few medieval Hebrew <sc>mss lack &#8220;50,000,&#8221; reading simply &#8220;70&#8221; instead. However, there does not seem to be sufficient external evidence to warrant reading 70 rather than 50,070, although that is done by a number of recent translations (e.g., NAB, NIV, NRSV, NLT). The present translation (reluctantly) follows the MT and the ancient versions here.</p>
