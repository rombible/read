<A NAME="36"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=107><b>tc</b> The MT has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497; &#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿhiggadti lo</font>). The verb is Hiphil perfect 1st person common singular, and apparently the conjunction should be understood as <font face="Scholar">vav</font> consecutive (&#8220;I will say to him&#8221;). But the future reference makes more sense if Samuel is the subject. This would require dropping the final <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yod)</font> and reading the 2nd person masculine singular <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿhiggadta)</font>. Although there is no external evidence to support it, this reading has been adopted in the present translation. The alternative is to understand the MT to mean &#8220;I <i>said </i>to him,&#8221; but for this we would expect the preterite with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> consecutive.</p>
