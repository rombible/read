<A NAME="38"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=109><b>tc</b> The translation follows the LXX <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#957;</font><font face="Scholar"> </font>(<font face="Greektl">qeon</font>, &#8220;God&#8221;) rather than the MT <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lahem</font>, &#8220;to them&#8221;). The MT seems to mean &#8220;they were bringing a curse on themselves&#8221; (cf. ASV, NASB). But this meaning is problematic in part because the verb <font face="Scholar">qll</font> means &#8220;to curse,&#8221; not &#8220;to bring a curse on,&#8221; and in part because it takes an accusative object rather than the equivalent of a dative. This is one of the so-called <i>tiqqune sopherim</i>, or &#8220;emendations of the scribes.&#8221; Why would the ancient copyists alter the original statement about Eli&#8217;s sons cursing <i>God</i> to the less objectionable statement that they brought a curse on <i>themselves</i>? Some argue that the scribes were concerned that such a direct and blasphemous affront against God could occur without an immediate response of judgment from God. Therefore they changed the text by deleting two letters <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">alef</font> and <font face="Scholar">yod</font>) from the word for &#8220;God,&#8221; with the result that the text then read &#8220;to them.&#8221; If this ancient scribal claim is accepted as accurate, it implies that the MT here is secondary. The present translation follows the LXX (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#8166;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#952;&#949;&#972;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">kakologounte&quot; qeon</font>) and a few <sc>mss of the Old Latin in reading &#8220;God&#8221; rather than the MT &#8220;to them.&#8221; Cf. also NAB, NRSV, NLT.</p>
