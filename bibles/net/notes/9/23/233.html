<A NAME="233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=671><b>tn</b> The MT reading (&#8220;God has alienated him into my hand&#8221;) in v. 7 is a difficult and uncommon idiom. The use of this verb in Jer 19:4 is somewhat parallel, but not entirely so. Many scholars have therefore suspected a textual problem here, emending the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<i>nikkar</i>, &#8220;alienated&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sikkar</font>, &#8220;he has shut up [i.e., delivered]&#8221;). This is the idea reflected in the translations of the Syriac Peshitta and Vulgate, although it is not entirely clear whether they are reading something different from the MT or are simply paraphrasing what for them too may have been a difficult text. The LXX has &#8220;God has sold him into my hands,&#8221; apparently reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1499;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">makar</font>, &#8220;sold&#8221;) for MT&#8217;s <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;</font>. The present translation is a rather free interpretation.</p>
