<A NAME="131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=303><b>tc</b> The MT does not have &#8220;thirty.&#8221; A number appears to have dropped out of the Hebrew text here, since as it stands the MT (literally, &#8220;a son of a year&#8221;) must mean that Saul was only one year old when he began to reign! The KJV, attempting to resolve this, reads &#8220;Saul reigned one year,&#8221; but that is not the normal meaning of the Hebrew text represented by the MT. Although most LXX <sc>mss lack the entire verse, some Greek <sc>mss have &#8220;thirty years&#8221; here (while others have &#8220;one year&#8221; like the MT). The Syriac Peshitta has Saul&#8217;s age as twenty-one. But this seems impossible to harmonize with the implied age of Saul&#8217;s son Jonathan in the following verse. Taking into account the fact that in v. 2 Jonathan was old enough to be a military leader, some scholars prefer to supply in v. 1 the number forty (cf. ASV, NASB). The present translation (&#8220;thirty&#8221;) is a possible but admittedly uncertain proposal based on a few Greek <sc>mss and followed by a number of English versions (e.g., NIV, NCV, NLT). Other English versions simply supply ellipsis marks for the missing number (e.g., NAB, NRSV).</p>
