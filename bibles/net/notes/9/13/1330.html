<A NAME="1330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=332><b>tn</b> This word, which appears only here in the OT, probably refers to a stone weight. Stones marked <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pim</font>) have been found in excavations of Palestinian sites. The average weight of such stones is 0.268 ounces, which is equivalent to about two-thirds of a shekel. This probably refers to the price charged by the Philistines for the services listed. See P. K. McCarter, <i>I Samuel </i>(AB), 238; <i>DNWSI</i> 2:910; and G. I. Davies, <i>Ancient Hebrew Inscriptions</i>, 259.</p>
