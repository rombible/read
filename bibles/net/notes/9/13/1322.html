<A NAME="1322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=324><b>tn</b> This verb form, as well as the one that follows (&#8220;appointed&#8221;), indicates completed action from the standpoint of the speaker. This does not necessarily mean that the Lord had already conducted his search and made his choice, however. The forms may be used for rhetorical effect to emphasize the certainty of the action. The divine search for a new king is as good as done, emphasizing that the days of Saul&#8217;s dynasty are numbered. </p>
