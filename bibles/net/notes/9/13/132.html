<A NAME="132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=304><b>tc</b> The MT has &#8220;two years&#8221; here. If this number is to be accepted as correct, the meaning apparently would be that after a lapse of two years at the beginning of Saul&#8217;s reign, he then went about the task of consolidating an army as described in what follows (cf. KJV, ASV, CEV). But if the statement in v. 1 is intended to be a comprehensive report on the length of Saul&#8217;s reign, the number is too small. According to Acts 13:21 Saul reigned for forty years. Some English versions (e.g., NIV, NCV, NLT), taking this forty to be a round number, add it to the &#8220;two years&#8221; of the MT and translate the number in 2 Sam 13:1 as &#8220;forty-two years.&#8221; While this is an acceptable option, the present translation instead replaces the MT&#8217;s &#8220;two&#8221; with the figure &#8220;forty.&#8221; Admittedly the textual evidence for this decision is weak, but the same can be said of any attempt to restore sense to this difficult text (note the ellipsis marks at this point in NAB, NRSV). The Syriac Peshitta lacks this part of v. 1.</p>
