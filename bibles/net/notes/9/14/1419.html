<A NAME="1419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=352><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the ark of God.&#8221; It seems unlikely that Saul would call for the ark, which was several miles away in Kiriath-jearim (see 1 Sam 7:2). The LXX and an Old Latin <sc>ms have &#8220;ephod&#8221; here, a reading which harmonizes better with v. 3 and fits better with the verb &#8220;bring near&#8221; (see 1 Sam 23:9; 30:7) and with the expression &#8220;withdraw your hand&#8221; in v.19. This reading is followed in the present translation (cf. NAB, TEV, NLT).</p>
