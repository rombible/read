The present translation follows the LXX (as do several English versions, cf. NAB, NRSV, TEV). See P. K. McCarter, <i>I Samuel</i> (AB), 247-48, and R. W. Klein, <i>1 Samuel</i> (WBC), 132.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The <i>Urim</i> and <i>Thummim</i> were used for lot casting in ancient Israel. Their exact identity is uncertain; they may have been specially marked stones drawn from a bag. See Exod 28:30; Lev 8:8, and Deut 33:8, as well as the discussion in R. W. Klein, <i>1 Samuel</i> (WBC), 140. </p>
