<A NAME="1414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=347><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and it was by the fear of God.&#8221; The translation understands this to mean that God was the source or cause of the fear experienced by the Philistines. This seems to be the most straightforward reading of the sentence. It is possible, however, that the word &#8220;God&#8221; functions here simply to intensify the accompanying word &#8220;fear,&#8221; in which one might translate &#8220;a very great fear&#8221; (cf. NAB, NRSV). It is clear that on some occasions that the divine name carries such a superlative nuance. For examples see Joüon 2:525 §141.n.</p>
