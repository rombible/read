<A NAME="810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=206><b>tc</b> The numbers of v. 12 are confused in the Greek and Syriac versions. For &#8220;fifties&#8221; the LXX has &#8220;hundreds.&#8221; The Syriac Peshitta has &#8220;heads of thousands and heads of hundreds and heads of fifties and heads of tens,&#8221; perhaps reflecting influence from Deut 1:15.</p>
