<A NAME="1025"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=259><b>tc</b> In place of the MT (&#8220;and it was like one being silent&#8221;) the LXX has &#8220;after about a month,&#8221; taking the expression with the first part of the following chapter rather than with 10:27. Some Hebrew support for this reading appears in the corrected hand of a Qumran <sc>ms of Samuel, which has here &#8220;about a month.&#8221; However, it seems best to stay with the MT here even though it is difficult.</p>
