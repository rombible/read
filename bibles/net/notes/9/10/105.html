<A NAME="105"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=239><b>tc</b> The MT reads simply &#8220;Is it not that the <sc>Lord has anointed you over his inheritance for a leader?&#8221; The translation follows the LXX. The MT apparently suffers from parablepsis, whereby a scribe&#8217;s eye jumped from the first occurrence of the expression &#8220;the <sc>Lord has anointed you&#8221; to the second occurrence of this expression at the end of v. 1. This mistake caused the accidental omission of the intervening material in the LXX, which appears to preserve the original Hebrew text here.</p>
