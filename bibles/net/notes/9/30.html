<A NAME="309"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=839><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;stood.&#8221; So also in v. 10.</p>
<A NAME="3010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=840><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his spirit returned to him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3011"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=841><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text adds &#8220;with fire.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3012"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=842><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;him&#8221;; the referent (David) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3013"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=843><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;because of all the large plunder.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3014"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=844><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;who rode on camels and fled.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3015"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=845><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;David.&#8221; The pronoun (&#8220;he&#8221;) has been substituted for the proper name in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="3016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=846><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;there was nothing missing to them, from the small even unto the great, and unto sons and daughters, and from loot even unto all which they had taken for themselves.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3017"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=847><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;David.&#8221; The pronoun (&#8220;him&#8221;) has been substituted for the proper name in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="3018"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=848><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;with me.&#8221; The singular is used rather than the plural because the group is being treated as a singular entity, in keeping with Hebrew idiom. It is not necessary to read &#8220;with us,&#8221; rather than the MT &#8220;with me,&#8221; although the plural can be found here in a few medieval Hebrew <sc>mss. See also the LXX, Syriac Peshitta, and Vulgate, although these versions may simply reflect an understanding of the idiom as found in the MT rather than a different textual reading.</p>
<A NAME="3019"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=849><b>tc</b> This clause is difficult in the MT. The present translation accepts the text as found in the MT and understands this clause to be elliptical, with an understood verb such as &#8220;look&#8221; or &#8220;consider.&#8221; On the other hand, the LXX seems to reflect a slightly different Hebrew text, reading &#8220;after&#8221; where the MT has &#8220;my brothers.&#8221; The Greek translation yields the following translation: &#8220;You should not do this after the <sc>Lord has delivered us.&#8221; Although the Greek reading should be taken seriously, it seems better to follow the MT here.</p>
<A NAME="3020"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=850><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a statute and a judgment.&#8221; The expression is a hendiadys.</p>
<A NAME="3021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=851><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;blessing.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3022"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=852><b>tn</b> This sentence is not in the Hebrew text. It is supplied in the translation for the sake of clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=853><b>map</b> For location see Map4-G4; Map5-C1; Map6-E3; Map7-D1; Map8-G3.</p>
