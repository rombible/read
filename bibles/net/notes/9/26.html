<A NAME="263"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=754><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and David sent scouts and he knew that Saul had certainly come.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="264"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=755><b>tn</b> Here &#8220;the spear&#8221; almost certainly refers to Saul&#8217;s own spear, which according to the previous verse was stuck into the ground beside him as he slept. This is reflected in a number of English versions: TEV, CEV &#8220;his own spear&#8221;; NLT &#8220;that spear.&#8221; Cf. NIV, NCV &#8220;my spear,&#8221; in which case Abishai refers to his own spear rather than Saul&#8217;s, but this is unlikely since (1) Abishai would probably not have carried a spear along since such a weapon would be unwieldy when sneaking into the enemy camp; and (2) this would not explain the mention of Saul&#8217;s own spear stuck in the ground beside him in the previous verse.</p>
<A NAME="265"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=756><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;let me strike him with the spear and into the ground one time.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="269"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=760><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;What in my hand [is] evil?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=761><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;may he smell.&#8221; The implication is that Saul should seek to appease God, for such divine instigation to evil would a sign of God&#8217;s disfavor. For a fuller discussion of this passage see R. B. Chisholm, Jr., &#8220;Does God Deceive?&#8221; <i>BSac</i> 155 (1998): 19-21.</p>
