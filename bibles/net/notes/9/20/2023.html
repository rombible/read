<A NAME="2023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=609><b>tn</b> The word order is different in the Hebrew text, which reads &#8220;and Jonathan cut with the house of David, and the <sc>Lord will seek from the hand of the enemies of David.&#8221; The translation assumes that the main clauses of the verse have been accidentally transposed in the course of transmission. The first part of the verse (as it stands in MT) belongs with v. 17, while the second part of the verse actually continues v. 15. </p>
