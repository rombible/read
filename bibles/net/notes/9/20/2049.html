<A NAME="2049"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=635><b>tc</b> The translation follows the LXX in reading<i> </i>&#8220;the mound,&#8221; rather than the MT&#8217;s &#8220;the south.&#8221; It is hard to see what meaning the MT reading &#8220;from beside the south&#8221; would have as it stands, since such a location lacks specificity. The NIV treats it as an elliptical expression, rendering the phrase as &#8220;from the south side of the stone (rock NCV).&#8221; This is perhaps possible, but it seems better to follow the LXX rather than the MT here.</p>
