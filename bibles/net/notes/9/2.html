<A NAME="21"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=37><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;prayed and said.&#8221; This is somewhat redundant in contemporary English and has been simplified in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="22"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=38><b>sn</b> Horns of animals have always functioned as both offensive and defensive weapons for them. As a figure of speech the horn is therefore often used in the Bible as a symbol of human strength (see also in v. 10). The allusion in v. 1 to the <i>horn</i> being lifted <i>high</i> suggests a picture of an animal elevating its head in a display of strength or virility.</p>
<A NAME="23"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=39><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my mouth opens wide against.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="24"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=40><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for I rejoice in your deliverance.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="25"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=41><b>sn</b> In this context God&#8217;s holiness refers primarily to his sovereignty and incomparability. He is unique and distinct from all other so-called gods.</p>
<A NAME="26"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=42><b>tn</b> The LXX has &#8220;and there is none <i>righteous</i> like our God.&#8221; The Hebrew term translated &#8220;rock&#8221; refers to a rocky cliff where one can seek refuge from enemies. Here the metaphor depicts God as a protector of his people. Cf. TEV &#8220;no protector like our God&#8221;; CEV &#8220;We&#8217;re safer with you than on a high mountain.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="27"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=43><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;proudly, proudly.&#8221; If MT is original, the repetition of the word is for emphasis, stressing the arrogance of those addressed. However, a few medieval Hebrew manuscripts and some other textual witnesses do not reflect the repetition, suggesting that the Hebrew text may be dittographic.</p>
<A NAME="28"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=44><b>tc</b> The MT (<i>Qere</i>) reads &#8220;and by him actions are weighed.&#8221; The translation assumes that reading of the <i>Qere</i> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿlo</font>, &#8220;and by him&#8221;), which is supported by many medieval Hebrew <sc>mss, is correct, rather than the reading of the <i>Kethib</i> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿlo</font>&#8217;, &#8220;and not&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="29"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=45><b>tc</b> Against <i>BHS</i> but with the MT, the preposition (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">ad</font>) should be taken with what follows rather than with what precedes. For<i> </i>this sense of the preposition see Job 25:5.</p>
<A NAME="210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=46><b>sn</b> The number <i>seven</i> is used here in an ideal sense. Elsewhere in the OT having seven children is evidence of fertility as a result of God&#8217;s blessing on the family. See, for example, Jer 15:9, Ruth 4:15.</p>
<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=47><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;languishes.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=48><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Sheol&#8221;; NAB &#8220;the nether world&#8221;; CEV &#8220;the world of the dead.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=49><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;lowly&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;insignificant.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=50><b>tn</b> The imperfect verbal form, which is parallel to the participle in the preceding line, is best understood here as indicating what typically happens. </p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=51><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a seat of honor.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=52><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;guards the feet of.&#8221; The expression means that God watches over and protects the godly in all of their activities and movements. The imperfect verbal forms in v. 9 are understood as indicating what is typically true. Another option is to translate them with the future tense. See v. 10b.</p>
<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=53><b>tc</b> The translation follows the <i>Qere </i>and many medieval Hebrew <sc>mss in reading the plural (&#8220;his holy ones&#8221;) rather than the singular (&#8220;his holy one&#8221;) of the <i>Kethib</i>.</p>
<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=54><b>tn</b> The imperfect verbal forms in this line and in the next two lines are understood as indicating what is typically true. Another option is to translate them with the future tense. See v. 10b.</p>
<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=55><b>tc</b> The present translation follows the <i>Qere</i>, many medieval Hebrew manuscripts, the Syriac Peshitta, and the Vulgate in reading the plural (&#8220;his adversaries,&#8221; similarly many other English versions) rather than the singular (&#8220;his adversary&#8221;) of the <i>Kethib</i>.</p>
<A NAME="220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=56><b>tn</b> The Hebrew preposition here has the sense of &#8220;from within.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=57><b>tn</b> The imperfect verbal forms in this and the next line are understood as indicating what is anticipated and translated with the future tense, because at the time of Hannah&#8217;s prayer Israel did not yet have a king. </p>
<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=58><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the horn,&#8221; here a metaphor for power or strength. Cf. NCV &#8220;make his appointed king strong&#8221;; NLT &#8220;increases the might of his anointed one.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=59><b>tc</b> The LXX greatly expands v. 10 with an addition that seems to be taken from Jer 9:23-24.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The anointed one is the anticipated king of Israel, as the preceding line makes clear.</p>
<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=60><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;with [or &#8220;before&#8221;] the face of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=61><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sons of worthlessness.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=62><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they did not know the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The verb here has the semantic nuance &#8220;recognize the authority of.&#8221; Eli&#8217;s sons obviously knew who the Lord was; they served in his sanctuary. But they did not recognize his moral authority.</p>
<A NAME="227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=63><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the habit of the priests with the people [was this].&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=64><b>sn</b> The Hebrew word occurs only twice in the OT, here and again in v. 14. Its exact meaning is not entirely clear, although from the context it appears to be a sacrificial tool used for retrieving things from boiling water.</p>
<A NAME="229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=65><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to all Israel.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=66><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;living.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=67><b>tc</b> The translation follows the <i>Qere</i> and many medieval Hebrew <sc>mss</><font face="Scholar"> </font>(&#8220;no&#8221;) rather than the <i>Kethib</i> and MT, which read &#8220;to him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=68><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the men,&#8221; which is absent from one medieval Hebrew <sc>ms, a Qumran <sc>ms, and the LXX.</p>
<A NAME="233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=69><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;seed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=70><b>tn</b> The MT has a masculine verb here, but in light of the context the reference must be to Hannah. It is possible that the text of the MT is incorrect here (cf. the ancient versions), in which case the text should be changed to read either a passive participle or better, the third feminine singular of the verb. If the MT is correct here, perhaps the masculine is to be understood in a nonspecific and impersonal way, allowing for a feminine antecedent. In any case, the syntax of the MT is unusual here. </p>
<A NAME="235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=71><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=72><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;with the <sc>Lord.&#8221; Cf. NAB, TEV &#8220;in the service of the <sc>Lord&#8221;; NIV, NRSV, NLT &#8220;in the presence of the Lord&#8221;; CEV &#8220;at the Lord&#8217;s house in Shiloh.&#8221;</></p>
<A NAME="237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=73><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to all Israel.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=74><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lie with.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=75><b>tc</b> For &#8220;these&#8221; the LXX has &#8220;of the Lord&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965;</font>, <font face="Greektl">kuriou</font>), perhaps through the influence of the final phrase of v. 24 (&#8220;the people of the <sc>Lord&#8221;). Somewhat less likely is the view that the MT reading is due to a distorted dittography of the first word of v. 24. The Vulgate lacks the word.</p>
<A NAME="240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=76><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;no.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=77><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they&#8221;; the referent (Eli&#8217;s sons) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=78><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;desired.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=79><b>tn</b> The infinitive absolute appears before the finite verb for emphasis.</p>
<A NAME="244"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=80><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to your father&#8217;s&#8221; (also in vv. 28, 30).</p>
<A NAME="245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=81><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;him&#8221;; the referent (Eli&#8217;s ancestor, i.e., Aaron) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="246"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=82><b>tc</b> The MT has a plural &#8220;you&#8221; here, but the LXX and a Qumran <sc>ms have the singular. The singular may be the correct reading; the verb &#8220;you have honored&#8221; later in the verse is singular even in the MT. However, it is more probable that the Lord here refers to Eli and his sons. Note the plural in the second half of the verse (&#8220;you have made yourselves fat&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="247"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=83><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;which I commanded, dwelling place.&#8221; The noun is functioning as an adverbial accusative in relation to the verb. Since God&#8217;s dwelling place/sanctuary is in view, the pronoun &#8220;my&#8221; is supplied in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=84><b>tn</b> The infinitive absolute appears before the finite verb for emphasis. </p>
<A NAME="249"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=85><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;walk about before.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="250"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=86><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;may it be far removed from me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="251"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=87><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;chop off your arm.&#8221; The arm here symbolizes strength and activity.</p>
<A NAME="252"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=88><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;arm.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="253"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=89><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;you will see [the] trouble of [the] dwelling place.&#8221; Since God&#8217;s dwelling place/sanctuary is in view, the pronoun is supplied in the translation (see v. 29).</p>
<A NAME="254"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=90><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;in all which he does good with Israel.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="255"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=91><b>tc</b> The LXX and a Qumran manuscript have the first person pronoun &#8220;my&#8221; here.</p>
<A NAME="256"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=92><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;all the days.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="257"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=93><b>tc</b> The LXX, a Qumran <sc>ms, and a few old Latin <sc>mss have the third person pronominal suffix &#8220;his&#8221; here.</p>
<A NAME="258"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=94><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;to cause your eyes to fail.&#8221; Elsewhere this verb, when used of eyes, refers to bloodshot eyes resulting from weeping, prolonged staring, or illness (see Lev 26:16; Pss 69:3; 119:82; Lam 2:11; 4:17). </p>
<A NAME="259"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=95><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and to cause your soul grief.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="260"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=96><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and all the increase of your house.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="261"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=97><b>tc</b> The text is difficult. The MT literally says &#8220;they will die [as] men.&#8221; Apparently the meaning is that they will be cut off in the prime of their life without reaching old age. The LXX and a Qumran <sc>ms, however, have the additional word &#8220;sword&#8221; (&#8220;they will die by the sword of men&#8221;). This is an easier reading (cf. NAB, NRSV, TEV, CEV, NLT), but that fact is not in favor of its originality.</p>
<A NAME="262"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=98><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and this to you [is] the sign which will come to both of your sons.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="263"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=99><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;house.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="264"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=100><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he will walk about before my anointed one all the days.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="265"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=101><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a piece of silver&#8221; (so KJV, NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV).</p>
