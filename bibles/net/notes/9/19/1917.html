<A NAME="1917"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=581><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;teraphim&#8221; (also a second time in this verse and once in v. 16). These were statues that represented various deities. According to 2 Kgs 23:24 they were prohibited during the time of Josiah&#8217;s reform movement in the seventh century. The idol Michal placed under the covers was of sufficient size to give the mistaken impression that David lay in the bed, thus facilitating his escape. </p>
