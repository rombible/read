<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1><b>tc</b> The translation follows the MT. The LXX reads &#8220;a man from Ramathaim, a Zuphite&#8221;; this is followed by a number of recent English translations. It is possible the MT reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1493;&#1465;&#1508;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsofim</font>) arose from dittography of the <i>mem</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;</font>) at the beginning of the following word.</p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from days to days.&#8221;</p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3><b>tn</b> The exact sense of the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">appayim</font>, &#8220;two faces&#8221;) is not certain here. It is most likely used with the preceding expression (&#8220;one portion of two faces&#8221;) to mean a portion double than normally received. Although evidence for this use of the word derives primarily from Aramaic rather than from Hebrew usage, it provides an understanding that fits the context here better than other suggestions for the word do. The meaning &#8220;double&#8221; is therefore adopted in the present translation. Other possibilities for the meaning of the word include the following: &#8220;heavily&#8221; (cf. Vulg., <font face="Scholar">tristis</font>) and &#8220;worthy&#8221; or &#8220;choice&#8221; (cf. KJV and Targum). Some scholars have followed the LXX here, emending the word to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1505;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">efes</font>) and translating it as &#8220;but&#8221; or &#8220;however.&#8221; This seems unnecessary. The translators of the LXX may simply have been struggling to make sense of the word rather than following a Hebrew text that was different from the MT here.</p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for Hannah he loved.&#8221; Repetition of the proper name would seem redundant in contemporary English, so the pronoun (&#8220;her&#8221;) has been used here for clarity. The translation also adds the adverb &#8220;especially&#8221; to clarify the meaning of the text. Without this addition one might get the impression that only Hannah, not Peninnah, was loved by her husband. But the point of the text is that Hannah was his favorite.</p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> had closed her womb.&#8221; So also in v. 6. The disjunctive clause provides supplemental information that is pertinent to the story.</p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=6><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and her rival wife grieved her, even [with] grief so as to worry her.&#8221; </p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=7><b>tn</b> The MT has a masculine form of the verb here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aseh</font>, &#8220;he used to do&#8221;); the subject in that case would presumably be Elkanah. But this leads to an abrupt change of subject in the following part of the verse, where the subject is the rival wife who caused Hannah anxiety. In light of v. 6 one expects the statement of v. 7 to refer to the ongoing actions of the rival wife: &#8220;she used to behave in this way year after year.&#8221; Some scholars have proposed retaining the masculine form but changing the vocalization of the verb so as to read a Niphal rather than a Qal (i.e., <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1461;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ye</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aseh</font>, &#8220;so it used to be done&#8221;). But the problem here is lack of precedent for such a use of the Niphal of this verb. It seems best in light of the context to understand the reference to be to Hannah&#8217;s rival Peninnah and to read here, with the Syriac Peshitta, a feminine form of the verb (&#8220;she used to do&#8221;). In the translation the referent (Peninnah) has been specified for clarity.</p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=8><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;she&#8221;; the referent (Hannah) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=9><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;she&#8221;; the referent (Peninnah) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<a name="110"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=10><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;why is your heart displeased?&#8221;</p>
<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>sn</b> Like the number seven, the number ten is sometimes used in the OT as an ideal number (see, for example, Dan 1:20, Zech 8:23). </p>
<a name="112"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=12><b>tc</b> The LXX adds &#8220;and stood before the Lord,&#8221; but this is probably a textual expansion due to the terseness of the statement in the Hebrew text.</p>
<a name="113"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=13><b>tn</b> Or perhaps, &#8220;on his throne.&#8221; See Joüon 2:506-7 §137.f.</p>
<a name="114"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=14><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;she [was in] bitterness of soul.&#8221;</p>
<a name="115"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=15><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and weeping, she was weeping.&#8221; The infinitive absolute emphasizes the extent of her sorrow. The imperfect verbal form emphasizes the continuation of the action in past time.</p>
<a name="116"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=16><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;if looking you look.&#8221; The expression can refer, as here, to looking favorably upon another, in this case with compassion.</p>
<a name="117"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=17><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;handmaid.&#8221; The use of this term (translated two more times in this verse and once each in vv. 16, 17 simply as &#8220;servant&#8221; for stylistic reasons) is an expression of humility.</p>
<a name="118"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=18><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;seed of men.&#8221;</p>
<a name="119"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=19><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a razor will not go up upon his head.&#8221;</p>
<a name="120"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=20><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;before.&#8221; Many medieval Hebrew manuscripts read &#8220;to.&#8221; </p>
<a name="121"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=21><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Eli.&#8221; The pronoun (&#8220;he&#8221;) has been used in the translation in keeping with contemporary English style.</p>
<a name="122"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=22><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<a name="123"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=23><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I am a woman difficult of spirit.&#8221; The LXX has &#8220;for whom the day is difficult,&#8221; apparently mistaking the Hebrew word for &#8220;spirit&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ruakh</font>) to be the word for &#8220;day&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yom</font>).</p>
<a name="124"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=24><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;before.&#8221;</p>
<a name="125"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=25><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;daughter of worthlessness.&#8221;</p>
<a name="126"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=26><b>tc</b> Several medieval Hebrew <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> and the Syriac Peshitta lack the words &#8220;and got something to eat.&#8221;</p>
<a name="127"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=27><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Elkanah knew his wife.&#8221; The Hebrew expression is a euphemism for sexual relations.</p>
<a name="128"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=28><b>sn</b> The Lord &#8220;remembered&#8221; her in the sense of granting her earlier request for a child. The Hebrew verb is often used in the OT for considering the needs or desires of people with favor and kindness.</p>
<a name="129"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=29><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;because from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> I asked him.&#8221; The name &#8220;Samuel&#8221; sounds like the Hebrew verb translated &#8220;asked.&#8221; The explanation of the meaning of the name &#8220;Samuel&#8221; that is provided in v. 20 is not a strict etymology. It seems to suggest that the first part of the name is derived from the Hebrew root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sh</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">l</font>, &#8220;to ask&#8221;), but the consonants do not support this. Nor is it likely that the name comes from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shm</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to hear&#8221;), for the same reason. It more probably derives from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shem</font>, &#8220;name&#8221;), so that &#8220;Samuel&#8221; means &#8220;name of God.&#8221; Verse 20 therefore does not set forth a linguistic explanation of the meaning of the name, but rather draws a parallel between similar sounds. This figure of speech is known as paronomasia.</p>
<a name="130"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=30><b>tn</b> The disjunctive clause is contrastive here. The words &#8220;with them&#8221; have been supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<a name="131"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=31><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;what is good in your eyes.&#8221;</p>
<a name="132"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=32><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;establish his word.&#8221; This apparently refers to the promise inherent in Eli&#8217;s priestly blessing (see v. 17).</p>
<a name="133"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=33><b>sn</b> The <font face="Scholar">ephah</font> was a standard dry measure in OT times; it was the equivalent of one-tenth of the OT measure known as a homer. The ephah was equal to approximately one-half to two-thirds of a bushel.</p>
<a name="134"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=34><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term translated &#8220;container&#8221; may denote either a clay storage jar (cf. CEV &#8220;a clay jar full of wine&#8221;) or a leather container (cf. NAB, NIV, NRSV &#8220;a skin of wine&#8221;; NCV &#8220;a leather bag filled with (full of TEV) wine.&#8221;</p>
<a name="135"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=35><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the boy was a boy.&#8221; If the MT is correct the meaning apparently is that the boy was quite young at the time of these events. On the other hand, some scholars have suspected a textual problem, emending the text to read either &#8220;and the boy was with them&#8221; (so LXX) or &#8220;and the boy was with her&#8221; (a conjectural emendation). In spite of the difficulty it seems best to stay with the MT here.</p>
<a name="136"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=36><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he,&#8221; apparently referring to Samuel (but cf. CEV &#8220;Elkanah&#8221;). A few medieval manuscripts and some ancient versions take the verb as plural (cf. TEV, NLT).</p>
