<A NAME="911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=223><b>tc</b> The MT has &#8220;him&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1465;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">oto</font>) here, in addition to the &#8220;him&#8221; at the end of the verse. The ancient versions attest to only one occurrence of the pronoun, although it is possible that this is due to translation technique rather than to their having a Hebrew text with the pronoun used only once. The present translation assumes textual duplication in the MT and does not attempt to represent the pronoun twice. However, for a defense of the MT here, with the suggested translation &#8220;for <i>him</i> just now &#8211; you will find him,&#8221; see S. R. Driver, <i>Notes on the Hebrew Text and the Topography of the Books of Samuel</i>, 72-73.</p>
