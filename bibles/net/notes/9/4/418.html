<A NAME="418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=129><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has a direct quote, &#8220;because they said, &#8216;Gods have come to the camp.&#8217;&#8221; Even though the verb translated &#8220;have come&#8221; is singular, the following subject should be taken as plural (&#8220;gods&#8221;), as v. 8 indicates. Some emend the verb to a plural form.</p>
