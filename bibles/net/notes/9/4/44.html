<A NAME="44"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=115><b>tc</b> The LXX has a lengthy addition here: &#8220;And Samuel was acknowledged to be a prophet of the <sc>Lord in all Israel, from one end to the other. Eli was very old and, as for his sons, their way kept getting worse and worse before the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The Hebraic nature of the Greek syntax used here suggests that the LXX translator was accurately rendering a Hebrew variant and not simply expanding the text on his own initiative.</p>
