<A NAME="61"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=164><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;field.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="62"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=165><b>tc</b> The LXX adds &#8220;and their land swarmed with mice.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="63"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=166><b>tc</b> The LXX and a Qumran <sc>ms add &#8220;the covenant of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="64"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=167><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your mice.&#8221; A Qumran <sc>ms has simply &#8220;the mice.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="65"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=168><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Perhaps he will lighten his hand from upon you and from upon your gods and from upon your land.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="66"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=169><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;like Egypt and Pharaoh hardened their heart.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="67"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=170><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (God) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="68"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=171><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they sent them away and they went.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="69"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=172><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the men did so.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=173><b>tc</b> A few Hebrew <sc>mss and the LXX read &#8220;villages; the large rock&#8230;[is witness] until this very day.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=174><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (the <sc>Lord) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=175><b>tc</b> The number 50,070 is surprisingly large, although it finds almost unanimous textual support in the MT and in the ancient versions. Only a few medieval Hebrew <sc>mss lack &#8220;50,000,&#8221; reading simply &#8220;70&#8221; instead. However, there does not seem to be sufficient external evidence to warrant reading 70 rather than 50,070, although that is done by a number of recent translations (e.g., NAB, NIV, NRSV, NLT). The present translation (reluctantly) follows the MT and the ancient versions here.</p>
<A NAME="613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=176><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221; or &#8220;it&#8221;; the referent here (the ark) has been specified in the translation for clarity (cf. also NIV, CEV, NLT). Others, however, take the referent to be the <sc>Lord himself.</p>
