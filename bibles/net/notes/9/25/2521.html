<A NAME="2521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=727><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Thus God will do to the enemies of David and thus he will add.&#8221; Most of the Old Greek <sc>ms tradition has simply &#8220;David,&#8221; with no reference to his enemies. In OT imprecations such as the one found in v. 22 it is common for the speaker to direct malediction toward himself as an indication of the seriousness with which he regards the matter at hand. In other words, the speaker invites on himself dire consequences if he fails to fulfill the matter expressed in the oath. However, in the situation alluded to in v. 22 the threat actually does not come to fruition due to the effectiveness of Abigail&#8217;s appeal to David in behalf of her husband Nabal. Instead, David is placated through Abigail&#8217;s intervention. It therefore seems likely that the reference to &#8220;the enemies of David&#8221; in the MT of v. 22 is the result of a scribal attempt to deliver David from the implied consequences of this oath. The present translation follows the LXX rather than the MT here.</p>
