<A NAME="259"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=715><b>tc</b> The text is difficult here. The MT and most of the early versions support the reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lekhai</font>, &#8220;to life,&#8221; or &#8220;to the one who lives&#8221;). Some of the older English versions (KJV, ASV; cf. NKJV) took the expression to mean &#8220;to him who lives (in prosperity),&#8221; but this translation requires reading a good deal into the words. While the expression could have the sense of &#8220;Long life to you!&#8221; (cf. NIV, NJPS) or perhaps &#8220;Good luck to you!&#8221; this seems somewhat redundant in light of the salutation that follows in the context. The Latin Vulgate has <i>fratribus meis </i>(&#8220;to my brothers&#8221;), which suggests that Jerome understood the Hebrew word to have an <i>alef</i> that is absent in the MT (i.e., <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1462;&#1488;&#1457;&#1495;&#1464;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">le</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ekhay</font>). Jerome&#8217;s plural, however, remains a problem, since in the context David is addressing a single individual, namely Nabal, and not a group. However, it is likely that the Vulgate witnesses to a consonantal Hebrew text that is to be preferred here, especially if the word were to be revocalized as a singular rather than a plural. While it is impossible to be certain about this reading, the present translation essentially follows the Vulgate in reading &#8220;my brother&#8221; (so also NJB; cf. NAB, RSV, NRSV).</p>
