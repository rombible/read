<A NAME="251"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=707><b>tc</b> The LXX reads &#8220;Maon&#8221; here instead of &#8220;Paran,&#8221; perhaps because the following account of Nabal is said to be in Maon (v. 2). This reading is followed by a number of English versions (e.g., NAB, NIV, NCV, NLT). The MT, however, reads &#8220;Paran,&#8221; a location which would parallel this portion of David&#8217;s life with that of the nation Israel which also spent time in Paran (Num 10:12). Also, the desert of Paran was on the southern border of Judah&#8217;s territory and would be the most isolated location for hiding from Saul.</p>
