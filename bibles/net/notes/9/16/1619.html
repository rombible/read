<A NAME="1619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=456><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;caused seven of his sons to pass before Samuel.&#8221; This could be taken as referring to seven sons in addition to the three mentioned before this, but 1 Sam 17:12 says Jesse had eight sons, not eleven. 1 Chr 2:13-15 lists only seven sons, including David. However, 1 Chr 27:18 mentions an additional son, named Elihu. </p>
