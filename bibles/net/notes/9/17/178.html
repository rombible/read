<A NAME="178"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=480><b>sn</b> Although the exact weight of Goliath&#8217;s defensive <i>body armor</i> is difficult to estimate in terms of modern equivalency, it was obviously quite heavy. Driver, following Kennedy, suggests a modern equivalent of about 220 pounds (100 kg); see S. R. Driver, <i>Notes on the Hebrew Text and the Topography of the Books of Samuel</i>, 139. Klein, taking the shekel to be equal to .403 ounces, arrives at a somewhat smaller weight of about 126 pounds (57 kg); see R. W. Klein, <i>1 Samuel</i> (WBC), 175. But by any estimate it is clear that Goliath presented himself as a formidable foe indeed.</p>
