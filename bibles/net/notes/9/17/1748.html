<A NAME="1748"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=520><b>tn</b> This Hebrew word occurs only here and its exact meaning is not entirely clear. It refers to a receptacle of some sort and apparently was a common part of a shepherd&#8217;s equipment. Here it serves as a depository for the stones that David will use in his sling.</p>
