<A NAME="177"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=479><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his height was six cubits and a span&#8221; (cf. KJV, NASB, NRSV). A cubit was approximately eighteen inches, a span nine inches. So, according to the Hebrew tradition, Goliath was about nine feet, nine inches tall (cf. NIV, CEV, NLT &#8220;over nine feet&#8221;; NCV &#8220;nine feet, four inches&#8221;; TEV &#8220;nearly 3 metres&#8221;). However, some Greek witnesses, Josephus, and a manuscript of 1 Samuel from Qumran read &#8220;four cubits and a span&#8221; here, that is, about six feet, nine inches (cf. NAB &#8220;six and a half feet&#8221;). This seems more reasonable; it is likely that Goliath&#8217;s height was exaggerated as the story was retold. See P. K. McCarter, <i>I Samuel </i>(AB), 286, 291.</p>
