<A NAME="131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=303><b>tc</b> The MT does not have &#8220;thirty.&#8221; A number appears to have dropped out of the Hebrew text here, since as it stands the MT (literally, &#8220;a son of a year&#8221;) must mean that Saul was only one year old when he began to reign! The KJV, attempting to resolve this, reads &#8220;Saul reigned one year,&#8221; but that is not the normal meaning of the Hebrew text represented by the MT. Although most LXX <sc>mss lack the entire verse, some Greek <sc>mss have &#8220;thirty years&#8221; here (while others have &#8220;one year&#8221; like the MT). The Syriac Peshitta has Saul&#8217;s age as twenty-one. But this seems impossible to harmonize with the implied age of Saul&#8217;s son Jonathan in the following verse. Taking into account the fact that in v. 2 Jonathan was old enough to be a military leader, some scholars prefer to supply in v. 1 the number forty (cf. ASV, NASB). The present translation (&#8220;thirty&#8221;) is a possible but admittedly uncertain proposal based on a few Greek <sc>mss and followed by a number of English versions (e.g., NIV, NCV, NLT). Other English versions simply supply ellipsis marks for the missing number (e.g., NAB, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=304><b>tc</b> The MT has &#8220;two years&#8221; here. If this number is to be accepted as correct, the meaning apparently would be that after a lapse of two years at the beginning of Saul&#8217;s reign, he then went about the task of consolidating an army as described in what follows (cf. KJV, ASV, CEV). But if the statement in v. 1 is intended to be a comprehensive report on the length of Saul&#8217;s reign, the number is too small. According to Acts 13:21 Saul reigned for forty years. Some English versions (e.g., NIV, NCV, NLT), taking this forty to be a round number, add it to the &#8220;two years&#8221; of the MT and translate the number in 2 Sam 13:1 as &#8220;forty-two years.&#8221; While this is an acceptable option, the present translation instead replaces the MT&#8217;s &#8220;two&#8221; with the figure &#8220;forty.&#8221; Admittedly the textual evidence for this decision is weak, but the same can be said of any attempt to restore sense to this difficult text (note the ellipsis marks at this point in NAB, NRSV). The Syriac Peshitta lacks this part of v. 1.</p>

<A NAME="1311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=313><b>tn</b> Many English versions (e.g., KJV, NASB, NRSV, TEV) read &#8220;30,000&#8221; here.</p>
<A NAME="1312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=314><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;vaults.&#8221; This rare term also occurs in Judg 9:46, 49. Cf.

<A NAME="1313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=315><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;River&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but has been supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=316><b>tn</b> This apparently refers to the instructions given by Samuel in 1 Sam 10:8. If so, several years had passed. On the relationship between chs. 10 and 13, see V. P. Long, <i>The Art of Biblical History</i> (FCI), 201-23.</p>

<A NAME="1319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=321><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I forced myself&#8221; (so KJV, NASB, NRSV, CEV); NAB &#8220;So in my anxiety I offered&#8221;; NIV &#8220;I felt compelled.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=322><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;kept.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=323><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;commanded.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=324><b>tn</b> This verb form, as well as the one that follows (&#8220;appointed&#8221;), indicates completed action from the standpoint of the speaker. This does not necessarily mean that the Lord had already conducted his search and made his choice, however. The forms may be used for rhetorical effect to emphasize the certainty of the action. The divine search for a new king is as good as done, emphasizing that the days of Saul&#8217;s dynasty are numbered. </p>
<A NAME="1323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=325><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;according to his heart.&#8221; The idiomatic expression means to be like-minded with another, as its use in 1 Sam 14:7 indicates.</p>
<A NAME="1324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=326><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;commanded.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=327><b>tc</b> The LXX and two Old Latin <sc>mss include the following words here: &#8220;on his way. And the rest of the people went up after Saul to meet the warring army. When they arrived from Gilgal&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=328><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;at Gibeah of Benjamin.&#8221; The words &#8220;in the territory&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarity (likewise in the following verse).</p>
<A NAME="1327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=329><b>tn</b> The juxtaposition of disjunctive clauses in v.16 indicates synchronic action.</p>
<A NAME="1328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=330><b>tc</b> The translation follows the LXX (&#8220;their sickle&#8221;) here, rather than the MT &#8220;plowshares,&#8221; which is due to dittography from the word earlier in the verse.</p>
<A NAME="1329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=331><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the price was.&#8221; The meaning of the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pÿtsirah</font>) is uncertain. This is the only place it occurs in the OT. Some propose the meaning &#8220;sharpening,&#8221; but &#8220;price&#8221; is a more likely meaning if the following term refers to a weight (see the following note on the word &#8220;shekel&#8221;). See P. K. McCarter, <i>I Samuel</i> (AB), 238.</p>
<A NAME="1330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=332><b>tn</b> This word, which appears only here in the OT, probably refers to a stone weight. Stones marked <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pim</font>) have been found in excavations of Palestinian sites. The average weight of such stones is 0.268 ounces, which is equivalent to about two-thirds of a shekel. This probably refers to the price charged by the Philistines for the services listed. See P. K. McCarter, <i>I Samuel </i>(AB), 238; <i>DNWSI</i> 2:910; and G. I. Davies, <i>Ancient Hebrew Inscriptions</i>, 259.</p>
<A NAME="1331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=333><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and for a third, a pick.&#8221; The Hebrew text suffers from haplography at this point. The translation follows the textual reconstruction offered by P. K. McCarter, <i>I Samuel </i>(AB), 235. </p>
