<A NAME="251"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=707><b>tc</b> The LXX reads &#8220;Maon&#8221; here instead of &#8220;Paran,&#8221; perhaps because the following account of Nabal is said to be in Maon (v. 2). This reading is followed by a number of English versions (e.g., NAB, NIV, NCV, NLT). The MT, however, reads &#8220;Paran,&#8221; a location which would parallel this portion of David&#8217;s life with that of the nation Israel which also spent time in Paran (Num 10:12). Also, the desert of Paran was on the southern border of Judah&#8217;s territory and would be the most isolated location for hiding from Saul.</p>
<A NAME="252"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=708><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;great.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="253"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=709><b>sn</b> The name <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">Nabal</font>) means &#8220;foolish&#8221; or &#8220;senseless&#8221; in Hebrew, and as an adjective the word is used especially of persons who have no perception of ethical or religious claims. It is an apt name for this character, who certainly typifies such behavior.</p>
<A NAME="254"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=710><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;good of insight&#8221;; KJV &#8220;of good understanding&#8221;; NAB, NIV, TEV &#8220;intelligent&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;clever.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="255"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=711><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;David&#8221;; for stylistic reasons the pronoun has been used in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="256"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=712><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;young men.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="257"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=713><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and David said to the young men.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="258"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=714><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and inquire concerning him in my name in regard to peace.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="259"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=715><b>tc</b> The text is difficult here. The MT and most of the early versions support the reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lekhai</font>, &#8220;to life,&#8221; or &#8220;to the one who lives&#8221;). Some of the older English versions (KJV, ASV; cf. NKJV) took the expression to mean &#8220;to him who lives (in prosperity),&#8221; but this translation requires reading a good deal into the words. While the expression could have the sense of &#8220;Long life to you!&#8221; (cf. NIV, NJPS) or perhaps &#8220;Good luck to you!&#8221; this seems somewhat redundant in light of the salutation that follows in the context. The Latin Vulgate has <i>fratribus meis </i>(&#8220;to my brothers&#8221;), which suggests that Jerome understood the Hebrew word to have an <i>alef</i> that is absent in the MT (i.e., <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1462;&#1488;&#1457;&#1495;&#1464;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">le</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ekhay</font>). Jerome&#8217;s plural, however, remains a problem, since in the context David is addressing a single individual, namely Nabal, and not a group. However, it is likely that the Vulgate witnesses to a consonantal Hebrew text that is to be preferred here, especially if the word were to be revocalized as a singular rather than a plural. While it is impossible to be certain about this reading, the present translation essentially follows the Vulgate in reading &#8220;my brother&#8221; (so also NJB; cf. NAB, RSV, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="2510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=716><b>tc</b> The translation follows many medieval Hebrew <sc>mss in reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">nu</font>, &#8220;we have come&#8221;) rather than the MT&#8217;s <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">banu</font>, &#8220;we have built&#8221;). </p>

<A NAME="2521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=727><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Thus God will do to the enemies of David and thus he will add.&#8221; Most of the Old Greek <sc>ms tradition has simply &#8220;David,&#8221; with no reference to his enemies. In OT imprecations such as the one found in v. 22 it is common for the speaker to direct malediction toward himself as an indication of the seriousness with which he regards the matter at hand. In other words, the speaker invites on himself dire consequences if he fails to fulfill the matter expressed in the oath. However, in the situation alluded to in v. 22 the threat actually does not come to fruition due to the effectiveness of Abigail&#8217;s appeal to David in behalf of her husband Nabal. Instead, David is placated through Abigail&#8217;s intervention. It therefore seems likely that the reference to &#8220;the enemies of David&#8221; in the MT of v. 22 is the result of a scribal attempt to deliver David from the implied consequences of this oath. The present translation follows the LXX rather than the MT here.</p>
