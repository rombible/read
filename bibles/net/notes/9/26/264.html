<A NAME="264"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=755><b>tn</b> Here &#8220;the spear&#8221; almost certainly refers to Saul&#8217;s own spear, which according to the previous verse was stuck into the ground beside him as he slept. This is reflected in a number of English versions: TEV, CEV &#8220;his own spear&#8221;; NLT &#8220;that spear.&#8221; Cf. NIV, NCV &#8220;my spear,&#8221; in which case Abishai refers to his own spear rather than Saul&#8217;s, but this is unlikely since (1) Abishai would probably not have carried a spear along since such a weapon would be unwieldy when sneaking into the enemy camp; and (2) this would not explain the mention of Saul&#8217;s own spear stuck in the ground beside him in the previous verse.</p>
