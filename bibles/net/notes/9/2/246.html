<A NAME="246"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=82><b>tc</b> The MT has a plural &#8220;you&#8221; here, but the LXX and a Qumran <sc>ms have the singular. The singular may be the correct reading; the verb &#8220;you have honored&#8221; later in the verse is singular even in the MT. However, it is more probable that the Lord here refers to Eli and his sons. Note the plural in the second half of the verse (&#8220;you have made yourselves fat&#8221;).</p>
