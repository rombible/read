<A NAME="22"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=38><b>sn</b> Horns of animals have always functioned as both offensive and defensive weapons for them. As a figure of speech the horn is therefore often used in the Bible as a symbol of human strength (see also in v. 10). The allusion in v. 1 to the <i>horn</i> being lifted <i>high</i> suggests a picture of an animal elevating its head in a display of strength or virility.</p>
