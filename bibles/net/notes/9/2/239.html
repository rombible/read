<A NAME="239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=75><b>tc</b> For &#8220;these&#8221; the LXX has &#8220;of the Lord&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965;</font>, <font face="Greektl">kuriou</font>), perhaps through the influence of the final phrase of v. 24 (&#8220;the people of the <sc>Lord&#8221;). Somewhat less likely is the view that the MT reading is due to a distorted dittography of the first word of v. 24. The Vulgate lacks the word.</p>
