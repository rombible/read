<A NAME="261"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=97><b>tc</b> The text is difficult. The MT literally says &#8220;they will die [as] men.&#8221; Apparently the meaning is that they will be cut off in the prime of their life without reaching old age. The LXX and a Qumran <sc>ms, however, have the additional word &#8220;sword&#8221; (&#8220;they will die by the sword of men&#8221;). This is an easier reading (cf. NAB, NRSV, TEV, CEV, NLT), but that fact is not in favor of its originality.</p>
