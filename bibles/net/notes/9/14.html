<A NAME="141"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=334><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the servant who was carrying his military equipment&#8221; (likewise in vv. 6, 7, 12, 13, 14).</p>
<A NAME="142"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=335><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;bearing.&#8221; Many English versions understand this verb to mean &#8220;wearing&#8221; (cf. KJV, NAB, NASB, NIV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="143"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=336><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;act.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=337><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in your heart.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="145"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=338><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Look, I am with you, according to your heart.&#8221; See the note at 13:14.</p>
<A NAME="146"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=339><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Look!&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="147"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=340><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;stand.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="148"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=341><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the two of them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="149"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=342><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a thing.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=343><b>tn</b> The perfect verbal form is used rhetorically here to express Jonathan&#8217;s certitude. As far as he is concerned, the victory is as good as won and can be described as such.</p>
<A NAME="1411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=344><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they fell before Jonathan.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=345><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the one carrying his equipment was killing after him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=346><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fell upon.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=347><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and it was by the fear of God.&#8221; The translation understands this to mean that God was the source or cause of the fear experienced by the Philistines. This seems to be the most straightforward reading of the sentence. It is possible, however, that the word &#8220;God&#8221; functions here simply to intensify the accompanying word &#8220;fear,&#8221; in which one might translate &#8220;a very great fear&#8221; (cf. NAB, NRSV). It is clear that on some occasions that the divine name carries such a superlative nuance. For examples see Joüon 2:525 §141.n.</p>
<A NAME="1415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=348><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;at Gibeah of Benjamin.&#8221; The words &#8220;in the territory&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=349><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;saw, and look!&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=350><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the crowd melted and went, even here.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=351><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they mustered the troops, and look!&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=352><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the ark of God.&#8221; It seems unlikely that Saul would call for the ark, which was several miles away in Kiriath-jearim (see 1 Sam 7:2). The LXX and an Old Latin <sc>ms have &#8220;ephod&#8221; here, a reading which harmonizes better with v. 3 and fits better with the verb &#8220;bring near&#8221; (see 1 Sam 23:9; 30:7) and with the expression &#8220;withdraw your hand&#8221; in v.19. This reading is followed in the present translation (cf. NAB, TEV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="1420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=353><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for the ark of God was in that day, and the sons of Israel.&#8221; The translation follows the text of some Greek manuscripts. See the previous note.</p>
<A NAME="1421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=354><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;until.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=355><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and look, there was&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=356><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the sword of a man against his companion, a very great panic.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=357><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the Hebrews were to the Philistines formerly, who went up with them in the camp all around.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=358><b>tc</b> The LXX includes the following words: &#8220;And all the people were with Saul, about ten thousand men. And the battle extended to the entire city on mount Ephraim.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1426"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=359><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all the land.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1427"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=360><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the surface of the field.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1428"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=361><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the army entered the forest, and look!&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1429"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=362><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and there was no one putting his hand to his mouth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1430"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=363><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he returned his hand to his mouth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1431"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=364><b>tc</b> The translation follows the <i>Qere </i>and several medieval Hebrew <sc>mss in reading &#8220;gleamed,&#8221; rather than the <i>Kethib</i>, &#8220;saw.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1432"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=365><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your father surely put the army under an oath.&#8221; The infinitive absolute is used before the finite verb to emphasize the solemn nature of the oath.</p>
<A NAME="1433"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=366><b>tc</b> The LXX reads &#8220;saw.&#8221; See v. 27.</p>
<A NAME="1434"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=367><b>tc</b> The translation follows the <i>Qere</i> and many medieval Hebrew <sc>mss in reading &#8220;and they rushed greedily upon,&#8221; rather than the <i>Kethib</i>, &#8220;and they did.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1435"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=368><b>tc</b> The translation reads with the <i>Qere</i> and many medieval Hebrew <sc>mss <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hashalal</font>, &#8220;the spoil&#8221;) rather than following the <i>Kethib</i> reading, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shalal</font>, &#8220;spoil&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1436"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=369><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;You have acted deceptively.&#8221; In this context the verb refers to violating an agreement, in this case the dietary and sacrificial regulations of the Mosaic law. The verb form is second masculine plural; apparently Saul here addresses those who are eating the animals.</p>
<A NAME="1437"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=370><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and all the army brought near, each his ox by his hand, and they slaughtered there.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1438"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=371><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;plunder.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1439"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=372><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;until the light of the morning.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1440"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=373><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and there will not be left among them a man.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1441"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=374><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all that is good in your eyes.&#8221; So also in v. 40.</p>
<A NAME="1442"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=375><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;know and see.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1443"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=376><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and there was no one answering from all the army.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1444"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=377><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to the <sc>Lord God of Israel: &#8216;Give what is perfect.&#8217;&#8221; The Hebrew textual tradition has accidentally omitted several words here. The present translation follows the LXX (as do several English versions, cf. NAB, NRSV, TEV). See P. K. McCarter, <i>I Samuel</i> (AB), 247-48, and R. W. Klein, <i>1 Samuel</i> (WBC), 132.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The <i>Urim</i> and <i>Thummim</i> were used for lot casting in ancient Israel. Their exact identity is uncertain; they may have been specially marked stones drawn from a bag. See Exod 28:30; Lev 8:8, and Deut 33:8, as well as the discussion in R. W. Klein, <i>1 Samuel</i> (WBC), 140. </p>
<A NAME="1445"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=378><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;went out.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1446"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=379><b>tc</b> The LXX includes the following words: &#8220;Whomever the Lord will indicate by the lot, let him die! And the people said to Saul, &#8216;It is not this word.&#8217; But Saul prevailed over the people, and they cast lots between him and between Jonathan his son.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1447"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=380><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Look, I, I will die.&#8221; Apparently Jonathan is acquiescing to his anticipated fate of death. However, the words may be taken as sarcastic (&#8220;Here I am about to die!&#8221;) or as a question, &#8220;Must I now die?&#8221; (cf. NAB, NIV, NCV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="1448"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=381><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;So God will do and so he will add, surely you will certainly die, Jonathan.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1449"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=382><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he did not die.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1450"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=383><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to their place.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1451"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=384><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his,&#8221; which could refer to Israel or to Saul.</p>
<A NAME="1452"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=385><b>tc</b> The translation follows the LXX (&#8220;he was delivered&#8221;), rather than the MT, which reads, &#8220;he acted wickedly.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1453"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=386><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;plunderers.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1454"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=387><b>sn</b> The list differs from others. In 1 Sam 31:2 (= 1 Chr 10:2), Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malki-Shua are listed as Saul&#8217;s sons, while 1 Chr 8:33 and 9:39 list Jonathan, Malki-Shua, Abinadab, and Eshbaal.</p>
<A NAME="1455"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=388><b>sn</b> The word &#8220;uncle&#8221; can modify either Abner or Ner. See the note on the word &#8220;son&#8221; in v. 51 for further discussion.</p>
<A NAME="1456"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=389><b>tn</b> 1 Chr 9:35-36 indicates that Jeiel (= Abiel?) had two sons (among others) named Ner and Kish (see also 1 Sam 9:1 and 1 Chr 8:30, where some Greek manuscripts include the name Ner, though it is absent in the Hebrew text). If this Kish was the father of Saul and Ner was the father of Abner, then Saul and Abner were cousins. However, according to 1 Chr 8:33 and 9:39, Ner, not Abiel, was the father of Kish. In this case, Kish and Abner were brothers and Abner was Saul&#8217;s uncle. The simplest solution to the problem is to see two men named Kish in the genealogy: Abiel (Jeiel) was the father of Ner and Kish I. Ner was the father of Abner and Kish II. Kish II was the father of Saul. The Kish mentioned in 1 Sam 9:1 was the father of Saul (v.2) and must be identified as Kish II. In this case the genealogy is &#8220;gapped,&#8221; with Ner being omitted. Abiel was the grandfather of Kish II. </p>
