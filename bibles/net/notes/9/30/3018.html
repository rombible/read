<A NAME="3018"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=848><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;with me.&#8221; The singular is used rather than the plural because the group is being treated as a singular entity, in keeping with Hebrew idiom. It is not necessary to read &#8220;with us,&#8221; rather than the MT &#8220;with me,&#8221; although the plural can be found here in a few medieval Hebrew <sc>mss. See also the LXX, Syriac Peshitta, and Vulgate, although these versions may simply reflect an understanding of the idiom as found in the MT rather than a different textual reading.</p>
