<A NAME="3019"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=849><b>tc</b> This clause is difficult in the MT. The present translation accepts the text as found in the MT and understands this clause to be elliptical, with an understood verb such as &#8220;look&#8221; or &#8220;consider.&#8221; On the other hand, the LXX seems to reflect a slightly different Hebrew text, reading &#8220;after&#8221; where the MT has &#8220;my brothers.&#8221; The Greek translation yields the following translation: &#8220;You should not do this after the <sc>Lord has delivered us.&#8221; Although the Greek reading should be taken seriously, it seems better to follow the MT here.</p>
