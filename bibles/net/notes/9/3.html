<A NAME="31"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=102><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;before Eli.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="32"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=103><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Eli) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="33"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=104><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Eli) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="34"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=105><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text adds &#8220;so that&#8221; here, formally connecting this clause with the next.</p>
<A NAME="35"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=106><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;fulfill.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="36"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=107><b>tc</b> The MT has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497; &#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿhiggadti lo</font>). The verb is Hiphil perfect 1st person common singular, and apparently the conjunction should be understood as <font face="Scholar">vav</font> consecutive (&#8220;I will say to him&#8221;). But the future reference makes more sense if Samuel is the subject. This would require dropping the final <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yod)</font> and reading the 2nd person masculine singular <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿhiggadta)</font>. Although there is no external evidence to support it, this reading has been adopted in the present translation. The alternative is to understand the MT to mean &#8220;I <i>said </i>to him,&#8221; but for this we would expect the preterite with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> consecutive.</p>
<A NAME="37"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=108><b>tn</b> The translation understands the preposition to have a causal sense. However, the preposition could also be understood as the <i>beth pretii</i>, indicating in a broad sense the price attached to this action. So GKC 380 §119.<i>p</i>.</p>
<A NAME="38"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=109><b>tc</b> The translation follows the LXX <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#957;</font><font face="Scholar"> </font>(<font face="Greektl">qeon</font>, &#8220;God&#8221;) rather than the MT <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lahem</font>, &#8220;to them&#8221;). The MT seems to mean &#8220;they were bringing a curse on themselves&#8221; (cf. ASV, NASB). But this meaning is problematic in part because the verb <font face="Scholar">qll</font> means &#8220;to curse,&#8221; not &#8220;to bring a curse on,&#8221; and in part because it takes an accusative object rather than the equivalent of a dative. This is one of the so-called <i>tiqqune sopherim</i>, or &#8220;emendations of the scribes.&#8221; Why would the ancient copyists alter the original statement about Eli&#8217;s sons cursing <i>God</i> to the less objectionable statement that they brought a curse on <i>themselves</i>? Some argue that the scribes were concerned that such a direct and blasphemous affront against God could occur without an immediate response of judgment from God. Therefore they changed the text by deleting two letters <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">alef</font> and <font face="Scholar">yod</font>) from the word for &#8220;God,&#8221; with the result that the text then read &#8220;to them.&#8221; If this ancient scribal claim is accepted as accurate, it implies that the MT here is secondary. The present translation follows the LXX (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#8166;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#952;&#949;&#972;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">kakologounte&quot; qeon</font>) and a few <sc>mss of the Old Latin in reading &#8220;God&#8221; rather than the MT &#8220;to them.&#8221; Cf. also NAB, NRSV, NLT.</p>
<A NAME="39"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=110><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Eli) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=111><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;So God will do to you and thus he will add.&#8221; The verbal forms in this pronouncement are imperfects, not jussives, but the statement has the force of a curse or warning. One could translate, &#8220;May God do to you and thus may he add.&#8221; </p>
