<A NAME="1219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=293><b>tc</b> In the ancient versions there is some confusion with regard to these names, both with regard to the particular names selected for mention and with regard to the order in which they are listed. For example, the LXX has &#8220;Jerub-Baal, Barak, Jephthah, and Samuel.&#8221; But the Targum has &#8220;Gideon, Samson, Jephthah, and Samuel,&#8221; while the Syriac Peshitta has &#8220;Deborah, Barak, Gideon, Jephthah, and Samson.&#8221;</p>
