<A NAME="2120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1079><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;sulfur, which is.&#8221; The relative pronoun has been translated as &#8220;that&#8221; to indicate its connection to the previous clause. The nearest logical antecedent is &#8220;the lake [that burns with fire and sulfur],&#8221; although &#8220;lake&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#943;&#956;&#957;&#951;</font>, <font face="Greektl">limnh</font>) is feminine gender, while the pronoun &#8220;which&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jo</font>) is neuter gender. This means that (1) the proper antecedent could be &#8220;their place&#8221; (<i>Grk </i>&#8220;their share,&#8221;) agreeing with the relative pronoun in number and gender, or (2) the neuter pronoun still has as its antecedent the feminine noun &#8220;lake,&#8221; since agreement in gender between pronoun and antecedent was not always maintained, with an explanatory phrase occurring with a neuter pronoun regardless of the case of the antecedent. In favor of the latter explanation is Rev 20:14, where the phrase &#8220;the lake of fire&#8221; is in apposition to the phrase &#8220;the second death.&#8221;</p>
