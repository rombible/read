<A NAME="2122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1081><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;with me.&#8221; The translation &#8220;with me&#8221; implies that John was engaged in a dialogue with the one speaking to him (e.g., Jesus or an angel) when in reality it was a one-sided conversation, with John doing all the listening. For this reason, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#8127; &#7952;&#956;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">met</font><i>&#8217;</i><font face="Greektl"> emou</font>, &#8220;with me&#8221;) was translated as &#8220;to me.&#8221; See also v. 15.</p>
