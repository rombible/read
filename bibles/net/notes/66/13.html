All of the pronouns referring to this beast (along with the second beast appearing in 13:11) could be translated as &#8220;it&#8221; because the word for beast (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#951;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">qhrion</font>) is neuter gender in Greek and all the pronouns related to it are parsed as neuter in the Gramcord/Accordance database. Nevertheless, most interpreters would agree that the beast ultimately represents a human ruler, so beginning at the end of v. 4 the masculine pronouns (&#8220;he,&#8221; &#8220;him,&#8221; etc.) are used to refer to the first beast as well as the second beast appearing in 13:11.</p>

The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8033;&#962;</font> is used in Greek generally for comparison, and in Revelation it is used often to describe the appearance of what the author saw. In this instance, the appearance of the beast&#8217;s head did not match reality, because the next phrase shows that in fact it did not die. This text does not affirm that the beast died and was resurrected, but some draw this conclusion because of the only other use of the phrase, which refers to Jesus in 5:6.</p>

Although the ms evidence is somewhat in favor of the shorter reading, the support of <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>115</sup> (a recently-discovered ms) for the longer reading balances things out. Normally, the shorter reading should be given preference. However, in an instance in which homoioteleuton could play a role, caution must be exercised. In this passage, accidental omission is quite likely. That this could have happened seems apparent from the two occurrences of the identical phrase &#8220;and it was given to him&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7952;&#948;&#972;&#952;&#951; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</font>, <font face="Greektl">kai edoqh autw</font>) in v. 7.

<A NAME="1327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=650><b>tn</b> The prepositional phrase &#8220;since the foundation of the world&#8221; is traditionally translated as a modifier of the immediately preceding phrase in the Greek text, &#8220;the Lamb who was killed&#8221; (so also G. B. Caird, <i>Revelation </i>[HNTC], 168), but it is more likely that the phrase &#8220;since the foundation of the world&#8221; modifies the verb &#8220;written&#8221; (as translated above). Confirmation of this can be found in Rev 17:8 where the phrase &#8220;written in the book of life since the foundation of the world&#8221; occurs with no ambiguity.</p>

Other <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> 1006 1611* 1854<i> al</i>) are similar except that they read a present tense &#8220;kills&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#957;&#949;&#953;</font>, <font face="Greektl">apokteinei</font>) in this sentence. Both of these variants may be regarded as essentially saying the same thing. On the other hand, codex A reads &#8220;if anyone is to be killed by the sword, he is to be killed by the sword&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7988; &#964;&#953;&#962; &#7952;&#957; &#956;&#945;&#967;&#945;&#943;&#961;&#8131; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#964;&#945;&#957;&#952;&#8134;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#7952;&#957; &#956;&#945;&#967;&#945;&#943;&#961;&#8131; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#964;&#945;&#957;&#952;&#8134;&#957;&#945;&#953;</font>). Thus the first two variants convey the idea of retribution, while the last variant, supported by codex A, does not. (There are actually a dozen variants here, evidence that scribes found the original text quite difficult. Only the most important variants are discussed in this note.) The first two variants seem to be in line with Jesus&#8217; comments in Matt 26:52: &#8220;everyone who takes up the sword will die by the sword.&#8221; The last variant, however, seems to be taking up an idea found in Jer 15:2: &#8220;Those destined for death, to death; those for the sword, to the sword; those for starvation, to starvation; those for captivity, to captivity.&#8221; Though G. B. Caird, <i>Revelation </i>(HNTC), 169-70, gives four arguments in favor of the first reading (i.e., &#8220;whoever kills with the sword must with the sword be killed&#8221;), the arguments he puts forward can be read equally as well to support the latter alternative. In the end, the reading in codex A seems to be original. The fact that this sentence seems to be in parallel with 10a (which simply focuses on God&#8217;s will and suffering passively and is therefore akin to the reading in codex A), and that it most likely gave rise to the others as the most difficult reading, argues for its authenticity.</p>

<A NAME="1354"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=677><b>tn</b> Grk &#8220;it is man&#8217;s number.&#8221; <i>ExSyn</i> 254 states &#8220;if <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#8061;&#960;&#959;&#965;</font> is generic, then the sense is, &#8216;It is [the] number of humankind.&#8217; It is significant that this construction fits Apollonius&#8217; Canon (i.e., both the head noun and the genitive are anarthrous), suggesting that if one of these nouns is definite, then the other is, too. Grammatically, those who contend that the sense is &#8216;it is [the] number of a man&#8217; have the burden of proof on them (for they treat the head noun, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#956;&#972;&#962;</font>, as definite and the genitive, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#8061;&#960;&#959;&#965;</font>, as indefinite &#8211; the rarest of all possibilities). In light of Johannine usage, we might also add Rev 16:18, where the Seer clearly uses the anarthrous <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;</font> in a generic sense, meaning &#8216;humankind.&#8217; The implications of this grammatical possibility, exegetically speaking, are simply that the number &#8216;666&#8217; is the number that represents humankind. Of course, an individual is in view, but his number may be the number representing all of humankind. Thus the Seer might be suggesting here that the antichrist, who is the best representative of humanity without Christ (and the best counterfeit of a perfect man that his master, that old serpent, could muster), is still less than perfection (which would have been represented by the number seven).&#8221; See G. K. Beale, <i>Revelation</i>, [NIGTC], 723-24, who argues for the &#8220;generic&#8221; understanding of the noun; for an indefinite translation, see the ASV and ESV which both translate the clause as &#8220;it is the number of a man.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The translation <i>man&#8217;s number</i> suggests that the beast&#8217;s number is symbolic of humanity in general, while the translation <i>a man&#8217;s number</i> suggests that it represents an individual.</p>
<A NAME="1355"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=678><b>tc</b> A few <sc>mss (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>115</sup> C, along with a few <sc>mss known to Irenaeus {and two minuscule <sc>mss, 5 and 11, no longer extant}), read 616 here, and several other witnesses have other variations. Irenaeus&#8217; mention of <sc>mss that have 616 is balanced by his rejection of such witnesses in this case. As intriguing as the reading 616 is (since the conversion of Nero Caesar&#8217;s name in Latin by way of gematria would come out to 616), it must remain suspect because such a reading seems motivated in that it conforms more neatly to Nero&#8217;s gematria.</p>
