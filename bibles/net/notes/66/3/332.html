<A NAME="332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=186><b>tn</b> This translation is based on connecting the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) clause with the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#7990;&#948;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">oida</font>) at the beginning of the verse, giving the content of what is known (see also 3:1, 3:15 for parallels). Because of the intervening clause that is virtually parenthetical (see the note on the word &#8220;shut&#8221; earlier in this verse), the words &#8220;I know that&#8221; from the beginning of the verse had to be repeated to make this connection clear for the English reader. However, the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> could be understood as introducing a causal subordinate clause instead and thus translated, &#8220;because you have.&#8221;</p>
