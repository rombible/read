<A NAME="328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=182><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;door&#8221; is not in the Greek text but has been supplied in the translation. Direct objects were often omitted in Greek when clear from the context. Since the following verse does contain the word &#8220;door&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#973;&#961;&#945;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">quran</font>), that word has been supplied as the direct object here.</p>
