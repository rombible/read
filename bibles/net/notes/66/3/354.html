<A NAME="354"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=208><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the beginning of God&#8217;s creation&#8221;; or &#8220;the ruler of God&#8217;s creation.&#8221; From a linguistic standpoint all three meanings for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8053;</font> (<font face="Greektl">arch</font>) are possible. The term is well attested in both LXX (Gen 40:13, 21; 41:13) and intertestamental Jewish literature (2 Macc 4:10, 50) as meaning &#8220;<i>ruler, authority</i>&#8221; (BDAG 138 s.v. 6). Some have connected this passage to Paul&#8217;s statements in Col 1:15, 18 which describe Christ as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8053;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#972;&#964;&#959;&#954;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">prwtotoko&quot;</font>; e.g., see R. H. Mounce, <i>Revelation </i>[NICNT], 124) but the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8053;</font> has been understood as either &#8220;beginning&#8221; or &#8220;ruler&#8221; in that passage as well. The most compelling connection is to be found in the prologue to John&#8217;s Gospel (1:2-4) where the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">logos</font>) is said to be &#8220;in the beginning (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8053;</font>) with God,&#8221; a temporal reference connected with creation, and then v. 3 states that &#8220;all things were made through him.&#8221; The connection with the original creation suggests the meaning &#8220;originator&#8221; for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8053;</font> here. BDAG 138 s.v. 3 gives the meaning &#8220;the first cause&#8221; for the word in Rev 3:14, a term that is too philosophical for the general reader, so the translation &#8220;originator&#8221; was used instead. BDAG also notes, &#8220;but the mng. <i>beginning </i>= &#8216;first created&#8217; is linguistically probable (s. above 1b and Job 40:19; also CBurney, Christ as the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#913;&#961;&#967;&#8053;</font> of Creation: JTS 27, 1926, 160-77).&#8221; Such a meaning is unlikely here, however, since the connections described above are much more probable.</p>
