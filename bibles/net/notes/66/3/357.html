<A NAME="357"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=211><b>tn</b> This is the literal meaning of the Greek verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#956;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">emew</font>). It is usually translated with a much weaker term like &#8220;spit out&#8221; due to the unpleasant connotations of the English verb &#8220;vomit,&#8221; as noted by L&amp;N 23.44. The situation confronting the Laodicean church is a dire one, however, and such a term is necessary if the modern reader is to understand the gravity of the situation.</p>
