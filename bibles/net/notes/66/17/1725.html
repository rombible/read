<A NAME="1725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=870><b>tn</b> It is important to note that the height of &#8220;mountains&#8221; versus &#8220;hills&#8221; or other topographical terms is somewhat relative. In terms of Palestinian topography, Mount Tabor (traditionally regarded as the mount of transfiguration) is some 1,800 ft (550 m) above sea level, while the Mount of Olives is only some 100 ft (30 m) higher than Jerusalem.</p>
