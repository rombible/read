<A NAME="1516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=762><b>sn</b> <i>Because you alone are holy. </i>In the Greek text the sentence literally reads &#8220;because alone holy.&#8221; Three points can be made in connection with John&#8217;s language here: (1) Omitting the second person, singular verb &#8220;you are&#8221; lays stress on the attribute of God&#8217;s holiness. (2) The juxtaposition of <i>alone</i> with <i>holy</i> stresses the unique nature of God&#8217;s holiness and complete &#8220;otherness&#8221; in relationship to his creation. It is not just moral purity which is involved in the use of the term <i>holy</i>, though it certainly includes that. It is also the pervasive OT idea that although God is deeply involved in the governing of his creation, he is to be regarded as separate and distinct from it. (3) John&#8217;s use of the term <i>holy </i>is also intriguing since it is the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Josios</font>) and not the more common NT term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7941;&#947;&#953;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jagios</font>). The former term evokes images of Christ&#8217;s messianic status in early Christian preaching. Both Peter in Acts 2:27 and Paul in Acts 13:35 apply Psalm 16:10 (LXX) to Jesus, referring to him as the &#8220;holy one&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#962;</font>). It is also the key term in Acts 13:34 (Isa 55:3 [LXX]) where it refers to the &#8220;holy blessings&#8221; (i.e., forgiveness and justification) brought about through Jesus in fulfillment of Davidic promise. Thus, in Rev 15:3-4, when John refers to God as &#8220;holy,&#8221; using the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#962;</font> in a context where the emphasis is on both God and Christ, there might be an implicit connection between divinity and the Messiah. This is bolstered by the fact that the Lamb is referred to in other contexts as the King of Kings and Lord of Lords (cf. 1:5; 17:14; 19:16 and perhaps 11:15; G. K. Beale, <i>Revelation </i>[NIGTC], 796-97).</p>
