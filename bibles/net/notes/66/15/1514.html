<A NAME="1514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=760><b>tc</b> Certain <sc>mss (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>47</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>*<sup>,2</sup> C 1006 1611 1841 <i>pc</i>) read &#8220;ages&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#7984;&#8061;&#957;&#969;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">aiwnwn</font>) instead of &#8220;nations&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#952;&#957;&#8182;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">eqnwn</font>), which itself is supported by several <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>1</sup> A 051 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>). The ms evidence seems to be fairly balanced, though <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#7984;&#8061;&#957;&#969;&#957;</font> has somewhat better support. The replacement of &#8220;ages&#8221; with &#8220;nations&#8221; is possibly a scribal attempt to harmonize this verse with the use of &#8220;nations&#8221; in the following verse. On the other hand, the idea of &#8220;nations&#8221; fits well with v. 4 and it may be that &#8220;ages&#8221; is a scribal attempt to assimilate this text to 1 Tim 1:17: &#8220;the king of the ages&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#946;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#8058;&#962; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#945;&#7984;&#8061;&#957;&#969;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">basileu&quot; twn aiwnwn</font>). The decision is a difficult one since both scenarios deal well with the evidence, though the verbal parallel with 1 Tim 1:17 is exact while the parallel with v. 4 is not. The term &#8220;king&#8221; occurs 17 other times (most occurrences refer to earthly kings) in Revelation and it is not used with either &#8220;ages&#8221; or &#8220;nations&#8221; apart from this verse. Probably the reading &#8220;nations&#8221; should be considered original due to the influence of 1 Tim 1:17.</p>
