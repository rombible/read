<A NAME="1521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=767><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the temple of the tent of the testimony&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#957;&#945;&#972;&#962; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#963;&#954;&#951;&#957;&#8134;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jo naos ths skhnhs tou marturiou</font>). The genitive &#8220;of the tent&#8221; is probably an appositional genitive and should be rendered as &#8220;the temple, which is the tent.&#8221; The entire expression, then, would be &#8220;the temple which is the tent of testimony,&#8221; that is, &#8220;the heavenly equivalent of the tent or tabernacle that was with Israel in the wilderness&#8221; (G. K. Beale, <i>Revelation </i>[NIGTC], 801-2). </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In the OT the expression &#8220;tent of the testimony&#8221; occurs frequently (130 times in Exodus through Deuteronomy). The &#8220;testimony&#8221; refers to the ten commandments, i.e., the revelation of the righteous will of God (Exod 16:34; 25:21; 31:18; 32:15; 40:24). It is little wonder that the wrath of God upon an unrighteous, lawbreaking humanity follows in John&#8217;s description.</p>
