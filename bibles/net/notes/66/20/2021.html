<A NAME="2021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1038><b>tn</b> On the phrase &#8220;broad plain of the earth&#8221; BDAG 823 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#955;&#940;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font> states, &#8220;<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8056; &#960;&#955;&#940;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#947;&#8134;&#962;</font> Rv 20:9 comes fr. the OT (Da 12:2 LXX. Cp. Hab 1:6; Sir 1:3), but the sense is not clear: <i>breadth = the broad plain of the earth</i> is perh. meant to provide room for the countless enemies of God vs. 8, but the &#8216;going up&#8217; is better suited to Satan (vs. 7) who has recently been freed, and who comes up again fr. the abyss (vs. 3).&#8221; The referent here thus appears to be a plain large enough to accommodate the numberless hoards that have drawn up for battle against the Lord Christ and his saints.</p>
