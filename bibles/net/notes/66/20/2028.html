<A NAME="2028"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1045><b>tn</b> The verb in this clause is elided. In keeping with the previous past tenses some translations supply a past tense verb here (&#8220;were&#8221;), but in view of the future tense that follows (&#8220;they will be tormented&#8221;), a present tense verb was used to provide a transition from the previous past tense to the future tense that follows.</p>
