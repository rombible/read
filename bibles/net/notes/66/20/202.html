<A NAME="202"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1019><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;holding&#8221; is implied. The two clauses &#8220;having the key of the abyss&#8221; and &#8220;a huge chain in his hand&#8221; can be construed in two ways: (1) both are controlled by the participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#967;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">econta</font>) and both are modified by the phrase &#8220;in his hand&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;having in his hand the key to the abyss and a huge chain.&#8221; (2) The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#967;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;</font> refers only to the key, and the phrase &#8220;in his hand&#8221; refers only to the chain &#8211; &#8220;having the key of the abyss and holding a huge chain in his hand.&#8221; Because of the stylistic tendency in Rev to use the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#967;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ecw</font>) to mean &#8220;hold (something)&#8221; and the phrase &#8220;in his hand&#8221; forming a &#8220;bracket&#8221; along with the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#967;&#969;</font> around both the phrases in question, the first option is preferred.</p>
