<A NAME="2238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1167><b>tc</b> Most <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>) read &#8220;amen&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">amhn</font>) after &#8220;all&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">pantwn</font>). It is, however, not found in other important <sc>mss (A 1006 1841 <i>pc</i>). It is easier to account for its addition than its omission from the text if original. Such a conclusion is routinely added by scribes to NT books because a few of these books originally had such an ending (cf. Rom 16:27; Gal 6:18; Jude 25). A majority of Greek witnesses have the concluding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> in every NT book except Acts, James, and 3 John (and even in these books, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> is found in some witnesses). It is thus a predictable variant.</p>
