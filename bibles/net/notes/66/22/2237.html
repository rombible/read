<A NAME="2237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1166><b>tc</b> The <i>Textus Receptus</i>, on which the KJV rests, reads &#8220;the book&#8221; of life (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#946;&#943;&#946;&#955;&#959;&#965;</font>, <font face="Greektl">apo biblou</font>) instead of &#8220;the tree&#8221; of life. When the Dutch humanist Desiderius Erasmus translated the NT he had access to no Greek <sc>mss for the last six verses of Revelation. So he translated the Latin Vulgate back into Greek at this point. As a result he created seventeen textual variants which were not in any Greek <sc>mss. The most notorious of these is this reading. It is thus decidedly inauthentic, while &#8220;the tree&#8221; of life, found in the best and virtually all Greek <sc>mss, is clearly authentic. The confusion was most likely due to an intra-Latin switch: The form of the word for &#8220;tree&#8221; in Latin in this passage is <i>ligno</i>; the word for &#8220;book&#8221; is <i>libro</i>. The two-letter difference accounts for an accidental alteration in some Latin <sc>mss; that &#8220;book of life&#8221; as well as &#8220;tree of life&#8221; is a common expression in the Apocalypse probably accounts for why this was not noticed by Erasmus or the KJV translators. (This textual problem is not discussed in NA<sup>27</sup>.)</p>
