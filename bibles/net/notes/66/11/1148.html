<A NAME="1148"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=564><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;the time has come&#8221; do not occur except at the beginning of the verse; the phrase has been repeated for emphasis and contrast. The Greek has one finite verb (&#8220;has come&#8221;) with a compound subject (&#8220;your wrath,&#8221; &#8220;the time&#8221;), followed by three infinitive clauses (&#8220;to be judged,&#8221; &#8220;to give,&#8221; &#8220;to destroy&#8221;). The rhetorical power of the repetition of the finite verb in English thus emulates the rhetorical power of its lone instance in Greek.</p>
