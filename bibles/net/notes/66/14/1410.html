The problem that its inclusion represents is that there is no reference to any other angel in the immediate context (the last mention was in 11:15). In this instance, the longer reading is harder. The word was probably intentionally omitted in order to resolve the tension; less likely, it might have been accidentally omitted since its spelling is similar to &#8220;angel&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">angelos</font>).</p>
