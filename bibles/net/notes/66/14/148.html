<A NAME="148"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=686><b>tc</b> Several <sc>mss (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>47</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> 1 1006 1611 2351 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font><sup>K</sup> <i>pc</i>) have the conjunction &#8220;for&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#940;&#961;</font>, <font face="Greektl">gar</font>) here so that the phrase reads: &#8220;<i>for </i>they are blameless.&#8221; Other important <sc>mss (A C P 1854 2053 <i>al </i>lat) lack the word. The shorter reading is to be preferred since the scribes were more likely to make the connection explicit through the addition of &#8220;for&#8221; than they would have been to omit the conjunction. As it is, the passage without the conjunction makes good sense and evokes a very somber tone.</p>
