<A NAME="1418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=696><b>tc</b> There are several different variants comprising a textual problem involving &#8220;second&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#949;&#973;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">deuteros</font>). First, several <sc>mss (A 1 2329 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font><sup>K</sup>) read &#8220;another, a second angel&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#962; &#948;&#949;&#973;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#962; &#7940;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">allo&quot; deutero&quot; angelo&quot;</font>). Second, other <sc>mss (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>47</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* 1006 1841 1854 <i>pc</i>) read just &#8220;another, a second&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#962; &#948;&#949;&#973;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#962;</font>). Third, the reading &#8220;another angel&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#962; &#7940;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font>) is supported by a few Greek <sc>mss and some versional evidence (69 <i>pc</i> ar vg). Fourth, several <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2 </sup>[C reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#949;&#973;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;</font> instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#949;&#973;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#962;</font>] 051 1611 2053 2344 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font><sup>A</sup>) support the reading &#8220;another, a second angel&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#962; &#7940;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#959;&#962; &#948;&#949;&#973;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#962;</font>). The reading that most likely gave rise to the others is the fourth. The first reading attempts to smooth out the grammar by placing the adjective in front of the noun. The second reading may have dropped out the &#8220;angel&#8221; on the basis of its similarity to &#8220;another&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font>). The third reading either intentionally or accidentally left out the word &#8220;second.&#8221; In any event, this is weakly attested and should not be given much consideration. (If, however, this reading had had good support, with &#8220;second&#8221; floating, and with &#8220;third&#8221; in the text in 14:9, one could possibly see <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#949;&#973;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#962;</font> as a motivated reading. But without sufficient support for the third reading, the one thing that is most certain is that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#949;&#973;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#962;</font> was part of the original text here.) It is difficult to account for the rise of the other readings if &#8220;second&#8221; is not original. And the undisputed use of &#8220;third&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#961;&#943;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">tritos</font>) in 14:9 may be another indicator that the adjective &#8220;second&#8221; was in the original text. Finally, the fourth reading is the more difficult and therefore, in this case, to be accepted as the progenitor of the others.</p>
