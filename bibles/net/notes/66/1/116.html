Its inclusion, as supported by the bulk of the Byzantine witnesses, is clearly secondary and a scribal attempt to achieve two things: (1) to make explicit the referent in the passage, namely, God, and (2) to smooth out the grammar. The preposition &#8220;from&#8221; in Greek required a noun in the genitive case. But here in Rev 1:4 the words following the preposition &#8220;from&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#972;</font>) are in another case, i.e., the nominative. There are two principal ways in which to deal with this grammatical anomaly. First, it could be a mistake arising from someone who just did not know Greek very well, or as a Jew, was heavily influenced by a Semitic form of Greek. Both of these unintentional errors are unlikely here. Commenting on this <i>ExSyn</i> 63 argues: &#8220;Either of these is doubtful here because (1) such a flagrant misunderstanding of the rudiments of Greek would almost surely mean that the author could not compose in Greek, yet the Apocalypse itself argues against this; (2) nowhere else does the Seer [i.e., John] use a nom. immediately after a preposition (in fact, he uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#972;</font> 32 times with the gen. immediately following).&#8221; The passage appears to be an allusion to Exod 3:14 (in the LXX) where God refers to himself as &#8220;he who is&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#8036;&#957;</font>), the same wording in Greek as here in Rev 1:4. Thus, it appears that John is wanting to leave the divine name untouched (perhaps to allude to God&#8217;s immutability, or as a pointer to the Old Testament as the key to unlocking the meaning of this book), irrespective of what it &#8220;looks&#8221; like grammatically. The translation has placed the &#8220;he who is&#8221; in quotation marks to indicate to the reader that the syntactical awkwardness is intentional. (For further comments, see <i>ExSyn</i> 63).</p>
