<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;slaves.&#8221; Although this translation frequently renders <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">doulos</font>) as &#8220;slave,&#8221; the connotation is often of one who has sold himself into slavery; in a spiritual sense, the idea is that of becoming a slave of God or of Jesus Christ voluntarily. The voluntary notion is not conspicuous here; hence, the translation &#8220;servants.&#8221; In any case, the word does not bear the connotation of a free individual serving another. BDAG notes that &#8220;&#8216;servant&#8217; for &#8216;slave&#8217; is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times&#8230;in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished&#8221; (BDAG 260 s.v.). The most accurate translation is &#8220;bondservant&#8221; (sometimes found in the ASV for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font>), in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another. But as this is archaic, few today understand its force.</p>
