Zerwick&#8217;s &#8220;general&#8221; genitive [<i>Biblical Greek</i>,<i> </i>§§36-39]; D. B. Wallace&#8217;s &#8220;plenary&#8221; genitive [<i>ExSyn</i> 119-21]). In 1:1 and 22:16 it is clear that Jesus has sent his angel to proclaim the message to John; thus the message is from Christ, and this would be a subjective genitive. On a broader scale, though, the revelation is about Christ, so this would be an objective genitive. One important point to note is that the phrase under consideration is best regarded as the title of the book and therefore refers to the whole of the work in all its aspects. This fact favors considering this as a plenary genitive.</p>
