Internally, it seems that the reading &#8220;washed&#8221; could have arisen in at least one of three ways: (1) as an error of hearing (both &#8220;released&#8221; and &#8220;washed&#8221; are pronounced similarly in Greek); (2) an error of sight (both &#8220;released&#8221; and &#8220;washed&#8221; look very similar &#8211; a difference of only one letter &#8211; which could have resulted in a simple error during the copying of a ms); (3) through scribal inability to appreciate that the Hebrew preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;</font> can be used with a noun to indicate the price paid <i>for </i>something. Since the author of Revelation is influenced significantly by a Semitic form of Greek (e.g., 13:10), and since the Hebrew preposition &#8220;in&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;</font>) can indicate the price paid <i>for</i> something, and is often translated with the preposition &#8220;in&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">en</font>) in the LXX, the author may have tried to communicate by the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;</font> the idea of a price paid for something. That is, John was trying to say that Christ delivered us at the price of his own blood. This whole process, however, may have been lost on a later scribe, who being unfamiliar with Hebrew, found the expression &#8220;<i>delivered in</i> his blood&#8221; too difficult, and noticing the obvious similarities between <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#953;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#953;</font>, assumed an error and then proceeded to change the text to &#8220;washed in his blood&#8221; &#8211; a thought more tolerable in his mind. Both readings, of course, are true to scripture; the current question is what the author wrote in this verse.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;and released us&#8221; (L&amp;N 37.127).</p>
