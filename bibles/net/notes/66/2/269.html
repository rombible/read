<A NAME="269"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=131><b>sn</b> <i>Jezebel </i>was the name of King Ahab&#8217;s idolatrous and wicked queen in 1 Kgs 16:31; 18:1-5; 19:1-3; 21:5-24. It is probable that the individual named here was analogous to her prototype in idolatry and immoral behavior, since those are the items singled out for mention.</p>
