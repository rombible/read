<A NAME="23"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=65><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;These things says [the One]&#8230;&#8221; The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#940;&#948;&#949; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">tade legei</font>) occurs eight times in the NT, seven of which are in Rev 2-3. &#8220;The pronoun is used to add solemnity to the prophetic utterance that follows. &#8230;In classical drama, it was used to introduce a new actor to the scene (Smyth, <i>Greek Grammar</i>, 307 [§1241]). But the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#940;&#948;&#949; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953;</font> formula in the NT derives from the OT, where it was used to introduce a prophetic utterance (BAGD, s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#948;&#949;</font>, 1)&#8221; (<i>ExSyn</i> 328). Thus, the translation &#8220;this is the solemn pronouncement of&#8221; for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#940;&#948;&#949; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953;</font> is very much in keeping with the OT connotations of this expression.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The expression <i>This is the solemn pronouncement of</i> reflects an OT idiom. The LXX has the same Greek phrase (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#940;&#948;&#949; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953;</font>, <font face="Greektl">tade legei</font>) about 350 times, with nearly 320 of them having &#8220;the Lord&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;</font>, Yahweh) as subject. That the author of Revelation would use such an expression seven times with the risen Christ as the speaker may well imply something of Christ&#8217;s sovereignty and deity. Cf. also Acts 21:11 in which the Holy Spirit is the speaker of this expression.</p>
