<A NAME="257"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=119><b>tn</b> On the interpretation of the stone, L&amp;N 2.27 states, &#8220;A number of different suggestions have been made as to the reference of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#968;&#8134;&#966;&#959;&#962;</font> in this context. Some scholars believe that the white <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#968;&#8134;&#966;&#959;&#962;</font> indicates a vote of acquittal in court. Others contend that it is simply a magical amulet; still others, a token of Roman hospitality; and finally, some have suggested that it may represent a ticket to the gladiatorial games, that is to say, to martyrdom. The context, however, suggests clearly that this is something to be prized and a type of reward for those who have &#8216;won the victory.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
