But internally, it gains strength. The longer reading implies the idea that the angel in 2:18 is the bishop or leader of the church in Thyatira. The pronoun &#8220;your&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#959;&#965;</font>) is used four times in vv. 19-20 and may have been the cause for the scribe copying it again. Further, once the monarchical episcopate was in vogue (beginning in the 2nd century) scribes might have been prone to add &#8220;your&#8221; here.</p>
