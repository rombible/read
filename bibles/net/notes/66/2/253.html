<A NAME="253"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=115><b>tc</b> The &#8220;therefore&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">oun</font>) is not found in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> 2053 2329 2351 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font><sup>A</sup><i> </i>or the Latin <sc>mss. It is, however, included in impressive witnesses such as {A C 046 1006 1611 sy<sup>p,h</sup> co}. Though the conjunction looks at first glance like a scribal clarification, its omission may be explained on the basis of its similarity to the last three letters of the verb &#8220;repent&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#957;&#972;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">metanohson</font>; since <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</font> is a postpositive conjunction in Greek, the final three letters of the verb [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">-&#963;&#959;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">-son</font>] would have been immediately followed by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#965;&#957;</font>). A scribe could have simply passed over the conjunction in his copy when he saw the last three letters of the imperative verb. A decision is difficult, however, because of the motivation to add to the text and the quality of witnesses that lack the conjunction. </p>
