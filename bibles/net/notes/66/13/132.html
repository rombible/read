<A NAME="132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=625><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;having&#8221; (a continuation of the previous sentence). All of the pronouns referring to this beast (along with the second beast appearing in 13:11) could be translated as &#8220;it&#8221; because the word for beast (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#951;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">qhrion</font>) is neuter gender in Greek and all the pronouns related to it are parsed as neuter in the Gramcord/Accordance database. Nevertheless, most interpreters would agree that the beast ultimately represents a human ruler, so beginning at the end of v. 4 the masculine pronouns (&#8220;he,&#8221; &#8220;him,&#8221; etc.) are used to refer to the first beast as well as the second beast appearing in 13:11.</p>
