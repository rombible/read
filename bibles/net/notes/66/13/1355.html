<A NAME="1355"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=678><b>tc</b> A few <sc>mss (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>115</sup> C, along with a few <sc>mss known to Irenaeus {and two minuscule <sc>mss, 5 and 11, no longer extant}), read 616 here, and several other witnesses have other variations. Irenaeus&#8217; mention of <sc>mss that have 616 is balanced by his rejection of such witnesses in this case. As intriguing as the reading 616 is (since the conversion of Nero Caesar&#8217;s name in Latin by way of gematria would come out to 616), it must remain suspect because such a reading seems motivated in that it conforms more neatly to Nero&#8217;s gematria.</p>
