<A NAME="1329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=652><b>tc</b> Many <sc>mss (C 051* 2351 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font><sup>A</sup><i> pc</i>) read &#8220;if anyone <i>will kill</i> with the sword, <i>it is necessary</i> for him to be killed with the sword&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7988; &#964;&#953;&#962; &#7952;&#957; &#956;&#945;&#967;&#945;&#943;&#961;&#8131; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#964;&#949;&#957;&#949;&#8150;</font>,<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"><i> </i>&#948;&#949;&#8150; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#7952;&#957; &#956;&#945;&#967;&#945;&#943;&#961;&#8131; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#964;&#945;&#957;&#952;&#8134;&#957;&#945;&#953;</font>). Other <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> 1006 1611* 1854<i> al</i>) are similar except that they read a present tense &#8220;kills&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#957;&#949;&#953;</font>, <font face="Greektl">apokteinei</font>) in this sentence. Both of these variants may be regarded as essentially saying the same thing. On the other hand, codex A reads &#8220;if anyone is to be killed by the sword, he is to be killed by the sword&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7988; &#964;&#953;&#962; &#7952;&#957; &#956;&#945;&#967;&#945;&#943;&#961;&#8131; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#964;&#945;&#957;&#952;&#8134;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#7952;&#957; &#956;&#945;&#967;&#945;&#943;&#961;&#8131; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#964;&#945;&#957;&#952;&#8134;&#957;&#945;&#953;</font>). Thus the first two variants convey the idea of retribution, while the last variant, supported by codex A, does not. (There are actually a dozen variants here, evidence that scribes found the original text quite difficult. Only the most important variants are discussed in this note.) The first two variants seem to be in line with Jesus&#8217; comments in Matt 26:52: &#8220;everyone who takes up the sword will die by the sword.&#8221; The last variant, however, seems to be taking up an idea found in Jer 15:2: &#8220;Those destined for death, to death; those for the sword, to the sword; those for starvation, to starvation; those for captivity, to captivity.&#8221; Though G. B. Caird, <i>Revelation </i>(HNTC), 169-70, gives four arguments in favor of the first reading (i.e., &#8220;whoever kills with the sword must with the sword be killed&#8221;), the arguments he puts forward can be read equally as well to support the latter alternative. In the end, the reading in codex A seems to be original. The fact that this sentence seems to be in parallel with 10a (which simply focuses on God&#8217;s will and suffering passively and is therefore akin to the reading in codex A), and that it most likely gave rise to the others as the most difficult reading, argues for its authenticity.</p>
