<A NAME="1310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=633><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;killed to death,&#8221; an expression emphatic in its redundancy. The phrase behind this translation is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8033;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#966;&#945;&#947;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jw&quot; ejsfagmenon</font>). The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8033;&#962;</font> is used in Greek generally for comparison, and in Revelation it is used often to describe the appearance of what the author saw. In this instance, the appearance of the beast&#8217;s head did not match reality, because the next phrase shows that in fact it did not die. This text does not affirm that the beast died and was resurrected, but some draw this conclusion because of the only other use of the phrase, which refers to Jesus in 5:6.</p>
