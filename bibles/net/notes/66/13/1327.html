<A NAME="1327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=650><b>tn</b> The prepositional phrase &#8220;since the foundation of the world&#8221; is traditionally translated as a modifier of the immediately preceding phrase in the Greek text, &#8220;the Lamb who was killed&#8221; (so also G. B. Caird, <i>Revelation </i>[HNTC], 168), but it is more likely that the phrase &#8220;since the foundation of the world&#8221; modifies the verb &#8220;written&#8221; (as translated above). Confirmation of this can be found in Rev 17:8 where the phrase &#8220;written in the book of life since the foundation of the world&#8221; occurs with no ambiguity.</p>
