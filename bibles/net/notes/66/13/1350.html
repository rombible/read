<A NAME="1350"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=673><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;things&#8221; is not in the Greek text, but is implied. Direct objects were frequently omitted in Greek when clear from the context. In the context of buying and selling, food could be primarily in view, but the more general &#8220;things&#8221; was used in the translation because the context is not specific.</p>
