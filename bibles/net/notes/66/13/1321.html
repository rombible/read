<A NAME="1321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=644><b>tc</b> The reading &#8220;and his dwelling place&#8221; does not occur in codex C, but its omission is probably due to scribal oversight since the phrase has the same ending as the phrase before it, i.e., they both end in &#8220;his&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font>, <font face="Greektl">autou</font>). This is similar to the mistake this scribe made in 12:14 with the omission of the reading &#8220;and half a time&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7973;&#956;&#953;&#963;&#965; &#954;&#945;&#953;&#961;&#959;&#8166;</font>, <font face="Greektl">kai {hmisu kairou</font>). </p>
