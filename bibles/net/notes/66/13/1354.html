<A NAME="1354"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=677><b>tn</b> Grk &#8220;it is man&#8217;s number.&#8221; <i>ExSyn</i> 254 states &#8220;if <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#8061;&#960;&#959;&#965;</font> is generic, then the sense is, &#8216;It is [the] number of humankind.&#8217; It is significant that this construction fits Apollonius&#8217; Canon (i.e., both the head noun and the genitive are anarthrous), suggesting that if one of these nouns is definite, then the other is, too. Grammatically, those who contend that the sense is &#8216;it is [the] number of a man&#8217; have the burden of proof on them (for they treat the head noun, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#956;&#972;&#962;</font>, as definite and the genitive, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#8061;&#960;&#959;&#965;</font>, as indefinite &#8211; the rarest of all possibilities). In light of Johannine usage, we might also add Rev 16:18, where the Seer clearly uses the anarthrous <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;</font> in a generic sense, meaning &#8216;humankind.&#8217; The implications of this grammatical possibility, exegetically speaking, are simply that the number &#8216;666&#8217; is the number that represents humankind. Of course, an individual is in view, but his number may be the number representing all of humankind. Thus the Seer might be suggesting here that the antichrist, who is the best representative of humanity without Christ (and the best counterfeit of a perfect man that his master, that old serpent, could muster), is still less than perfection (which would have been represented by the number seven).&#8221; See G. K. Beale, <i>Revelation</i>, [NIGTC], 723-24, who argues for the &#8220;generic&#8221; understanding of the noun; for an indefinite translation, see the ASV and ESV which both translate the clause as &#8220;it is the number of a man.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The translation <i>man&#8217;s number</i> suggests that the beast&#8217;s number is symbolic of humanity in general, while the translation <i>a man&#8217;s number</i> suggests that it represents an individual.</p>
