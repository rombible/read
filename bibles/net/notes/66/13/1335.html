<A NAME="1335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=658><b>tn</b> Or perhaps, &#8220;like a ram.&#8221; Here L&amp;N 4.25 states, &#8220;In the one context in the NT, namely, Re 13:11, in which <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#961;&#957;&#943;&#959;&#957;</font> refers literally to a sheep, it is used in a phrase referring to the horns of an <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#961;&#957;&#943;&#959;&#957;</font>. In such a context the reference is undoubtedly to a &#8216;ram,&#8217; that is to say, the adult male of sheep.&#8221; In spite of this most translations render the word &#8220;lamb&#8221; here to maintain the connection between this false lamb and the true Lamb of the Book of Revelation, Jesus Christ.</p>
