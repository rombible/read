<A NAME="1323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=646><b>tc</b> Many <sc>mss omit the phrase &#8220;it was given to make war with the saints and to overcome them&#8221; (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>47 </sup>A C 2053 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font><sup>A</sup><i> </i>sa).

Although the ms evidence is somewhat in favor of the shorter reading, the support of <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>115</sup> (a recently-discovered ms) for the longer reading balances things out. Normally, the shorter reading should be given preference. However, in an instance in which homoioteleuton could play a role, caution must be exercised. In this passage, accidental omission is quite likely. That this could have happened seems apparent from the two occurrences of the identical phrase &#8220;and it was given to him&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7952;&#948;&#972;&#952;&#951; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</font>, <font face="Greektl">kai edoqh autw</font>) in v. 7.
