<A NAME="1650"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=821><b>sn</b> These lines are parenthetical, forming an aside to the narrative. The speaker here is the Lord Jesus Christ himself rather than the narrator. Many interpreters have seen this verse as so abrupt that it could not be an original part of the work, but the author has used such asides before (1:7; 14:13) and the suddenness here (on the eve of Armageddon) is completely parallel to Jesus&#8217; warning in Mark 13:15-16 and parallels.</p>
