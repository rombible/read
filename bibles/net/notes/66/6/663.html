<A NAME="663"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=364><b>tn</b> It is difficult to say where this quotation ends. The translation ends it after &#8220;withstand it&#8221; at the end of v. 17, but it is possible that it should end here, after &#8220;Lamb&#8221; at the end of v. 16. If it ends after &#8220;Lamb,&#8221; v. 17 is a parenthetical explanation by the author.</p>
