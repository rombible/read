<A NAME="517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=274><b>tc</b> There is good ms evidence for the inclusion of &#8220;seven&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7953;&#960;&#964;&#940;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jepta</font>; <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>24</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> 2053 2351 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font><sup>K</sup>). There is equally good ms support for the omission of the term (A 1006 1611 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font><sup>A</sup> <i>pc</i>). It may have been accidentally added due to its repeated presence in the immediately preceding phrases, or it may have been intentionally added to maintain the symmetry of the phrases or more likely to harmonize the phrase with 1:4; 3:1; 4:5. Or it may have been accidentally deleted by way of homoioteleuton (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8048; &#7953;&#960;&#964;&#940;</font>, <font face="Greektl">ta Jepta</font>). A decision is difficult in this instance. NA<sup>27</sup> also does not find the problem easy to solve, placing the word in brackets to indicate doubts as to its authenticity.</p>
