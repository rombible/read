<A NAME="53"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=260><b>tn</b> L&amp;N 6.55 states, &#8220;From the immediate context of Re 5:1 it is not possible to determine whether the scroll in question had seven seals on the outside or whether the scroll was sealed at seven different points. However, since according to chapter six of Revelation the seals were broken one after another, it would appear as though the scroll had been sealed at seven different places as it had been rolled up.&#8221;</p>
