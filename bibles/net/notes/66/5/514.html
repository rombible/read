<A NAME="514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=271><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;slaughtered&#8221;; traditionally, &#8220;slain.&#8221; The phrase behind this translation is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8033;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#966;&#945;&#947;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jw&quot; ejsfagmenon</font>). The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8033;&#962;</font> is used in Greek generally for comparison, and in Revelation it is used often to describe the appearance of what the author saw. This phrase does not imply that the Lamb &#8220;appeared to have been killed&#8221; but in reality was not, because the wider context of the NT shows that in fact the Lamb, i.e., Jesus, was killed. See 13:3 for the only other occurrence of this phrase in the NT.</p>
