<A NAME="189"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=898><b>tn</b> According to BDAG 949 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#964;&#961;&#8134;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#964;&#961;&#951;&#957;&#953;&#940;&#969;</font>, these terms can refer either to luxury or sensuality. In the context of Rev 18, however (as L&amp;N 88.254 indicate) the stress is on gratification of the senses by sexual immorality, so that meaning was emphasized in the translation here.</p>
