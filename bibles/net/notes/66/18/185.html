<A NAME="185"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=894><b>tc</b> There are several problems in this verse. It seems that according to the ms evidence the first two phrases (i.e., &#8220;and a haunt for every unclean spirit, and a haunt for every unclean bird&#8221; [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#966;&#965;&#955;&#945;&#954;&#8052; &#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#960;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#7936;&#954;&#945;&#952;&#940;&#961;&#964;&#959;&#965; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#966;&#965;&#955;&#945;&#954;&#8052; &#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#8000;&#961;&#957;&#941;&#959;&#965; &#7936;&#954;&#945;&#952;&#940;&#961;&#964;&#959;&#965;</font>, <font face="Greektl">kai fulakh panto&quot; pneumato&quot; akaqartou kai fulakh panto&quot; orneou akaqartou</font>]) are to be regarded as authentic, though there are some ms discrepancies. The similar beginnings (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#966;&#965;&#955;&#945;&#954;&#8052; &#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font>) and endings (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#954;&#945;&#952;&#940;&#961;&#964;&#959;&#965;</font>) of each phrase would easily account for some <sc>mss omitting one or the other phrase. The third phrase (&#8220;a haunt for every unclean animal&#8221; [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#966;&#965;&#955;&#945;&#954;&#8052; &#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#952;&#951;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965; &#7936;&#954;&#945;&#952;&#940;&#961;&#964;&#959;&#965;</font>, <font face="Greektl">kai fulakh panto&quot; qhriou akaqartou</font>]), however, is more problematic since it is missing in several important <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> C 051 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>). The passage as a whole, including the third phrase, seems to be an allusion to Isa 13:21 and 34:11. It seems reasonable, in such a case, to assume that since there is good ms evidence to support the third phrase (A 1611 2329 <i>al</i>), it probably dropped out of certain <sc>mss because of its similarity to the two preceding clauses. It is the presence of all three phrases in the original that most likely gave rise to the divergent ms evidence extant today.</p>
