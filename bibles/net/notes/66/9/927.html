<A NAME="927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=456><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;human faces.&#8221; The Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anqrwpos</font>) is often used in a generic sense, referring to both men and women. However, because &#8220;women&#8217;s hair&#8221; in the next clause suggests a possible gender distinction here, &#8220;men&#8217;s&#8221; was retained.</p>
