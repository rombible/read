<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Floor and wine-press do not delight them, And new wine doth  fail in her,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>They do not abide in the land of Jehovah, And turned back  hath Ephraim [to] Egypt, And in Asshur an unclean thing they  eat.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>They pour not out wine to Jehovah, Nor are they sweet to  Him, Their sacrifices [are] as bread of mourners to them, All  eating it are unclean: For their bread [is] for themselves, It  doth not come into the house of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>What do ye at the day appointed? And at the day of Jehovah&#8217;s  festival?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For, lo, they have gone because of destruction, Egypt  gathereth them, Moph burieth them, The desirable things of  their silver, Nettles possess them &#8212; a thorn [is] in their  tents.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Come in have the days of inspection, Come in have the days  of recompence, Israel doth know! a fool [is] the prophet, Mad  [is] the man of the Spirit, Because of the abundance of thine  iniquity, And great [is] the hatred.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Ephraim is looking [away] from My God, The prophet! a snare  of a fowler [is] over all his ways, Hatred [is] in the house of  his God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>They have gone deep &#8212; have done corruptly, As [in] the days  of Gibeah, He doth remember their iniquity, He doth inspect  their sins.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>As grapes in a wilderness I found Israel, As the  first-fruit in a fig-tree, at its beginning, I have seen your  fathers, They &#8212; they have gone in [to] Baal-Peor, And are  separated to a shameful thing, And are become abominable like  their love.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Ephraim [is] as a fowl, Fly away doth their honour, without  birth, And without womb, and without conception.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For though they nourish their sons, I have made them  childless &#8212; without man, Surely also, wo to them, when I turn  aside from them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Ephraim! when I have looked to the rock, Is planted in  comeliness, And Ephraim [is] to bring out unto a slayer his  sons.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Give to them, Jehovah &#8212; what dost Thou give? Give to them  miscarrying womb, and dry breasts.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>All their evil [is] in Gilgal, Surely there I have hated  them, Because of the evil of their doings, Out of My house I do  drive them, I add not to love them, all their heads [are]  apostates.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Ephraim hath been smitten, Their root hath dried up, fruit  they yield not, Yea, though they bring forth, I have put to  death the desired of their womb.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Reject them doth my God, Because they have not hearkened to  Him, And they are wanderers among nations!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
