<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And to slaughter sinners have gone deep, And I [am] a fetter  to them all.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>I have known Ephraim, And Israel hath not been hid from me,  For now thou hast gone a-whoring, Ephraim, Defiled is Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>They give not up their habitual doings, To turn back unto  their God, For a spirit of whoredoms [is] in their midst, And  Jehovah they have not known.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And humbled hath been the excellency of Israel to his face,  And Israel and Ephraim stumble by their iniquity, Stumbled also  hath Judah with them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>With their flock and with their herd, They go to seek  Jehovah, and do not find, He hath withdrawn from them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Against Jehovah they dealt treacherously, For strange sons  they have begotten, Now consume them doth a month [with] their  portions.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Blow ye a cornet in Gibeah, a trumpet in Ramah, Shout, O  Beth-Aven, after thee, O Benjamin.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Ephraim is for a desolation in a day of reproof, Among the  tribes of Israel I have made known a sure thing.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Princes of Judah have been as those removing a border, On  them I do pour out as water My wrath.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Oppressed is Ephraim, broken in judgment, When he pleased he  went after the command.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And I [am] as a moth to Ephraim, And as a rotten thing to  the house of Judah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And see doth Ephraim his sickness, and Judah his wound, And  Ephraim goeth unto Asshur, And sendeth unto a warlike king, And  he is not able to give healing to you, Nor doth he remove from  you a scar.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For I [am] as a lion to Ephraim, And as a young lion to the  house of Judah, I &#8212; I tear and go, I bear away, and there is  no deliverer.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>I go &#8212; I turn back unto My place, Till that they are  desolate, and have sought My face. In their distress they do  seek Me speedily!&#8217;</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
