<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And now do they add to sin, And make to them a molten image  of their silver, By their own understanding &#8212; idols, A work of  artizans &#8212; all of it, Of them they say, who [are] sacrificers  among men, &#8216;The calves let them kiss.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Therefore they are as a cloud of the morning, And as dew,  rising early, going away, As chaff tossed about out of a floor,  And as smoke out of a window.</p>
<p class="hdg">God's Anger</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And I [am] Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt, And a  God besides Me thou dost not know, And a Saviour &#8212; there is  none save Me.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And I am to them as a lion, As a leopard by the way I look  out.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>I do meet them as a bereaved bear, And I rend the enclosure  of their heart.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>I give to thee a king in Mine anger, And I take away in My  wrath.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>From the hand of Sheol I do ransom them, From death I  redeem them, Where [is] thy plague, O death? Where thy  destruction, O Sheol? Repentance is hid from Mine eyes.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Judgment on Samaria</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Though he among brethren produceth fruit, Come in doth an  east wind, a wind of Jehovah, From a wilderness it is coming  up, And it drieth up his fountain, And become dry doth his  spring, It &#8212; it spoileth a treasure &#8212; every desirable vessel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Become desolate doth Samaria, Because she hath rebelled  against her God, By sword they do fall, Their sucklings are  dashed in pieces, And its pregnant ones are ripped up!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
