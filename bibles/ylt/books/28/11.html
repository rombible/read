<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>They have called to them rightly, They have gone from  before them, To lords they do sacrifice, And to graven images  they make perfume.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And I have caused Ephraim to go on foot, Taking them by  their arms, And they have not known that I strengthened them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>With cords of man I do draw them, With thick cords of love,  And I am to them as a raiser up of a yoke on their jaws, And I  incline unto him &#8212; I feed [him].</p>

Do I deliver thee up, O  Israel? How do I make thee as Admah? Do I set thee as Zeboim?  Turned in Me is My heart, kindled together have been My  repentings.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>I do not the fierceness of My anger, I turn not back to  destroy Ephraim, For God I [am], and not a man. In thy midst  the Holy One, and I enter not in enmity,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>After Jehovah they go &#8212; as a lion He roareth, When He  doth roar, then tremble do the sons from the west.</p>
