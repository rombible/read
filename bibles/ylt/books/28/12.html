<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And a controversy hath Jehovah with Judah, To lay a charge  on Jacob according to his ways, According to his doings He  returneth to him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>In the womb he took his brother by the heel, And by his  strength he was a prince with God,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Yea, he is a prince unto the Messenger, And he overcometh  [by] weeping, And he maketh supplication to Him, At Bethel He  doth find him, And there He doth speak with us,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Even Jehovah, God of the Hosts, Jehovah [is] His memorial.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And thou, through thy God, dost turn, Kindness and judgment  keep thou, And wait on thy God continually.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Canaan! in his hand [are] balances of deceit! To oppress he  hath loved.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Ephraim saith: &#8216;Surely I have become rich, I have found  wealth for myself, All my labours &#8212; they find not against me  iniquity that [is] sin.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And I &#8212; Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt, Again do I  turn thee back into tents, As in the days of the appointed  time.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And I have spoken unto the prophets, And I have multiplied  vision, And by the hand of the prophets I use similes.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Surely Gilead [is] iniquity, Only, vanity they have been,  In Gilead bullocks they have sacrificed, Also their altars [are]  as heaps, on the furrows of a field.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And Jacob doth flee to the country of Aram, And Israel  doth serve for a wife, Yea, for a wife he hath kept watch.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And by a prophet hath Jehovah brought up Israel out of  Egypt, And by a prophet it hath been watched.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Ephraim hath provoked most bitterly, And his blood on  himself he leaveth, And his reproach turn back to him doth his  Lord!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
