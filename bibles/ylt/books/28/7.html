<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And they do not say to their heart, [That] all their evil I  have remembered, Now compassed them have their doings,  Over-against My face they have been.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>With their wickedness they make glad a king, And with their  lies &#8212; princes.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>All of them [are] adulterers, Like a burning oven of a  baker, He ceaseth from stirring up after kneading the dough,  till its leavening.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>A day of our king! Princes have polluted themselves [with]  the poison of wine, He hath drawn out his hand with scorners.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For they have drawn near, As an oven [is] their heart, In  their lying in wait all the night sleep doth their baker,  Morning! he is burning as a flaming fire.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>All of them are warm as an oven, And they have devoured  their judges, All their kings have fallen, There is none  calling unto Me among them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Ephraim! among peoples he mixeth himself, Ephraim hath been  a cake unturned.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Devoured have strangers his power, And he hath not known,  Also old age hath sprinkled [itself] on him, And he hath not  known.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And humbled hath been the excellency of Israel to his face,  And they have not turned back unto Jehovah their God, Nor have  they sought Him for all this.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And Ephraim is as a simple dove without heart, Egypt they  called on &#8212; [to] Asshur they have gone.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>When they go I spread over them My net, As the fowl of the  heavens I bring them down, I chastise them as their company  hath heard.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Wo to them, for they wandered from Me, Destruction to them,  for they transgressed against Me, And I &#8212; I ransom them, and  they have spoken lies against Me,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And have not cried unto Me with their heart, but howl on  their beds, For corn and new wine they assemble themselves,  They turn aside against Me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And I instructed &#8212; I strengthened their arms, And  concerning Me they think evil!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>They turn back &#8212; not to the Most High, They have been as a  deceitful bow, Fall by sword do their princes, From the  insolence of their tongue, This [is] their derision in the land  of Egypt!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
