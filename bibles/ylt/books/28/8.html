<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>To Me they cry, &#8216;My God, we &#8212; Israel &#8212; have known Thee.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Cast off good hath Israel, an enemy pursueth him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>They have made kings, and not by Me, They have made princes,  and I have not known, Their silver and their gold they have  made to them idols, So that they are cut off.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Cast off hath thy calf, O Samaria, Burned hath Mine anger  against them, Till when are they not capable of purity?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For even it [is] of Israel; an artificer made it, And it  [is] not God, For the calf of Samaria is fragments!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For wind they sow, and a hurricane they reap, Stalk it hath  none &#8212; a shoot not yielding grain, If so be it yield &#8212;  strangers do swallow it up.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Israel hath been swallowed up, Now they have been among  nations, As a vessel in which is no delight.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For they &#8212; they have gone up [to] Asshur, A wild ass alone  by himself [is] Ephraim, They have hired lovers!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Also though they hire among nations, Now I gather them, and  they are pained a little, From the burden of a king of princes.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Because Ephraim did multiply altars to sin, They have been  to him altars to sin.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>I write for him numerous things of My law, As a strange  thing they have been reckoned.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The sacrifices of Mine offerings! They sacrifice flesh, and  they eat, Jehovah hath not accepted them, Now doth He remember  their iniquity, And inspect their sin, They &#8212; [to] Egypt they  turn back.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And forget doth Israel his Maker, and buildeth temples, And  Judah hath multiplied cities of defence, And I have sent a fire  into his cities, And it hath consumed their palaces!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
