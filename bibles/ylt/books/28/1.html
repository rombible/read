<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The commencement of Jehovah&#8217;s speaking by Hosea. And Jehovah  saith unto Hosea, &#8216;Go, take to thee a woman of whoredoms, and  children of whoredoms, for utterly go a-whoring doth the land  from after Jehovah.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And he goeth and taketh Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she  conceiveth and beareth to him a son; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and Jehovah saith unto him, &#8216;Call his name Jezreel, for yet  a little, and I have charged the blood of Jezreel on the house  of Jehu, and have caused to cease the kingdom of the house of  Israel; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and it hath come to pass in that day that I have broken the  bow of Israel, in the valley of Jezreel.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And she conceiveth again, and beareth a daughter, and He  saith to him, &#8216;Call her name Lo-Ruhamah, for I add no more to  pity the house of Israel, for I do utterly take them away; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and the house of Judah I pity, and have saved them by  Jehovah their God, and do not save them by bow, and by sword,  and by battle, by horses, and by horsemen.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And she weaneth Lo-Ruhamah, and conceiveth, and beareth a  son; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and He saith, &#8216;Call his name Lo-Ammi, for ye [are] not My  people, and I am not for you;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and the number of the sons of Israel hath been as the sand  of the sea, that is not measured nor numbered, and it hath come  to pass in the place where it is said to them, Ye [are] not My  people, it is said to them, Sons of the Living God;</p>
