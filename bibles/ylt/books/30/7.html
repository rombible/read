<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and Jehovah saith unto me, &#8216;What art thou seeing, Amos?&#8217; And  I say, &#8216;A plumb-line;&#8217; and the Lord saith: &#8216;Lo, I am setting a  plumb-line in the midst of My people Israel, I do not add any  more to pass over to it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And desolated have been high places of Isaac, And  sanctuaries of Israel are wasted, And I have risen against the  house of Jeroboam with a sword.&#8217;</p>
<p class="hdg">Amaziah Accuses Amos</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And Amaziah priest of Beth-El sendeth unto Jeroboam king of  Israel, saying, &#8216;Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst  of the house of Israel; the land is not able to bear all his  words, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>for thus said Amos: By sword die doth Jeroboam, And Israel  certainly removeth from off its land.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And Amaziah saith unto Amos, &#8216;Seer, go flee for thee unto  the land of Judah, and eat there bread, and there thou dost  prophesy; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>and [at] Beth-El do not add to prophesy any more, for it  [is] the king&#8217;s sanctuary, and it [is] the royal house.&#8217;</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and Jehovah taketh me from after the flock, and Jehovah  saith unto me, Go, prophesy unto My people Israel.
