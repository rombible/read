<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Sworn hath the Lord Jehovah by His holiness, That lo, days  are coming upon you, And he hath taken you away with hooks, And  your posterity with fish-hooks.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And [by] breaches ye go forth, A woman [at that]  over-against her, And ye have cast down the high place, An  affirmation of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Enter ye Beth-El, and transgress, At Gilgal multiply  transgression, And bring in every morning your sacrifices,  Every third year your tithes.</p>

While yet  three months to harvest, And I have sent rain on one city, And  on another city I do not send rain, One portion is rained on,  And the portion on which it raineth not withereth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And wandered have two or three cities, Unto the same city to  drink water, And they are not satisfied, And ye have not turned  back unto Me, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>I have smitten you with blasting and with mildew, The  abundance of your gardens and of your vineyards, And of your  figs, and of your olives, Eat doth the palmer-worm, And ye have  not turned back unto Me, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p>
