<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Only you I have known of all families of the land, Therefore  I charge on you all your iniquities.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Do two walk together if they have not met?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Roar doth a lion in a forest and prey he hath none? Give out  doth a young lion his voice from his habitation, If he hath not  caught?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Doth a bird fall into a snare of the earth, And there is no  gin for it? Doth a snare go up from the ground, And prey it  captureth not?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Is a trumpet blown in a city, And do people not tremble? Is  there affliction in a city, And Jehovah hath not done [it]?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For the Lord Jehovah doth nothing, Except He hath revealed  His counsel unto His servants the prophets.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>A lion hath roared &#8212; who doth not fear? The Lord Jehovah  hath spoken &#8212; who doth not prophesy?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Sound ye unto palaces in Ashdod, And to palaces in the land  of Egypt, and say: Be ye gathered on mountains of Samaria, And  see many troubles within her, And oppressed ones in her midst. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And they have not known to act straightforwardly, An  affirmation of Jehovah, Who are treasuring up violence and  spoil in their palaces.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: An adversary &#8212; and  surrounding the land, And he hath brought down from thee thy  strength, And spoiled have been thy palaces.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Thus said Jehovah: As the shepherd delivereth from the  lion&#8217;s mouth Two legs, or a piece of an ear, So delivered are  the sons of Israel, Who are sitting in Samaria on the corner of  a bed, And in Damascus [on that of] a couch.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Hear ye and testify to the house of Jacob, An affirmation  of the Lord Jehovah, God of Hosts.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For in the day of My charging the transgressions of Israel  on him, I have laid a charge on the altars of Beth-El, And cut  off have been the horns of the altar, And they have fallen to  the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And I have smitten the winter-house with the summer-house,  And perished have houses of ivory, And consumed have been many  houses, An affirmation of Jehovah!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
