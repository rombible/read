<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And I have sent a fire against Moab, And it hath consumed  the palaces of Kerioth, And dying with noise is Moab, With  shouting, with voice of a trumpet.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And I have cut off a judge from her midst, And all its heads  I slay with him, said Jehovah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Thus said Jehovah: For three transgressions of Judah, And  for four, I do not reserve it, Because of their loathing the  law of Jehovah, And His statutes they have not kept, And their  lies do cause them to err, After which their fathers did walk,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And I have sent a fire against Judah, And it hath consumed  palaces of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Thus said Jehovah: For three transgressions of Israel, And  for four, I do not reverse it, Because of their selling for  silver the righteous, And the needy for a pair of sandals.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Who are panting for the dust of the earth on the head of the  poor, And the way of the humble they turn aside, And a man and  his father go unto the damsel, So as to pollute My holy name.</p>

<p class="hdg">The Ingratitude of Israel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And I &#8212; I have destroyed the Amorite from before them,  Whose height [is] as the height of cedars, And strong he [is]  as the oaks, And I destroy his fruit from above, And his roots  from beneath.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And I &#8212; I have brought you up from the land of Egypt, And  cause you to go in a wilderness forty years, To possess the  land of the Amorite.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And I raise of your sons for prophets, And of your choice  ones for Nazarites, Is not this true, O sons of Israel? An  affirmation of Jehovah.</p>
