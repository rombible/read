<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Pass ye over [to] Calneh and see, And go thence [to] Hamath  the great, And go down [to] Gath of the Philistines, Are [they]  better than these kingdoms? Greater [is] their border than your  border?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Who are putting away the day of evil, And ye bring nigh the  seat of violence,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Who are lying down on beds of ivory, And are spread out on  their couches, And are eating lambs from the flock, And calves  from the midst of the stall,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Who are taking part according to the psaltery, Like David  they invented for themselves instruments of music;</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And if there are left ten persons in one house, It hath come  to pass &#8212; that they have died. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And lifted him up hath his loved one, even his burner, To  bring forth the bones from the house, And he said to him who  [is] in the sides of the house, &#8216;Is there yet with thee?&#8217; And  he said, &#8216;None,&#8217; then he said, &#8216;Hush!
