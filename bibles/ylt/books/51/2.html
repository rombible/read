<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>that their hearts may be comforted, being united in love,  and to all riches of the full assurance of the understanding,  to the full knowledge of the secret of the God and Father, and  of the Christ, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>in whom are all the treasures of the wisdom and the  knowledge hid, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and this I say, that no one may beguile you in enticing  words, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>for if even in the flesh I am absent &#8212; yet in the spirit I  am with you, joying and beholding your order, and the  stedfastness of your faith in regard to Christ;</p>
<p class="hdg">Alive in Christ</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>as, then, ye did receive Christ Jesus the Lord, in him walk  ye, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>being rooted and built up in him, and confirmed in the  faith, as ye were taught &#8212; abounding in it in thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>See that no one shall be carrying you away as spoil through  the philosophy and vain deceit, according to the deliverance  of men, according to the rudiments of the world, and not  according to Christ, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>because in him doth tabernacle all the fulness of the  Godhead bodily, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and ye are in him made full, who is the head of all  principality and authority, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>in whom also ye were circumcised with a circumcision not  made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the sins of  the flesh in the circumcision of the Christ, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>being buried with him in the baptism, in which also ye rose  with [him] through the faith of the working of God, who did  raise him out of the dead.

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>having blotted out the handwriting in the ordinances that  is against us, that was contrary to us, and he hath taken it  out of the way, having nailed it to the cross; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>having stripped the principalities and the authorities, he  made a shew of them openly &#8212; having triumphed over them in it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Let no one, then, judge you in eating or in drinking, or in  respect of a feast, or of a new moon, or of sabbaths, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>which are a shadow of the coming things, and the body [is]  of the Christ; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>let no one beguile you of your prize, delighting in  humble-mindedness and [in] worship of the messengers, intruding  into the things he hath not seen, being vainly puffed up by the  mind of his flesh, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>and not holding the head, from which all the body &#8212;  through the joints and bands gathering supply, and being knit  together &#8212; may increase with the increase of God.</p>
