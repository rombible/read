<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and the Philistines call for priests and for diviners,  saying, &#8216;What do we do to the ark of Jehovah? let us know  wherewith we send it to its place?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And they say, &#8216;If ye are sending away the ark of the God of  Israel, ye do not send it away empty; for ye do certainly send  back to Him a guilt-offering; then ye are healed, and it hath  been known to you why His hand doth not turn aside from you.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And they say, &#8216;What [is] the guilt-offering which we send  back to Him?&#8217; and they say, &#8216;The number of the princes of the  Philistines &#8212; five golden emerods, and five golden mice &#8212; for one  plague [is] to you all, and to your princes, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and ye have made images of your emerods, and images of your  mice that are corrupting the land, and have given honour to the  God of Israel; it may be He doth lighten His hand from off you,  and from off your gods, and from off your land; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and why do ye harden your heart as the Egyptians and Pharaoh  hardened their heart? do they not &#8212; when He hath rolled Himself  upon them &#8212; send them away, and they go? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8216;And now, take and make one new cart, and two suckling kine,  on which a yoke hath not gone up, and ye have bound the kine in  the cart, and caused their young ones to turn back from after  them to the house, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and ye have taken the ark of Jehovah, and put it on the  cart, and the vessels of gold which ye have returned to Him &#8212; a  guilt-offering &#8212; ye put in a coffer on its side, and have sent  it away, and it hath gone; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and ye have seen, if the way of its own border it goeth up  to Beth-Shemesh &#8212; He hath done to us this great evil; and if  not, then we have known that His hand hath not come against us;  an accident it hath been to us.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the men do so, and take two suckling kine, and bind  them in the cart, and their young ones they have shut up in the  house; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and they place the ark of Jehovah upon the cart, and the  coffer, and the golden mice, and the images of their emerods. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And the kine go straight in the way, on the way to  Beth-Shemesh, in one highway they have gone, going and lowing,  and have not turned aside right or left; and the princes of the  Philistines are going after them unto the border of  Beth-Shemesh.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And the Beth-Shemeshites are reaping their wheat-harvest in  the valley, and they lift up their eyes, and see the ark, and  rejoice to see [it]. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And the cart hath come in unto the field of Joshua the  Beth-Shemeshite, and standeth there, and there [is] a great  stone, and they cleave the wood of the cart, and the kine they  have caused to ascend &#8212; a burnt-offering to Jehovah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And the Levites have taken down the ark of Jehovah, and the  coffer which [is] with it, in which [are] the vessels of gold,  and place [them] on the great stone; and the men of  Beth-Shemesh have caused to ascend burnt-offerings and  sacrifice sacrifices in that day to Jehovah; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and the five princes of the Philistines have seen [it], and  turn back [to] Ekron, on that day.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And these [are] the golden emerods which the Philistines  have sent back &#8212; a guilt-offering to Jehovah: for Ashdod one,  for Gaza one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and the golden mice &#8212; the number of all the cities of the  Philistines &#8212; for the five princes, from the fenced city even  unto the hamlet of the villages, even unto the great meadow on  which they placed the ark of Jehovah &#8212; [are] unto this day in  the field of Joshua the Beth-Shemeshite.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And He smiteth among the men of Beth-Shemesh, for they  looked into the ark of Jehovah, yea, He smiteth among the  people seventy men &#8212; fifty chief men; and the people mourn,  because Jehovah smote among the people &#8212; a great smiting. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And the men of Beth-Shemesh say, &#8216;Who is able to stand  before Jehovah, this holy God? and unto whom doth He go up from  us?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And they send messengers unto the inhabitants of  Kirjath-Jearim, saying, &#8216;The Philistines have sent back the  ark of Jehovah; come down, take it up unto you.&#8217;</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
