<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Saul taketh three thousand chosen men out of all  Israel, and goeth to seek David and his men, on the front of  the rocks of the wild goats, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and he cometh in unto folds of the flock, on the way, and  there [is] a cave, and Saul goeth in to cover his feet; and  David and his men in the sides of the cave are abiding. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the men of David say unto him, &#8216;Lo, the day of which  Jehovah said unto thee, Lo, I am giving thine enemy into thy  hand, and thou hast done to him as it is good in thine eyes;&#8217;  and David riseth and cutteth off the skirt of the upper robe  which [is] on Saul &#8212; gently. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And it cometh to pass afterwards that the heart of David  smiteth him, because that he hath cut off the skirt which [is]  on Saul, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and he saith to his men, &#8216;Far be it from me, by Jehovah;  I do not do this thing to my lord &#8212; to the anointed of  Jehovah &#8212; to put forth my hand against him, for the anointed of  Jehovah he [is].&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And David subdueth his men by words, and hath not permitted  them to rise against Saul; and Saul hath risen from the cave,  and goeth on the way;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and David riseth afterwards, and goeth out from the cave,  and calleth after Saul, saying, &#8216;My lord, O king!&#8217; And Saul  looketh attentively behind him, and David boweth &#8212; face to the  earth &#8212; and doth obeisance. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And David saith to Saul, &#8216;Why dost thou hear the words of  man, saying, Lo, David is seeking thine evil? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Lo, this day have thine eyes seen how that Jehovah hath  given thee to-day into my hand in the cave; and [one] said to  slay thee, and [mine eye] hath pity on thee, and I say, I do  not put forth my hand against my lord, for the anointed of  Jehovah he [is]. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8216;And, my father, see, yea see the skirt of thine upper  robe in my hand; for by cutting off the skirt of thy upper  robe, and I have not slain thee, know and see that there is not  in my hand evil and transgression, and I have not sinned  against thee, and thou art hunting my soul to take it! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8216;Jehovah doth judge between me and thee, and Jehovah hath  avenged me of thee, and my hand is not on thee; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>as saith the simile of the ancients, From the wicked goeth  out wickedness, and my hand is not on thee. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8216;After whom hath the king of Israel come out? after whom  art thou pursuing? &#8212; after a dead dog! after one flea! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And Jehovah hath been for judge, and hath judged between  me and thee, yea, he seeth and pleadeth my cause, and doth  deliver me out of thy hand.&#8217;</p>
<p class="hdg">David's Oath to Saul</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And it cometh to pass, when David completeth to speak  these words unto Saul, that Saul saith, &#8216;Is this thy voice, my  son David?&#8217; and Saul lifteth up his voice, and weepeth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And he saith unto David, &#8216;More righteous thou [art] than  I; for thou hast done me good, and I have done thee evil; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and thou hast declared to-day how that thou hast done good  with me, how that Jehovah shut me up into thy hand, and thou  didst not slay me, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>and that a man doth find his enemy, and hath sent him away  in a good manner; and Jehovah doth repay thee good for that  which thou didst to me this day. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>&#8216;And, now, lo, I have known that thou dost certainly  reign, and the kingdom of Israel hath stood in thy hand; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>and, now, swear to me by Jehovah &#8212; thou dost not cut off my  seed after me, nor dost thou destroy my name from the house of  my father.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And David sweareth to Saul, and Saul goeth unto his  house, and David and his men have gone up unto the fortress.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
