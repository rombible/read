<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>There is none holy like Jehovah, For there is none save  Thee, And there is no rock like our God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Ye multiply not &#8212; ye speak haughtily &#8212; The old saying goeth  out from your mouth, For a God of knowledge [is] Jehovah, And  by Him actions are weighed.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>The feet of His saints He keepeth, And the wicked in  darkness are silent, For not by power doth man become mighty.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Jehovah &#8212; broken down are His adversaries, Against them in  the heavens He thundereth: Jehovah judgeth the ends of earth,  And giveth strength to His king, And exalteth the horn of His  anointed.&#8217;</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And the custom of the priests with the people [is]: any man  sacrificing a sacrifice &#8212; then hath the servant of the priest  come in when the flesh is boiling, and the hook of three teeth  in his hand, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and hath struck [it] into the pan, or kettle, or caldron,  or pot; all that the hook bringeth up doth the priest take for  himself; thus they do to all Israel who are coming in, there,  in Shiloh. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Also before they make perfume with the fat &#8212; then hath the  priest&#8217;s servant come in, and said to the man who is  sacrificing, &#8216;Give flesh to roast for the priest, and he doth  not take of thee flesh boiled, but raw;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and the man saith unto him, &#8216;Let them surely make a perfume  (as to-day) with the fat, then take to thee as thy soul  desireth;&#8217; and he hath said to him, &#8216;Surely now thou dost give;  and if not &#8212; I have taken by strength.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And the sin of the young men is very great [in] the  presence of Jehovah, for the men have despised the offering of  Jehovah.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Eli blessed Elkanah, and his wife, and said, &#8216;Jehovah  doth appoint for thee seed of this woman, for the petition  which she asked for Jehovah;&#8217; and they have gone to their  place.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Nay, my sons; for the report which I am hearing is not good  causing the people of Jehovah to transgress. &#8212;

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Why do ye kick at My sacrifice, and at Mine offering which  I commanded [in] My habitation, and dost honour thy sons above  Me, to make yourselves fat from the first part of every  offering of Israel, of My people?

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>and I have raised up for Me a stedfast priest; as in My  heart and in My soul he doth do; and I have built for him a  stedfast house, and he hath walked up and down before Mine  anointed all the days; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>and it hath been, every one who is left in thy house doth  come in to bow himself to him, for a wage of silver, and a cake  of bread, and hath said, Admit me, I pray thee, unto one of the  priest&#8217;s offices, to eat a morsel of bread.&#8217;</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
