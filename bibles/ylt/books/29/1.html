<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Concerning it to your sons talk ye, And your sons to their  sons, And their sons to another generation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>What is left of the palmer-worm, eaten hath the locust, And  what is left of the locust, Eaten hath the cankerworm, And what  is left of the cankerworm, Eaten hath the caterpillar.</p>
