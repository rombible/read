<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then I have gathered all the nations, And caused them to go  down unto the valley of Jehoshaphat, And I have been judged  with them there, Concerning My people and Mine inheritance &#8212;  Israel, Whom they scattered among nations, And My land they  have apportioned.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And for My people they do cast a lot, And they give the  young man for an harlot, And the young woman have sold for  wine, That they may drink.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And also, what [are] ye to Me, O Tyre and Zidon, And all  circuits of Philistia? Recompence are ye rendering unto Me? And  if ye are giving recompence to Me, Swiftly, hastily, I turn  back your recompence on your head. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>In that My silver and My gold ye took, And My desirable  things that are good, Ye have brought in to your temples. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And sons of Judah, and sons of Jerusalem, Ye have sold to  the sons of Javan, To put them far off from their border. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Lo, I am stirring them up out of the place Whither ye have  sold them, And I have turned back your recompence on your head, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And have sold your sons and your daughters Into the hand of  the sons of Judah, And they have sold them to Shabeans, Unto a  nation far off, for Jehovah hath spoken.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Proclaim ye this among nations, Sanctify a war, stir up the  mighty ones, Come nigh, come up, let all the men of war.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Beat your ploughshares to swords, And your pruning-hooks to  javelins, Let the weak say, &#8216;I [am] mighty.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Haste, and come in, all ye nations round, And be gathered  together, Thither cause to come down, O Jehovah, Thy mighty  ones.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Wake and come up let the nations unto the valley of  Jehoshaphat, For there I sit to judge all the nations around.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Send ye forth a sickle, For ripened hath harvest, Come in,  come down, for filled hath been the press, Overflowed hath  wine-presses, For great [is] their wickedness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Multitudes, multitudes [are] in the valley of decision, For  near [is] the day of Jehovah in the valley of decision.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Sun and moon have been black, And stars have gathered up  their shining.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And Jehovah from Zion doth roar, And from Jerusalem giveth  forth His voice, And shaken have the heavens and earth, And  Jehovah [is] a refuge to his people, And a stronghold to sons  of Israel.</p>
<p class="hdg">Blessings for God's People</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And ye have known that I [am] Jehovah your God, Dwelling in  Zion, My holy mountain, And Jerusalem hath been holy, And  strangers do not pass over into it again.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And it hath come to pass, in that day, Drop down do the  mountains juice, And the hills do flow [with] milk, And all  streams of Judah do go [with] water, And a fountain from the  house of Jehovah goeth forth, And hath watered the valley of  Shittim.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Egypt a desolation becometh, And Edom a desolation, a  wilderness, becometh, For violence [to] sons of Judah, Whose  innocent blood they shed in their land.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Judah to the age doth dwell, And Jerusalem to  generation and generation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And I have declared their blood innocent, [That] I did not  declare innocent, And Jehovah is dwelling in Zion! </p></div></div><div id="botbox">
