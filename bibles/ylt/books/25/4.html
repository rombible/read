Poured out are stones of the sanctuary At the head of all  out-places.</p>
<p class="acrostic">&#1489;</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The precious sons of Zion, Who are comparable with fine  gold, How have they been reckoned earthen bottles, Work of the  hands of a potter.</p>
