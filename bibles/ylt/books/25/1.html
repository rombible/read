She  hath been as a widow, The mighty among nations! Princes among  provinces, She hath become tributary!</p>
<p class="acrostic">&#1489;</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>She weepeth sore in the night, And her tear [is] on her  cheeks, There is no comforter for her out of all her lovers,  All her friends dealt treacherously by her, They have been to  her for enemies.</p>
<p class="acrostic">&#1490;</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Removed hath Judah because of affliction, And because of the  abundance of her service; She hath dwelt among nations, She  hath not found rest, All her pursuers have overtaken her  between the straits.</p>
