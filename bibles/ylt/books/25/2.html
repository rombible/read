<p class="acrostic">&#1489;</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Swallowed up hath the Lord, He hath not pitied any of the  pleasant places of Jacob, He hath broken down in His wrath The  fortresses of the daughter of Judah, He hath caused to come to  the earth, He polluted the kingdom and its princes.</p>
<p class="acrostic">&#1490;</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>He hath cut off in the heat of anger every horn of Israel,  He hath turned backward His right hand From the face of the  enemy, And He burneth against Jacob as a flaming fire, It hath  devoured round about.</p>
<p class="acrostic">&#1491;</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>He hath trodden His bow as an enemy, Stood hath His right  hand as an adversary, And He slayeth all the desirable ones of  the eye, In the tent of the daughter of Zion, He hath poured  out as fire His fury.</p>
<p class="acrostic">&#1492;</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The Lord hath been as an enemy, He hath swallowed up Israel,  He hath swallowed up all her palaces, He hath destroyed His  fortresses, And He multiplieth in the daughter of Judah  Mourning and moaning.</p>
<p class="acrostic">&#1493;</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And He shaketh as a garden His tabernacle, He hath destroyed  His appointed place, Jehovah hath forgotten in Zion the  appointed time and sabbath, And despiseth, in the indignation  of His anger, king and priest.</p>
<p class="acrostic">&#1494;</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The Lord hath cast off His altar, He hath rejected His  sanctuary, He hath shut up into the hand of the enemy The walls  of her palaces, A noise they have made in the house of Jehovah  Like a day of appointment.</p>
<p class="acrostic">&#1495;</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Devised hath Jehovah to destroy the wall of the daughter of  Zion, He hath stretched out a line, He hath not turned His hand  from destroying, And He causeth bulwark and wall to mourn,  Together &#8212; they have been weak.</p>
<p class="acrostic">&#1496;</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Sunk into the earth have her gates, He hath destroyed and  broken her bars, Her king and her princes [are] among the  nations, There is no law, also her prophets Have not found  vision from Jehovah.</p>
