<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>for there did come in unobserved certain men, long ago  having been written beforehand to this judgment, impious, the  grace of our God perverting to lasciviousness, and our only  Master, God, and Lord &#8212; Jesus Christ &#8212; denying,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and to remind you I intend, you knowing once this, that the  Lord, a people out of the land of Egypt having saved, again  those who did not believe did destroy;

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them, in like  manner to these, having given themselves to whoredom, and gone  after other flesh, have been set before &#8212; an example, of fire  age-during, justice suffering.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>In like manner, nevertheless, those dreaming also the flesh  indeed do defile, and lordship they put away, and dignities  they speak evil of,

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and these, as many things indeed as they have not known,  they speak evil of; and as many things as naturally (as the  irrational beasts) they understand, in these they are  corrupted; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>wo to them! because in the way of Cain they did go on, and  to the deceit of Balaam for reward they did rush, and in the  gainsaying of Korah they did perish.
