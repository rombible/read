<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>When do ye set an end to words? Consider ye, and afterwards  do we speak.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Wherefore have we been reckoned as cattle? We have been  defiled in your eyes!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>(He is tearing himself in his anger.) For thy sake is earth  forsaken? And removed is a rock from its place?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Also, the light of the wicked is extinguished. And there  doth not shine a spark of his fire.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>The light hath been dark in his tent, And his lamp over him  is extinguished.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Straitened are the steps of his strength, And cast him down  doth his own counsel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For he is sent into a net by his own feet, And on a snare  he doth walk habitually.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Seize on the heel doth a gin, Prevail over him do the  designing.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>It consumeth the parts of his skin, Consume his parts doth  death&#8217;s first-born.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Drawn from his tent is his confidence, And it causeth him  to step to the king of terrors.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>It dwelleth in his tent &#8212; out of his provender, Scattered  over his habitation is sulphur.</p>
