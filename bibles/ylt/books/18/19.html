<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Till when do ye afflict my soul, And bruise me with words?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>These ten times ye put me to shame, ye blush not. Ye make  yourselves strange to me &#8212;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And also &#8212; truly, I have erred, With me doth my error  remain.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>If, truly, over me ye magnify yourselves, And decide  against me my reproach;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Know now, that God turned me upside down, And His net  against me hath set round,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Lo, I cry out &#8212; violence, and am not answered, I cry  aloud, and there is no judgment.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>My way He hedged up, and I pass not over, And on my paths  darkness He placeth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Mine honour from off me He hath stripped, And He turneth  the crown from my head.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>He breaketh me down round about, and I go, And removeth  like a tree my hope.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And He kindleth against me His anger, And reckoneth me to  Him as His adversaries.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Come in do His troops together, And they raise up against  me their way, And encamp round about my tent.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>My brethren from me He hath put far off, And mine  acquaintances surely Have been estranged from me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Ceased have my neighbours And my familiar friends have  forgotten me,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Sojourners of my house and my maids, For a stranger reckon  me: An alien I have been in their eyes.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>To my servant I have called, And he doth not answer, With  my mouth I make supplication to him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>My spirit is strange to my wife, And my favours to the  sons of my [mother&#8217;s] womb.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Also sucklings have despised me, I rise, and they speak  against me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Abominate me do all the men of my counsel, And those I  have loved, Have been turned against me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>To my skin and to my flesh Cleaved hath my bone, And I  deliver myself with the skin of my teeth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Pity me, pity me, ye my friends, For the hand of God hath  stricken against me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Why do you pursue me as God? And with my flesh are not  satisfied?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Who doth grant now, That my words may be written? Who doth  grant that in a book they may be graven?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>With a pen of iron and lead &#8212; For ever in a rock they may  be hewn.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>That &#8212; I have known my Redeemer, The Living and the Last,  For the dust he doth rise.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And after my skin hath compassed this [body], Then from my  flesh I see God:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Whom I &#8212; I see on my side, And mine eyes have beheld, and  not a stranger, Consumed have been my reins in my bosom.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>But ye say, &#8216;Why do we pursue after him?&#8217; And the root of  the matter hath been found in me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Be ye afraid because of the sword, For furious [are] the  punishments of the sword, That ye may know that [there is] a  judgment.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
