<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>According to your knowledge I have known &#8212; also I. I am  not fallen more than you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Yet I for the Mighty One do speak, And to argue for God I  delight.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And yet, ye [are] forgers of falsehood, Physicians of  nought &#8212; all of you,</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>He doth surely reprove you, if in secret ye accept faces.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Doth not His excellency terrify you? And His dread fall  upon you?</p>
