<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Till when dost thou speak these things? And a strong wind &#8212;  sayings of thy mouth?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Doth God pervert judgment? And doth the Mighty One pervert  justice?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>If thy sons have sinned before Him, And He doth send them  away, By the hand of their transgression,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>If thou dost seek early unto God, And unto the Mighty makest  supplication,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>If pure and upright thou [art], Surely now He waketh for  thee, And hath completed The habitation of thy righteousness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And thy beginning hath been small, And thy latter end is  very great.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For, ask I pray thee of a former generation, And prepare to  a search of their fathers,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>(For of yesterday we [are], and we know not, For a shadow  [are] our days on earth.)</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Do they not shew thee &#8212; speak to thee, And from their  heart bring forth words?</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Whose confidence is loathsome, And the house of a spider  his trust.</p>
