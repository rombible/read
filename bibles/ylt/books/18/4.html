<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Hath one tried a word with thee? &#8212; Thou art weary! And to  keep in words who is able?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Lo, thou hast instructed many, And feeble hands thou makest  strong.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The stumbling one do thy words raise up, And bowing knees  thou dost strengthen.</p>
