<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Hear ye diligently my word, And this is your consolation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Bear with me, and I speak, And after my speaking &#8212; ye may  deride.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>I &#8212; to man [is] my complaint? and if [so], wherefore May  not my temper become short?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Turn unto me, and be astonished, And put hand to mouth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Yea, if I have remembered, then I have been troubled. And  my flesh hath taken fright.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Wherefore do the wicked live? They have become old, Yea,  they have been mighty in wealth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Their seed is established, Before their face with them, And  their offspring before their eyes.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>How oft is the lamp of the wicked extinguished, And come  on them doth their calamity? Pangs He apportioneth in His  anger.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>His own eyes see his destruction, And of the wrath of the  Mighty he drinketh.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Who doth declare to his face his way? And [for] that which  he hath done, Who doth give recompence to him?</p>
