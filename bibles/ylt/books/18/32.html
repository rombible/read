<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and burn doth the anger of Elihu son of Barachel the  Buzite, of the family of Ram; against Job hath his anger  burned, because of his justifying himself more than God; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and against his three friends hath his anger burned,  because that they have not found an answer, and condemn Job. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And Elihu hath waited earnestly beside Job with words, for  they are older than he in days. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And Elihu seeth that there is no answer in the mouth of the  three men, and his anger burneth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite answereth and saith:  &#8212; Young I [am] in days, and ye [are] age Therefore I have  feared, And am afraid of shewing you my opinion.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>I said: Days do speak, And multitude of years teach wisdom.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Surely a spirit is in man, And the breath of the Mighty One  Doth cause them to understand.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>The multitude are not wise, Nor do the aged understand  judgment.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Therefore I have said: Hearken to me, I do shew my opinion  &#8212; even I.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Lo, I have waited for your words, I give ear unto your  reasons, Till ye search out sayings.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And unto you I attend, And lo, there is no reasoner for  Job, [Or] answerer of his sayings among you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Lest ye say, We have found wisdom, God doth thrust him  away, not man.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And he hath not set in array words for me, And with your  sayings I do not answer him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>(They have broken down, They have not answered again, They  removed from themselves words.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And I have waited, but they do not speak, For they have  stood still, They have not answered any more.)</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>I answer, even I &#8212; my share, I shew my opinion &#8212; even I.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For I have been full of words, Distressed me hath the  spirit of my breast,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Lo, my breast [is] as wine not opened, Like new bottles it  is broken up.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>I speak, and there is refreshment to me, I open my lips  and answer.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Let me not, I pray you, accept the face of any, Nor unto  man give flattering titles,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>For I have not known to give flattering titles, In a  little doth my Maker take me away.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
