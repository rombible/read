<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>As a flower he hath gone forth, and is cut off, And he  fleeth as a shadow and standeth not.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Also &#8212; on this Thou hast opened Thine eyes, And dost bring  me into judgment with Thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Who giveth a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>If determined are his days, The number of his months [are]  with Thee, His limit Thou hast made, And he passeth not over;</p>
