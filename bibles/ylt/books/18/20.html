<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Therefore my thoughts cause me to answer, And because of my  sensations in me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>The chastisement of my shame I hear, And the spirit of mine  understanding Doth cause me to answer:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>This hast thou known from antiquity? Since the placing of  man on earth?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>That the singing of the wicked [is] short, And the joy of  the profane for a moment,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Though his excellency go up to the heavens, And his head  against a cloud he strike &#8212;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>As his own dung for ever he doth perish, His beholders say:  &#8216;Where [is] he?&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>As a dream he fleeth, and they find him not, And he is  driven away as a vision of the night,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>The eye hath not seen him, and addeth not. And not again  doth his place behold him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>His sons do the poor oppress, And his hands give back his  wealth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>His bones have been full of his youth, And with him on the  dust it lieth down.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Though he doth sweeten evil in his mouth, Doth hide it  under his tongue,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Hath pity on it, and doth not forsake it, And keep it back  in the midst of his palate,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>His food in his bowels is turned, The bitterness of asps  [is] in his heart.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Wealth he hath swallowed, and doth vomit it. From his  belly God driveth it out.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Gall of asps he sucketh, Slay him doth the tongue of a  viper.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>He looketh not on rivulets, Flowing of brooks of honey and  butter.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>He is giving back [what] he laboured for, And doth not  consume [it]; As a bulwark [is] his exchange, and he exults  not.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For he oppressed &#8212; he forsook the poor, A house he hath  taken violently away, And he doth not build it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>For he hath not known ease in his belly. With his  desirable thing he delivereth not himself.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>There is not a remnant to his food, Therefore his good  doth not stay.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>In the fulness of his sufficiency he is straitened. Every  perverse hand doth meet him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>It cometh to pass, at the filling of his belly, He sendeth  forth against him The fierceness of His anger, Yea, He raineth  on him in his eating.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>He fleeth from an iron weapon, Pass through him doth a bow  of brass.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>One hath drawn, And it cometh out from the body, And a  glittering weapon from his gall proceedeth. On him [are]  terrors.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>All darkness is hid for his treasures, Consume him doth a  fire not blown, Broken is the remnant in his tent.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Reveal do the heavens his iniquity, And earth is raising  itself against him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Remove doth the increase of his house, Poured forth in a  day of His anger.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>This [is] the portion of a wicked man from God. And an  inheritance appointed him by God.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
