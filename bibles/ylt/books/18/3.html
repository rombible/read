<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Job answereth and saith: &#8212;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Let the day perish in which I am born, And the night that  hath said: &#8216;A man-child hath been conceived.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>That day &#8212; let it be darkness, Let not God require it from  above, Nor let light shine upon it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Let darkness and death-shade redeem it, Let a cloud  tabernacle upon it, Let them terrify it as the most bitter of  days.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>That night &#8212; let thick darkness take it, Let it not be  united to days of the year, Into the number of months let it  not come.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Lo! that night &#8212; let it be gloomy, Let no singing come into  it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Let the cursers of day mark it, Who are ready to wake up  Leviathan.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Let the stars of its twilight be dark, Let it wait for  light, and there is none, And let it not look on the eyelids of  the dawn.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Because it hath not shut the doors Of the womb that was  mine! And hide misery from mine eyes.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Why from the womb do I not die? From the belly I have come  forth and gasp!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Wherefore have knees been before me? And what [are] breasts,  that I suck?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For now, I have lain down, and am quiet, I have slept &#8212;  then there is rest to me,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>With kings and counsellors of earth, These building wastes  for themselves.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>(Or as a hidden abortion I am not, As infants &#8212; they have  not seen light.)</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>There the wicked have ceased troubling, And there rest do  the wearied in power.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Together prisoners have been at ease, They have not heard  the voice of an exactor,</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Why giveth He to the miserable light, and life to the  bitter soul?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Who are waiting for death, and it is not, And they seek it  above hid treasures.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>For a fear I feared and it meeteth me, And what I was  afraid of doth come to me.</p>
