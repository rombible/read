<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary, &#8216;Whence camest thou?&#8217;  And the Adversary answereth Jehovah and saith, &#8216;From going to  and fro in the land, and from walking up and down in it.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary, &#8216;Hast thou set thy  heart unto My servant Job because there is none like him in the  land, a man perfect and upright, fearing God and turning aside  from evil? and still he is keeping hold on his integrity, and  thou dost move Me against him to swallow him up for nought!&#8217;
