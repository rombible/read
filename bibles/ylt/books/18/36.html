<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Honour me a little, and I shew thee, That yet for God [are]  words.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>I lift up my knowledge from afar, And to my Maker I ascribe  righteousness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For, truly, my words [are] not false, The perfect in  knowledge [is] with thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Lo, God [is] mighty, and despiseth not, Mighty [in] power  [and] heart.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He reviveth not the wicked, And the judgment of the poor  appointeth;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>He withdraweth not from the righteous His eyes, And [from]  kings on the throne, And causeth them to sit for ever, and they  are high,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And if prisoners in fetters They are captured with cords of  affliction,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then He declareth to them their work, And their  transgressions, Because they have become mighty,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And He uncovereth their ear for instruction, And saith  that they turn back from iniquity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>If they do hear and serve, They complete their days in  good, And their years in pleasantness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And if they do not hearken, By the dart they pass away,  And expire without knowledge.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And the profane in heart set the face, They cry not when  He hath bound them.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And the judgment of the wicked thou hast fulfilled,  Judgment and justice are upheld &#8212; because of fury,</p>
