<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>I say unto God, &#8216;Do not condemn me, Let me know why Thou  dost strive [with] me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Is it good for Thee that Thou dost oppress? That Thou  despisest the labour of Thy hands, And on the counsel of the  wicked hast shone?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Eyes of flesh hast Thou? As man seeth &#8212; seest Thou?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>As the days of man [are] Thy days? Thy years as the days of  a man?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>That Thou inquirest for mine iniquity, And for my sin  seekest?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For Thou knowest that I am not wicked, And there is no  deliverer from Thy hand.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Thy hands have taken pains about me, And they make me  together round about, And Thou swallowest me up!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Remember, I pray Thee, That as clay Thou hast made me, And  unto dust Thou dost bring me back.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Dost Thou not as milk pour me out? And as cheese curdle  me?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Skin and flesh Thou dost put on me, And with bones and  sinews dost fence me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Life and kindness Thou hast done with me. And Thy  inspection hath preserved my spirit.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And these Thou hast laid up in Thy heart, I have known  that this [is] with Thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>If I sinned, then Thou hast observed me, And from mine  iniquity dost not acquit me,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>If I have done wickedly &#8212; wo to me, And righteously &#8212; I  lift not up my head, Full of shame &#8212; then see my affliction,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And it riseth &#8212; as a lion Thou huntest me. And Thou  turnest back &#8212; Thou shewest Thyself wonderful in me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Thou renewest Thy witnesses against me, And dost multiply  Thine anger with me, Changes and warfare [are] with me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And why from the womb Hast Thou brought me forth? I  expire, and the eye doth not see me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>As I had not been, I am, From the belly to the grave I am  brought,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Are not my days few? Cease then, and put from me, And I  brighten up a little,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Before I go, and return not, Unto a land of darkness and  death-shade,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>A land of obscurity as thick darkness, Death-shade &#8212; and  no order, And the shining [is] as thick darkness.&#8217;</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
