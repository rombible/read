<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Also &#8212; to-day [is] my complaint bitter, My hand hath been  heavy because of my sighing.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>O that I had known &#8212; and I find Him, I come in unto His  seat,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>I arrange before Him the cause, And my mouth fill [with]  arguments.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>I know the words He doth answer me, And understand what He  saith to me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>In the abundance of power doth He strive with me? No!  surely He putteth [it] in me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>There the upright doth reason with Him, And I escape for  ever from my judge.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Lo, forward I go &#8212; and He is not, And backward &#8212; and I  perceive him not.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>[To] the left in His working &#8212; and I see not, He is  covered [on] the right, and I behold not.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For He hath known the way with me, He hath tried me &#8212; as  gold I go forth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>On His step hath my foot laid hold, His way I have kept,  and turn not aside,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>The command of His lips, and I depart not. Above my  allotted portion I have laid up The sayings of His mouth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And He [is] in one [mind], And who doth turn Him back? And  His soul hath desired &#8212; and He doth [it].</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For He doth complete my portion, And many such things  [are] with Him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Therefore, from His presence I am troubled, I consider,  and am afraid of Him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And God hath made my heart soft, And the Mighty hath  troubled me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For I have not been cut off before darkness, And before me  He covered thick darkness.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
