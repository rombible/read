<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Truly I have known that [it is] so, And what &#8212; is man  righteous with God?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>If he delight to strive with Him &#8212; He doth not answer him  one of a thousand.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Wise in heart and strong in power &#8212; Who hath hardened  toward Him and is at peace?</p>
