<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Doth a wise man answer [with] vain knowledge? And fill  [with] an east wind his belly?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>To reason with a word not useful? And speeches &#8212; no profit  in them?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Yea, thou dost make reverence void, And dost diminish  meditation before God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For thy mouth teacheth thine iniquity, And thou chooseth  the tongue of the subtile.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Thy mouth declareth thee wicked, and not I, And thy lips  testify against thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The first man art thou born? And before the heights wast  thou formed?</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Too few for thee are the comforts of God? And a gentle  word [is] with thee,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>What &#8212; doth thine heart take thee away? And what &#8212; are  thine eyes high?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For thou turnest against God thy spirit? And hast brought  out words from thy mouth:</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>To them alone was the land given, And a stranger passed  not over into their midst:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>&#8216;All days of the wicked he is paining himself, And few  years have been laid up for the terrible one.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>A fearful voice [is] in his ears, In peace doth a  destroyer come to him.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Terrify him do adversity and distress, They prevail over  him As a king ready for a boaster.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>For he stretched out against God his hand, And against the  Mighty he maketh himself mighty.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>For he hath covered his face with his fat, And maketh  vigour over [his] confidence.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And he inhabiteth cities cut off, houses not dwelt in,  That have been ready to become heaps.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>He is not rich, nor doth his wealth rise, Nor doth he  stretch out on earth their continuance.</p>
