<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Lo, I pray thee, I have opened my mouth, My tongue hath  spoken in the palate.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Of the uprightness of my heart [are] my sayings, And  knowledge have my lips clearly spoken.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The Spirit of God hath made me, And the breath of the  Mighty doth quicken me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>If thou art able &#8212; answer me, Set in array before me &#8212;  station thyself.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Lo, I [am], according to thy word, for God, From the clay I  &#8212; I also, have been formed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Lo, my terror doth not frighten thee, And my burden on thee  is not heavy.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Surely &#8212; thou hast said in mine ears, And the sounds of  words I hear:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8216;Pure [am] I, without transgression, Innocent [am] I, and I  have no iniquity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Lo, occasions against me He doth find, He doth reckon me  for an enemy to Him,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>He doth put in the stocks my feet, He doth watch all my  paths.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Lo, [in] this thou hast not been righteous, I answer thee,  that greater is God than man.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Wherefore against Him hast thou striven, When [for] all  His matters He answereth not?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For once doth God speak, and twice, (He doth not behold  it.)</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>In a dream &#8212; a vision of night, In the falling of deep  sleep on men, In slumberings on a bed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then He uncovereth the ear of men, And for their  instruction sealeth:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>To turn aside man [from] doing, And pride from man He  concealeth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>He keepeth back his soul from corruption, And his life  from passing away by a dart.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And he hath been reproved With pain on his bed, And the  strife of his bones [is] enduring.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And his life hath nauseated bread, And his soul desirable  food.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>His flesh is consumed from being seen, And high are his  bones, they were not seen!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And draw near to the pit doth his soul, And his life to  those causing death.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>If there is by him a messenger, An interpreter &#8212; one of a  thousand, To declare for man his uprightness:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then He doth favour him and saith, &#8216;Ransom him from going  down to the pit, I have found an atonement.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Fresher [is] his flesh than a child&#8217;s, He returneth to the  days of his youth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>He maketh supplication unto God, And He accepteth him.  And he seeth His face with shouting, And He returneth to man  His righteousness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>He looketh on men, and saith, &#8216;I sinned, And uprightness I  have perverted, And it hath not been profitable to me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>He hath ransomed my soul From going over into the pit, And  my life on the light looketh.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Lo, all these doth God work, Twice &#8212; thrice with man,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>To bring back his soul from the pit, To be enlightened  with the light of the living.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Attend, O Job, hearken to me, Keep silent, and I &#8212; I do  speak.</p>
