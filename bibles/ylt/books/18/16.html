<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>I have heard many such things, Miserable comforters [are]  ye all.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Is there an end to words of wind? Or what doth embolden  thee that thou answerest?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>I also, like you, might speak, If your soul were in my  soul&#8217;s stead. I might join against you with words, And nod at  you with my head.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>I might harden you with my mouth, And the moving of my lips  might be sparing.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>If I speak, my pain is not restrained, And I cease &#8212; what  goeth from me?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Only, now, it hath wearied me; Thou hast desolated all my  company,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Thou dost loathe me, For a witness it hath been, And  rise up against me doth my failure, In my face it testifieth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>His anger hath torn, and he hateth me, He hath gnashed at  me with his teeth, My adversary sharpeneth his eyes for me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>They have gaped on me with their mouth, In reproach they  have smitten my cheeks, Together against me they set  themselves.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>God shutteth me up unto the perverse, And to the hands of  the wicked turneth me over.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>At ease I have been, and he breaketh me, And he hath laid  hold on my neck, And he breaketh me in pieces, And he raiseth  me to him for a mark.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Go round against me do his archers. He splitteth my reins,  and spareth not, He poureth out to the earth my gall.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>He breaketh me &#8212; breach upon breach, He runneth upon me  as a mighty one.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Sackcloth I have sewed on my skin, And have rolled in the  dust my horn.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>My face is foul with weeping, And on mine eyelids [is]  death-shade.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Not for violence in my hands, And my prayer [is] pure.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>O earth, do not thou cover my blood! And let there not be  a place for my cry.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Also, now, lo, in the heavens [is] my witness, And my  testifier in the high places.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>My interpreter [is] my friend, Unto God hath mine eye  dropped:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And he reasoneth for a man with God, And a son of man for  his friend.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>When a few years do come, Then a path I return not do I  go.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
