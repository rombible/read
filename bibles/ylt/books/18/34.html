<div class="chap"><p class="hdg">Elihu Confirms God's Justice</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>And Elihu answereth and saith:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Hear, O wise men, my words, And, O knowing ones, give ear  to me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For the ear doth try words, And the palate tasteth to eat.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Judgment let us choose for ourselves, Let us know among  ourselves what [is] good.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For Job hath said, &#8216;I have been righteous, And God hath  turned aside my right,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Against my right do I lie? Mortal [is] mine arrow &#8212;  without transgression.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Who [is] a man like Job? He drinketh scoffing like water,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And he hath travelled for company With workers of iniquity,  So as to go with men of wickedness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For he hath said, &#8216;It doth not profit a man, When he  delighteth himself with God.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Therefore, O men of heart, hearken to me; Far be it from  God to do wickedness, And [from] the Mighty to do perverseness:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For the work of man he repayeth to him, And according to  the path of each He doth cause him to find.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Yea, truly, God doth not do wickedly, And the Mighty doth  not pervert judgment.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Who hath inspected for Himself the earth? And who hath  placed all the habitable world?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>If He doth set on him His heart, His spirit and his breath  unto Him He gathereth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Expire doth all flesh together, And man to dust returneth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And if [there is] understanding, hear this, Give ear to  the voice of my words.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Yea, doth one hating justice govern? Or the Most Just dost  thou condemn?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Who hath said to a king &#8212; &#8216;Worthless,&#8217; Unto princes &#8212;  &#8216;Wicked?&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>That hath not accepted the person of princes, Nor hath  known the rich before the poor, For a work of His hands [are]  all of them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>[In] a moment they die, and at midnight Shake do people,  and they pass away, And they remove the mighty without hand.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For His eyes [are] on the ways of each, And all his steps  He doth see.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>There is no darkness nor death-shade, For workers of  iniquity to be hidden there;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>For He doth not suffer man any more, To go unto God in  judgment,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>He breaketh the mighty &#8212; no searching! And He appointeth  others in their stead.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Therefore He knoweth their works, And He hath overturned  by night, And they are bruised.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>As wicked He hath stricken them, In the place of  beholders.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Because that against right They have turned aside from  after Him, And none of His ways have considered wisely,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>To cause to come in unto Him The cry of the poor, And the  cry of the afflicted He heareth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And He giveth rest, and who maketh wrong? And hideth the  face, and who beholdeth it? And in reference to a nation and to  a man, [It is] the same.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>From the reigning of a profane man, From the snares of a  people;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>For unto God hath any said: &#8216;I have taken away, I do not  corruptly,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Besides [that which] I see, shew Thou me, If iniquity I  have done &#8212; I do not add?&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>By thee doth He recompense, That thou hast refused &#8212; That  thou dost choose, and not I? And what thou hast known, speak.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Let men of heart say to me, And a wise man is hearkening  to me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Job &#8212; not with knowledge doth he speak, And his words  [are] not with wisdom.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>My Father! let Job be tried &#8212; unto victory, Because of  answers for men of iniquity,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>For he doth add to his sin, Transgression among us he  vomiteth, And multiplieth his sayings to God.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
