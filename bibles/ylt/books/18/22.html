<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>To God is a man profitable, Because a wise man to himself  is profitable?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Is it a delight to the Mighty One That thou art righteous?  is it gain, That thou makest perfect thy ways?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Because of thy reverence Doth He reason [with] thee? He  entereth with thee into judgment:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Is not thy wickedness abundant? And there is no end to  thine iniquities.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For thou takest a pledge of thy brother for nought, And the  garments of the naked Thou dost strip off.</p>
