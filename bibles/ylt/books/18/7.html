<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>As a servant desireth the shadow, And as a hireling  expecteth his wage,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So I have been caused to inherit months of vanity, And  nights of misery they numbered to me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>If I lay down then I said, &#8216;When do I rise!&#8217; And evening  hath been measured, And I have been full of tossings till dawn.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Clothed hath been my flesh [with] worms, And a clod of dust,  My skin hath been shrivelled and is loathsome,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>My days swifter than a weaving machine, And they are  consumed without hope.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Remember Thou that my life [is] a breath, Mine eye turneth  not back to see good.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The eye of my beholder beholdeth me not. Thine eyes [are]  upon me &#8212; and I am not.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Consumed hath been a cloud, and it goeth, So he who is going  down to Sheol cometh not up.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>He turneth not again to his house, Nor doth his place  discern him again.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Also I &#8212; I withhold not my mouth &#8212; I speak in the  distress of my spirit, I talk in the bitterness of my soul.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>A sea-[monster] am I, or a dragon, That thou settest over  me a guard?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>When I said, &#8216;My bed doth comfort me,&#8217; He taketh away in my  talking my couch.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And thou hast affrighted me with dreams, And from visions  thou terrifiest me,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And my soul chooseth strangling, Death rather than my  bones.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>I have wasted away &#8212; not to the age do I live. Cease from  me, for my days [are] vanity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>What [is] man that Thou dost magnify him? And that Thou  settest unto him Thy heart?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And inspectest him in the mornings, In the evenings dost  try him?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>How long dost Thou not look from me? Thou dost not desist  till I swallow my spittle.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>I have sinned, what do I to Thee, O watcher of man? Why  hast Thou set me for a mark to Thee, And I am for a burden to  myself &#8212; and what?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Thou dost not take away my transgression, And cause to pass  away mine iniquity, Because now, for dust I lie down: And Thou  hast sought me &#8212; and I am not!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
