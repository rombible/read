<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Euodia I exhort, and Syntyche I exhort, to be of the same  mind in the Lord;

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>the things that also ye did learn, and receive, and hear,  and saw in me, those do, and the God of the peace shall be  with you.</p>
<p class="hdg">Philippian Generosity</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at length ye  flourished again in caring for me, for which also ye were  caring, and lacked opportunity; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>not that in respect of want I say [it], for I did learn in  the things in which I am &#8212; to be content; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>I have known both to be abased, and I have known to abound;  in everything and in all things I have been initiated, both to  be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and ye have known, even ye Philippians, that in the  beginning of the good news when I went forth from Macedonia,  no assembly did communicate with me in regard to giving and  receiving except ye only; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>because also in Thessalonica, both once and again to my  need ye sent; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>not that I seek after the gift, but I seek after the fruit  that is overflowing to your account;
