<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and now, let us make a covenant with our God, to cause all  the women to go out, and that which is born of them, by the  counsel of the Lord, and of those trembling at the command of  our God, and according to law it is done;
