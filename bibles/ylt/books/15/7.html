<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>because that from the king and his seven counsellors thou  art sent, to inquire concerning Judah and concerning Jerusalem,  with the law of God that [is] in thy hand,

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>&#8216;And to you we are making known, that upon any of the  priests and Levites, singers, gatekeepers, Nethinim, and  servants of the house of God, tribute and custom there is no  authority to lift up.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>&#8216;And thou, Ezra, according to the wisdom of thy God, that  [is] in thy hand, appoint magistrates and judges who may be  judges to all the people who are beyond the river, to all  knowing the law of thy God, and he who hath not known ye cause  to know; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>and any who doth not do the law of thy God, and the law of  the king, speedily is judgment done upon him, whether to death,  or to banishment, or to confiscation of riches, and to bonds.&#8217;</p>
