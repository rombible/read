<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then have Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua son of  Jozadak, risen, and begun to build the house of God, that [is]  in Jerusalem, and with them are the prophets of God supporting  them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>At that time come to them hath Tatnai, governor beyond the  river, and Shethar-Boznai, and their companions, and thus they  are saying to them, &#8216;Who hath made for you a decree this house  to build, and this wall to finish?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then thus we have said to them, &#8216;What [are] the names of the  men who are building this building?&#8217;

<p class="hdg">Tattenai's Letter to Darius</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>The copy of a letter that Tatnai, governor beyond the river,  hath sent, and Shethar-Boznai and his companions, the  Apharsachites who [are] beyond the river, unto Darius the king. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>A letter they have sent unto him, and thus is it written in  it: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8216;To Darius the king, all peace! be it known to the king that  we have gone to the province of Judah, to the great house of  God, and it is built [with] rolled stones, and wood is placed  in the walls, and this work is done speedily, and prospering in  their hand. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then we have asked of these elders, thus we have said to  them, Who hath made for you a decree this house to build, and  this wall to finish? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And also their names we have asked of them, to let thee  know, that we might write the names of the men who [are] at  their head. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8216;And thus they have returned us word, saying, We [are]  servants of the God of heaven and earth, and are building the  house that was built many years before this, that a great king  of Israel built and finished: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>but after that our fathers made the God of heaven angry, he  gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon the  Chaldean, and this house he destroyed, and the people he  removed to Babylon; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>but in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the  king made a decree to build this house of God, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and also, the vessels of the house of God, of gold and  silver, that Nebuchadnezzar had taken forth out of the temple  that [is] in Jerusalem, and brought them to the temple of  Babylon, them hath Cyrus the king brought forth out of the  temple of Babylon, and they have been given to [one],  Sheshbazzar [is] his name, whom he made governor, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and said to him, These vessels lift up, go, put them down  in the temple that [is] in Jerusalem, and the house of God is  builded on its place. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then hath this Sheshbazzar come &#8212; he hath laid the  foundations of the house of God that [is] in Jerusalem, and  from thence even till now it hath been building, and is not  finished. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8216;And now, if to the king it be good, let search be made in  the treasure-house of the king, that [is] there in Babylon,  whether it be that of Cyrus the king there was made a decree to  build this house of God in Jerusalem, and the will of the king  concerning this thing he doth send unto us.&#8217;</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
