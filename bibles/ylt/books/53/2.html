<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>that ye be not quickly shaken in mind, nor be troubled,  neither through spirit, neither through word, neither through  letters as through us, as that the day of Christ hath arrived; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>let not any one deceive you in any manner, because &#8212; if the  falling away may not come first, and the man of sin be  revealed &#8212; the son of the destruction, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>who is opposing and is raising himself up above all called  God or worshipped, so that he in the sanctuary of God as God  hath sat down, shewing himself off that he is God &#8212; [the day  doth not come]. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Do ye not remember that, being yet with you, these things I  said to you?

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and in all deceitfulness of the unrighteousness in those  perishing, because the love of the truth they did not receive  for their being saved, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and because of this shall God send to them a working of  delusion, for their believing the lie,
