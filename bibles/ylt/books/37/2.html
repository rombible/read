<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8216;Speak, I pray thee, unto Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel,  governor of Judah, and unto Joshua, son of Josedech, the high  priest, and unto the remnant of the people, saying: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Who among you hath been left that saw this house in its  former honour? And what are ye seeing it now? Is it not,  compared with it, as nothing in your eyes? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And now, be strong, O Zerubbabel, An affirmation of Jehovah,  And be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest, And  be strong, all ye people of the land, An affirmation of  Jehovah, And do ye &#8212; (for I [am] with you, An affirmation of  Jehovah of Hosts) &#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The thing that I covenanted with you, In your coming forth  from Egypt, And My Spirit is remaining in your midst, fear not. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Yet once more &#8212; it [is] a  little, And I am shaking the heavens and the earth, And the  sea, and the dry land, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And I have shaken all the nations, And they have come [to]  the desire of all the nations, And I have filled this house  [with] honour, Said Jehovah of Hosts.

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Greater is the honour of this latter house, Than of the  former, said Jehovah of Hosts, And in this place do I give  peace, An affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts.&#8217;</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: &#8216;Ask, I pray thee, the priests  [of] the law, saying: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Lo, one doth carry holy flesh in the skirt of his garment,  and he hath come with his skirt against the bread, or against  the pottage, or against the wine, or against the oil, or  against any food &#8212; is it holy?&#8217; And the priests answer and  say, &#8216;No.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And Haggai saith, &#8216;If the unclean of body doth come against  any of these, is it unclean?&#8217; And the priests answer and say,  &#8216;It is unclean.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And Haggai answereth and saith, &#8216;So [is] this people, and  so [is] this nation before Me &#8212; an affirmation of Jehovah &#8212;  and so [is] every work of their hands, and that which they  bring near there &#8212; it is unclean. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And now, lay [it], I pray you, to your heart, From this  day, and onwards, Before the laying of stone to stone in the  temple of Jehovah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>From that time [one] hath come to a heap of twenty, And it  hath been ten, He hath come unto the wine-fat to draw out fifty  purahs, And it hath been twenty. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>I have smitten you with blasting, And with mildew, and with  hail &#8212; All the work of your hands, And there is none of you  with Me, An affirmation of Jehovah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Set [it], I pray you, to your heart, from this day and  onwards, from the twenty and fourth day of the ninth [month],  even from the day that the temple of Jehovah hath been founded,  set [it] to your heart.
