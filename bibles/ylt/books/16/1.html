And it cometh to pass,  in the month of Chisleu, the twentieth year, and I have been in  Shushan the palace, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and come in doth Hanani, one of my brethren, he and men of  Judah, and I ask them concerning the Jews, the escaped part  that have been left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and they say to me, &#8216;Those left, who have been left of the  captivity there in the province, [are] in great evil, and in  reproach, and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its  gates have been burnt with fire.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And it cometh to pass, at my hearing these words, I have sat  down, and I weep and mourn [for] days, and I am fasting and  praying before the God of the heavens. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And I say, &#8216;I beseech thee, O Jehovah, God of the heavens,  God, the great and the fearful, keeping the covenant and  kindness for those loving Him, and for those keeping His  commands, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>let Thine ear be, I pray Thee, attentive, and Thine eyes  open, to hearken unto the prayer of Thy servant, that I am  praying before Thee to-day, by day and by night, concerning the  sons of Israel Thy servants, and confessing concerning the sins  of the sons of Israel, that we have sinned against Thee; yea, I  and the house of my father have sinned; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>we have acted very corruptly against Thee, and have not kept  the commands, and the statutes, and the judgments, that Thou  didst command Moses Thy servant. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8216;Remember, I pray Thee, the word that Thou didst command  Moses Thy servant, saying, Ye &#8212; ye trespass &#8212; I scatter you  among peoples;
