<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and saith before his brethren and the force of Samaria, yea,  he saith, &#8216;What [are] the weak Jews doing? are they left to  themselves? do they sacrifice? do they complete in a day? do  they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish? &#8212; and  they burnt!&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Tobiah the Ammonite [is] by him and saith, &#8216;Also, that  which they are building &#8212; if a fox doth go up, then it hath  broken down their stone wall.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Hear, O our God, for we have been despised; and turn back  their reproach on their own head, and give them for a spoil in  a land of captivity; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and do not cover over their iniquity, and their sin from  before Thee let not be blotted out, for they have provoked to  anger &#8212; over-against those building.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And we build the wall, and all the wall is joined &#8212; unto  its half, and the people have a heart to work.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And it cometh to pass, when Sanballat hath heard, and  Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the  Ashdodites, that lengthening hath gone up to the walls of  Jerusalem, that the breeches have begun to be stopped, then it  is very displeasing to them, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and they conspire, all of them together, to come in to fight  against Jerusalem, and to do to it injury.</p>
