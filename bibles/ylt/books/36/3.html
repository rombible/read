<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>She hath not hearkened to the voice, She hath not accepted  instruction, In Jehovah she hath not trusted, Unto her God she  hath not drawn near.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Her heads in her midst [are] roaring lions, Her judges [are]  evening wolves, They have not gnawn the bone in the morning.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Her prophets unstable &#8212; men of treachery, Her priests have  polluted the sanctuary, They have violated the law.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Jehovah [is] righteous in her midst, He doth not do  perverseness, Morning by morning His judgment he giveth to the  light, It hath not been lacking, And the perverse doth not know  shame.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>I have cut off nations, Desolated have been their chief  ones, I have laid waste their out-places without any passing  by, Destroyed have been their cities, Without man, without  inhabitant.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>I have said: Only, ye do fear Me, Ye do accept instruction,  And her habitation is not cut off, All that I have appointed  for her, But they have risen early, They have corrupted all  their doings.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Therefore, wait for Me &#8212; an affirmation of Jehovah, For the  day of My rising for prey, For My judgment [is] to gather  nations, To assemble kingdoms, To pour out on them Mine  indignation, All the heat of Mine anger, For by the fire of My  jealousy consumed is all the earth.</p>
<p class="hdg">Purification of the Nations</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For then do I turn unto peoples a pure lip, To call all of  them by the name of Jehovah, To serve Him [with] one shoulder.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>From beyond the rivers of Cush, my supplicants, The  daughter of My scattered ones, Do bring My present.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>In that day thou art not ashamed because of any of thine  actions, Wherewith thou hast transgressed against Me, For then  do I turn aside from thy midst The exulting ones of thine  excellency, And thou dost add no more to be haughty, In My holy  mountain.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And I have left in thy midst a people humble and poor, And  they have trusted in the name of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The remnant of Israel do no perversity, nor speak lies, Nor  found in their mouth is a deceitful tongue, For they have  delight, and have lain down, And there is none troubling.</p>
<p class="hdg">Israel's Restoration</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Cry aloud, O daughter of Zion, shout, O Israel, Rejoice and  exult with the whole heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Jehovah hath turned aside thy judgments, He hath faced  thine enemy, The king of Israel, Jehovah, [is] in thy midst,  Thou seest evil no more.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>In that day it is said to Jerusalem, &#8216;Fear not, O Zion, let  not thy hands be feeble.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Jehovah thy God [is] in thy midst, A mighty one doth save,  He rejoiceth over thee with joy, He doth work in His love, He  joyeth over thee with singing.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Mine afflicted from the appointed place I have gathered,  from thee they have been, Bearing for her sake reproach.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Lo, I am dealing with all afflicting thee at that time, And  I have saved the halting one, And the driven out ones I do  gather, And have set them for a praise and for a name, In all  the land of their shame.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>At that time I bring you in, Even at the time of My  assembling you, For I give you for a name, and for a praise,  Among all peoples of the land, In My turning back [to] your  captivity before your eyes, said Jehovah! </p></div></div><div id="botbox">
