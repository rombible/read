<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>beloved, now, children of God are we, and it was not yet  manifested what we shall be, and we have known that if he may  be manifested, like him we shall be, because we shall see him  as he is;

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Every one who is doing the sin, the lawlessness also he doth  do, and the sin is the lawlessness,
