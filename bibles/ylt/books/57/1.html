<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and Apphia the beloved, and Archippus our fellow-soldier,  and the assembly in thy house: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord  Jesus Christ!</p>
<p class="hdg">Philemon's Faith and Love</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>I give thanks to my God, always making mention of thee in my  prayers, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>hearing of thy love and faith that thou hast unto the Lord  Jesus and toward all the saints, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>that the fellowship of thy faith may become working in the  full knowledge of every good thing that [is] in you toward  Christ Jesus; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>for we have much joy and comfort in thy love, because the  bowels of the saints have been refreshed through thee,  brother.</p>
<p class="hdg">Paul's Appeal for Onesimus</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Wherefore, having in Christ much boldness to command thee  that which is fit &#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>because of the love I rather entreat, being such an one as  Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>I entreat thee concerning my child &#8212; whom I did beget in  my bonds &#8212; Onesimus, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>who once was to thee unprofitable, and now is profitable to  me and to thee, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>whom I did send again, and thou him (that is, my own  bowels) receive, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>whom I did wish to retain to myself, that in thy behalf he  might minister to me in the bonds of the good news, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and apart from thy mind I willed to do nothing, that as of  necessity thy good deed may not be, but of willingness, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>for perhaps because of this he did depart for an hour, that  age-duringly thou mayest have him, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>no more as a servant, but above a servant &#8212; a brother  beloved, especially to me, and how much more to thee, both in  the flesh and in the Lord!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>If, then, with me thou hast fellowship, receive him as me, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and if he did hurt to thee, or doth owe anything, this to  me be reckoning; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>I, Paul did write with my hand, I &#8212; I will repay; that I  may not say that also thyself, besides, to me thou dost owe. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Yes, brother, may I have profit of thee in the Lord;  refresh my bowels in the Lord;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>having been confident in thy obedience I did write to thee,  having known that also above what I may say thou wilt do;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>and at the same time also prepare for me a lodging, for I  hope that through your prayers I shall be granted to you.</p>
