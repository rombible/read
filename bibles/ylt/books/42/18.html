<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>saying, &#8216;A certain judge was in a certain city &#8212; God he is  not fearing, and man he is not regarding &#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and a widow was in that city, and she was coming unto him,  saying, Do me justice on my opponent,

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the Lord said, &#8216;Hear ye what the unrighteous judge  saith:

<p class="hdg">The Pharisee and Tax Collector</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And he spake also unto certain who have been trusting in  themselves that they were righteous, and have been despising  the rest, this simile: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8216;Two men went up to the temple to pray, the one a  Pharisee, and the other a tax-gatherer; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>the Pharisee having stood by himself, thus prayed: God, I  thank Thee that I am not as the rest of men, rapacious,  unrighteous, adulterers, or even as this tax-gatherer; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all things &#8212;  as many as I possess.

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>I say to you, this one went down declared righteous, to  his house, rather than that one: for every one who is exalting  himself shall be humbled, and he who is humbling himself shall  be exalted.&#8217;</p>
