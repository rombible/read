<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and having called him, he said to him, What [is] this I  hear about thee? render the account of thy stewardship, for  thou mayest not any longer be steward. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8216;And the steward said in himself, What shall I do, because  my lord doth take away the stewardship from me? to dig I am  not able, to beg I am ashamed: &#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>I have known what I shall do, that, when I may be removed  from the stewardship, they may receive me to their houses. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8216;And having called near each one of his lord&#8217;s debtors, he  said to the first, How much dost thou owe to my lord? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and he said, A hundred baths of oil; and he said to him,  Take thy bill, and having sat down write fifty. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8216;Afterward to another he said, And thou, how much dost thou  owe? and he said, A hundred cors of wheat; and he saith to  him, Take thy bill, and write eighty. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8216;And the lord commended the unrighteous steward that he did  prudently, because the sons of this age are more prudent than  the sons of the light, in respect to their generation. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and I say to you, Make to yourselves friends out of the  mammon of unrighteousness, that when ye may fail, they may  receive you to the age-during tabernacles.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>if, then, in the unrighteous mammon ye became not faithful  &#8212; the true who will entrust to you? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and if in the other&#8217;s ye became not faithful &#8212; your own,  who shall give to you? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8216;No domestic is able to serve two lords, for either the  one he will hate, and the other he will love; or one he will  hold to, and of the other he will be heedless; ye are not able  to serve God and mammon.&#8217;</p>
