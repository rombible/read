<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and the Pharisees and the scribes were murmuring, saying &#8212;  This one doth receive sinners, and doth eat with them.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And he spake unto them this simile, saying, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8216;What man of you having a hundred sheep, and having lost  one out of them, doth not leave behind the ninety-nine in the  wilderness, and go on after the lost one, till he may find it? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and having found, he doth lay [it] on his shoulders  rejoicing, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and having come to the house, he doth call together the  friends and the neighbours, saying to them, Rejoice with me,  because I found my sheep &#8212; the lost one. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8216;I say to you, that so joy shall be in the heaven over one  sinner reforming, rather than over ninety-nine righteous men,  who have no need of reformation.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8216;And not many days after, having gathered all together,  the younger son went abroad to a far country, and there he  scattered his substance, living riotously; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and he having spent all, there came a mighty famine on  that country, and himself began to be in want; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and having gone on, he joined himself to one of the  citizens of that country, and he sent him to the fields to feed  swine,

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>having risen, I will go on unto my father, and will say to  him, Father, I did sin &#8212; to the heaven, and before thee,

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>and the son said to him, Father, I did sin &#8212; to the  heaven, and before thee, and no more am I worthy to be called  thy son. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>&#8216;And the father said unto his servants, Bring forth the  first robe, and clothe him, and give a ring for his hand, and  sandals for the feet;

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>&#8216;And his elder son was in a field, and as, coming, he drew  nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>and having called near one of the young men, he was  inquiring what these things might be, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>and he said to him &#8212; Thy brother is arrived, and thy  father did kill the fatted calf, because in health he did  receive him back.

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>and he answering said to the father, Lo, so many years I  do serve thee, and never thy command did I transgress, and to  me thou didst never give a kid, that with my friends I might  make merry; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>but when thy son &#8212; this one who did devour thy living  with harlots &#8212; came, thou didst kill to him the fatted calf. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>&#8216;And he said to him, Child, thou art always with me, and  all my things are thine;
