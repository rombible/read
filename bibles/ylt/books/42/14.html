<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and lo, there was a certain dropsical man before him; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and Jesus answering spake to the lawyers and Pharisees,  saying, &#8216;Is it lawful on the sabbath-day to heal?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and they were silent, and having taken hold of [him], he  healed him, and let [him] go; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and answering them he said, &#8216;Of which of you shall an ass  or ox fall into a pit, and he will not immediately draw it up  on the sabbath-day?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and they were not able to answer him again unto these  things.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Parable of the Guests</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And he spake a simile unto those called, marking how they  were choosing out the first couches, saying unto them, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8216;When thou mayest be called by any one to marriage-feasts,  thou mayest not recline on the first couch, lest a more  honourable than thou may have been called by him, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and he who did call thee and him having come shall say to  thee, Give to this one place, and then thou mayest begin with  shame to occupy the last place. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8216;But, when thou mayest be called, having gone on, recline  in the last place, that when he who called thee may come, he  may say to thee, Friend, come up higher; then thou shalt have  glory before those reclining with thee; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>because every one who is exalting himself shall be  humbled, and he who is humbling himself shall be exalted.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And he said also to him who did call him, &#8216;When thou  mayest make a dinner or a supper, be not calling thy friends,  nor thy brethren, nor thy kindred, nor rich neighbours, lest  they may also call thee again, and a recompense may come to  thee; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>but when thou mayest make a feast, be calling poor,  maimed, lame, blind, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and happy thou shalt be, because they have not to  recompense thee, for it shall be recompensed to thee in the  rising again of the righteous.&#8217;</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8216;And they began with one consent all to excuse themselves:  The first said to him, A field I bought, and I have need to go  forth and see it; I beg of thee, have me excused.

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>&#8216;And the servant said, Sir, it hath been done as thou  didst command, and still there is room.
