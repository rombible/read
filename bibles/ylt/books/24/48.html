<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>There is no more praise of Moab, In Heshbon they devised  against it evil: Come, and we cut it off from [being] a nation,  Also, O Madmen, thou art cut off, After thee goeth a sword.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>A voice of a cry [is] from Horonaim, Spoiling and great  destruction.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Destroyed hath been Moab, Caused a cry to be heard have her  little ones.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For the ascent of Luhith with weeping, Go up doth weeping,  For in the descent of Horonaim Adversaries a cry of desolation  have heard.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Flee ye, deliver yourselves, Ye are as a naked thing in a  wilderness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For, because of thy trusting in thy works, And in thy  treasures, even thou art captured, And gone out hath Chemosh in  a removal, His priests and his heads together.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And come in doth a spoiler unto every city, And no city  doth escape, And perished hath the valley, And destroyed been  the plain, as Jehovah said.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Give wings to Moab, for she utterly goeth out, And her  cities are for a desolation, Without an inhabitant in them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Cursed [is] he who is doing the work of Jehovah  slothfully, And cursed [is] he Who is withholding his sword  from blood.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Secure is Moab from his youth, And at rest [is] he for his  preserved things, And he hath not been emptied out from vessel  unto vessel, And into captivity he hath not gone, Therefore  hath his taste remained in him, And his fragrance hath not been  changed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore, lo, days are coming, An affirmation of Jehovah,  And I have sent to him wanderers, And they have caused him to  wander, And his vessels they empty out, And his bottles they  dash in pieces. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And ashamed hath been Moab because of Chemosh, As the  house of Israel have been ashamed Because of Beth-El their  confidence.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>How do ye say, We [are] mighty, And men of strength for  battle?</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Put to shame hath been Moab, For it hath been broken down,  Howl and cry, declare ye in Arnon, For spoiled is Moab,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And judgment hath come in unto the land of the plain &#8212;  unto Holon, And unto Jahazah, and on Mephaath,

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Cut down hath been the horn of Moab, And his arm hath been  broken, An affirmation of Jehovah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Declare ye him drunk, For against Jehovah he made himself  great And Moab hath stricken in his vomit, And he hath been for  a derision &#8212; even he. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And was not Israel the derision to thee? Among thieves was  he found? For since thy words concerning him, Thou dost bemoan  thyself.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Forsake cities, and dwell in a rock, Ye inhabitants of  Moab, And be as a dove making a nest in the passages of a pit&#8217;s  mouth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>We have heard of the arrogance of Moab, Exceeding proud!  His haughtiness, and his arrogance, And his pride, and the  height of his heart,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>I &#8212; I have known, an affirmation of Jehovah, His wrath,  and [it is] not right, His devices &#8212; not right they have done.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Therefore for Moab I howl, even for Moab &#8212; all of it, I  cry for men of Kir-Heres, it doth mourn,</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And removed hath been joy and gladness From the fruitful  field, Even from the land of Moab, And wine from wine-presses I  have caused to cease, Shouting doth not proceed, The shouting  [is] no shouting!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Because of the cry of Heshbon unto Elealeh, Unto Jahaz  they have given their voice, From Zoar unto Horonaim, A heifer  of the third [year], For even waters of Nimrim become  desolations. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And I have caused to cease to Moab, An affirmation of  Jehovah, Him who is offering in a high place, And him who is  making perfume to his god.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Therefore my heart for Moab as pipes doth sound, And my  heart for men of Kir-Heres As pipes doth sound, Therefore the  abundance he made did perish.

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>On all roofs of Moab, and in her broad-places, All of it  &#8212; [is] lamentation, For I have broken Moab as a vessel in  which there is no pleasure, An affirmation of Jehovah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>How hath it been broken down! they have howled, How hath  Moab turned the neck ashamed, And Moab hath been for a  derision. And for a terror to all round about her.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>Captured have been the cities, And the strongholds are  caught, And the heart of the mighty of Moab Hath been in that  day as the heart of a distressed woman.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>And Moab hath been destroyed from [being] a people, For  against Jehovah he exerted himself.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>Fear, and a snare, and a gin, [are] for thee, O inhabitant  of Moab &#8212; an affirmation of Jehovah,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>Whoso is fleeing because of the fear falleth into the  snare, And whoso is coming up from the snare is captured by the  gin, For I bring in unto her &#8212; unto Moab &#8212; The year of their  inspection, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>In the shadow of Heshbon stood powerless have fugitives,  For fire hath gone forth from Heshbon, And a flame from within  Sihon, And it consumeth the corner of Moab, And the crown of  the sons of Shaon.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>Wo to thee, O Moab, Perished hath the people of Chemosh,  For thy sons were taken with the captives, And thy daughters  with the captivity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>And I have turned back [to] the captivity of Moab, In the  latter end of the days, An affirmation of Jehovah! Hitherto  [is] the judgment of Moab.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
