<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8216;Thus said Jehovah: Lo, waters are coming up from the  north, And have been for an overflowing stream, And they  overflow the land and its fulness, The city, and the  inhabitants in it, And men have cried out, And howled hath  every inhabitant of the land.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>From the sound of the stamping of the hoofs of his mighty  ones, From the rushing of his chariot, the noise of his wheels,  Fathers have not turned unto sons, From feebleness of hands,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Because of the day that hath come to spoil all the  Philistines, To cut off to Tyre and to Zidon every helping  remnant. For Jehovah is spoiling the Philistines, The remnant  of the isle of Caphtor.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Come hath baldness unto Gaza, Cut off hath been Ashkelon, O  remnant of their valley, Till when dost thou cut thyself?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Ho, sword of Jehovah, till when art thou not quiet? Be  removed unto thy sheath, rest and cease.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>How shall it be quiet, And Jehovah hath given a charge to  it, Against Ashkelon, and against the sea shore? There hath He  appointed it!&#8217;</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
