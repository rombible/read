Wherefore hath Malcam  possessed Gad? And his people in its cities have dwelt?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Therefore, lo, days are coming, An affirmation of Jehovah,  And I have sounded unto Rabbah of the sons of Ammon a shout of  battle, And it hath been for a heap &#8212; a desolation, And her  daughters with fire are burnt, And Israel hath succeeded its  heirs, Said hath Jehovah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Howl, Heshbon, for spoiled is Ai, Cry, daughters of Rabbah,  gird on sackcloth, Lament, and go to and fro by the hedges, For  Malcam into captivity doth go, His priests and his princes  together.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>What &#8212; dost thou boast thyself in valleys? Flowed hath thy  valley, O backsliding daughter, Who is trusting in her  treasures: Who doth come in unto me?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Lo, I am bringing in upon thee a fear, An affirmation of  the Lord Jehovah of Hosts, From all round about thee, And ye  have been driven out each before it, And there is no gatherer  of the wandering.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And after this I turn back the captivity of the sons of  Ammon, An affirmation of Jehovah.&#8217;</p>
<p class="hdg">The Judgment on Edom</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Concerning Edom: &#8216;Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Is wisdom no  more in Teman? Perished hath counsel from the intelligent?  Vanished hath their wisdom?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Flee, turn, go deep to dwell, ye inhabitants of Dedan, For  the calamity of Esau I brought in upon him, The time I  inspected him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>If gatherers have come in to thee, They do not leave  gleanings, If thieves in the night, They have destroyed their  sufficiency!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For I &#8212; I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his  secret places, And to be hidden he is not able, Spoiled [is]  his seed, and his brethren, And his neighbours, and he is not.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Leave thine orphans &#8212; I do keep alive, And thy widows &#8212;  on Me trust ye,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For thus said Jehovah: They whose judgment is not to drink  of the cup, Do certainly drink, And thou [art] he that is  entirely acquitted! Thou art not acquitted, for thou certainly  drinkest. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For, by Myself, I have sworn, An affirmation of Jehovah,  That for a desolation, for a reproach, For a waste, and for a  reviling &#8212; is Bozrah, And all her cities are for wastes  age-during.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>A report I have heard from Jehovah, And an ambassador  among nations is sent, Gather yourselves and come in against  her, And rise ye for battle.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For, lo, little I have made thee among nations, Despised  among men.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Thy terribleness hath lifted thee up, The pride of thy  heart, O dweller in clefts of the rock, Holding the high place  of the height, For thou makest high as an eagle thy nest, From  thence I bring thee down, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And Edom hath been for a desolation, Every passer by her  is astonished, And doth hiss because of all her plagues. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>As the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, And its  neighbours, said Jehovah, No one doth dwell there, Nor sojourn  in her doth a son of man. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Lo, as a lion he cometh up, Because of the rising of the  Jordan, Unto the enduring habitation, But I cause to rest, I  cause him to run from off her, And who is chosen? concerning  her I lay a charge, For who is like Me? and who conveneth Me?  And who [is] this shepherd who standeth before Me?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Therefore, hear ye the counsel of Jehovah, That He hath  counselled concerning Edom, And His devices that He hath  devised Concerning the inhabitants of Teman: Drag them out do  not little ones of the flock, Make desolate over them doth he  not their habitation? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>From the noise of their fall hath the earth shaken, The  cry &#8212; at the sea of Suph is its voice heard. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Lo, as an eagle he cometh up, and flieth, And he spreadeth  his wings over Bozrah, And the heart of the mighty of Edom hath  been in that day, As the heart of a distressed woman!&#8217;</p>
<p class="hdg">The Judgment on Damascus</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Concerning Damascus: Ashamed hath been Hamath and Arpad,  For an evil report they have heard, They have been melted, in  the sea [is] sorrow, To be quiet it is not able.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Feeble hath been Damascus, She turned to flee, and fear  strengthened her, Distress and pangs have seized her, as a  travailing woman.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>How is it not left &#8212; the city of praise, The city of my  joy!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Therefore fall do her young men in her broad places, And  all the men of war are cut off in that day, An affirmation of  Jehovah of Hosts.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And I have kindled a fire against the wall of Damascus,  And it consumed palaces of Ben-Hadad!&#8217;</p>
<p class="hdg">The Judgment on Kedar and Hazor</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor,  that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath smitten: &#8216;Thus said  Jehovah: Arise ye, go ye up unto Kedar, And spoil the sons of  the east.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Their tents and their flock they do take, Their curtains,  and all their vessels, And their camels, they bear away for  themselves, And they called concerning them, Fear [is] round  about.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Flee, bemoan mightily, go deep to dwell, Ye inhabitants of  Hazor &#8212; an affirmation of Jehovah, For given counsel against  you hath Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, Yea, he deviseth  against them a device.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Rise ye, go up unto a nation at rest, Dwelling  confidently, an affirmation of Jehovah, It hath no two-leaved  doors nor bar, Alone they do dwell.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And their camels have been for a prey, And the multitude  of their cattle for a spoil, And I have scattered them to every  wind, Who cut off the corner [of the beard], And from all its  passages I bring in their calamity, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And Hazor hath been for a habitation of dragons, A  desolation &#8212; unto the age, No one doth dwell there, nor  sojourn in it doth a son of man!&#8217;</p>
