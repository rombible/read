<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The comely and the delicate one I have cut off, The daughter  of Zion.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Unto her come do shepherds and their droves, They have  stricken tents by her round about, They have fed each [in] his  own station.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Sanctify ye against her the battle, Rise, and we go up at  noon. Wo to us, for turned hath the day, For stretched out are  the shades of evening,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8216;Rise, and we go up by night, And we destroy her palaces.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Cut down her wood, And pour  out against Jerusalem a mount, She [is] the city to be  inspected, Wholly &#8212; she is oppression in her midst.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>As the digging of a well, is [for] its waters, So she hath  digged [for] her wickedness, Violence and spoil is heard in  her, Before My face continually [are] sickness and smiting.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Be instructed, O Jerusalem, Lest My soul be alienated from  thee, Lest I make thee a desolation, a land not inhabited.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: They surely glean, as a vine,  the remnant of Israel, Put back thy hand, as a gatherer to the  baskets.</p>

Lo, their  ear [is] uncircumcised, And they are not able to attend. Lo, a  word of Jehovah hath been to them for a reproach, They delight  not in it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And with the fury of Jehovah I have been filled, (I have  been weary of containing,) To pour [it] on the suckling in the  street, And on the assembly of youths together, For even  husband with wife are captured, An elder with one full of days,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And their houses have been turned to others, Fields and  wives together, For I stretch out My hand against the  inhabitants of the land, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For from their least unto their greatest, Every one is  gaining dishonest gain, And from prophet even unto priest,  Every one is dealing falsely,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And they heal the breach of the daughter of my people  slightly, Saying, &#8216;Peace, peace!&#8217; and there is no peace.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>They were ashamed when they did abomination! Yea, they are  not at all ashamed, Yea, blushing they have not known,  Therefore they do fall among those falling, In the time I have  inspected them, They stumble, said Jehovah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Thus said Jehovah: Stand ye by the ways and see, and ask  for paths of old, Where [is] this &#8212; the good way? and go ye in  it, And find rest for yourselves.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And I have raised up for you watchmen, Attend ye to the  voice of the trumpet. And they say, &#8216;We do not attend.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Therefore hear, O nations, and know, O company, That which  [is] upon them.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Why [is] this to Me? frankincense from Sheba cometh, And  the sweet cane from a land afar off, Your burnt-offerings [are]  not for acceptance, And your sacrifices have not been sweet to  Me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Therefore thus said Jehovah: Lo, I do give to this people  stumbling blocks, And stumbled against them have fathers and  sons together, The neighbour and his friend do perish.</p>
<p class="hdg">An Invasion from the North</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Thus said Jehovah: Lo, a people hath come from a north  country, And a great nation is stirred up from the sides of the  earth.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>&#8216;We have heard its sound, feeble have been our hands,  Distress hath seized us, pain as of a travailing woman.</p>
