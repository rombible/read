<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8216;Go, and thou hast called in the ears of Jerusalem, saying,  Thus said Jehovah: I have remembered for thee The kindness of  thy youth, the love of thine espousals, Thy going after Me in a  wilderness, in a land not sown.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Holy [is] Israel to Jehovah, The first-fruit of His  increase, All consuming him are guilty, Evil cometh in unto  them, an affirmation of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Hear a word of Jehovah, O house of Jacob, And all ye  families of the house of Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Thus said Jehovah: What &#8212; have your fathers found in Me  perversity, That they have gone far off from Me, And go after  the vanity, and become vain,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And have not said, Where [is] Jehovah, Who bringeth us up  out of the land of Egypt, Who leadeth us in a wilderness, In a  land of deserts and pits, In a dry land, and of death-shade, In  a land &#8212; none hath passed through it, Nor dwelt hath man  there?&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Yea, I bring you in to a land of fruitful fields, To eat its  fruit and its goodness, And ye come in and defile My land, And  Mine inheritance have made an abomination.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The priests have not said, &#8216;Where [is] Jehovah?&#8217; And those  handling the law have not known Me. And the shepherds  transgressed against Me, And the prophets have prophesied by  Baal, And after those who profit not have gone.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Therefore, yet I plead with you, An affirmation of Jehovah,  And with your sons&#8217; sons I plead.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For, pass to the isles of Chittim, and see, And to Kedar  send, and consider well, And see if there hath been like this:</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For two evils hath My people done, Me they have forsaken, a  fountain of living waters, To hew out for themselves wells &#8212;  broken wells, That contain not the waters.</p>
