<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Therefore, thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, Against the  shepherds who feed My people, Ye have scattered My flock, and  drive them away, And have not inspected them, Lo, I am charging  on you the evil of your doings, An affirmation of Jehovah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And I do gather the remnant of My flock Out of all the  lands whither I drove them, And have brought them back unto  their fold, And they have been fruitful, and multiplied. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And I have raised for them shepherds, And they have fed  them, And they fear no more, nor are affrighted, Nor are they  lacking &#8212; an affirmation of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Lo, days are coming &#8212; an affirmation of Jehovah, And I  have raised to David a righteous shoot, And a king hath reigned  and acted wisely, And done judgment and righteousness in the  earth.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Therefore, lo, days are coming, An affirmation of Jehovah,  And they do not say any more, Jehovah liveth who brought up The  sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt,

<p class="hdg">Lying Prophets</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>In reference to the prophets: Broken hath been my heart in  my midst, Fluttered have all my bones, I have been as a man &#8212;  a drunkard, And as a man &#8212; wine hath passed over him, Because  of Jehovah, and of His holy words.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For of adulterers hath the land been full, For because of  these hath the land mourned, Dried up hath been the pleasant  places of the wilderness, And their course is evil, and their  might &#8212; not right.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For both prophet and priest have been profane, Yea, in My  house I found their wickedness, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore is their way to them as slippery places, Into  thick darkness they are driven, And they have fallen in it, For  I bring in against them evil, The year of their inspection, An  affirmation of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And in prophets of Samaria I have seen folly, They have  prophesied by Baal, And cause my people &#8212; Israel &#8212; to err.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And in prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing,  Committing adultery, and walking falsely, Yea, they  strengthened the hands of evil doers, So that they have not  turned back Each from his wickedness, They have been to me &#8212;  all of them &#8212; as Sodom, And its inhabitants as Gomorrah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Therefore, thus said Jehovah of Hosts, concerning the  prophets: Lo, I am causing them to eat wormwood, And have  caused them to drink water of gall, For, from prophets of  Jerusalem Hath profanity gone forth to all the land.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Ye do not hearken unto the  words Of the prophets who are prophesying to you, They are  making you vain things, A vision of their own heart they speak,  Not from the mouth of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Saying diligently to those despising The word of Jehovah:  Peace is for you, And [to] every one walking in the  stubbornness of his heart they have said: Evil doth not come in  unto you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For who hath stood in the counsel of Jehovah, And seeth  and heareth His word? Who hath regarded My word, and  hearkeneth?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Lo, a whirlwind of Jehovah &#8212; Fury hath gone out, even a  piercing whirlwind, On the head of the wicked it stayeth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>The anger of Jehovah doth not turn back Till His doing,  and till His establishing, The thoughts of His heart, In the  latter end of the days ye attend to it With understanding.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>I have not sent the prophets, and they have run, I have  not spoken unto them, and they have prophesied.</p>
