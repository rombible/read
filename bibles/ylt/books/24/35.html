<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8216;Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and thou hast spoken  with them, and brought them into the house of Jehovah, unto one  of the chambers, and caused them to drink wine.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And I take Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah,  and his brethren, and all his sons, and all the house of the  Rechabites, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and bring them into the house of Jehovah, unto the chamber  of the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah, a man of God, that [is]  near to the chamber of the princes, that [is] above the chamber  of Maaseiah son of Shallum, keeper of the threshold; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and I put before the sons of the house of the Rechabites  goblets full of wine, and cups, and I say unto them, Drink ye  wine. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And they say, &#8216;We do not drink wine: for Jonadab son of  Rechab, our father, charged us, saying, Ye do not drink wine,  ye and your sons &#8212; unto the age; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and a house ye do not build, and seed ye do not sow, and a  vineyard ye do not plant, nor have ye any; for in tents do ye  dwell all your days, that ye may live many days on the face of  the ground whither ye are sojourning. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8216;And we hearken to the voice of Jonadab son of Rechab, our  father, to all that he commanded us, not to drink wine all our  days, we, our wives, our sons, and our daughters; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>nor to build houses for our dwelling; and vineyard, and  field, and seed, we have none; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and we dwell in tents, and we hearken, and we do according  to all that Jonadab our father commanded us; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and it cometh to pass, in the coming up of Nebuchadrezzar  king of Babylon unto the land, that we say, Come, and we enter  Jerusalem, because of the force of the Chaldeans, and because  of the force of Aram &#8212; and we dwell in Jerusalem.&#8217;</p>
<p class="hdg">Judah Rebuked</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And there is a word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah, saying:  &#8216;Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8216;Go, and thou hast said to the men of Judah, and to the  inhabitants of Jerusalem: Do ye not receive instruction? &#8212; to  hearken unto My words &#8212; an affirmation of Jehovah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Performed have been the words of Jonadab son of Rechab,  when he commanded his sons not to drink wine, and they have not  drunk unto this day, for they have obeyed the command of their  father; and I &#8212; I have spoken unto you, rising early and  speaking, and ye have not hearkened unto Me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And I send unto you all My servants the prophets, rising  early and sending, saying: Turn back, I pray you, each from his  evil way, and amend your doings, yea, ye do not walk after  other gods, to serve them, and dwell ye on the ground that I  have given to you and to your fathers; and ye have not inclined  your ear, nor hearkened unto Me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8216;Because the sons of Jonadab son of Rechab have performed  the command of their father, that he commanded them, and this  people have not hearkened unto Me, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>therefore thus said Jehovah, God of Hosts, God of Israel:  Lo, I am bringing in unto Judah, and unto all inhabitants of  Jerusalem, all the evil that I have spoken against them,  because I have spoken unto them, and they have not hearkened,  yea, I call to them, and they have not answered.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And to the house of the Rechabites said Jeremiah: &#8216;Thus  said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, Because that ye have  hearkened unto the command of Jonadab your father, and ye  observe all his commands, and do according to all that he  commanded you; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>therefore, thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, Of  Jonadab son of Rechab one standing before me is not cut off all  the days.&#8217;</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
