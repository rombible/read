<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And if they say, &#8216;Jehovah liveth,&#8217; Surely to a falsehood  they swear.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Jehovah, Thine eyes, are they not on stedfastness? Thou hast  smitten them, and they have not grieved, Thou hast consumed  them, They have refused to receive instruction, They made their  faces harder than a rock, They have refused to turn back.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And I &#8212; I said, &#8216;Surely these [are] poor, They have been  foolish, For they have not known the way of Jehovah, The  judgment of their God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>I get me to the great, and I speak with them, For they have  known the way of Jehovah, The judgment of their God.&#8217; Surely  they together have broken the yoke, They have drawn away the  bands.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Therefore smitten them hath a lion out of the forest, A wolf  of the deserts doth spoil them, A leopard is watching over  their cities, Every one who is going out of them is torn, For  many have been their transgressions, Mighty have been their  backslidings.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For this I am not propitious to thee, Thy sons have forsaken  Me, And are satisfied by that which is not god, I satisfy them,  and they commit adultery, And at the house of a harlot They  gather themselves together.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Fed horses &#8212; they have been early risers, Each to the wife  of his neighbour they neigh.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>They have lied against Jehovah, And they say, &#8216;[It is] not  He, Nor come in against us doth evil, Yea, sword and famine we  do not see.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And the prophets become wind, And the word is not in them,&#8217;  &#8212; thus it is done by them.</p>
