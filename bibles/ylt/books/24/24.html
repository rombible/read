<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>In the one basket [are] figs very good, like the first-ripe  figs, and in the other basket [are] figs very bad, that are not  eaten for badness. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Jehovah saith unto me, &#8216;What art thou seeing,  Jeremiah?&#8217; and I say, &#8216;Figs, the good figs [are] very good, and  the bad [are] very bad, that are not eaten for badness.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, Like these good figs so  do I acknowledge The removed of Judah &#8212; that I sent from this  place, [To] the land of the Chaldeans &#8212; for good. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And I have set Mine eyes on them for good, And have brought  them back to this land, And built them up, and I throw not  down, And have planted them, and pluck not up. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And have given to them a heart to know Me, For I [am]  Jehovah, And they have been to Me for a people, And I am to  them for God, For they turned back unto Me with all their  heart.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And like the bad figs, that are not eaten for badness,  Surely thus said Jehovah: So do I make Zedekiah king of Judah,  And his heads, and the remnant of Jerusalem, Who are left in  this land, And who are dwelling in the land of Egypt, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And I have given them for a trembling, For evil &#8212; to all  kingdoms of the earth, For a reproach, and for a simile, For a  byword, and for a reviling, In all the places whither I drive  them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And I have sent against them the sword, The famine and the  pestilence, Till their consumption from off the ground, That I  gave to them and to their fathers!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
