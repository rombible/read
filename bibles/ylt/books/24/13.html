<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and I get the girdle, according to the word of Jehovah, and  I place [it] on my loins. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And there is a word of Jehovah unto me a second time,  saying, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8216;Take the girdle that thou hast got, that [is] on thy  loins, and rise, go to Phrat, and hide it there in a hole of  the rock; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and I go and hide it by Phrat, as Jehovah commanded me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And it cometh to pass, at the end of many days, that  Jehovah saith unto me, &#8216;Rise, go to Phrat, and take thence the  girdle, that I commanded thee to hide there;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and I go to Phrat, and dig, and take the girdle from the  place where I had hid it; and lo, the girdle hath been marred,  it is not profitable for anything.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying, &#8216;Thus said  Jehovah: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Thus do I mar the excellency of Judah, And the great  excellency of Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>This evil people, who refuse to hear My words, Who walk in  the stubbornness of their heart, And go after other gods to  serve them, And to bow themselves to them, Yea it is &#8212; as this  girdle, that is not profitable for anything. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For, as the girdle cleaveth unto the loins of a man, So I  caused to cleave unto Me The whole house of Israel, And the  whole house of Judah, an affirmation of Jehovah, To be to Me  for a people, and for a name, And for praise, and for beauty,  And they have not hearkened.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Wineskins</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And thou hast said unto them this word, Thus said Jehovah,  God of Israel, &#8216;Every bottle is full of wine,&#8217; And they have  said unto thee: &#8216;Do we not certainly know that every bottle is  full of wine?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And thou hast said unto them, &#8216;Thus said Jehovah: Lo, I am  filling all the inhabitants of this land, And the kings who sit  for David on his throne, And the priests, and the prophets, And  all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, [With] drunkenness, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And have dashed them one against another, And the fathers  and the sons together, An affirmation of Jehovah, I do not  pity, nor spare, nor have I mercy, So as not to destroy them.</p>
<p class="hdg">Captivity Threatened</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Hear, and give ear &#8212; be not haughty, For Jehovah hath  spoken.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Give ye to Jehovah your God honour, Before He doth cause  darkness, And before your feet stumble on dark mountains, And  ye have waited for light, And He hath made it for death-shade,  And hath appointed [it] for thick darkness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And if ye do not hear it, In secret places doth my soul  weep, because of pride, Yea, it weepeth sore, And the tear  cometh down mine eyes, For the flock of Jehovah hath been taken  captive.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Say to the king and to the mistress: Make yourselves low  &#8212; sit still, For come down have your principalities, The crown  of your beauty.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>The cities of the south have been shut up, And there is  none opening, Judah hath been removed &#8212; all of her, She hath  been removed completely &#8212;</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>What dost thou say, when He looketh after thee? And thou  &#8212; thou hast taught them [to be] over thee &#8212; leaders for head?  Do not pangs seize thee as a travailing woman?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And when thou dost say in thy heart, &#8216;Wherefore have these  met me?&#8217; For the abundance of thine iniquity Have thy skirts  been uncovered, Have thy heels suffered violence.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Doth a Cushite change his skin? and a leopard his spots?  Ye also are able to do good, who are accustomed to do evil.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>I also have made bare thy skirts before thy face, And thy  shame hath been seen.</p>
