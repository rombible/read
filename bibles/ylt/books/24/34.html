<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>to send out each his man-servant, and each his maid-servant  &#8212; the Hebrew and the Hebrewess &#8212; free, so as not to lay  service on them, any on a Jew his brother; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and hearken do all the heads, and all the people who have  come in to the covenant to send forth each his man-servant and  each his maid-servant free, so as not to lay service on them  any more, yea, they hearken, and send them away; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and they turn afterwards, and cause the men-servants and  the maid-servants to return, whom they had sent forth free, and  they subdue them for men-servants and for maid-servants.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And there is a word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah from Jehovah,  saying: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8216;Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, I &#8212; I made a covenant  with your fathers in the day of My bringing them forth from the  land of Egypt, from a house of servants, saying,

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8216;And ye turn back, ye to-day, and ye do that which is  right in Mine eyes, to proclaim liberty each to his neighbour,  and ye make a covenant before Me in the house over which My  name is called. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And &#8212; ye turn back, and pollute My name, and ye cause  each his man-servant and each his maid-servant, whom he had  sent forth free, (at their pleasure,) to return, and ye subdue  them to be to you for men-servants and for maid-servants.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8216;Therefore, thus said Jehovah: Ye have not hearkened unto  Me to proclaim freedom, each to his brother, and each to his  neighbour; lo, I am proclaiming to you liberty &#8212; an  affirmation of Jehovah &#8212; unto the sword, unto the pestilence,  and unto the famine, and I have given you for a trembling to  all kingdoms of the earth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8216;And I have given the men who are transgressing My  covenant, who have not established the words of the covenant  that they have made before Me, by the calf, that they have cut  in two, and pass through between its pieces &#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>heads of Judah, and heads of Jerusalem, the officers, and  the priests, and all the people of the land those passing  through between the pieces of the calf &#8212;

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Lo, I am commanding &#8212; an affirmation of Jehovah &#8212; and  have brought them back unto this city, and they have fought  against it, and captured it, and burned it with fire, and the  cities of Judah I do make a desolation &#8212; without inhabitant.&#8217;</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
