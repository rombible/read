<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And have spread them to sun, and to moon, And to all the  host of the heavens, that they have loved, And that they have  served, And that they have walked after, And that they have  sought, And to which they have bowed themselves, They are not  gathered, nor buried, They are for dung on the face of the  ground. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And chosen is death rather than life By all the remnant who  are left of this evil family, In all the remaining places,  whither I have driven them, An affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Ashamed have been the wise, They have been affrighted, and  are captured, Lo, against a word of Jehovah they kicked, And  the wisdom of what &#8212; have they?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Therefore, I give their wives to others, Their fields to  dispossessors, For from the least even unto the greatest, Every  one is gaining dishonest gain, From prophet even unto priest,  every one is dealing falsely.</p>
