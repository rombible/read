And I weep by day and by night, For the wounded of the  daughter of my people.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Who doth give me in a wilderness A lodging-place of  travellers? And I leave my people, and go from them, For all of  them [are] adulterers, An assembly of treacherous ones.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And they bend their tongue, their bow [is] a lie, And not  for stedfastness have they been mighty in the land, For from  evil unto evil they have gone forth, And Me they have not  known, An affirmation of Jehovah!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Each of his friend &#8212; beware ye, And on any brother, do not  trust, For every brother doth utterly supplant, For every  friend slanderously doth walk,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And each at his friend they mock, And truth they do not  speak, They taught their tongue to speak falsehood, To commit  iniquity they have laboured.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>thy dwelling [is] in the midst of deceit, Through deceit  they refused to know Me, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Therefore, thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Lo, I am refining  them, and have tried them, For how do I do because of the  daughter of My people?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>A slaughtering arrow [is] their tongue, Deceit it hath  spoken in its mouth, Peace with its neighbour it speaketh, And  in its heart it layeth its ambush,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For these things do not I see after them? An affirmation of  Jehovah, Against a nation such as this doth not My soul avenge  itself?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For the mountains I lift up weeping and wailing, And for  the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, For they have  been burnt up without any passing over, Nor have they heard the  voice of cattle, From the fowl of the heavens unto the beast  they have fled, they have gone.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And I make Jerusalem become heaps, A habitation of dragons,  And the cities of Judah I make a desolation, Without  inhabitant.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Who [is] the wise man? and he understandeth this, And he to  whom the mouth of Jehovah spake? And he doth declare it, For  what hath the land perished? It hath been burnt up as a  wilderness, Without any passing through. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And Jehovah saith: Because of their forsaking My law that I  set before them, And they have not hearkened to My voice nor  walked in it, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And they walk after the stubbornness of their heart, And  after the Baalim, that their fathers taught them, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Therefore, thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel: Lo, I  am causing them &#8212; this people &#8212; to eat wormwood, And I have  caused them to drink water of gall, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And I have scattered them among nations Which they knew  not, they and their fathers, And have sent after them the  sword, Till I have consumed them.</p>
<p class="hdg">Weeping in Jerusalem</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Consider ye, and call for  mourning women, And they come, And to the wise women send, and  they come,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And they hasten, and lift up for us a wailing. And run down  our eyes do tears, And from our eyelids do waters flow.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For &#8212; a voice of wailing is heard from Zion: How have we  been spoiled! We have been greatly ashamed, Because we have  forsaken the land, Because they have cast down our tabernacles.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But hear, ye women, a word of Jehovah, And your ear  receiveth a word of His mouth, And teach ye your daughters  wailing, and each her neighbour lamentation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For death hath come up into our windows, It hath come into  our palaces, To cut off the suckling from without, Young men  from the broad places.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Speak thus &#8212; an affirmation of Jehovah, And fallen hath  the carcase of man, As dung on the face of the field, And as a  handful after the reaper, And there is none gathering.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Thus said Jehovah: Let not the wise boast himself in his  wisdom, Nor let the mighty boast himself in his might, Let not  the rich boast himself in his riches, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>But &#8212; in this let the boaster boast himself, In  understanding and knowing Me, For I [am] Jehovah, doing  kindness, Judgment, and righteousness, in the earth, For in  these I have delighted, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Lo, days are coming &#8212; an affirmation of Jehovah, And I  have laid a charge on all circumcised in the foreskin, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>On Egypt, and on Judah, and on Edom, And on the sons of  Ammon, and on Moab, And on all cutting the corner [of the  beard], Who are dwelling in the wilderness, For all the nations  [are] uncircumcised, And all the house of Israel [are]  uncircumcised in heart!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
