<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>As their sons remember their altars and their shrines, By  the green tree, by the high hills.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>O My mountain in the field &#8212; thy strength, All thy  treasures &#8212; for a prey I give, Thy high places for sin in all  thy borders.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And thou hast let go &#8212; even through thyself, Of thine  inheritance that I gave to thee, And I have caused thee to  serve thine enemies, In a land that thou hast not known, For a  fire ye have kindled in Mine anger, Unto the age it doth burn.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Thus said Jehovah: Cursed [is] the man who doth trust in  man, And hath made flesh his arm, And from Jehovah whose heart  turneth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And he hath been as a naked thing in a desert, And doth not  see when good cometh, And hath inhabited parched places in a  wilderness, A salt land, and not inhabited.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Blessed [is] the man who trusteth in Jehovah, And whose  confidence hath been Jehovah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And hath been as a tree planted by waters, And by a rivulet  he sendeth forth his roots, And he doth not see when heat  cometh, And his leaf hath been green, And in a year of dearth  he is not sorrowful, Nor doth he cease from making fruit.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Crooked [is] the heart above all things, And it [is]  incurable &#8212; who doth know it?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>I Jehovah do search the heart, try the reins, Even to give  to each according to his way, According to the fruit of his  doings.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>A partridge hatching, and not bringing forth, [Is] one  making wealth, and not by right, In the midst of his days he  doth forsake it, And in his latter end &#8212; he is a fool.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And I hastened not from feeding after Thee, And the  desperate day I have not desired, Thou &#8212; Thou hast known, The  produce of my lips, before Thy face it hath been,</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Thus said Jehovah, Take ye heed to yourselves, And ye bear  not a burden on the day of rest, Nor have ye brought [it] in by  the gates of Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Nor do ye take out a burden from your houses on the day of  rest, Yea, any work ye do not do, And ye have sanctified the  day of rest, As I have commanded your fathers. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And they have not hearkened nor inclined their ear, And  they stiffen their neck not to hear, And not to receive  instruction.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And it hath been, if ye certainly hearken unto Me, An  affirmation of Jehovah, So as not to bring in a burden By the  gates of this city on the day of rest, And to sanctify the day  of rest, So as not to do in it any work &#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then entered by the gates of this city have kings and  princes, Sitting on the throne of David, Riding in a chariot,  and on horses, They, and their princes, the man of Judah, And  inhabitants of Jerusalem, And this city hath remained to the  age. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And they have come in from cities of Judah, And from  suburbs of Jerusalem, And from the land of Benjamin, And from  the low country, And from the hill-country, and from the south,  Bringing in burnt-offering, and sacrifice, And present, and  frankincense, And bringing praise [to] the house of Jehovah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And if ye do not hearken unto me to sanctify the day of  rest, And so as not to bear a burden, And to come in at the  gates of Jerusalem on the day of rest, Then I have kindled a  fire in its gates, And it hath consumed the high places of  Jerusalem, And it is not quenched!&#8217;</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
