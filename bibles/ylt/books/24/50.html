<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8216;Declare ye among nations, and sound, And lift up an  ensign, sound, do not hide, Say ye: Captured hath been Babylon,  Put to shame hath been Bel, Broken hath been Merodach, Put to  shame have been her grievous things, Broken have been her  idols.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For come up against her hath a nation from the north, It  maketh her land become a desolation, And there is not an  inhabitant in it.
