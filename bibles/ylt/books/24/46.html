<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For Egypt, concerning the force of Pharaoh-Necho king of  Egypt, that hath been by the river Phrat, in Carchemish, that  Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath smitten, in the fourth year  of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8216;Set ye in array shield and buckler, And draw nigh to  battle.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Gird the horses, and go up, ye horsemen, And station  yourselves with helmets, Polish the javelins, put on the coats  of mail.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Wherefore have I seen them dismayed &#8212; They are turned  backward, And their mighty ones are beaten down, And [to] a  refuge they have fled, and not turned the face? Fear [is] round  about &#8212; an affirmation of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>The swift do not flee, nor do the mighty escape, Northward,  by the side of the river Phrat, They have stumbled and fallen.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Who is this? as a flood he cometh up, As rivers do his  waters shake themselves!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Egypt, as a flood cometh up, And as rivers the waters shake  themselves. And he saith, I go up; I cover the land, I destroy  the city and the inhabitants in it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Go up, ye horses; and boast yourselves, ye chariots, And go  forth, ye mighty, Cush and Phut handling the shield, And Lud  handling &#8212; treading the bow.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And that day [is] to the Lord Jehovah of Hosts A day of  vengeance, To be avenged of His adversaries, And the sword hath  devoured, and been satisfied, And it hath been watered from  their blood, For a sacrifice [is] to the Lord Jehovah of Hosts,  In the land of the north, by the river Phrat.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Go up to Gilead, and take balm, O virgin daughter of  Egypt, In vain thou hast multiplied medicines, Healing there is  none for thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Nations have heard of thy shame, And thy cry hath filled  the land, For the mighty on the mighty did stumble, Together  they have fallen &#8212; both of them!&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The word that Jehovah hath spoken unto Jeremiah the  prophet concerning the coming in of Nebuchadrezzar king of  Babylon, to smite the land of Egypt:</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Wherefore hath thy bull been swept away? He hath not  stood, because Jehovah thrust him away.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>He hath multiplied the stumbling, Yea one hath fallen upon  his neighbour, And they say: Rise, and we turn back to our  people, And unto the land of our birth, Because of the  oppressing sword.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>They have cried there: Pharaoh king of Egypt [is] a  desolation, Passed by hath the appointed time.</p>
