<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8216;Thus said Jehovah: He who is remaining in this city dieth,  by sword, by famine, and by pestilence, and he who is going  forth unto the Chaldeans liveth, and his soul hath been to him  for a prey, and he liveth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Thus said Jehovah: This city is certainly given into the  hand of the force of the king of Babylon, and he hath captured  it.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the heads say unto the king, &#8216;Let, we pray thee, this  man be put to death, because that he is making feeble the hands  of the men of war, who are left in this city, and the hands of  all the people, by speaking unto them according to these words,  for this man is not seeking for the peace of this people, but  for its evil.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the king Zedekiah saith, &#8216;Lo, he [is] in your hand: for  the king is not able for you [in] anything.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And they take Jeremiah, and cast him into the pit of  Malchiah son of the king, that [is] in the court of the prison,  and they send down Jeremiah with cords; and in the pit there is  no water, but mire, and Jeremiah sinketh in the mire.</p>
