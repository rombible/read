<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Rise, and thou hast gone down [to] the potter&#8217;s house, and  there I cause thee to hear My words; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and I go down [to] the potter&#8217;s house, and lo, he is doing  a work on the stones, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and marred is the vessel that he is making, as clay in the  hand of the potter, and he hath turned and he maketh it another  vessel, as it was right in the eyes of the potter to make.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And there is a word of Jehovah to me, saying: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>As this potter am I not able to do to you? O house of  Israel, an affirmation of Jehovah. Lo, as clay in the hand of  the potter, So [are] ye in My hand, O house of Israel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The moment I speak concerning a nation, And concerning a  kingdom, To pluck up and to break down, and to destroy, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And that nation hath turned from its evil, Because I have  spoken against it, Then I have repented of the evil that I  thought to do to it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And the moment I speak concerning a nation, And concerning  a kingdom, to build, and to plant, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And it hath done the evil thing in Mine eyes, So as not to  hearken to My voice, Then I have repented of the good That I  have spoken of doing to it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And now, speak, I pray thee, unto men of Judah, And  against inhabitants of Jerusalem, Saying: Thus said Jehovah:  Lo, I am framing against you evil, And devising against you a  device, Turn back, I pray you, each from his evil way And amen  your ways and your doings. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And they have said, It is incurable, For after our own  devices we do go, And each the stubbornness of his evil heart  we do.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Therefore, thus said Jehovah: Ask, I pray you, among the  nations, Who hath heard like these? A very horrible thing hath  the virgin of Israel done.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Doth snow of Lebanon Cease from the rock of the field?  Failed are the cold strange waters that flow?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But My people have forgotten Me, to a vain thing they make  perfume, And they cause them to stumble in their ways &#8212; paths  of old, To walk in paths &#8212; a way not raised up,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>To make their land become a desolation, A hissing  age-during, Every passer by it is astonished, And bemoaneth  with his head.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>As an east wind I scatter them before an enemy, The neck,  and not the face, I shew them, In the day of their calamity.&#8217;</p>
