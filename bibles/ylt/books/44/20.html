<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>having made also three months&#8217; [stay] &#8212; a counsel of the  Jews having been against him &#8212; being about to set forth to  Syria, there came [to him] a resolution of returning through  Macedonia. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And there were accompanying him unto Asia, Sopater of  Berea, and of Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus, and  Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus, and of Asiatics Tychicus and  Trophimus;

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and there was sitting a certain youth, by name Eutychus,  upon the window &#8212; being borne down by a deep sleep, Paul  discoursing long &#8212; he having sunk down from the sleep, fell  down from the third story, and was lifted up dead. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And Paul, having gone down, fell upon him, and having  embraced [him], said, &#8216;Make no tumult, for his life is in  him;&#8217;

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>serving the Lord with all humility, and many tears, and  temptations, that befell me in the counsels of the Jews against  [me]; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>how nothing I did keep back of what things are profitable,  not to declare to you, and to teach you publicly, and in every  house, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>testifying fully both to Jews and Greeks, toward God  reformation, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>&#8216;And now, lo, I &#8212; bound in the Spirit &#8212; go on to  Jerusalem, the things that shall befall me in it not knowing, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>save that the Holy Spirit in every city doth testify  fully, saying, that for me bonds and tribulations remain; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>but I make account of none of these, neither do I count my  life precious to myself, so that I finish my course with joy,  and the ministration that I received from the Lord Jesus, to  testify fully the good news of the grace of God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>&#8216;And now, lo, I have known that no more shall ye see my  face, &#8212; ye all among whom I did go preaching the reign of God; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>wherefore I take you to witness this day, that I [am]  clear from the blood of all, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>for I did not keep back from declaring to you all the  counsel of God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>&#8216;Take heed, therefore, to yourselves, and to all the  flock, among which the Holy Spirit made you overseers, to feed  the assembly of God that He acquired through His own blood, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>for I have known this, that there shall enter in, after my  departing, grievous wolves unto you, not sparing the flock,

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>&#8216;Therefore, watch, remembering that three years, night and  day, I did not cease with tears warning each one; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>and now, I commend you, brethren, to God, and to the word  of His grace, that is able to build up, and to give you an  inheritance among all those sanctified.

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>all things I did shew you, that, thus labouring, it  behoveth [us] to partake with the ailing, to be mindful also of  the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is more  blessed to give than to receive.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>And these things having said, having bowed his knees, with  them all, he did pray,
