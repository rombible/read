<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8216;Concerning all things of which I am accused by Jews, king  Agrippa, I have thought myself happy, being about to make a  defence before thee to-day, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>especially knowing thee to be acquainted with all things &#8212;  both customs and questions &#8212; among Jews; wherefore, I beseech  thee, patiently to hear me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8216;The manner of my life then, indeed, from youth &#8212; which  from the beginning was among my nation, in Jerusalem &#8212; know do  all the Jews, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>knowing me before from the first, (if they may be willing  to testify,) that after the most exact sect of our worship, I  lived a Pharisee; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and now for the hope of the promise made to the fathers by  God, I have stood judged, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>to which our twelve tribes, intently night and day serving,  do hope to come, concerning which hope I am accused, king  Agrippa, by the Jews; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>why is it judged incredible with you, if God doth raise the  dead?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8216;I, indeed, therefore, thought with myself, that against  the name of Jesus of Nazareth it behoved [me] many things to  do, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>which also I did in Jerusalem, and many of the saints I in  prison did shut up, from the chief priests having received the  authority; they also being put to death, I gave my vote against  them, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and in every synagogue, often punishing them, I was  constraining [them] to speak evil, being also exceedingly mad  against them, I was also persecuting [them] even unto strange  cities.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8216;In which things, also, going on to Damascus &#8212; with  authority and commission from the chief priests &#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>at mid-day, I saw in the way, O king, out of heaven, above  the brightness of the sun, shining round about me a light &#8212;  and those going on with me; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and we all having fallen to the earth, I heard a voice  speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew dialect, Saul, Saul,  why me dost thou persecute? hard for thee against pricks to  kick! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8216;And I said, Who art thou, Lord? and he said, I am Jesus  whom thou dost persecute; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>but rise, and stand upon thy feet, for for this I appeared  to thee, to appoint thee an officer and a witness both of the  things thou didst see, and of the things [in which] I will  appear to thee, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>delivering thee from the people, and the nations, to whom  now I send thee, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>to open their eyes, to turn [them] from darkness to light,  and [from] the authority of the Adversary unto God, for their  receiving forgiveness of sins, and a lot among those having  been sanctified, by faith that [is] toward me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>&#8216;Whereupon, king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the  heavenly vision, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>but to those in Damascus first, and to those in Jerusalem,  to all the region also of Judea, and to the nations, I was  preaching to reform, and to turn back unto God, doing works  worthy of reformation; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>because of these things the Jews &#8212; having caught me in  the temple &#8212; were endeavouring to kill [me]. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>&#8216;Having obtained, therefore, help from God, till this day,  I have stood witnessing both to small and to great, saying  nothing besides the things that both the prophets and Moses  spake of as about to come, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>that the Christ is to suffer, whether first by a rising  from the dead, he is about to proclaim light to the people and  to the nations.&#8217;</p>
<p class="hdg">Festus Interrupts Paul's Defense</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And, he thus making a defence, Festus with a loud voice  said, &#8216;Thou art mad, Paul; much learning doth turn thee mad;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>and he saith, &#8216;I am not mad, most noble Festus, but of  truth and soberness the sayings I speak forth; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>for the king doth know concerning these things, before  whom also I speak boldly, for none of these things, I am  persuaded, are hidden from him; for this thing hath not been  done in a corner; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>thou dost believe, king Agrippa, the prophets? I have  known that thou dost believe!&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And Agrippa said unto Paul, &#8216;In a little thou dost  persuade me to become a Christian!&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>and Paul said, &#8216;I would have wished to God, both in a  little, and in much, not only thee, but also all those hearing  me to-day, to become such as I also am &#8212; except these bonds.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And, he having spoken these things, the king rose up, and  the governor, Bernice also, and those sitting with them, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>and having withdrawn, they were speaking unto one another,  saying &#8212; &#8216;This man doth nothing worthy of death or of bonds;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>and Agrippa said to Festus, &#8216;This man might have been  released if he had not appealed to Caesar.&#8217;</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
