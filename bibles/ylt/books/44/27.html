<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and having embarked in a ship of Adramyttium, we, being  about to sail by the coasts of Asia, did set sail, there being  with us Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>on the next [day] also we touched at Sidon, and Julius,  courteously treating Paul, did permit [him], having gone on  unto friends, to receive [their] care. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And thence, having set sail, we sailed under Cyprus,  because of the winds being contrary, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and having sailed over the sea over-against Cilicia and  Pamphylia, we came to Myria of Lycia, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and there the centurion having found a ship of Alexandria,  sailing to Italy, did put us into it, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and having sailed slowly many days, and with difficulty  coming over-against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we  sailed under Crete, over-against Salmone, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and hardly passing it, we came to a certain place called  &#8216;Fair Havens,&#8217; nigh to which was the city [of] Lasaea.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And much time being spent, and the sailing being now  dangerous &#8212; because of the fast also being already past &#8212;  Paul was admonishing, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>saying to them, &#8216;Men, I perceive that with hurt, and much  damage, not only of the lading and of the ship, but also of  our lives &#8212; the voyage is about to be;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>but the centurion to the pilot and to the shipowner gave  credence more than to the things spoken by Paul; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and the haven being incommodious to winter in, the more  part gave counsel to sail thence also, if by any means they  might be able, having attained to Phenice, [there] to winter,  [which is] a haven of Crete, looking to the south-west and  north-west,</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and not long after there arose against it a tempestuous  wind, that is called Euroclydon, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and the ship being caught, and not being able to bear up  against the wind, having given [her] up, we were borne on, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and having run under a certain little isle, called Clauda,  we were hardly able to become masters of the boat, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>which having taken up, they were using helps, undergirding  the ship, and fearing lest they may fall on the quicksand,  having let down the mast &#8212; so were borne on. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And we, being exceedingly tempest-tossed, the succeeding  [day] they were making a clearing, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>and on the third [day] with our own hands the tackling of  the ship we cast out, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and neither sun nor stars appearing for more days, and not  a little tempest lying upon us, thenceforth all hope was taken  away of our being saved.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And there having been long fasting, then Paul having stood  in the midst of them, said, &#8216;It behoved [you], indeed, O men  &#8212; having hearkened to me &#8212; not to set sail from Crete, and to  save this hurt and damage; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>and now I exhort you to be of good cheer, for there shall  be no loss of life among you &#8212; but of the ship; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>for there stood by me this night a messenger of God &#8212;  whose I am, and whom I serve &#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>saying, Be not afraid Paul; before Caesar it behoveth thee  to stand; and, lo, God hath granted to thee all those sailing  with thee; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>wherefore be of good cheer, men! for I believe God, that  so it shall be, even as it hath been spoken to me, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>and on a certain island it behoveth us to be cast.&#8217;</p>
<p class="hdg">The Shipwreck on Malta</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And when the fourteenth night came &#8212; we being borne up  and down in the Adria &#8212; toward the middle of the night the  sailors were supposing that some country drew nigh to them; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>and having sounded they found twenty fathoms, and having  gone a little farther, and again having sounded, they found  fifteen fathoms, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>and fearing lest on rough places we may fall, out of the  stern having cast four anchors, they were wishing day to come. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And the sailors seeking to flee out of the ship, and  having let down the boat to the sea, in pretence as [if] out of  the foreship they are about to cast anchors, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, &#8216;If these  do not remain in the ship &#8212; ye are not able to be saved;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>then the soldiers did cut off the ropes of the boat, and  suffered it to fall off.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And till the day was about to be, Paul was calling upon  all to partake of nourishment, saying, &#8216;Fourteen days to-day,  waiting, ye continue fasting, having taken nothing, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>wherefore I call upon you to take nourishment, for this is  for your safety, for of not one of you shall a hair from the  head fall;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>and having said these things, and having taken bread, he  gave thanks to God before all, and having broken [it], he began  to eat; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>and all having become of good cheer, themselves also took  food, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>(and we were &#8212; all the souls in the ship &#8212; two hundred,  seventy and six), 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>and having eaten sufficient nourishment, they were  lightening the ship, casting forth the wheat into the sea.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>And when the day came, they were not discerning the land,  but a certain creek were perceiving having a beach, into which  they took counsel, if possible, to thrust forward the ship, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>and the anchors having taken up, they were committing [it]  to the sea, at the same time &#8212; having loosed the bands of the  rudders, and having hoisted up the mainsail to the wind &#8212; they  were making for the shore, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>and having fallen into a place of two seas, they ran the  ship aground, and the fore-part, indeed, having stuck fast,  did remain immoveable, but the hinder-part was broken by the  violence of the waves. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>And the soldiers&#8217; counsel was that they should kill the  prisoners, lest any one having swam out should escape, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>but the centurion, wishing to save Paul, hindered them  from the counsel, and did command those able to swim, having  cast themselves out first &#8212; to get unto the land, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>and the rest, some indeed upon boards, and some upon  certain things of the ship; and thus it came to pass that all  came safe unto the land.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
