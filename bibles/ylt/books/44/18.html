<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and having found a certain Jew, by name Aquilas, of Pontus  by birth, lately come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife &#8212;  because of Claudius having directed all the Jews to depart out  of Rome &#8212; he came to them, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and because of being of the same craft, he did remain with  them, and was working, for they were tent-makers as to craft; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and he was reasoning in the synagogue every sabbath,  persuading both Jews and Greeks.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And the Lord said through a vision in the night to Paul,  &#8216;Be not afraid, but be speaking and thou mayest be not silent; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>because I am with thee, and no one shall set on thee to do  thee evil; because I have much people in this city;&#8217;

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and Paul being about to open [his] mouth, Gallio said unto  the Jews, &#8216;If, indeed, then, it was anything unrighteous, or an  act of wicked profligacy, O Jews, according to reason I had  borne with you, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>but if it is a question concerning words and names, and of  your law, look ye yourselves [to it], for a judge of these  things I do not wish to be,&#8217;
