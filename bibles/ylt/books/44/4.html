<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>being grieved because of their teaching the people, and  preaching in Jesus the rising again out of the dead &#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and they laid hands upon them, and did put them in custody  unto the morrow, for it was evening already; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and many of those hearing the word did believe, and the  number of the men became, as it were, five thousand.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And it came to pass upon the morrow, there were gathered  together of them the rulers, and elders, and scribes, to  Jerusalem, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and Annas the chief priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and  Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the chief  priest, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and having set them in the midst, they were inquiring, &#8216;In  what power, or in what name did ye do this?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Peter, having been filled with the Holy Spirit, said  unto them: &#8216;Rulers of the people, and elders of Israel, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>if we to-day are examined concerning the good deed to the  ailing man, by whom he hath been saved, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>be it known to all of you, and to all the people of Israel,  that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye did  crucify, whom God did raise out of the dead, in him hath this  one stood by before you whole. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8216;This is the stone that was set at nought by you &#8212; the  builders, that became head of a corner; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and there is not salvation in any other, for there is no  other name under the heaven that hath been given among men, in  which it behoveth us to be saved.&#8217;</p>
<p class="hdg">Peter and John Threatened, Released</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And beholding the openness of Peter and John, and having  perceived that they are men unlettered and plebeian, they were  wondering &#8212; they were taking knowledge also of them that with  Jesus they had been &#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and seeing the man standing with them who hath been healed,  they had nothing to say against [it], 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and having commanded them to go away out of the sanhedrim,  they took counsel with one another, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>saying, &#8216;What shall we do to these men? because that,  indeed, a notable sign hath been done through them, to all  those dwelling in Jerusalem [is] manifest, and we are not able  to deny [it]; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>but that it may spread no further toward the people, let us  strictly threaten them no more to speak in this name to any  man.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And having called them, they charged them not to speak at  all, nor to teach, in the name of Jesus, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>and Peter and John answering unto them said, &#8216;Whether it is  righteous before God to hearken to you rather than to God,  judge ye; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>for we cannot but speak what we did see and hear.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And they having further threatened [them], let them go,  finding nothing how they may punish them, because of the  people, because all were glorifying God for that which hath  been done, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>for above forty years of age was the man upon whom had been  done this sign of the healing.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>and they having heard, with one accord did lift up the  voice unto God, and said, &#8216;Lord, thou [art] God, who didst  make the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all that  [are] in them,</p>
