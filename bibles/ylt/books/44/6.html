<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and the twelve, having called near the multitude of the  disciples, said, &#8216;It is not pleasing that we, having left the  word of God, do minister at tables; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>look out, therefore, brethren, seven men of you who are well  testified of, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may  set over this necessity, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and we to prayer, and to the ministration of the word, will  give ourselves continually.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the thing was pleasing before all the multitude, and  they did choose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy  Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and  Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>whom they did set before the apostles, and they, having  prayed, laid on them [their] hands.</p>

<p class="hdg">Stephen Arrested</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Stephen, full of faith and power, was doing great  wonders and signs among the people, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and there arose certain of those of the synagogue, called of  the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of those  from Cilicia, and Asia, disputing with Stephen, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit  with which he was speaking; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>then they suborned men, saying &#8212; &#8216;We have heard him  speaking evil sayings in regard to Moses and God.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>They did stir up also the people, and the elders, and the  scribes, and having come upon [him], they caught him, and  brought [him] to the sanhedrim; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>they set up also false witnesses, saying, &#8216;This one doth  not cease to speak evil sayings against this holy place and the  law, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>for we have heard him saying, That this Jesus the Nazarean  shall overthrow this place, and shall change the customs that  Moses delivered to us;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and gazing at him, all those sitting in the sanhedrim saw  his face as it were the face of a messenger.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
