<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and a certain man, being lame from the womb of his mother,  was being carried, whom they were laying every day at the gate  of the temple, called Beautiful, to ask a kindness from those  entering into the temple, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>who, having seen Peter and John about to go into the temple,  was begging to receive a kindness. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And Peter, having looked stedfastly toward him with John,  said, &#8216;Look toward us;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and he was giving heed to them, looking to receive something  from them; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and Peter said, &#8216;Silver and gold I have none, but what I  have, that I give to thee; in the name of Jesus Christ of  Nazareth, rise up and be walking.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And having seized him by the right hand, he raised [him] up,  and presently his feet and ankles were strengthened, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and springing up, he stood, and was walking, and did enter  with them into the temple, walking and springing, and praising  God; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and all the people saw him walking and praising God, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>they were knowing him also that this it was who for a  kindness was sitting at the Beautiful gate of the temple, and  they were filled with wonder and amazement at what hath  happened to him.</p>
<p class="hdg">Peter Speaks in Solomon's Colonnade</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And at the lame man who was healed holding Peter and John,  all the people ran together unto them in the porch called  Solomon&#8217;s &#8212; greatly amazed, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and Peter having seen, answered unto the people, &#8216;Men,  Israelites! why wonder ye at this? or on us why look ye so  earnestly, as if by our own power or piety we have made him to  walk? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8216;The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of  our fathers, did glorify His child Jesus, whom ye delivered up,  and denied him in the presence of Pilate, he having given  judgment to release [him], 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and ye the Holy and Righteous One did deny, and desired a  man &#8212; a murderer &#8212; to be granted to you, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and the Prince of the life ye did kill, whom God did raise  out of the dead, of which we are witnesses; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and on the faith of his name, this one whom ye see and have  known, his name made strong, even the faith that [is] through  him did give to him this perfect soundness before you all.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8216;And now, brethren, I have known that through ignorance ye  did [it], as also your rulers; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and God, what things before He had declared through the  mouth of all His prophets, that the Christ should suffer, He  did thus fulfil; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>reform ye, therefore, and turn back, for your sins being  blotted out, that times of refreshing may come from the  presence of the Lord, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and He may send Jesus Christ who before hath been preached  to you, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>whom it behoveth heaven, indeed, to receive till times of a  restitution of all things, of which God spake through the mouth  of all His holy prophets from the age. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>&#8216;For Moses, indeed, unto the fathers said &#8212; A prophet to  you shall the Lord your God raise up out of your brethren, like  to me; him shall ye hear in all things, as many as he may speak  unto you; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>and it shall be, every soul that may not hear that prophet  shall be utterly destroyed out of the people; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>and also all the prophets from Samuel and those following  in order, as many as spake, did also foretell of these days. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>&#8216;Ye are sons of the prophets, and of the covenant that God  made unto our fathers, saying unto Abraham: And in thy seed  shall be blessed all the families of the earth; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>to you first, God, having raised up His child Jesus, did  send him, blessing you, in the turning away of each one from  your evil ways.&#8217;</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
