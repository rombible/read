<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and in their ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy  Spirit said, &#8216;Separate ye to me both Barnabas and Saul to the  work to which I have called them,&#8217;

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>and having destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan,  He did divide by lot to them their land. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>&#8216;And after these things, about four hundred and fifty  years, He gave judges &#8212; till Samuel the prophet; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>and thereafter they asked for a king, and God did give to  them Saul, son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for  forty years; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>and having removed him, He did raise up to them David for  king, to whom also having testified, he said, I found David,  the [son] of Jesse, a man according to My heart, who shall do  all My will. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>&#8216;Of this one&#8217;s seed God, according to promise, did raise  to Israel a Saviour &#8212; Jesus,

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>and as John was fulfilling the course, he said, Whom me do  ye suppose to be? I am not [he], but, lo, he doth come after  me, of whom I am not worthy to loose the sandal of [his] feet.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>and the synagogue having been dismissed, many of the Jews  and of the devout proselytes did follow Paul and Barnabas, who,  speaking to them, were persuading them to remain in the grace  of God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>And on the coming sabbath, almost all the city was  gathered together to hear the word of God,

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>And speaking boldly, Paul and Barnabas said, &#8216;To you it  was necessary that first the word of God be spoken, and seeing  ye do thrust it away, and do not judge yourselves worthy of the  life age-during, lo, we do turn to the nations;</p>
