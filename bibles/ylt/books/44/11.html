<div class="chap"><p class="hdg">Peter Reports to the Church at Jerusalem</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>And the apostles and the brethren who are in Judea heard  that also the nations did receive the word of God, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those of the  circumcision were contending with him, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>saying &#8212; &#8216;Unto men uncircumcised thou didst go in, and  didst eat with them!&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And Peter having begun, did expound to them in order  saying, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8216;I was in the city of Joppa praying, and I saw in a trance  a vision, a certain vessel coming down, as a great sheet by  four corners being let down out of the heaven, and it came unto  me; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>at which having looked stedfastly, I was considering, and I  saw the four-footed beasts of the earth, and the wild beasts,  and the creeping things, and the fowls of heaven; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and I heard a voice saying to me, Having risen, Peter, slay  and eat; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and I said, Not so, Lord; because anything common or  unclean hath at no time entered into my mouth; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and a voice did answer me a second time out of the heaven,  What God did cleanse, thou &#8212; declare not thou common. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8216;And this happened thrice, and again was all drawn up to  the heaven, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and, lo, immediately, three men stood at the house in  which I was, having been sent from Cesarea unto me, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and the Spirit said to me to go with them, nothing  doubting, and these six brethren also went with me, and we did  enter into the house of the man, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>he declared also to us how he saw the messenger in his  house standing, and saying to him, Send men to Joppa, and call  for Simon, who is surnamed Peter, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>who shall speak sayings by which thou shalt be saved, thou  and all thy house. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8216;And in my beginning to speak, the Holy Spirit did fall  upon them, even as also upon us in the beginning, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and I remembered the saying of the Lord, how he said, John  indeed did baptize with water, and ye shall be baptized with  the Holy Spirit; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>if then the equal gift God did give to them as also to us,  having believed upon the Lord Jesus Christ, I &#8212; how was I able  to withstand God?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And they, having heard these things, were silent, and were  glorifying God, saying, &#8216;Then, indeed, also to the nations did  God give the reformation to life.&#8217;</p>
<p class="hdg">The Church at Antioch</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Those, indeed, therefore, having been scattered abroad,  from the tribulation that came after Stephen, went through unto  Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none  except to Jews only; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and there were certain of them men of Cyprus and Cyrene,  who having entered into Antioch, were speaking unto the  Hellenists, proclaiming good news &#8212; the Lord Jesus, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>and the hand of the Lord was with them, a great number  also, having believed, did turn unto the Lord. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And the account was heard in the ears of the assembly that  [is] in Jerusalem concerning them, and they sent forth Barnabas  to go through unto Antioch, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>who, having come, and having seen the grace of God, was  glad, and was exhorting all with purpose of heart to cleave to  the Lord, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>because he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit,  and of faith, and a great multitude was added to the Lord. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And Barnabas went forth to Tarsus, to seek for Saul, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>and having found him, he brought him to Antioch, and it  came to pass that they a whole year did assemble together in  the assembly, and taught a great multitude, the disciples also  were divinely called first in Antioch Christians.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And in those days there came from Jerusalem prophets to  Antioch, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>and one of them, by name Agabus, having stood up, did  signify through the Spirit a great dearth is about to be  throughout all the world &#8212; which also came to pass in the time  of Claudius Caesar &#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>and the disciples, according as any one was prospering,  determined each of them to send for ministration to the  brethren dwelling in Judea, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>which also they did, having sent unto the elders by the  hand of Barnabas and Saul.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
