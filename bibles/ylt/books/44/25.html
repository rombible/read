<div class="chap"><p class="hdg">Paul's Trial Before Festus</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Festus, therefore, having come into the province, after  three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and the chief priest and the principal men of the Jews made  manifest to him [the things] against Paul, and were calling on  him, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>asking favour against him, that he may send for him to  Jerusalem, making an ambush to put him to death in the way. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then, indeed, Festus answered that Paul is kept in  Caesarea, and himself is about speedily to go on thither, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8216;Therefore those able among you &#8212; saith he &#8212; having come  down together, if there be anything in this man &#8212; let them  accuse him;&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and having tarried among them more than ten days, having  gone down to Caesarea, on the morrow having sat upon the  tribunal, he commanded Paul to be brought; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and he having come, there stood round about the Jews who  have come down from Jerusalem &#8212; many and weighty charges they  are bringing against Paul, which they were not able to prove, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>he making defence &#8212; &#8216;Neither in regard to the law of the  Jews, nor in regard to the temple, nor in regard to Caesar &#8212;  did I commit any sin.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And Festus willing to lay on the Jews a favour, answering  Paul, said, &#8216;Art thou willing, to Jerusalem having gone up,  there concerning these things to be judged before me?&#8217;</p>
<p class="hdg">Paul Appeals to Caesar</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and Paul said, &#8216;At the tribunal of Caesar I am standing,  where it behoveth me to be judged; to Jews I did no  unrighteousness, as thou dost also very well know; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>for if indeed I am unrighteous, and anything worthy of  death have done, I deprecate not to die; and if there is none  of the things of which these accuse me, no one is able to make  a favour of me to them; to Caesar I appeal!&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>then Festus, having communed with the council, answered,  &#8216;To Caesar thou hast appealed; to Caesar thou shalt go.&#8217;</p>
<p class="hdg">Festus Consults King Agrippa</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And certain days having passed, Agrippa the king, and  Bernice, came down to Caesarea saluting Festus, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and as they were continuing there more days, Festus  submitted to the king the things concerning Paul, saying,  &#8216;There is a certain man, left by Felix, a prisoner, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>about whom, in my being at Jerusalem, the chief priests  and the elders of the Jews laid information, asking a decision  against him, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>unto whom I answered, that it is not a custom of Romans to  make a favour of any man to die, before that he who is accused  may have the accusers face to face, and may receive place of  defence in regard to the charge laid against [him]. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8216;They, therefore, having come together &#8212; I, making no  delay, on the succeeding [day] having sat upon the tribunal,  did command the man to be brought, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>concerning whom the accusers, having stood up, were  bringing against [him] no accusation of the things I was  thinking of, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>but certain questions concerning their own religion they  had against him, and concerning a certain Jesus who was dead,  whom Paul affirmed to be alive; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and I, doubting in regard to the question concerning this,  said, If he would wish to go on to Jerusalem, and there to be  judged concerning these things &#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>but Paul having appealed to be kept to the hearing of  Sebastus, I did command him to be kept till I might send him  unto Caesar.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And Agrippa said unto Festus, &#8216;I was wishing also myself  to hear the man;&#8217; and he said, &#8216;To-morrow thou shalt hear him;&#8217;</p>
<p class="hdg">Paul Before Agrippa and Bernice</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>on the morrow, therefore &#8212; on the coming of Agrippa and  Bernice with much display, and they having entered into the  audience chamber, with the chief captains also, and the  principal men of the city, and Festus having ordered &#8212; Paul  was brought forth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And Festus said, &#8216;King Agrippa, and all men who are  present with us, ye see this one, about whom all the multitude  of the Jews did deal with me, both in Jerusalem and here,  crying out, He ought not to live any longer; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>and I, having found him to have done nothing worthy of  death, and he also himself having appealed to Sebastus, I  decided to send him, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>concerning whom I have no certain thing to write to [my]  lord, wherefore I brought him forth before you, and specially  before thee, king Agrippa, that the examination having been  made, I may have something to write; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>for it doth seem to me irrational, sending a prisoner, not  also to signify the charges against him.&#8217;</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
