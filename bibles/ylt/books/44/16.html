<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And as they were going on through the cities, they were  delivering to them the decrees to keep, that have been judged  by the apostles and the elders who [are] in Jerusalem,

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>on the sabbath-day also we went forth outside of the city,  by a river, where there used to be prayer, and having sat  down, we were speaking to the women who came together,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and a certain woman, by name Lydia, a seller of purple, of  the city of Thyatira, worshipping God, was hearing, whose  heart the Lord did open to attend to the things spoken by  Paul;

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And her masters having seen that the hope of their  employment was gone, having caught Paul and Silas, drew [them]  to the market-place, unto the rulers, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and having brought them to the magistrates, they said,  &#8216;These men do exceedingly trouble our city, being Jews;

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And, having asked for a light, he sprang in, and trembling  he fell down before Paul and Silas, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>and having brought them forth, said, &#8216;Sirs, what must I do  &#8212; that I may be saved?&#8217;</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>and having taken them, in that hour of the night, he did  bathe [them] from the blows, and was baptized, himself and all  his presently, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>having brought them also into his house, he set food  before [them], and was glad with all the household, he having  believed in God.</p>
