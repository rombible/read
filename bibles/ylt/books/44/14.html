<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and the unbelieving Jews did stir up and made evil the  souls of the nations against the brethren; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>long time, indeed, therefore, did they abide speaking  boldly in the Lord, who is testifying to the word of His grace,  and granting signs and wonders to come to pass through their  hands. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the multitude of the city was divided, and some were  with the Jews, and some with the apostles, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and when there was a purpose both of the nations and of the  Jews with their rulers to use [them] despitefully, and to stone  them, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>they having become aware, did flee to the cities of  Lycaonia, Lystra, and Derbe, and to the region round about,

<p class="hdg">The Visit to Lystra and Derbe</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And a certain man in Lystra, impotent in the feet, was  sitting, being lame from the womb of his mother &#8212; who never  had walked, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>this one was hearing Paul speaking, who, having stedfastly  beheld him, and having seen that he hath faith to be saved, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>said with a loud voice, &#8216;Stand up on thy feet upright;&#8217;  and he was springing and walking, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and the multitudes having seen what Paul did, did lift up  their voice, in the speech of Lycaonia, saying, &#8216;The gods,  having become like men, did come down unto us;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>they were calling also Barnabas Zeus, and Paul Hermes,  since he was the leader in speaking. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And the priest of the Zeus that is before their city, oxen  and garlands unto the porches having brought, with the  multitudes did wish to sacrifice, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and having heard, the apostles Barnabas and Paul, having  rent their garments, did spring into the multitude, crying

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>who in the past generations did suffer all the nations to  go on in their ways, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>though, indeed, without witness He did not leave himself,  doing good &#8212; from heaven giving rains to us, and fruitful  seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and these things saying, scarcely did they restrain the  multitudes from sacrificing to them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And there came thither, from Antioch and Iconium, Jews,  and they having persuaded the multitudes, and having stoned  Paul, drew him outside of the city, having supposed him to be  dead;

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>and having appointed to them by vote elders in every  assembly, having prayed with fastings, they commended them to  the Lord in whom they had believed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And having passed through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia,
