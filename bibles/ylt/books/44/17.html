<div class="chap"><p class="hdg">Paul Preaches at Thessalonica</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>And having passed through Amphipolis, and Apollonia, they  came to Thessalonica, where was the synagogue of the Jews, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and according to the custom of Paul, he went in unto them,  and for three sabbaths he was reasoning with them from the  Writings, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>opening and alleging, &#8216;That the Christ it behoved to  suffer, and to rise again out of the dead, and that this is  the Christ &#8212; Jesus whom I proclaim to you.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And certain of them did believe, and attached themselves to  Paul and to Silas, also of the worshipping Greeks a great  multitude, of the principal women also not a few.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jason Seized</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the unbelieving Jews, having been moved with envy, and  having taken to them of the loungers certain evil men, and  having made a crowd, were setting the city in an uproar; having  assailed also the house of Jason, they were seeking them to  bring [them] to the populace, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and not having found them, they drew Jason and certain  brethren unto the city rulers, calling aloud &#8212; &#8216;These, having  put the world in commotion, are also here present, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>whom Jason hath received; and these all do contrary to the  decrees of Caesar, saying another to be king &#8212; Jesus.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And they troubled the multitude and the city rulers,  hearing these things, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and having taking security from Jason and the rest, they  let them go.</p>
<p class="hdg">Paul and Silas at Berea</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the brethren immediately, through the night, sent  forth both Paul and Silas to Berea, who having come, went to  the synagogue of the Jews; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, they  received the word with all readiness of mind, every day  examining the Writings whether those things were so; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>many, indeed, therefore, of them did believe, and of the  honourable Greek women and men not a few. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And when the Jews from Thessalonica knew that also in  Berea was the word of God declared by Paul, they came thither  also, agitating the multitudes; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and then immediately the brethren sent forth Paul, to go  on as it were to the sea, but both Silas and Timothy were  remaining there. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And those conducting Paul, brought him unto Athens, and  having received a command unto Silas and Timotheus that with  all speed they may come unto him, they departed;</p>
<p class="hdg">Paul at Athens</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and Paul waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was  stirred in him, beholding the city wholly given to idolatry, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>therefore, indeed, he was reasoning in the synagogue with  the Jews, and with the worshipping persons, and in the  market-place every day with those who met with him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And certain of the Epicurean and of the Stoic  philosophers, were meeting together to see him, and some were  saying, &#8216;What would this seed picker wish to say?&#8217; and others,  &#8216;Of strange demons he doth seem to be an announcer;&#8217; because  Jesus and the rising again he did proclaim to them as good  news, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>having also taken him, unto the Areopagus they brought  [him], saying, &#8216;Are we able to know what [is] this new teaching  that is spoken by thee, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>for certain strange things thou dost bring to our ears? we  wish, then, to know what these things would wish to be;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>and all Athenians, and the strangers sojourning, for  nothing else were at leisure but to say something, and to hear  some newer thing.</p>
<p class="hdg">Paul Before the Areopagus</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And Paul, having stood in the midst of the Areopagus,  said, &#8216;Men, Athenians, in all things I perceive you as  over-religious; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>for passing through and contemplating your objects of  worship, I found also an erection on which had been inscribed:  To God &#8212; unknown; whom, therefore &#8212; not knowing &#8212; ye do  worship, this One I announce to you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>&#8216;God, who did make the world, and all things in it, this  One, of heaven and of earth being Lord, in temples made with  hands doth not dwell, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>neither by the hands of men is He served &#8212; needing  anything, He giving to all life, and breath, and all things; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>He made also of one blood every nation of men, to dwell  upon all the face of the earth &#8212; having ordained times before  appointed, and the bounds of their dwellings &#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>to seek the Lord, if perhaps they did feel after Him and  find, &#8212; though, indeed, He is not far from each one of us, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>for in Him we live, and move, and are; as also certain of  your poets have said: For of Him also we are offspring. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>&#8216;Being, therefore, offspring of God, we ought not to think  the Godhead to be like to gold, or silver, or stone, graving of  art and device of man; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>the times, indeed, therefore, of the ignorance God having  overlooked, doth now command all men everywhere to reform, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>because He did set a day in which He is about to judge the  world in righteousness, by a man whom He did ordain, having  given assurance to all, having raised him out of the dead.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And having heard of a rising again of the dead, some,  indeed, were mocking, but others said, &#8216;We will hear thee again  concerning this;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>and so Paul went forth from the midst of them, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>and certain men having cleaved to him, did believe, among  whom [is] also Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman, by name  Damaris, and others with them.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
