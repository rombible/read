<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and they were giving heed to him, because of his having for  a long time amazed them with deeds of magic. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And when they believed Philip, proclaiming good news, the  things concerning the reign of God and the name of Jesus  Christ, they were baptized both men and women;
