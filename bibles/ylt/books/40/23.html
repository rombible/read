<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>for they bind together burdens heavy and grievous to be  borne, and lay upon the shoulders of men, but with their finger  they will not move them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8216;And all their works they do to be seen by men, and they  make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the fringes of their  garments,
