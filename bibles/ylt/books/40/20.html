<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and having agreed with the workmen for a denary a day, he  sent them into his vineyard. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8216;And having gone forth about the third hour, he saw others  standing in the market-place idle, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and to these he said, Go ye &#8212; also ye &#8212; to the vineyard,  and whatever may be righteous I will give you; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and they went away. &#8216;Again, having gone forth about the  sixth and the ninth hour, he did in like manner. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And about the eleventh hour, having gone forth, he found  others standing idle, and saith to them, Why here have ye stood  all the day idle? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>they say to him, Because no one did hire us; he saith to  them, Go ye &#8212; ye also &#8212; to the vineyard, and whatever may be  righteous ye shall receive.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8216;And evening having come, the lord of the vineyard saith to  his steward, Call the workmen, and pay them the reward, having  begun from the last &#8212; unto the first. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And they of about the eleventh hour having come, did  receive each a denary. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8216;And the first having come, did suppose that they shall  receive more, and they received, they also, each a denary, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and having received [it], they were murmuring against the  householder, saying, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>that These, the last, wrought one hour, and thou didst  make them equal to us, who were bearing the burden of the day  &#8212; and the heat. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8216;And he answering said to one of them, Comrade, I do no  unrighteousness to thee; for a denary didst not thou agree with  me? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>take that which is thine, and go; and I will to give to  this, the last, also as to thee; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>is it not lawful to me to do what I will in mine own? is  thine eye evil because I am good? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So the last shall be first, and the first last, for many  are called, and few chosen.&#8217;</p>
