<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>whenever, therefore, thou mayest do kindness, thou mayest  not sound a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do, in the  synagogues, and in the streets, that they may have glory from  men; verily I say to you &#8212; they have their reward! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8216;But thou, doing kindness, let not thy left hand know what  thy right hand doth,

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8216;But thou, when thou mayest pray, go into thy chamber, and  having shut thy door, pray to thy Father who [is] in secret,  and thy Father who is seeing in secret, shall reward thee  manifestly.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8216;And &#8212; praying &#8212; ye may not use vain repetitions like the  nations, for they think that in their much speaking they shall  be heard, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>be ye not therefore like to them, for your Father doth know  those things that ye have need of before your asking him;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>thus therefore pray ye: &#8216;Our Father who [art] in the  heavens! hallowed be Thy name.</p>

Is not the life more than the  nourishment, and the body than the clothing? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>look to the fowls of the heaven, for they do not sow, nor  reap, nor gather into storehouses, and your heavenly Father  doth nourish them; are not ye much better than they?

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>therefore ye may not be anxious, saying, What may we eat?  or, What may we drink? or, What may we put round? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>for all these do the nations seek for, for your  heavenly Father doth know that ye have need of all these;
