<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and five of them were prudent, and five foolish; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>they who were foolish having taken their lamps, did not  take with themselves oil; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and the prudent took oil in their vessels, with their  lamps.

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and in the middle of the night a cry was made, Lo, the  bridegroom doth come; go ye forth to meet him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8216;Then rose all those virgins, and trimmed their lamps, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and the foolish said to the prudent, Give us of your oil,  because our lamps are going out; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and the prudent answered, saying &#8212; Lest there may not be  sufficient for us and you, go ye rather unto those selling, and  buy for yourselves. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8216;And while they are going away to buy, the bridegroom  came, and those ready went in with him to the marriage-feasts,  and the door was shut; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and afterwards come also do the rest of the virgins,  saying, Sir, sir, open to us; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and he answering said, Verily I say to you, I have not  known you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8216;Watch therefore, for ye have not known the day nor the  hour in which the Son of Man doth come.</p>
