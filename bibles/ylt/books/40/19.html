<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them  there.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the Pharisees came near to him, tempting him, and  saying to him, &#8216;Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for  every cause?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And he answering said to them, &#8216;Did ye not read, that He  who made [them], from the beginning a male and a female made  them, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and said, For this cause shall a man leave father and  mother, and cleave to his wife, and they shall be &#8212; the two &#8212;  for one flesh? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>so that they are no more two, but one flesh; what therefore  God did join together, let no man put asunder.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>They say to him, &#8216;Why then did Moses command to give a roll  of divorce, and to put her away?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>He saith to them &#8212; &#8216;Moses for your stiffness of heart did  suffer you to put away your wives, but from the beginning it  hath not been so. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8216;And I say to you, that, whoever may put away his wife, if  not for whoredom, and may marry another, doth commit adultery;  and he who did marry her that hath been put away, doth commit  adultery.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>His disciples say to him, &#8216;If the case of the man with the  woman is so, it is not good to marry.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And he said to them, &#8216;All do not receive this word, but  those to whom it hath been given; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>for there are eunuchs who from the mother&#8217;s womb were so  born; and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and  there are eunuchs who kept themselves eunuchs because of the  reign of the heavens: he who is able to receive [it] &#8212; let him  receive.&#8217;</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>He saith to him, &#8216;What kind?&#8217; And Jesus said, &#8216;Thou shalt  not kill, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not steal,  thou shalt not bear false witness,
