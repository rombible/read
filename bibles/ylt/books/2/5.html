<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and Pharaoh saith, &#8216;Who [is] Jehovah, that I hearken to His  voice, to send Israel away? I have not known Jehovah, and  Israel also I do not send away.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And they say, &#8216;The God of the Hebrews hath met with us, let  us go, we pray thee, a journey of three days into the  wilderness, and we sacrifice to Jehovah our God, lest He meet  us with pestilence or with sword.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the king of Egypt saith unto them, &#8216;Why, Moses and  Aaron, do ye free the people from its works? go to your  burdens.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Pharaoh also saith, &#8216;Lo, numerous now [is] the people of the  land, and ye have caused them to cease from their burdens!&#8217;</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8216;Ye do not add to give straw to the people for the making of  the bricks, as heretofore &#8212; they go and have gathered straw  for themselves; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and the proper quantity of the bricks which they are making  heretofore ye do put on them, ye do not diminish from it, for  they are remiss, therefore they are crying, saying, Let us go,  let us sacrifice to our God; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>let the service be heavy on the men, and let them work at  it, and not be dazzled by lying words.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the exactors of the people, and its authorities, go  out, and speak unto the people, saying, &#8216;Thus said Pharaoh, I  do not give you straw, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>ye &#8212; go ye, take for yourselves straw where ye find [it],  for there is nothing of your service diminished.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And the people is scattered over all the land of Egypt, to  gather stubble for straw, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>and the exactors are making haste, saying, &#8216;Complete your  works, the matter of a day in its day, as when there is straw.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And the authorities of the sons of Israel, whom the  exactors of Pharaoh have placed over them, are beaten, saying,  &#8216;Wherefore have ye not completed your portion in making brick  as heretofore, both yesterday and to-day?&#8217;</p>
<p class="hdg">The Israelites' Cry</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And the authorities of the sons of Israel come in and cry  unto Pharaoh, saying, &#8216;Why dost thou thus to thy servants? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Straw is not given to thy servants, and they are saying to  us, Make bricks, and lo, thy servants are smitten &#8212; and thy  people hath sinned.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And he saith, &#8216;Remiss &#8212; ye are remiss, therefore ye are  saying, Let us go, let us sacrifice to Jehovah; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and now, go, serve; and straw is not given to you, and the  measure of bricks ye do give.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And the authorities of the sons of Israel see them in  affliction, saying, &#8216;Ye do not diminish from your bricks; the  matter of a day in its day.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And they meet Moses and Aaron standing to meet them, in  their coming out from Pharaoh, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>and say unto them, &#8216;Jehovah look upon you, and judge,  because ye have caused our fragrance to stink in the eyes of  Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants &#8212; to give a sword  into their hand to slay us.&#8217;</p>
