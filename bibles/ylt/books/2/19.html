<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and they journey from Rephidim, and enter the wilderness of  Sinai, and encamp in the wilderness; and Israel encampeth  there before the mount. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Moses hath gone up unto God, and Jehovah calleth unto  him out of the mount, saying, &#8216;Thus dost thou say to the house  of Jacob, and declare to the sons of Israel,
