<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>for if there may come into your synagogue a man with gold  ring, in gay raiment, and there may come in also a poor man in  vile raiment, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and ye may look upon him bearing the gay raiment, and may  say to him, &#8216;Thou &#8212; sit thou here well,&#8217; and to the poor man  may say, &#8216;Thou &#8212; stand thou there, or, Sit thou here under my  footstool,&#8217; &#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>ye did not judge fully in yourselves, and did become  ill-reasoning judges. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Hearken, my brethren beloved, did not God choose the poor of  this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the reign that He  promised to those loving Him? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and ye did dishonour the poor one; do not the rich oppress  you and themselves draw you to judgment-seats; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>do they not themselves speak evil of the good name that was  called upon you?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>If, indeed, royal law ye complete, according to the Writing,  &#8216;Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,&#8217; &#8212; ye do well; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and if ye accept persons, sin ye do work, being convicted by  the law as transgressors; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>for whoever the whole law shall keep, and shall stumble in  one [point], he hath become guilty of all; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>for He who is saying, &#8216;Thou mayest not commit adultery,&#8217;  said also, &#8216;Thou mayest do no murder;&#8217; and if thou shalt not  commit adultery, and shalt commit murder, thou hast become a  transgressor of law; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>so speak ye and so do, as about by a law of liberty to be  judged, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>for the judgment without kindness [is] to him not having  done kindness, and exult doth kindness over judgment.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and if a brother or sister may be naked, and may be  destitute of the daily food, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and any one of you may say to them, &#8216;Depart ye in peace, be  warmed, and be filled,&#8217; and may not give to them the things  needful for the body, what [is] the profit? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>so also the faith, if it may not have works, is dead by  itself.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But say may some one, Thou hast faith, and I have works,  shew me thy faith out of thy works, and I will shew thee out of  my works my faith:

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>and fulfilled was the Writing that is saying, &#8216;And Abraham  did believe God, and it was reckoned to him &#8212; to  righteousness;&#8217; and, &#8216;Friend of God&#8217; he was called. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Ye see, then, that out of works is man declared righteous,  and not out of faith only; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>and in like manner also Rahab the harlot &#8212; was she not out  of works declared righteous, having received the messengers,  and by another way having sent forth?
