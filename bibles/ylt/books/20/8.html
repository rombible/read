<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>At the head of high places by the way, Between the paths she  hath stood,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>At the side of the gates, at the mouth of the city, The  entrance of the openings, she crieth aloud,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8216;Unto you, O men, I call, And my voice [is] unto the sons of  men.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Understand, ye simple ones, prudence, And ye fools,  understand the heart,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Hearken, for noble things I speak, And the opening of my  lips [is] uprightness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For truth doth my mouth utter, And an abomination to my lips  [is] wickedness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>In righteousness [are] all the sayings of my mouth, Nothing  in them is froward and perverse.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>All of them [are] plain to the intelligent, And upright to  those finding knowledge.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Receive my instruction, and not silver, And knowledge  rather than choice gold.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For better [is] wisdom than rubies, Yea, all delights are  not comparable with it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>I, wisdom, have dwelt with prudence, And a knowledge of  devices I find out.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The fear of Jehovah [is] to hate evil; Pride, and  arrogance, and an evil way, And a froward mouth, I have hated.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>In a path of righteousness I cause to walk, In midst of  paths of judgment,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>To cause my lovers to inherit substance, Yea, their  treasures I fill.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Jehovah possessed me &#8212; the beginning of His way, Before  His works since then.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>In His preparing the heavens I [am] there, In His decreeing  a circle on the face of the deep,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>In His strengthening clouds above, In His making strong  fountains of the deep,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>In His setting for the sea its limit, And the waters  transgress not His command, In His decreeing the foundations of  earth,</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>For whoso is finding me, hath found life, And bringeth out  good-will from Jehovah.</p>
