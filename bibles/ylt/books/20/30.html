<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For I am more brutish than any one, And have not the  understanding of a man.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Nor have I learned wisdom, Yet the knowledge of Holy Ones I  know.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Who went up to heaven, and cometh down? Who hath gathered  the wind in his fists? Who hath bound waters in a garment? Who  established all ends of the earth? What [is] His name? and what  His son&#8217;s name? Surely thou knowest!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Every saying of God [is] tried, A shield He [is] to those  trusting in Him.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Lest I become satiated, and have denied, And have said,  &#8216;Who [is] Jehovah?&#8217; And lest I be poor, and have stolen, And  have laid hold of the name of my God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Accuse not a servant unto his lord, Lest he disesteem  thee, and thou be found guilty.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>A generation [is], that lightly esteemeth their father,  And their mother doth not bless.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>A generation &#8212; pure in their own eyes, But from their own  filth not washed.</p>
