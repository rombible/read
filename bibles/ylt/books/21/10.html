<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The heart of the wise [is] at his right hand, And the heart  of a fool at his left. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And also, when he that is a fool Is walking in the way, his  heart is lacking, And he hath said to every one, &#8216;He [is] a  fool.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>If the spirit of the ruler go up against thee, Thy place  leave not, For yielding quieteth great sinners.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>There is an evil I have seen under the sun, As an error  that goeth out from the ruler, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He hath set the fool in many high places, And the rich in a  low place do sit.

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Whoso is removing stones is grieved by them, Whoso is  cleaving trees endangered by them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>If the iron hath been blunt, And he the face hath not  sharpened, Then doth he increase strength, And wisdom [is]  advantageous to make right. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>If the serpent biteth without enchantment, Then there is  no advantage to a master of the tongue. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Words of the mouth of the wise [are] gracious, And the  lips of a fool swallow him up. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The beginning of the words of his mouth [is] folly, And  the latter end of his mouth [Is] mischievous madness. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And the fool multiplieth words: &#8216;Man knoweth not that  which is, And that which is after him, who doth declare to  him?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The labour of the foolish wearieth him, In that he hath  not known to go unto the city.
