<div class="chap"><p class="hdg">The Evils of Oppression</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>And I have turned, and I see all the oppressions that are  done under the sun, and lo, the tear of the oppressed, and they  have no comforter; and at the hand of their oppressors [is]  power, and they have no comforter. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And I am praising the dead who have already died above the  living who are yet alive. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And better than both of them [is] he who hath not yet been,  in that he hath not seen the evil work that hath been done  under the sun.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And I have seen all the labour, and all the benefit of the  work, because for it a man is the envy of his neighbour. Even  this [is] vanity and vexation of spirit. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The fool is clasping his hands, and eating his own flesh: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8216;Better [is] a handful [with] quietness, than two handfuls  [with] labour and vexation of spirit.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And I have turned, and I see a vain thing under the sun: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>There is one, and there is not a second; even son or brother  he hath not, and there is no end to all his labour! His eye  also is not satisfied with riches, and [he saith not], &#8216;For  whom am I labouring and bereaving my soul of good?&#8217; This also  is vanity, it is a sad travail.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>The two [are] better than the one, in that they have a good  reward by their labour. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For if they fall, the one raiseth up his companion, but wo  to the one who falleth and there is not a second to raise him  up! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Also, if two lie down, then they have heat, but how hath  one heat? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And if the one strengthen himself, the two stand against  him; and the threefold cord is not hastily broken.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Futility of Power</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish  king, who hath not known to be warned any more. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For from a house of prisoners he hath come out to reign,  for even in his own kingdom he hath been poor. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>I have seen all the living, who are walking under the sun,  with the second youth who doth stand in his place; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>there is no end to all the people, to all who were before  them; also, the latter rejoice not in him. Surely this also is  vanity and vexation of spirit.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
