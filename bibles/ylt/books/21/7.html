<div class="chap"><p class="hdg">The Value of Wisdom</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Better [is] a name than good perfume, And the day of death  than the day of birth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Better to go unto a house of mourning,  Than to go unto a  house of banqueting, For that is the end of all men, And the  living layeth [it] unto his heart.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Better [is] sorrow than laughter, For by the sadness of the  face the heart becometh better.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The heart of the wise [is] in a house of mourning, And the  heart of fools in a house of mirth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Better to hear a rebuke of a wise man, Than [for] a man to  hear a song of fools,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For as the noise of thorns under the pot, So [is] the  laughter of a fool, even this [is] vanity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Surely oppression maketh the wise mad, And a gift destroyeth  the heart.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Better [is] the latter end of a thing than its beginning,  Better [is] the patient of spirit, than the haughty of spirit.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry, For anger in the  bosom of fools resteth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Say not thou, &#8216;What was it, That the former days were  better than these?&#8217; For thou hast not asked wisely of this.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Wisdom [is] good with an inheritance, And an advantage [it  is] to those beholding the sun.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For wisdom [is] a defense, money [is] a defence, And the  advantage of the knowledge of wisdom [is], She reviveth her  possessors.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>See the work of God, For who is able to make straight that  which  He made crooked?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>In a day of prosperity be in gladness, And in a day of evil  consider. Also this over-against that hath God made, To the  intent that man doth not find anything after him.</p>
<p class="hdg">Limits of Human Wisdom</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The whole I have considered in the days of my vanity. There  is a righteous one perishing in his righteousness, and there is  a wrong-doer prolonging [himself] in his wrong. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Be not over-righteous, nor show thyself too wise, why art  thou desolate? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Do not much wrong, neither be thou a fool, why dost thou  die within thy time? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>[It is] good that thou dost lay hold on this, and also,  from that withdrawest not thy hand, for whoso is fearing God  goeth out with them all.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>The wisdom giveth strength to a wise man, more than wealth  the rulers who have been in a city. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Because there is not a righteous man on earth that doth  good and sinneth not. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Also to all the words that they speak give not thy heart,  that thou hear not thy servant reviling thee. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>For many times also hath thy heart known that thou thyself  also hast reviled others.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>All this I have tried by wisdom; I have said, &#8216;I am wise,&#8217;  and it [is] far from me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Far off [is] that which hath been, and deep, deep, who doth  find it? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>I have turned round, also my heart, to know and to search,  and to seek out wisdom, and reason, and to know the wrong of  folly, and of foolishness the madness. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And I am finding more bitter than death, the woman whose  heart [is] nets and snares, her hands [are] bands; the good  before God escapeth from her, but the sinner is captured by  her.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>See, this I have found, said the Preacher, one to one, to  find out the reason 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>(that still my soul had sought, and I had not found), One  man, a teacher, I have found, and a woman among all these I  have not found. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>See, this alone I have found, that God made man upright,  and they &#8212; they have sought out many devices.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
