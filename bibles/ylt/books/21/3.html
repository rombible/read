<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>I have seen the travail that God hath given to the sons of  man to be humbled by it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>The whole He hath made beautiful in its season; also, that  knowledge He hath put in their heart without which man findeth  not out the work that God hath done from the beginning even  unto the end.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>I have known that there is no good for them except to  rejoice and to do good during their life,

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>I have known that all that God doth is to the age, to it  nothing is to be added, and from it nothing is to be withdrawn;  and God hath wrought that they do fear before Him.

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>I said in my heart, &#8216;The righteous and the wicked doth God  judge, for a time [is] to every matter and for every work  there.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>I said in my heart concerning the matter of the sons of man  that God might cleanse them, so as to see that they themselves  [are] beasts.
