<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Give a portion to seven, and even to eight, For thou  knowest not what evil is on the earth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>If the thick clouds are full of rain, On the earth they  empty [themselves]; And if a tree doth fall in the south or to  the north, The place where the tree falleth, there it is. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Whoso is observing the wind soweth not, And whoso is  looking on the thick clouds reapeth not. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>As thou knowest not what [is] the way of the spirit, How &#8212;  bones in the womb of the full one, So thou knowest not the work  of God who maketh the whole.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>In the morning sow thy seed, And at even withdraw not thy  hand, For thou knowest not which is right, this or that, Or  whether both of them alike [are] good.</p>
<p class="hdg">Enjoy Your Years</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Sweet also [is] the light, And good for the eyes to see the  sun. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But, if man liveth many years, In all of them let him  rejoice, And remember the days of darkness, For they are many!  all that is coming [is] vanity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Rejoice, O young man, in thy childhood, And let thy heart  gladden thee in days of thy youth, And walk in the ways of thy  heart, And in the sight of thine eyes, And know thou that for  all these, Doth God bring thee into judgment. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And turn aside anger from thy heart, And cause evil to  pass from thy flesh, For the childhood and the age [are]  vanity!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
