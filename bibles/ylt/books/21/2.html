<div class="chap"><p class="hdg">The Futility of Pleasures</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>I said in my heart, &#8216;Pray, come, I try thee with mirth, and  look thou on gladness;&#8217; and lo, even it [is] vanity. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Of laughter I said, &#8216;Foolish!&#8217; and of mirth, &#8216;What [is] this  it is doing?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>I have sought in my heart to draw out with wine my appetite,  (and my heart leading in wisdom), and to take hold on folly  till that I see where [is] this &#8212; the good to the sons of man  of that which they do under the heavens, the number of the days  of their lives. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>I made great my works, I builded for me houses, I planted  for me vineyards. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>I made for me gardens and paradises, and I planted in them  trees of every fruit. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>I made for me pools of water, to water from them a forest  shooting forth trees. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>I got men-servants, and maid-servants, and sons of the house  were to me; also, I had much substance &#8212; herd and flock &#8212;  above all who had been before me in Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>I gathered for me also silver and gold, and the peculiar  treasure of kings and of the provinces. I prepared for me  men-singers and women-singers, and the luxuries of the sons of  man &#8212; a wife and wives.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And I became great, and increased above every one who had  been before me in Jerusalem; also, my wisdom stood with me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And all that mine eyes asked I kept not back from them; I  withheld not my heart from any joy, for my heart rejoiced  because of all my labour, and this hath been my portion, from  all my labour, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and I have looked on all my works that my hands have done,  and on the labour that I have laboured to do, and lo, the whole  [is] vanity and vexation of spirit, and there is no advantage  under the sun!</p>
<p class="hdg">The Wise and the Foolish</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And I turned to see wisdom, and madness, and folly, but  what [is] the man who cometh after the king? that which [is]  already &#8212; they have done it! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And I saw that there is an advantage to wisdom  above  folly, like the advantage of the light above  the darkness. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The wise! &#8212; his eyes [are] in his head, and the fool in  darkness is walking, and I also knew that one event happeneth  with them all; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and I said in my heart, &#8216;As it happeneth with the fool, it  happeneth also with me, and why am I then more wise?&#8217; And I  spake in my heart, that also this [is] vanity: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>That there is no remembrance to the wise &#8212; with the fool  &#8212; to the age, for that which [is] already, [in] the days that  are coming is all forgotten, and how dieth the wise? with the  fool! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And I have hated life, for sad to me [is] the work that  hath been done under the sun, for the whole [is] vanity and  vexation of spirit.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Futility of Work</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And I have hated all my labour that I  labour at under the  sun, because I leave it to a man who is after me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And who knoweth whether he is wise or foolish? yet he doth  rule over all my labour that I have laboured at, and that I  have done wisely under  the sun! this also [is] vanity. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And I turned round to cause my heart to despair concerning  all the labour that I laboured at under the sun. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For there is a man whose labour [is] in wisdom, and in  knowledge, and in equity, and to a man who hath not laboured  therein he giveth it &#8212; his portion! Even this [is] vanity and  a great evil. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>For what hath been to a man by all his labour, and by the  thought of his heart that he laboured at under the sun? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>For all his days are sorrows, and his travail sadness; even  at night his heart hath not lain down; this also [is] vanity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>There is nothing good in a man who eateth, and hath drunk,  and hath shewn his soul good in his labour. This also I have  seen that it [is] from the hand of God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>For who eateth and who hasteth out more than I? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>For to a man who [is] good before Him, He hath  given  wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; and to a sinner He hath given  travail, to gather and to heap up, to give to the good before  God. Even this [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
