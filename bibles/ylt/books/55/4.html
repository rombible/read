<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>preach the word; be earnest in season, out of season,  convict, rebuke, exhort, in all long-suffering and teaching, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>for there shall be a season when the sound teaching they  will not suffer, but according to their own desires to  themselves they shall heap up teachers &#8212; itching in the  hearing, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and indeed, from the truth the hearing they shall turn away,  and to the fables they shall be turned aside. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And thou &#8212; watch in all things; suffer evil; do the work of  one proclaiming good news; of thy ministration make full  assurance,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>for I am already being poured out, and the time of my  release hath arrived; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>the good strife I have striven, the course I have finished,  the faith I have kept, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of the  righteousness that the Lord &#8212; the Righteous Judge &#8212; shall  give to me in that day, and not only to me, but also to all  those loving his manifestation.</p>
<p class="hdg">Personal Concerns</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Be diligent to come unto me quickly, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>for Demas forsook me, having loved the present age, and  went on to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, Titus to  Dalmatia, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Lukas only is with me; Markus having taken, bring with  thyself, for he is profitable to me for ministration; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and Tychicus I sent to Ephesus; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>the cloak that I left in Troas with Carpus, coming, bring  thou and the books &#8212; especially the parchments. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil; may the Lord  repay to him according to his works, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>of whom also do thou beware, for greatly hath he stood  against our words;</p>
<p class="hdg">The Lord Remains Faithful</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>in my first defence no one stood with me, but all forsook  me, (may it not be reckoned to them!) 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>and the Lord stood by me, and did strengthen me, that  through me the preaching might be fully assured, and all the  nations might hear, and I was freed out of the mouth of a lion, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and the Lord shall free me from every evil work, and shall  save [me] &#8212; to his heavenly kingdom; to whom [is] the glory to  the ages of the ages! Amen.</p>
