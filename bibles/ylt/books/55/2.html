<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>thou, therefore, suffer evil as a good soldier of Jesus  Christ; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>no one serving as a soldier did entangle himself with the  affairs of life, that him who did enlist him he may please;
