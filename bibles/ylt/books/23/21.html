<div class="chap"><p class="hdg">Babylon is Fallen</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>The burden of the wilderness of the sea. &#8216;Like hurricanes  in the south for passing through, From the wilderness it hath  come, From a fearful land.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>A hard vision hath been declared to me, The treacherous  dealer is dealing treacherously, And the destroyer is  destroying. Go up, O Elam, besiege, O Media, All its sighing I  have caused to cease.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Therefore filled have been my loins [with] great pain,  Pangs have seized me as pangs of a travailing woman, I have  been bent down by hearing, I have been troubled by seeing.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Wandered hath my heart, trembling hath terrified me, The  twilight of my desire He hath made a fear to me,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Arrange the table, watch in the watch-tower, Eat, drink,  rise, ye heads, anoint the shield,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For thus said the Lord unto me: &#8216;Go, station the watchman,  That which he seeth let him declare.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And he hath seen a chariot &#8212; a couple of horsemen, The  rider of an ass, the rider of a camel, And he hath given  attention &#8212; He hath increased attention!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And he crieth &#8212; a lion, &#8216;On a watch-tower my lord, I am  standing continually by day, And on my ward I am stationed  whole nights.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And lo, this, the chariot of a man is coming, A couple of  horsemen.&#8217; And he answereth and saith: &#8216;Fallen, fallen hath  Babylon, And all the graven images of her gods He hath broken  to the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>O my threshing, and the son of my floor, That which I  heard from Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, I have declared to  you!&#8217;</p>
<p class="hdg">A Prophecy against Edom</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>The burden of Dumah. Unto me is [one] calling from Seir  &#8216;Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>The watchman hath said, &#8216;Come hath morning, and also  night, If ye inquire, inquire ye, turn back, come.&#8217;</p>
<p class="hdg">A Prophecy against Arabia</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The burden on Arabia. In a forest in Arabia ye lodge, O  travellers of Dedanim.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>To meet the thirsty brought water have Inhabitants of the  land of Tema, With his bread they came before a fugitive.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For from the face of destructions they fled, From the face  of a stretched-out sword, And from the face of a trodden bow,  And from the face of the grievousness of battle.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>For thus said the Lord unto me: &#8216;Within a year, as years  of a hireling, Consumed hath been all the honour of Kedar. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And the remnant of the number of bow-men, The mighty of  the sons of Kedar are few, For Jehovah, God of Israel, hath  spoken!&#8217;</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
