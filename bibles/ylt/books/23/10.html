<div class="chap"><p class="hdg">Woe to Tyrants</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Wo [to] those decreeing decrees of iniquity, And writers  who have prescribed perverseness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>To turn aside from judgment the poor, And to take violently  away the judgment Of the afflicted of My people, That widows  may be their prey, That the fatherless they may spoil.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And what do ye at a day of inspection? And at desolation?  &#8212; from afar it cometh. Near whom do ye flee for help? And  where do ye leave your honour?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Without Me it hath bowed down In the place of a bound one,  And in the place of the slain they fall. With all this not  turned back hath His anger, And still His hand is stretched  out.</p>
<p class="hdg">Judgment on Assyria</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Wo [to] Asshur, a rod of Mine anger, And a staff in their  hand [is] Mine indignation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Against a profane nation I send him, And concerning a  people of My wrath I charge him, To spoil spoil, and to seize  prey, And to make it a treading-place as the clay of out  places.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And he &#8212; he thinketh not so, And his heart reckoneth not  so, For &#8212; to destroy [is] in his heart, And to cut off nations  not a few.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For he saith, &#8216;Are not my princes altogether kings?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Is not Calno as Carchemish? Is not Hamath as Arpad? Is not  Samaria as Damascus?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>As my hand hath got to the kingdoms of a worthless thing,  and their graven images, [Greater] than Jerusalem and than  Samaria,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Do I not &#8212; as I have done to Samaria, And to her  worthless things, So do to Jerusalem and to her grievous  things?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And it hath come to pass, When the Lord doth fulfil all  His work In mount Zion and in Jerusalem, I see concerning the  fruit of the greatness Of the heart of the king of Asshur. And  concerning the glory of the height of his eyes.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For he hath said, &#8216;By the power of my hand I have wrought,  And by my wisdom, for I have been intelligent, And I remove  borders of the peoples, And their chief ones I have spoiled,  And I put down as a mighty one the inhabitants,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And my hand as to a nest Getteth to the wealth of the  peoples, And as a gathering of forsaken eggs All the earth I &#8212;  I have gathered, And there hath not been one moving wing, Or  opening mouth, or whispering.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8212; Doth the axe glorify itself Against him who is hewing  with it? Doth the saw magnify itself Against him who is shaking  it? As a rod waving those lifting it up! As a staff lifting up  that which is not wood!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Therefore doth the Lord, the Lord of Hosts, Send among his  fat ones leanness, And under his honour He kindleth a burning  As the burning of a fire.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And the light of Israel hath been for a fire, And his Holy  One for a flame, And it hath burned, and devoured his thorn And  his brier in one day.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And the honour of his forest, and his fruitful field, From  soul even unto flesh He doth consume, And it hath been as the  fainting of a standard-bearer.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>A remnant returneth &#8212; a remnant of Jacob, Unto the Mighty  God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, A  remnant doth return of it, A consumption determined,  Overflowing [with] righteousness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>For a consumption that is determined, The Lord, Jehovah of  Hosts, Is making in the midst of all the land.</p>
