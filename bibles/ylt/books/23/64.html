<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>(As fire kindleth stubble &#8212; Fire causeth water to boil,)  To make known Thy name to Thine adversaries, From Thy presence  do nations tremble.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>In Thy doing fearful things &#8212; we expect not, Thou didst  come down, From Thy presence did mountains flow.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Even from antiquity [men] have not heard, They have not  given ear, Eye hath not seen a God save Thee, He doth work for  those waiting for Him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Thou hast met with the rejoicer And the doer of  righteousness, In Thy ways they remember Thee, Lo, Thou hast  been wroth when we sin, By them [is] continuance, and we are  saved.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And we are as unclean &#8212; all of us, And as a garment  passing away, all our righteous acts; And we fade as a leaf &#8212;  all of us. And our iniquities as wind do take us away.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And there is none calling in Thy name, Stirring up himself  to lay hold on Thee, For Thou hast hid Thy face from us, And  thou meltest us away by our iniquities.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And now, O Jehovah, thou [art] our Father, We [are] the  clay, and Thou our Framer, And the work of Thy hand &#8212; all of  us.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Be not wroth, O Jehovah, very sore, Nor for ever remember  iniquity, Lo, look attentively, we beseech Thee, Thy people  [are] we all.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Thy holy cities have been a wilderness, Zion a wilderness  hath been, Jerusalem a desolation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Our holy and our beautiful house, Where praise Thee did  our fathers, Hath become burnt with fire, And all our desirable  things have become a waste.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For these dost Thou refrain Thyself, Jehovah? Thou art  silent, and dost afflict us very sore!&#8217;</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
