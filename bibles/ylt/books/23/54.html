Break forth with  singing, and cry aloud, She hath not brought forth! For more  [are] the sons of the desolate, Than the sons of the married  one, said Jehovah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Enlarge the place of thy tent, And the curtains of thy  tabernacles they stretch out, Restrain not &#8212; lengthen thy  cords, And thy pins make strong.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For right and left thou breakest forth, And thy seed doth  nations possess,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And desolate cities they cause to be inhabited. Fear not,  for thou art not ashamed, Nor blush, for thou art not  confounded, For the shame of thy youth thou forgettest, And the  reproach of thy widowhood Thou dost not remember any more.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For thy Maker [is] thy husband, Jehovah of Hosts [is] His  name, And thy Redeemer [is] the Holy One of Israel, &#8216;God of all  the earth,&#8217; He is called.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For, as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, Called thee  hath Jehovah, Even a youthful wife when she is refused, said  thy God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>In a small moment I have forsaken thee, And in great  mercies I do gather thee,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>In overflowing wrath I hid my face [for] a moment from  thee, And in kindness age-during I have loved thee, Said thy  Redeemer &#8212; Jehovah!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For, the waters of Noah [is] this to Me, In that I have  sworn &#8212; the waters of Noah Do not pass again over the earth &#8212;  So I have sworn, Wrath is not upon thee, Nor rebuke against  thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For the mountains depart, and the hills remove, And My  kindness from thee departeth not, And the covenant of My peace  removeth not, Said hath thy loving one &#8212; Jehovah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>O afflicted, storm-tossed, not comforted, Lo, I am laying  with cement thy stones, And have founded thee with sapphires,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And have made of agate thy pinnacles, And thy gates of  carbuncle stones, And all thy border of stones of delight,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And all thy sons are taught of Jehovah, And abundant [is]  the peace of thy sons.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>In righteousness thou establishest thyself, Be far from  oppression, for thou fearest not, And from ruin, for it cometh  not near unto thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Lo, he doth diligently assemble without My desire, Who  hath assembled near thee? By thee he falleth!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Lo, I &#8212; I have prepared an artizan, Blowing on a fire of  coals, And bringing out an instrument for his work, And I have  prepared a destroyer to destroy.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>No weapon formed against thee prospereth, And every tongue  rising against thee, In judgment thou condemnest. This [is] the  inheritance of the servants of Jehovah, And their righteousness  from me, an affirmation of Jehovah!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
