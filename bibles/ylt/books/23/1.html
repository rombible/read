<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, For Jehovah hath  spoken: Sons I have nourished and brought up, And they &#8212; they  transgressed against Me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>An ox hath known its owner, And an ass the crib of its  master, Israel hath not known, My people hath not understood.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Ah, sinning nation, a people heavy [with] iniquity, A seed  of evil doers, sons &#8212; corrupters! They have forsaken Jehovah,  They have despised the Holy One of Israel, They have gone away  backward.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Wherefore are ye stricken any more? Ye do add apostacy!  Every head is become diseased, and every heart [is] sick.</p>
