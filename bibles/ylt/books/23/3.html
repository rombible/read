<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Hero and man of war, judge and prophet, And diviner and  elder,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Head of fifty, and accepted of faces, And counsellor, and  the wise of artificers, And the intelligent of charmers.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And I have made youths their heads, And sucklings rule over  them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the people hath exacted &#8212; man upon man, Even a man on  his neighbour, Enlarge themselves do the youths against the  aged, And the lightly esteemed against the honoured.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When one layeth hold on his brother, [Of] the house of his  father, [by] the garment, &#8216;Come, a ruler thou art to us, And  this ruin [is] under thy hand.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>He lifteth up, in that day, saying: &#8216;I am not a binder up,  And in my house is neither bread nor garment, Ye do not make me  a ruler of the people.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For stumbled hath Jerusalem, and Judah hath fallen, For  their tongue and their doings [are] against Jehovah, To provoke  the eyes of His glory.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>The appearance of their faces witnessed against them, And  their sin, as Sodom, they declared, They have not hidden! Wo to  their soul, For they have done to themselves evil.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Say ye to the righteous, that [it is] good, Because the  fruit of their doings they eat.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Wo to the wicked &#8212; evil, Because the deed of his hand is  done to him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>My people &#8212; its exactors [are] sucklings, And women have  ruled over it. My people &#8212; thy eulogists are causing to err,  And the way of thy paths swallowed up.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Jehovah hath stood up to plead, And He is standing to judge  the peoples.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Jehovah into judgment doth enter With elders of His people,  and its heads: &#8216;And ye, ye have consumed the vineyard, Plunder  of the poor [is] in your houses.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>What &#8212; to you? ye bruise My people, And the faces of the  poor ye grind.&#8217; An affirmation of the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts,  And Jehovah saith:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8216;Because that daughters of Zion have been haughty, And they  walk stretching out the neck, And deceiving [with] the eyes,  Walking and mincing they go, And with their feet they make a  tinkling,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>The Lord also hath scabbed The crown of the head of  daughters of Zion, And Jehovah their simplicity exposeth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>In that day doth the Lord turn aside The beauty of the  tinkling ornaments, And of the embroidered works, And of the  round tires like moons, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Of the drops, and the bracelets, and the mufflers, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Of the bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, And of the  bands, And of the perfume boxes, and the amulets, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Of the seals, and of the nose-rings, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Of the costly apparel, and of the mantles, And of the  coverings, and of the purses, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Of the mirrors, and of the linen garments, And of the  hoods, and of the vails,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And it hath been, instead of spice is muck, And instead of  a girdle, a rope, And instead of curled work, baldness, And  instead of a stomacher a girdle of sackcloth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>For instead of glory, thy men by sword do fall, And thy  might in battle.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And lamented and mourned have her openings, Yea, she hath  been emptied, on the earth she sitteth!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
