<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And He also [is] wise, and bringeth in evil, And His words  He hath not turned aside, And He hath risen against a house of  evil doers, And against the help of workers of iniquity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the Egyptians [are men], and not God, And their horses  [are] flesh, and not spirit, And Jehovah stretcheth out His  hand, And stumbled hath the helper, And fallen hath the helped  one, And together all of them are consumed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For thus said Jehovah unto me: &#8216;As growl doth the lion and  the young lion over his prey, Called against whom is a  multitude of shepherds, From their voice he is not affrighted,  And from their noise he is not humbled; So come down doth  Jehovah of Hosts To war on mount Zion, and on her height.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>As birds flying, so doth Jehovah of Hosts Cover over  Jerusalem, covering and delivering, Passing over, and causing  to escape.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Turn back to Him from whom sons of Israel Have deepened  apostacy. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For in that day despise doth each His idols of silver, and  his idols of gold, That your hands made to you &#8212; a sin.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And fallen hath Asshur by sword, not of the high, Yea, a  sword &#8212; not of the low, doth consume him, And he hath fled for  himself from the face of a sword, And his young men become  tributary.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And [to] his rock from fear he passeth on, And affrighted  by the ensign have been his princes &#8212; an affirmation of  Jehovah, Who hath a light in Zion, And who hath a furnace in  Jerusalem!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
