<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For from the Holy City they have been called, And on the  God of Israel been supported, Jehovah of Hosts [is] His name.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>The former things from that time I declared, And from my  mouth they have gone forth, And I proclaim them, Suddenly I  have done, and it cometh.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>From my knowing that thou art obstinate, And a sinew of  iron thy neck, And thy forehead brass,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And I declare to thee from that time, Before it cometh I  have caused thee to hear, Lest thou say, &#8216;Mine idol hath done  them, And my graven image, And my molten image did command  them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Thou hast heard, see the whole of it, And ye, do ye not  declare? I have caused thee to hear new things from this time,  And things reserved that ye knew not.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now they have been produced and not from that time, Yea,  before the day, and thou hast not heard them, Lest thou say,  &#8216;Lo, I have known them.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Yea, thou hast not heard, Yea, thou hast not known, Yea,  from that time not opened hath thine ear, For I have known thou  dealest treacherously, And &#8216;Transgressor from the belly,&#8217; One  is crying to thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For My name&#8217;s sake I defer Mine anger, And My praise I  restrain for thee, So as not to cut thee off.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Lo, I have refined thee, and not with silver, I have  chosen thee in a furnace of affliction.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For My sake, for Mine own sake, I do [it], For how is it  polluted? And Mine honour to another I give not.</p>
<p class="hdg">Israel Promised Deliverance</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Hearken to me, O Jacob, and Israel, My called one, I [am]  He, I [am] first, and I [am] last;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Also, My hand hath founded earth, And My right hand  stretched out the heavens, I am calling unto them, they stand  together.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Be gathered all of you, and hear, Who among them did  declare these things? Jehovah hath loved him, He doth His  pleasure on Babylon, And His arm [is on] the Chaldeans.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>I &#8212; I have spoken, yea, I have called him, I have brought  him in, And he hath made prosperous his way.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Come ye near unto me, hear this, Not from the beginning in  secret spake I, From the time of its being, there [am] I, And  now the Lord Jehovah hath sent me, and His Spirit.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Thus said Jehovah, thy redeemer, The Holy One of Israel,  &#8216;I [am] Jehovah thy God, teaching thee to profit, Causing thee  to tread in the way thou goest.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>O that thou hadst attended to My commands, Then as a river  is thy peace, And thy righteousness as billows of the sea,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And as sand is thy seed, And the offspring of thy bowels  as its gravel, Not cut off nor destroyed his name before Me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Go out from Babylon, flee from the Chaldeans, With a voice  of singing declare, Cause ye this to be heard, Bring it forth  unto the end of the earth, Say, Redeemed hath Jehovah His  servant Jacob.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And they have not thirsted in waste places, He hath caused  them to go on, Waters from a rock he hath caused to flow to  them, Yea, he cleaveth a rock, and flow do waters.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>There is no peace, said Jehovah, to the wicked!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
