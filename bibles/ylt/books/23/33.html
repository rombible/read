<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>O Jehovah, favour us, for thee we have waited, Be their  arm, in the mornings, Yea, our salvation in time of adversity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>From the voice of a multitude fled have peoples, From thine  exaltation scattered have been nations.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Desolated have been highways, Ceased hath he who passeth  along the path, He hath broken covenant, He hath despised  enemies, He hath not esteemed a man.</p>
