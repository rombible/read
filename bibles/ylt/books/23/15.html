Because in a night destroyed was Ar of  Moab &#8212; It hath been cut off, Because in a night destroyed was  Kir of Moab &#8212; It hath been cut off.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He hath gone up to Bajith and Dibon, The high places &#8212; to  weep, On Nebo and on Medeba Moab howleth, On all its heads [is]  baldness, every beard cut off.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>In its out-places they girded on sackcloth, On its  pinnacles, and in its broad places, Every one howleth &#8212; going  down with weeping.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And cry doth Heshbon and Elealeh, Unto Jahaz heard hath  been their voice, Therefore the armed ones of Moab do shout,  His life hath been grievous to him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>My heart [is] toward Moab, Cry do her fugitives unto Zoar,  a heifer of the third [year], For &#8212; the ascent of Luhith &#8212;  With weeping he goeth up in it, For, in the way of Horonaim, A  cry of destruction they wake up.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For, the waters of Nimrim are desolations, For, withered  hath been the hay, Finished hath been the tender grass, A green  thing there hath not been.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Therefore the abundance he made, and their store, Unto the  brook of the willows they carry.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For gone round hath the cry the border of Moab, Unto Eglaim  [is] its howling, And to Beer-Elim [is] its howling.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For the waters of Dimon have been full of blood, For I set  on Dimon additions, For the escaped of Moab a lion, And for the  remnant of Adamah!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
