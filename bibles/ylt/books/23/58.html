<div class="chap"><p class="hdg">True Fasts and Sabbaths</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Call with the throat, restrain not, As a trumpet lift up  thy voice, And declare to My people their transgression, And to  the house of Jacob their sins;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Seeing &#8212; Me day by day they seek, And the knowledge of My  ways they desire, As a nation that righteousness hath done, And  the judgment of its God hath not forsaken, They ask of me  judgments of righteousness, The drawing near of God they  desire:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8216;Why have we fasted, and Thou hast not seen? We have  afflicted our soul, and Thou knowest not.&#8217; Lo, in the day of  your fast ye find pleasure, And all your labours ye exact.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Lo, for strife and debate ye fast, And to smite with the  fist of wickedness, Ye fast not as [to]-day, To sound in the high  place your voice.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Like this is the fast that I choose? The day of a man&#8217;s  afflicting his soul? To bow as a reed his head, And sackcloth  and ashes spread out? This dost thou call a fast, And a  desirable day &#8212; to Jehovah?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Is not this the fast that I chose &#8212; To loose the bands of  wickedness, To shake off the burdens of the yoke, And to send  out the oppressed free, And every yoke ye draw off?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Is it not to deal to the hungry thy bread, And the mourning  poor bring home, That thou seest the naked and cover him, And  from thine own flesh hide not thyself?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then broken up as the dawn is thy light, And thy health in  haste springeth up, Gone before thee hath thy righteousness,  The honour of Jehovah doth gather thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then thou callest, and Jehovah answereth, Thou criest, and  He saith, &#8216;Behold Me.&#8217; If thou turn aside from thy midst the  yoke, The sending forth of the finger, And the speaking of  vanity,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And dost bring out to the hungry thy soul, And the  afflicted soul dost satisfy, Then risen in the darkness hath  thy light, And thy thick darkness [is] as noon.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And Jehovah doth lead thee continually, And hath satisfied  in drought thy soul, And thy bones He armeth, And thou hast  been as a watered garden, And as an outlet of waters, whose  waters lie not.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And they have built out of thee the wastes of old, The  foundations of many generations thou raisest up, And one  calleth thee, &#8216;Repairer of the breach, Restorer of paths to  rest in.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>If thou dost turn from the sabbath thy foot, Doing thine  own pleasure on My holy day, And hast cried to the sabbath, &#8216;A  delight,&#8217; To the holy of Jehovah, &#8216;Honoured,&#8217; And hast honoured  it, without doing thine own ways, Without finding thine own  pleasure, And speaking a word.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then dost thou delight thyself on Jehovah, And I have  caused thee to ride on high places of earth, And have caused  thee to eat the inheritance of Jacob thy father, For the mouth  of Jehovah hath spoken!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
