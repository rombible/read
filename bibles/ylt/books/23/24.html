<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And it hath been &#8212; as a people so a priest, As the servant  so his master, As the maid-servant so her mistress, As the  buyer so the seller, As the lender so the borrower, As the  usurer so he who is lifting [it] on himself. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Utterly emptied is the land, and utterly spoiled, For  Jehovah hath spoken this word: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Mourned, faded hath the land, Languished, faded hath the  world, Languished have they &#8212; the high place of the people of  the land. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the land hath been defiled under its inhabitants,  Because they have transgressed laws, They have changed a  statute, They have made void a covenant age-during. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Therefore a curse hath consumed the land, And the  inhabitants in it are become desolate, Therefore consumed have  been inhabitants of the land, And few men have been left.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Mourned hath the new wine, languished the vine, Sighed have  all the joyful of heart.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Ceased hath the joy of tabrets, Ceased hath the noise of  exulting ones, Ceased hath the joy of a harp.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>With a song they drink not wine, Bitter is strong drink to  those drinking it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>It was broken down &#8212; a city of emptiness, Shut hath been  every house from entrance.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>A cry over the wine [is] in out-places, Darkened hath been  all joy, Removed hath been the joy of the land.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Left in the city [is] desolation, And [with] wasting is  the gate smitten.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>When thus it is in the heart of the land, In the midst of  the peoples, As the compassing of the olive, As gleanings when  harvest hath been finished,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>They &#8212; they lift up their voice, They sing of the  excellency of Jehovah, They have cried aloud from the sea.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Therefore in prosperity honour ye Jehovah, In isles of the  sea, the name of Jehovah, God of Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>From the skirt of the earth we heard songs, The desire of  the righteous. And I say, &#8216;Leanness [is] to me, Leanness [is]  to me, wo [is] to me.&#8217; Treacherous dealers dealt treacherously,  Yea, treachery, treacherous dealers dealt treacherously.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Fear, and a snare, and a gin, [Are] on thee, O inhabitant  of the land.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And it hath come to pass, He who is fleeing from the noise  of the fear Doth fall into the snare, And he who is coming up  from the midst of the snare, Is captured by the gin, For  windows on high have been opened, And shaken are foundations of  the land.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Utterly broken down hath been the land, Utterly broken  hath been the land, Utterly moved hath been the land.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Stagger greatly doth the land as a drunkard, And it hath  been moved as a lodge, And heavy on it hath been its  transgression, And it hath fallen, and addeth not to rise.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And it hath come to pass, in that day, Jehovah layeth a  charge on the host of the high place in the high place, And on  the kings of the land on the land.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And they have been gathered &#8212; A gathering of bound ones  in a pit, And shut up they have been in a prison, And after a  multitude of days are inspected.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And confounded hath been the moon, And ashamed hath been  the sun, For reigned hath Jehovah of Hosts In mount Zion, and  in Jerusalem, And over-against His elders &#8212; honour!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
