And  the fading flower of the beauty of his glory, That [is] on the  head of the fat valley of the broken down of wine.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Lo, a mighty and strong one [is] to the Lord, As a storm of  hail &#8212; a destructive shower, As an inundation of mighty waters  overflowing, He cast down to the earth with the hand.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>By feet trodden down is the proud crown of the drunkards of  Ephraim,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the fading flower of the beauty of his glory That [is]  on the head of the fat valley, Hath been as its first-fruit  before summer, That its beholder seeth, While it [is] yet in  his hand he swalloweth it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>In that day is Jehovah of Hosts For a crown of beauty, and  for a diadem of glory, To the remnant of His people.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And for a spirit of judgment To him who is sitting in the  judgment, And for might [to] those turning back the battle to  the gate.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And even these through wine have erred, And through strong  drink have wandered, Priest and prophet erred through strong  drink, They have been swallowed up of the wine, They wandered  because of the strong drink, They have erred in seeing, They  have stumbled judicially.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For all tables have been full of vomit, Filth &#8212; without  place!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>By whom doth He teach knowledge? And by whom doth He cause  to understand the report? The weaned from milk, the removed  from breasts,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For rule [is] on rule, rule on rule, line on line, line on  line, A little here, a little there,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For by scorned lip, and by another tongue, Doth He speak  unto this people.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Unto whom He hath said, &#8216;This [is] the rest, give ye rest  to the weary, And this &#8212; the refreshing:&#8217; And they have not  been willing to hear,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And to whom a word of Jehovah hath been, Rule on rule,  rule on rule, line on line, line on line, A little here, a  little there, So that they go and have stumbled backward, And  been broken, and snared, and captured.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Because ye have said: &#8216;We have made a covenant with death,  And with Sheol we have made a provision, An overflowing  scourge, when it passeth over, Doth not meet us, Though we have  made a lie our refuge, And in falsehood have been hidden.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: &#8216;Lo, I am laying a  foundation in Zion, A stone &#8212; a tried stone, a corner stone  precious, a settled foundation, He who is believing doth not  make haste.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And I have put judgment for a line, And righteousness for  a plummet, And sweep away doth hail the refuge of lies, And the  secret hiding-place do waters overflow.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And disannulled hath been your covenant with death, And  your provision with Sheol doth not stand, An overflowing  scourge, when it passeth over, Then ye have been to it for a  treading-place.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>From the fulness of its passing over it taketh you, For  morning by morning it passeth over, By day and by night, And it  hath been only a trembling to consider the report.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>For shorter hath been the bed Than to stretch one&#8217;s self  out in, And the covering hath been narrower Than to wrap one&#8217;s  self up in.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For as [at] mount Perazim rise doth Jehovah, As [at] the  valley in Gibeon He is troubled, To do His work &#8212; strange [is]  His work, And to do His deed &#8212; strange [is] His deed.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And now, show not yourselves scorners, Lest strong be  your bands, For a consumption, that is determined, I have  heard, by the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, [Is] for all the land.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>For not with a sharp-pointed thing threshed are fitches,  And the wheel of a cart on cummin turned round, For with a  staff beaten out are fitches, And cummin with a rod.</p>
