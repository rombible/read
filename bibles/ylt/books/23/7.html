<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And it is declared to the house of David, saying, &#8216;Aram hath  been led towards Ephraim,&#8217; And his heart and the heart of his  people is moved, like the moving of trees of a forest by the  presence of wind.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Jehovah saith unto Isaiah, &#8216;Go forth, I pray thee, to  meet Ahaz, thou, and Shear-Jashub thy son, unto the end of the  conduit of the upper pool, unto the highway of the fuller&#8217;s  field, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and thou hast said unto him: &#8216;Take heed, and be quiet, fear  not, And let not thy heart be timid, Because of these two tails  of smoking brands, For the fierceness of the anger of Rezin and  Aram, And the son of Remaliah.
