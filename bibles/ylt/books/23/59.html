<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>But your iniquities have been separating Between you and  your God, And your sins have hidden The Presence from you &#8212;  from hearing.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For your hands have been polluted with blood, And your  fingers with iniquity, Your lips have spoken falsehood, Your  tongue perverseness doth mutter.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>There is none calling in righteousness, And there is none  pleading in faithfulness, Trusting on emptiness, and speaking  falsehood, Conceiving perverseness, and bearing iniquity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Eggs of a viper they have hatched, And webs of a spider  they weave, Whoso is eating their eggs doth die, And the  crushed hatcheth a viper.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Their webs become not a garment, Nor do they cover  themselves with their works, Their works [are] works of  iniquity, And a deed of violence [is] in their hands.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Their feet to evil do run, And they haste to shed innocent  blood, Their thoughts [are] thoughts of iniquity, Spoiling and  destruction [are] in their highways.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>A way of peace they have not known, And there is no  judgment in their paths, Their paths they have made perverse  for themselves, No treader in it hath known peace.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Therefore hath judgment been far from us, And righteousness  reacheth us not, We wait for light, and lo, darkness, For  brightness &#8212; in thick darkness we go,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>We feel like the blind [for] the wall, Yea, as without  eyes we feel, We have stumbled at noon as at twilight, In  desolate places as the dead.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>We make a noise as bears &#8212; all of us, And as doves we coo  sorely; We wait for judgment, and there is none, For salvation  &#8212; it hath been far from us.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For our transgressions have been multiplied before Thee,  And our sins have testified against us, For our transgressions  [are] with us, And our iniquities &#8212; we have known them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Transgressing, and lying against Jehovah, And removing  from after our God, Speaking oppression and apostacy,  Conceiving and uttering from the heart Words of falsehood.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And removed backward is judgment, And righteousness afar  off standeth, For truth hath been feeble in the street, And  straightforwardness is not able to enter,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And the truth is lacking, And whoso is turning aside from  evil, Is making himself a spoil. And Jehovah seeth, and it is  evil in His eyes, That there is no judgment.</p>
<p class="hdg">Salvation is Only of God</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And He seeth that there is no man, And is astonished that  there is no intercessor, And His own arm giveth salvation to  Him, And His righteousness &#8212; it sustained Him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And He putteth on righteousness as a breastplate, And an  helmet of salvation on His head, And He putteth on garments of  vengeance [for] clothing, And is covered, as [with] an  upper-robe, [with] zeal.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>According to deeds &#8212; so He repayeth. Fury to His  adversaries, [their] deed to His enemies, To the isles [their]  deed He repayeth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And they fear from the west the name of Jehovah, And from  the rising of the sun &#8212; His honour, When come in as a flood  doth an adversary, The Spirit of Jehovah hath raised an ensign  against him.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Covenant of the Redeemer</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And come to Zion hath a redeemer, Even to captives of  transgression in Jacob, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And I &#8212; this [is] My covenant with them, said Jehovah, My  Spirit that [is] on thee, And My words that I have put in thy  mouth, Depart not from thy mouth, And from the mouth of thy  seed, And from the mouth of thy seed&#8217;s seed, said Jehovah, From  henceforth unto the age!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
