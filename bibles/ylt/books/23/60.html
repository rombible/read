<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And sons of a stranger have built thy walls, And their  kings do serve thee, For in My wrath I have smitten thee, And  in My good pleasure I have pitied thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And opened have thy gates continually, By day and by night  they are not shut, To bring unto thee the force of nations,  Even their kings are led.</p>
