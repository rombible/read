Lo, Jehovah is riding on a swift thick  cloud, And He hath entered Egypt, And moved have been the idols  of Egypt at His presence, And the heart of Egypt melteth in its  midst.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And I armed Egyptians against Egyptians, And they fought,  each against his brother, And each against his neighbour, City  against city, kingdom against kingdom.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And emptied out hath been in its midst the spirit of Egypt.  And its counsel I swallow up, And they have sought unto the  idols, And unto the charmers, And unto those having familiar  spirits, And unto the wizards.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And I have delivered the Egyptians Into the hand of a hard  lord, And a strong king doth rule over them, An affirmation of  the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And failed have waters from the sea, And a river is wasted  and dried up.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And they have turned away the flowings, Weak and dried up  have been brooks of the bulwark, Reed and flag have withered.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Exposed things by the brook, by the edge of the brook, And  every sown thing of the brook, hath withered, It hath been  driven away, and is not.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And lamented have the fishers, And mourned have all casting  angle into a brook, And those spreading nets on the face of the  waters have languished.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And ashamed have been makers of fine flax, And weavers of  net-works.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And its foundations have been smitten, All making wages  [are] afflicted in soul.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Only, fools [are] the princes of Zoan, The counsel of the  wise ones of the counsellors of Pharaoh hath become brutish.  How say ye unto Pharaoh, &#8216;A son of the wise am I, a son of  kings of antiquity?&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Where [are] they now, thy wise ones? Yea, let them tell to  thee, I pray thee, And they know what Jehovah of Hosts hath  counselled against Egypt!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Foolish have been princes of Zoan, Lifted up have been  princes of Noph, And they have caused Egypt to err, The chief  of her tribes.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Jehovah hath mingled in her midst A spirit of  perverseness, And they have caused Egypt to err in all its  work, As a drunkard erreth in his vomit.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And there is no work to Egypt, That head or tail, branch  or reed, may do.</p>
<p class="hdg">Blessing to Egypt, Assyria, Israel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>In that day is Egypt like women, And it hath mourned, and  been afraid, Because of the waving of the hand of Jehovah of  Hosts, That He is waving over it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And the land of Judah hath been to Egypt for a cause of  staggering, Every one who doth mention it, for himself feareth,  Because of the counsel of Jehovah of Hosts, That He is  counselling against it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>In that day there are five cities in the land of Egypt,  Speaking the lip of Canaan, And swearing to Jehovah of Hosts,  &#8216;The city of destruction,&#8217; is said of one.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>In that day there is an altar to Jehovah In the midst of  the land of Egypt, And a standing pillar near its border to  Jehovah, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And it hath been for a sign and for a testimony, To  Jehovah of Hosts in the land of Egypt, For they cry unto  Jehovah from the face of oppressors, And He sendeth to them a  saviour, Even a great one, and hath delivered them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And known hath been Jehovah to Egypt, And the Egyptians  have known Jehovah in that day, And done sacrifice and present,  And vowed a vow to Jehovah, and completed [it]. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And Jehovah hath smitten Egypt, smiting and healing, And  they have turned back unto Jehovah, And He hath been entreated  of them, And hath healed them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>In that day is a highway out of Egypt to Asshur, And come  in have the Assyrians to Egypt, And the Egyptians into Asshur,  And the Egyptians have served with the Assyrians.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>In that day is Israel third, After Egypt, and after  Asshur, A blessing in the heart of the earth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>In that Jehovah of Hosts did bless it, saying, &#8216;Blessed  [is] My people &#8212; Egypt, And the work of My hands &#8212; Asshur,  And Mine inheritance &#8212; Israel!&#8217;</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
