<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Shake thyself from dust, arise, sit, O Jerusalem, Bands of  thy neck have loosed themselves, O captive, daughter of Zion.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For thus said Jehovah: &#8216;For nought ye have been sold, And  not by money are ye redeemed.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For thus said the Lord Jehovah: &#8216;To Egypt My people went  down at first to sojourn there, And Asshur &#8212; for nought he  hath oppressed it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And now, what &#8212; to Me here, An affirmation of Jehovah,  That taken is My people for nought? Its rulers cause howling,  &#8212; an affirmation of Jehovah, And continually all the day My  name is despised. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Therefore doth My people know My name, Therefore, in that  day, Surely I [am] He who is speaking, behold Me.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>How comely on the mountains, Have been the feet of one  proclaiming tidings, Sounding peace, proclaiming good tidings,  Sounding salvation, Saying to Zion, &#8216;Reigned hath thy God.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The voice of thy watchmen! They have lifted up the voice,  together they cry aloud, Because eye to eye they see, in  Jehovah&#8217;s turning back [to] Zion.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Break forth, sing together, O wastes of Jerusalem, For  Jehovah hath comforted His people, He hath redeemed Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Jehovah hath made bare His holy arm Before the eyes of all  the nations, And seen have all the ends of the earth, The  salvation of our God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Turn aside, turn aside, go out thence, The unclean touch  not, go out from her midst, Be ye pure, who are bearing the  weapons of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For not in haste do ye go out, Yea, with flight ye go not  on, For going before you [is] Jehovah, And gathering you [is]  the God of Israel!</p>
