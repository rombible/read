<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and thou hast remembered all the way which Jehovah thy God  hath caused thee to go these forty years in the wilderness, in  order to humble thee to try thee, to know that which [is] in  thy heart, whether thou dost keep His commands or not. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8216;And He doth humble thee, and cause thee to hunger and doth  cause thee to eat the manna (which thou hast not known, even  thy fathers have not known), in order to cause thee to know  that not by bread alone doth man live, but by every produce of  the mouth of Jehovah man doth live. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8216;Thy raiment hath not worn out from off thee, and thy foot  hath not swelled these forty years, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and thou hast known, with thy heart, that as a man  chastiseth his son Jehovah thy God is chastising thee, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and thou hast kept the commands of Jehovah thy God, to walk  in His ways, and to fear Him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8216;For Jehovah thy God is bringing thee in unto a good land, a  land of brooks of waters, of fountains, and of depths coming  out in valley and in mountain: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>a land of wheat, and barley, and vine, and fig, and  pomegranate; a land of oil olive and honey; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>a land in which without scarcity thou dost eat bread, thou  dost not lack anything in it; a land whose stones [are] iron,  and out of its mountains thou dost dig brass; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and thou hast eaten, and been satisfied, and hast blessed  Jehovah thy God, on the good land which he hath given to thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8216;Take heed to thyself, lest thou forget Jehovah thy God so  as not to keep His commands, and His judgments, and His statutes  which I am commanding thee to-day;

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8216;And thy heart hath been high, and thou hast forgotten  Jehovah thy God (who is bringing thee out of the land of Egypt,  out of a house of servants; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>who is causing thee to go in the great and the terrible  wilderness &#8212; burning serpent, and scorpion, and thirst &#8212;  where there is no water; who is bringing out to thee waters  from the flinty rock; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>who is causing thee to eat manna in the wilderness, which  thy fathers have not known, in order to humble thee, and in  order to try thee, to do thee good in thy latter end), 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>and thou hast said in thy heart, My power, and the might of  my hand, hath made for me this wealth: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8216;And thou hast remembered Jehovah thy God, for He it [is]  who is giving to thee power to make wealth, in order to  establish His covenant which He hath sworn to thy fathers as  [at] this day.

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>as the nations whom Jehovah is destroying from your  presence, so ye perish; because ye hearken not to the voice of  Jehovah your God.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
