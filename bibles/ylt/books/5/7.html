<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and Jehovah thy God hath given them before thee, and thou  hast smitten them &#8212; thou dost utterly devote them &#8212; thou dost  not make with them a covenant, nor dost thou favour them.

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8216;And thou hast known that Jehovah thy God He [is] God, the  faithful God, keeping the covenant, and the kindness, to those  loving Him, and to those keeping His commands &#8212; to a thousand  generations,
