<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and it hath been, in your drawing near unto the battle,  that the priest hath come nigh, and spoken unto the people, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and said unto them, Hear, Israel, ye are drawing near  to-day to battle against your enemies, let not your hearts be  tender, fear not, nor make haste, nor be terrified at their  presence, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>for Jehovah your God [is] He who is going with you, to  fight for you with your enemies &#8212; to save you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8216;And the authorities have spoken unto the people, saying,  Who [is] the man that hath built a new house, and hath not  dedicated it? &#8212; let him go and turn back to his house, lest he  die in battle, and another man dedicate it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8216;And who [is] the man that hath planted a vineyard, and  hath not made it common? &#8212; let him go and turn back to his  house, lest he die in battle, and another man make it common. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8216;And who [is] the man that hath betrothed a woman, and hath  not taken her? &#8212; let him go and turn back to his house, lest  he die in battle, and another man take her. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8216;And the authorities have added to speak unto the people,  and said, Who [is] the man that is afraid and tender of heart?  &#8212; let him go and turn back to his house, and the heart of his  brethren doth not melt like his heart; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and it hath come to pass as the authorities finish to speak  unto the people, that they have appointed princes of the hosts  at the head of the people.</p>
