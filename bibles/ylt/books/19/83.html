<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For, lo, Thine enemies do roar, And those hating Thee have  lifted up the head,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Against Thy people they take crafty counsel, And consult  against Thy hidden ones.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>They have said, &#8216;Come, And we cut them off from [being] a  nation, And the name of Israel is not remembered any more.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For they consulted in heart together, Against Thee a  covenant they make,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Tents of Edom, and Ishmaelites, Moab, and the Hagarenes,</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Do to them as [to] Midian, As [to] Sisera, as [to] Jabin,  at the stream Kishon.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>They were destroyed at Endor, They were dung for the  ground!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Make their nobles as Oreb and as Zeeb, And as Zebah and  Zalmunna all their princes,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Who have said, &#8216;Let us occupy for ourselves The comely  places of God.&#8217;</p>
