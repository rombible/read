<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For the mouth of wickedness, and the mouth of deceit,  Against me they have opened, They have spoken with me &#8212; A  tongue of falsehood, and words of hatred!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>They have compassed me about, And they fight me without  cause.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For my love they oppose me, and I &#8212; prayer!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And they set against me evil for good, And hatred for my  love.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Appoint Thou over him the wicked, And an adversary  standeth at his right hand.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>In his being judged, he goeth forth wicked, And his prayer  is for sin.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>His days are few, his oversight another taketh,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>His sons are fatherless, and his wife a widow.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And wander continually do his sons, Yea, they have  begged, And have sought out of their dry places.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>An exactor layeth a snare for all that he hath, And  strangers spoil his labour.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>He hath none to extend kindness, Nor is there one showing  favour to his orphans.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>His posterity is for cutting off, In another generation  is their name blotted out.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The iniquity of his fathers Is remembered unto Jehovah,  And the sin of his mother is not blotted out.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>They are before Jehovah continually, And He cutteth off  from earth their memorial.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Because that he hath not remembered to do kindness, And  pursueth the poor man and needy, And the smitten of heart &#8212; to  slay,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And he loveth reviling, and it meeteth him, And he hath  not delighted in blessing, And it is far from him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And he putteth on reviling as his robe, And it cometh in  as water into his midst, And as oil into his bones.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>It is to him as apparel &#8212; he covereth himself, And for a  continual girdle he girdeth it on.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>This [is] the wage of mine accusers from Jehovah, And of  those speaking evil against my soul.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And Thou, O Jehovah Lord, Deal with me for Thy name&#8217;s  sake, Because Thy kindness [is] good, deliver me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>For I [am] poor and needy, And my heart hath been pierced  in my midst.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>As a shadow when it is stretched out I have gone, I have  been driven away as a locust.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>My knees have been feeble from fasting, And my flesh hath  failed of fatness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And I &#8212; I have been a reproach to them, They see me,  they shake their head.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Help me, O Jehovah my God, Save me, according to Thy  kindness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And they know that this [is] Thy hand, Thou, O Jehovah,  Thou hast done it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>They revile, and Thou dost bless, They have risen, and  are ashamed, And Thy servant doth rejoice.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Mine accusers put on blushing, and are covered, As an  upper robe [is] their shame.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>I thank Jehovah greatly with my mouth, And in the midst  of many I praise Him,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>For He standeth at the right hand of the needy, To save  from those judging his soul.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
