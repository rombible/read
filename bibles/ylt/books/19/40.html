I have diligently  expected Jehovah, And He inclineth to me, and heareth my cry,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And He doth cause me to come up From a pit of desolation &#8212;  from mire of mud, And He raiseth up on a rock my feet, He is  establishing my steps.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And He putteth in my mouth a new song, &#8216;Praise to our God.&#8217;  Many do see and fear, and trust in Jehovah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>O the happiness of the man Who hath made Jehovah his trust,  And hath not turned unto the proud, And those turning aside to  lies.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Much hast Thou done, Jehovah my God; Thy wonders and Thy  thoughts toward us, There is none to arrange unto Thee, I  declare and speak: They have been more than to be numbered.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Sacrifice and present Thou hast not desired, Ears Thou hast  prepared for me, Burnt and sin-offering Thou hast not asked.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then said I, &#8216;Lo, I have come,&#8217; In the roll of the book it  is written of me,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>To do Thy pleasure, my God, I have delighted, And Thy law  [is] within my heart.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>I have proclaimed tidings of righteousness In the great  assembly, lo, my lips I restrain not, O Jehovah, Thou hast  known.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Thy righteousness I have not concealed In the midst of my  heart, Thy faithfulness and Thy salvation I have told, I have  not hidden Thy kindness and Thy truth, To the great assembly.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Thou, O Jehovah, restrainest not Thy mercies from me, Thy  kindness and Thy truth do continually keep me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For compassed me have evils innumerable, Overtaken me have  mine iniquities, And I have not been able to see; They have  been more than the hairs of my head, And my heart hath forsaken  me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Be pleased, O Jehovah, to deliver me, O Jehovah, for my  help make haste.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>They are ashamed and confounded together, Who are seeking  my soul to destroy it, They are turned backward, And are  ashamed, who are desiring my evil.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>They are desolate because of their shame, Who are saying  to me, &#8216;Aha, aha.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>All seeking Thee rejoice and are glad in Thee, Those  loving Thy salvation say continually, &#8216;Jehovah is magnified.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And I [am] poor and needy, The Lord doth devise for me. My  help and my deliverer [art] Thou, O my God, tarry Thou not.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
