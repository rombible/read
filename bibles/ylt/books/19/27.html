Jehovah [is] my light and my salvation, Whom do I  fear? Jehovah [is] the strength of my life, Of whom am I  afraid?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>When evil doers come near to me to eat my flesh, My  adversaries and mine enemies to me, They have stumbled and  fallen.</p>
