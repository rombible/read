<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Hidest me from the secret counsel of evil doers, From the  tumult of workers of iniquity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Who sharpened as a sword their tongue, They directed their  arrow &#8212; a bitter word.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>To shoot in secret places the perfect, Suddenly they shoot  him, and fear not.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>They strengthen for themselves an evil thing, They recount  of the hiding of snares, They have said, &#8216;Who doth look at it?&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>They search out perverse things, &#8216;We perfected a searching  search,&#8217; And the inward part of man, and the heart [are] deep.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And God doth shoot them [with] an arrow, Sudden have been  their wounds,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And they cause him to stumble, Against them [is] their own  tongue, Every looker on them fleeth away.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And all men fear, and declare the work of God, And His deed  they have considered wisely.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The righteous doth rejoice in Jehovah, And hath trusted in  Him, And boast themselves do all the upright of heart!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
