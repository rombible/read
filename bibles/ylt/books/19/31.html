In Thee, O Jehovah, I  have trusted, Let me not be ashamed to the age, In Thy  righteousness deliver me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Incline unto me Thine ear hastily, deliver me, Be to me for  a strong rock, For a house of bulwarks to save me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For my rock and my bulwark [art] Thou, For Thy name&#8217;s sake  lead me and tend me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Bring me out from the net that they hid for me, For Thou  [art] my strength.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Into Thy hand I commit my spirit, Thou hast redeemed me,  Jehovah God of truth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>I have hated the observers of lying vanities, And I toward  Jehovah have been confident.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>I rejoice, and am glad in Thy kindness, In that Thou hast  seen mine affliction, Thou hast known in adversities my soul.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Thou hast not shut me up, Into the hand of an enemy,  Thou hast caused my feet to stand in a broad place.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Favour me, O Jehovah, for distress [is] to me, Mine eye, my  soul, and my body Have become old by provocation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For my life hath been consumed in sorrow And my years in  sighing. Feeble because of mine iniquity hath been my strength,  And my bones have become old.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Among all mine adversaries I have been a reproach, And to  my neighbours exceedingly, And a fear to mine acquaintances,  Those seeing me without &#8212; fled from me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>I have been forgotten as dead out of mind, I have been as  a perishing vessel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For I have heard an evil account of many, Fear [is] round  about. In their being united against me, To take my life they  have devised,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And I on Thee &#8212; I have trusted, O Jehovah, I have said,  &#8216;Thou [art] my God.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>In Thy hand [are] my times, Deliver me from the hand of my  enemies, And from my pursuers.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Cause Thy face to shine on Thy servant, Save me in Thy  kindness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>O Jehovah, let me not be ashamed, For I have called Thee,  let the wicked be ashamed, Let them become silent to Sheol.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Let lips of falsehood become dumb, That are speaking  against the righteous, Ancient sayings, in pride and contempt.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>How abundant is Thy goodness, That Thou hast laid up for  those fearing Thee,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Thou hast wrought for those trusting in Thee, Before sons  of men. Thou hidest them in the secret place of Thy presence,  From artifices of man, Thou concealest them in a tabernacle,  From the strife of tongues.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Blessed [is] Jehovah, For He hath made marvellous His  kindness To me in a city of bulwarks.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And I &#8212; I have said in my haste, &#8216;I have been cut off  from before Thine eyes,&#8217; But Thou hast heard the voice of my  supplications, In my crying unto Thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Love Jehovah, all ye His saints, Jehovah is keeping the  faithful, And recompensing abundantly a proud doer.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Be strong, and He strengtheneth your heart, All ye who are  waiting for Jehovah!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
