Lord, a habitation Thou  &#8212; Thou hast been, To us &#8212; in generation and generation,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Before mountains were brought forth, And Thou dost form the  earth and the world, Even from age unto age Thou [art] God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Thou turnest man unto a bruised thing, And sayest, Turn  back, ye sons of men.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For a thousand years in Thine eyes [are] as yesterday, For  it passeth on, yea, a watch by night.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Thou hast inundated them, they are asleep, In the morning  as grass he changeth.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For we were consumed in Thine anger, And in Thy fury we  have been troubled.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Thou hast set our iniquities before Thee, Our hidden things  at the light of Thy face,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For all our days pined away in Thy wrath, We consumed our  years as a meditation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Days of our years, in them [are] seventy years, And if, by  reason of might, eighty years, Yet [is] their enlargement  labour and vanity, For it hath been cut off hastily, and we fly  away.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Who knoweth the power of Thine anger? And according to Thy  fear &#8212; Thy wrath?</p>
