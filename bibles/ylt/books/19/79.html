O God, nations have come into Thy  inheritance, They have defiled Thy holy temple, They made  Jerusalem become heaps,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>They gave the dead bodies of Thy servants Food for the  fowls of the heavens, The flesh of Thy saints For the wild  beast of the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>They have shed their blood As water round about Jerusalem,  And there is none burying.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>We have been a reproach to our neighbours, A scorn and a  derision to our surrounders.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Till when, O Jehovah? art Thou angry for ever? Thy jealousy  doth burn as fire.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Pour Thy fury on the nations who have not known Thee, And  on kingdoms that have not called in Thy name.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For [one] hath devoured Jacob, And his habitation they have  made desolate.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Remember not for us the iniquities of forefathers, Haste,  let Thy mercies go before us, For we have been very weak.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Help us, O God of our salvation, Because of the honour of  Thy name, And deliver us, and cover over our sins, For Thy  name&#8217;s sake.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Why do the nations say, &#8216;Where [is] their God?&#8217; Let be  known among the nations before our eyes, The vengeance of the  blood of Thy servants that is shed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Let the groaning of the prisoner come in before Thee,  According to the greatness of Thine arm, Leave Thou the sons of  death.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And turn Thou back to our neighbours, Sevenfold unto their  bosom, their reproach, Wherewith they reproached Thee, O Lord.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And we, Thy people, and the flock of Thy pasture, We give  thanks to Thee to the age, To all generations we recount Thy  praise!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
