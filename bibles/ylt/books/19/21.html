Jehovah, in Thy  strength is the king joyful, In Thy salvation how greatly he  rejoiceth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The desire of his heart Thou gavest to him, And the request  of his lips Thou hast not withheld. Selah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For Thou puttest before him blessings of goodness, Thou  settest on his head a crown of fine gold.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Life he hath asked from Thee, Thou hast given to him &#8212;  length of days, Age-during &#8212; and for ever.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For the king is trusting in Jehovah, And in the kindness of  the Most High He is not moved.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Thy hand cometh to all Thine enemies, Thy right hand doth  find Thy haters.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Thou makest them as a furnace of fire, At the time of Thy  presence. Jehovah in His anger doth swallow them, And fire doth  devour them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Their fruit from earth Thou destroyest, And their seed  from the sons of men.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For they stretched out against Thee evil, They devised a  wicked device, they prevail not,</p>
