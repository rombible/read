Give ear, O my people, to my law,  Incline your ear to sayings of my mouth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>I open with a simile my mouth, I bring forth hidden things  of old,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>That we have heard and do know, And our fathers have  recounted to us.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And they are not like their fathers, A generation apostate  and rebellious, A generation! it hath not prepared its heart,  Nor stedfast with God [is] its spirit.</p>
