O Jehovah, hear my prayer, Give ear unto  my supplications, In Thy faithfulness answer me &#8212; in Thy  righteousness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And enter not into judgment with Thy servant, For no one  living is justified before Thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For an enemy hath pursued my soul, He hath bruised to the  earth my life, He hath caused me to dwell in dark places, As  the dead of old.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And my spirit in me is become feeble, Within me is my  heart become desolate.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>I have remembered days of old, I have meditated on all  Thine acts, On the work of Thy hand I muse.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>I have spread forth my hands unto Thee, My soul [is] as a  weary land for Thee. Selah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Haste, answer me, O Jehovah, My spirit hath been consumed,  Hide not Thou Thy face from me, Or I have been compared with  those going down [to] the pit.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Cause me to hear in the morning Thy kindness, For in Thee  I have trusted, Cause me to know the way that I go, For unto  Thee I have lifted up my soul.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Deliver me from mine enemies, O Jehovah, Near Thee I am  covered.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Teach me to do Thy good pleasure, For Thou [art] my God  &#8212; Thy Spirit [is] good, Lead me into a land of uprightness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For Thy name&#8217;s sake O Jehovah, Thou dost quicken me, In  Thy righteousness, Thou bringest out from distress my soul,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And in Thy kindness cuttest off mine enemies, And hast  destroyed all the adversaries of my soul, For I [am] Thy  servant!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
