A fool said in his heart, &#8216;There is no God.&#8217; They have  done corruptly, Yea, they have done abominable iniquity, There  is none doing good.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/53-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>God from the heavens looked on the sons of men, To see if  there be an understanding one, [One] seeking God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/53-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Every one went back, together they became filthy, There is  none doing good &#8212; not even one.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/53-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Have not workers of iniquity known, Those eating my people  have eaten bread, God they have not called.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/53-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>There they feared a fear &#8212; there was no fear, For God hath  scattered the bones of him Who is encamping against thee, Thou  hast put to shame, For God hath despised them.</p>
