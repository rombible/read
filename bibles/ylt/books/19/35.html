<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Take hold of shield and buckler, and rise for my help,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And draw out spear and lance, To meet my pursuers. Say to  my soul, &#8216;Thy salvation I [am].&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>They are ashamed and blush, those seeking my soul, Turned  backward and confounded, Those devising my evil.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>They are as chaff before wind, And a messenger of Jehovah  driving away.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Their way is darkness and slipperiness, And a messenger of  Jehovah their pursuer.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For without cause they hid for me their netpit, Without  cause they digged for my soul.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Meet him doth desolation &#8212; he knoweth not, And his net  that he hid catcheth him, For desolation he falleth into it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And my soul is joyful in Jehovah, It rejoiceth in His  salvation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>All my bones say, &#8216;Jehovah, who is like Thee, Delivering  the poor from the stronger than he, And the poor and needy from  his plunderer.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Violent witnesses rise up, That which I have not known  they ask me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>They pay me evil for good, bereaving my soul,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And I &#8212; in their sickness my clothing [is] sackcloth, I  have humbled with fastings my soul, And my prayer unto my bosom  returneth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>As [if] a friend, as [if] my brother, I walked habitually,  As a mourner for a mother, Mourning I have bowed down.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And &#8212; in my halting they have rejoiced, And have been  gathered together, Gathered against me were the smiters, And I  have not known, They have rent, and they have not ceased;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>With profane ones, mockers in feasts, Gnashing against me  their teeth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Lord, how long dost thou behold? Keep back my soul from  their desolations, From young lions my only one.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>I thank Thee in a great assembly, Among a mighty people I  praise Thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Mine enemies rejoice not over me [with] falsehood, Those  hating me without cause wink the eye.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>For they speak not peace, And against the quiet of the  land, Deceitful words they devise,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And they enlarge against me their mouth, They said, &#8216;Aha,  aha, our eye hath seen.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Thou hast seen, O Jehovah, Be not silent, O Lord &#8212; be not  far from me,</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>They are ashamed and confounded together, Who are  rejoicing at my evil. They put on shame and confusion, Who are  magnifying themselves against me.</p>
