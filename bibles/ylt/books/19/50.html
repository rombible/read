The God of gods &#8212; Jehovah &#8212; hath  spoken, And He calleth to the earth From the rising of the sun  unto its going in.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>From Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shone.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Our God cometh, and is not silent, Fire before Him doth  devour, And round about him it hath been very tempestuous.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>He doth call unto the heavens from above, And unto the  earth, to judge His people.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Gather ye to Me My saints, Making covenant with Me over a  sacrifice.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the heavens declare His righteousness, For God Himself  [is] judge. Selah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Hear, O My people, and I speak, O Israel, and I testify  against thee, God, thy God [am] I.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Not for thy sacrifices do I reprove thee, Yea, thy  burnt-offerings [Are] before Me continually.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>I take not from thy house a bullock, From thy folds  he goats.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For Mine [is] every beast of the forest, The cattle on the  hills of oxen.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>I have known every fowl of the mountains, And the wild  beast of the field [is] with Me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>If I am hungry I tell not to thee, For Mine [is] the world  and its fulness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Do I eat the flesh of bulls, And drink the blood of  he-goats?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Sacrifice to God confession, And complete to the Most High  thy vows.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And call Me in a day of adversity, I deliver thee, and  thou honourest Me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And to the wicked hath God said: What to thee &#8212; to  recount My statutes? That thou liftest up My covenant on thy  mouth?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Yea, thou hast hated instruction, And dost cast My words  behind thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>If thou hast seen a thief, Then thou art pleased with him,  And with adulterers [is] thy portion.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Thy mouth thou hast sent forth with evil, And thy tongue  joineth deceit together,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Thou sittest, against thy brother thou speakest, Against a  son of thy mother givest slander.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>These thou didst, and I kept silent, Thou hast thought  that I am like thee, I reprove thee, and set in array before  thine eyes.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Understand this, I pray you, Ye who are forgetting God,  Lest I tear, and there is no deliverer.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>He who is sacrificing praise honoureth Me, As to him who  maketh a way, I cause him to look on the salvation of God!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
