I confess, O Jehovah, with all my heart, I recount all  Thy wonders,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>I rejoice and exult in Thee, I praise Thy Name, O Most High.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>In mine enemies turning backward, they stumble and perish  from Thy face.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For Thou hast done my judgment and my right. Thou hast sat  on a throne, A judge of righteousness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Thou hast rebuked nations, Thou hast destroyed the wicked,  Their name Thou hast blotted out to the age and for ever.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>O thou Enemy, Finished have been destructions for ever, As  to cities thou hast plucked up, Perished hath their memorial  with them.</p>
