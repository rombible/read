By sons of Korah. As a  hart doth pant for streams of water, So my soul panteth toward  Thee, O God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>My soul thirsted for God, for the living God, When do I  enter and see the face of God?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>My tear hath been to me bread day and night, In their  saying unto me all the day, &#8216;Where [is] thy God?&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>These I remember, and pour out my soul in me, For I pass  over into the booth, I go softly with them unto the house of  God, With the voice of singing and confession, The multitude  keeping feast!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>What! bowest thou thyself, O my soul? Yea, art thou  troubled within me? Wait for God, for still I confess Him: The  salvation of my countenance &#8212; My God!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>In me doth my soul bow itself, Therefore I remember Thee  from the land of Jordan, And of the Hermons, from the hill  Mizar.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Deep unto deep is calling At the noise of Thy  water-spouts, All Thy breakers and Thy billows passed over me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>By day Jehovah commandeth His kindness, And by night a song  [is] with me, A prayer to the God of my life.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>I say to God my rock, &#8216;Why hast Thou forgotten me? Why go I  mourning in the oppression of an enemy?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>With a sword in my bones Have mine adversaries reproached  me, In their saying unto me all the day, &#8216;Where [is] thy God?&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>What! bowest thou thyself, O my soul? And what! art thou  troubled within me? Wait for God, for still I confess Him, The  salvation of my countenance, and my God!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
