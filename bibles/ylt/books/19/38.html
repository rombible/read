<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For Thine arrows have come down on me, And Thou lettest  down upon me Thy hand.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Soundness is not in my flesh, Because of Thine indignation,  Peace is not in my bones because of my sin.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For mine iniquities have passed over my head, As a heavy  burden &#8212; too heavy for me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Stunk &#8212; become corrupt have my wounds, Because of my  folly.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>I have been bent down, I have been bowed down &#8212; unto  excess, All the day I have gone mourning.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For my flanks have been full of drought, And soundness is  not in my flesh.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>I have been feeble and smitten &#8212; unto excess, I have  roared from disquietude of heart.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Lord, before Thee [is] all my desire, And my sighing from  Thee hath not been hid.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>My heart [is] panting, my power hath forsaken me, And the  light of mine eyes, Even they are not with me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>My lovers and my friends over-against my plague stand. And  my neighbours afar off have stood.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And those seeking my soul lay a snare, And those seeking  my evil Have spoken mischievous things, And they do deceits  meditate all the day.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And I, as deaf, hear not. And as a dumb one who openeth  not his mouth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Yea, I am as a man who heareth not, And in his mouth are  no reproofs.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Because for Thee, O Jehovah, I have waited, Thou dost  answer, O Lord my God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>When I said, &#8216;Lest they rejoice over me, In the slipping  of my foot against me they magnified themselves.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For I am ready to halt, And my pain [is] before me  continually.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For mine iniquity I declare, I am sorry for my sin.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And mine enemies [are] lively, They have been strong, and  those hating me without cause, Have been multiplied.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And those paying evil for good accuse me, Because of my  pursuing good.</p>
