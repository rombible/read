<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>O the happiness of a man, To whom Jehovah imputeth not  iniquity, And in whose spirit there is no deceit.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>When I have kept silence, become old have my bones, Through  my roaring all the day.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>My sin I cause Thee to know, And mine iniquity I have not  covered. I have said, &#8216;I confess concerning My transgressions  to Jehovah,&#8217; And Thou &#8212; Thou hast taken away, The iniquity of  my sin. Selah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For this doth every saintly one pray to Thee, As the time  to find. Surely at an overflowing of many waters, Unto him they  come not.</p>
