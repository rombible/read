<div class="chap"><p class="hdg">Surely God is Good to Israel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>A Psalm of Asaph. Only &#8212; good to Israel [is] God, to the  clean of heart. And I &#8212; as a little thing, My feet have been  turned aside,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>As nothing, have my steps slipped, For I have been envious  of the boastful,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>The peace of the wicked I see, That there are no bands at  their death,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And their might [is] firm.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>In the misery of mortals they are not, And with common men  they are not plagued.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Therefore hath pride encircled them, Violence covereth them  as a dress.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Their eye hath come out from fat. The imaginations of the  heart transgressed;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>They do corruptly, And they speak in the wickedness of  oppression, From on high they speak.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>They have set in the heavens their mouth, And their tongue  walketh in the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Therefore do His people return hither, And waters of  fulness are wrung out to them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And they have said, &#8216;How hath God known? And is there  knowledge in the Most High?&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Lo, these [are] the wicked and easy ones of the age, They  have increased strength.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Only &#8212; a vain thing! I have purified my heart, And I wash  in innocency my hands,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And I am plagued all the day, And my reproof [is] every  morning.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>If I have said, &#8216;I recount thus,&#8217; Lo, a generation of Thy  sons I have deceived.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And I think to know this, Perverseness it [is] in mine  eyes,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Till I come in to the sanctuaries of God, I attend to  their latter end.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Only, in slippery places Thou dost set them, Thou hast  caused them to fall to desolations.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>How have they become a desolation as in a moment, They  have been ended &#8212; consumed from terrors.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>As a dream from awakening, O Lord, In awaking, their image  Thou despisest.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For my heart doth show itself violent, And my reins prick  themselves,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And I am brutish, and do not know. A beast I have been  with Thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And I [am] continually with Thee, Thou hast laid hold on  my right hand.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>With Thy counsel Thou dost lead me, And after honour dost  receive me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Whom have I in the heavens? And with Thee none I have  desired in earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Consumed hath been my flesh and my heart, The rock of my  heart and my portion [is] God to the age.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>For, lo, those far from Thee do perish, Thou hast cut off  every one, Who is going a whoring from Thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And I &#8212; nearness of God to me [is] good, I have placed in  the Lord Jehovah my refuge, To recount all Thy works!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
