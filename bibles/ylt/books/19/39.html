I have  said, &#8216;I observe my ways, Against sinning with my tongue, I  keep for my mouth a curb, while the wicked [is] before me.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>I was dumb [with] silence, I kept silent from good, and my  pain is excited.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Hot [is] my heart within me, In my meditating doth the fire  burn, I have spoken with my tongue.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8216;Cause me to know, O Jehovah, mine end, And the measure of  my days &#8212; what it [is],&#8217; I know how frail I [am].</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Lo, handbreadths Thou hast made my days, And mine age [is]  as nothing before Thee, Only, all vanity [is] every man set up.  Selah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Only, in an image doth each walk habitually, Only, [in]  vain, they are disquieted, He heapeth up and knoweth not who  gathereth them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And, now, what have I expected? O Lord, my hope &#8212; it [is]  of Thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>From all my transgressions deliver me, A reproach of the  fool make me not.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>I have been dumb, I open not my mouth, Because Thou &#8212; Thou  hast done [it].</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Turn aside from off me Thy stroke, From the striving of  Thy hand I have been consumed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>With reproofs against iniquity, Thou hast corrected man,  And dost waste as a moth his desirableness, Only, vanity [is]  every man. Selah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, And [to] my cry give ear, Unto  my tear be not silent, For a sojourner I [am] with Thee, A  settler like all my fathers.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Look from me, and I brighten up before I go and am not!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
