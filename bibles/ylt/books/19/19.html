The heavens [are]  recounting the honour of God, And the work of His hands The  expanse [is] declaring.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Day to day uttereth speech, And night to night sheweth  knowledge.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>There is no speech, and there are no words. Their voice  hath not been heard.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Into all the earth hath their line gone forth, And to the  end of the world their sayings, For the sun He placed a tent in  them,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And he, as a bridegroom, goeth out from his covering, He  rejoiceth as a mighty one To run the path.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>The fear of Jehovah [is] clean, standing to the age, The  judgments of Jehovah [are] true, They have been righteous &#8212;  together.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>They are more desirable than gold, Yea, than much fine  gold; and sweeter than honey, Even liquid honey of the comb.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Also &#8212; Thy servant is warned by them, &#8216;In keeping them  [is] a great reward.&#8217;</p>
