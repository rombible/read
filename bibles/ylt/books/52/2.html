<div class="chap"><p class="hdg">Paul's Ministry</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>For yourselves have known, brethren, our entrance in unto  you, that it did  not become vain, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>but having both suffered before, and having been injuriously  treated (as ye  have known) in Philippi, we were bold in our  God to speak unto you the good  news of God in much conflict, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>for our exhortation [is] not out of deceit, nor out of  uncleanness, nor in  guile, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>but as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the  good news, so  we speak, not as pleasing men, but God, who is  proving our hearts, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>for at no time did we come with speech of flattery, (as ye  have known,) nor  in a pretext for covetousness, (God [is]  witness!) 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>nor seeking of men glory, neither from you nor from others,  being able to  be burdensome, as Christ&#8217;s apostles. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But we became gentle in your midst, as a nurse may cherish  her own  children, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>so being desirous of you, we are well-pleased to impart to  you not only the  good news of God, but also our own souls,  because beloved ye have become to  us,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>for ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail, for,  night and day  working not to be a burden upon any of you, we  did preach to you the good  news of God; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>ye [are] witnesses &#8212; God also &#8212; how kindly and  righteously, and  blamelessly to you who believe we became, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>even as ye have known, how each one of you, as a father his  own children,  we are exhorting you, and comforting, and  testifying, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>for your walking worthily of God, who is calling you to His  own reign and  glory.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Because of this also, we &#8212; we do give thanks to God  continually, that,  having received the word of hearing from us  of God, ye accepted, not the word  of man, but as it is truly,  the word of God, who also doth work in you who  believe; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>for ye became imitators, brethren, of the assemblies of God  that are in  Judea in Christ Jesus, because such things ye  suffered, even ye, from your  own countrymen, as also they from  the Jews, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>who did both put to death the Lord Jesus and their own  prophets, and did  persecute us, and God they are not pleasing,  and to all men [are] contrary, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>forbidding us to speak to the nations that they might be  saved, to fill up  their sins always, but the anger did come  upon them &#8212; to the end!</p>
