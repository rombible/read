<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and did send Timotheus &#8212; our brother, and a ministrant of  God, and our  fellow-workman in the good news of the Christ &#8212;  to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>that no one be moved in these tribulations, for yourselves  have known that  for this we are set, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>for even when we were with you, we said to you beforehand,  that we are  about to suffer tribulation, as also it did come  to pass, and ye have known  [it]; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>because of this also, I, no longer forbearing, did send to  know your faith,  lest he who is tempting did tempt you, and in  vain might be our labour.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>because of this we were comforted, brethren, over you, in  all our  tribulation and necessity, through your faith,
