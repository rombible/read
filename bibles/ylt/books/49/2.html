<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>in which once ye did walk according to the age of this  world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, of  the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>among whom also we all did walk once in the desires of our  flesh, doing the wishes of the flesh and of the thoughts, and  were by nature children of wrath &#8212; as also the others, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and God, being rich in kindness, because of His great love  with which He loved us, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>even being dead in the trespasses, did make us to live  together with the Christ, (by grace ye are having been saved,)

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>for by grace ye are having been saved, through faith, and  this not of you &#8212; of God the gift,

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>for of Him we are workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to  good works, which God did before prepare, that in them we may  walk.</p>
<p class="hdg">One in Christ</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Wherefore, remember, that ye [were] once the nations in the  flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that called  Circumcision in the flesh made by hands, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>that ye were at that time apart from Christ, having been  alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to  the covenants of the promise, having no hope, and without God,  in the world;
