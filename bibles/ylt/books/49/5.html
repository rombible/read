<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and walk in love, as also the Christ did love us, and did  give himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an  odour of a sweet smell,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and whoredom, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it  not even be named among you, as becometh saints; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>also filthiness, and foolish talking, or jesting, &#8212; the  things not fit &#8212; but rather thanksgiving;

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of the  darkness and rather even convict, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>for the things in secret done by them it is a shame even to  speak of,
