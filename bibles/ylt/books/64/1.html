<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>beloved, concerning all things I desire thee to prosper, and  to be in health, even as thy soul doth prosper, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>for I rejoiced exceedingly, brethren coming and testifying  of the truth in thee, even as thou in truth dost walk; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>greater than these things I have no joy, that I may hear of  my children in truth walking.</p>
<p class="hdg">Gaius' Example of Hospitality</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Beloved, faithfully dost thou do whatever thou mayest work  to the brethren and to the strangers, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>who did testify of thy love before an assembly, whom thou  wilt do well, having sent forward worthily of God, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>because for [His] name they went forth, nothing receiving  from the nations; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>we, then, ought to receive such, that fellow-workers we may  become to the truth.</p>
<p class="hdg">Diotrephes and Demetrius</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>I did write to the assembly, but he who is loving the first  place among them &#8212; Diotrephes &#8212; doth not receive us; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>because of this, if I may come, I will cause him to  remember his works that he doth, with evil words prating  against us; and not content with these, neither doth he  himself receive the brethren, and those intending he doth   forbid, and out of the assembly he doth cast.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Beloved, be not thou following that which is evil, but that  which is good; he who is doing good, of God he is, and he who  is doing evil hath not seen God; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>to Demetrius testimony hath been given by all, and by the  truth itself, and we also &#8212; we do testify, and ye have known  that our testimony is true.</p>
<p class="hdg">Conclusion</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Many things I had to write, but I do not wish through ink  and pen to write to thee,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and I hope straightway to see thee, and mouth to mouth we  shall speak. Peace to thee! salute thee do the friends; be  saluting the friends by name.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
