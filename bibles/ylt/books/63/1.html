<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>because of the truth that is remaining in us, and with us  shall be to the age, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>there shall be with you grace, kindness, peace, from God the  Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father,  in truth and love.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and now I beseech thee, Kyria, not as writing to thee a new  command, but which we had from the beginning, that we may love  one another,

<p class="hdg">Beware of Deceivers</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>because many leading astray did enter into the world, who  are not confessing Jesus Christ coming in flesh; this one is  he who is leading astray, and the antichrist. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>See to yourselves that ye may not lose the things that we  wrought, but a full reward may receive; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>every one who is transgressing, and is not remaining in the  teaching of the Christ, hath not God; he who is remaining in  the teaching of the Christ, this one hath both the Father and  the Son;
