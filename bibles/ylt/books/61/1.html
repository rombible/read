<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Grace to you, and peace be multiplied in the acknowledgement  of God and of Jesus our Lord!</p>
<p class="hdg">Make Your Calling Sure</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>As all things to us His divine power (the things pertaining  unto life and piety) hath given, through the acknowledgement  of him who did call us through glory and worthiness, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>through which to us the most great and precious promises  have been given, that through these ye may become partakers of  a divine nature, having escaped from the corruption in the  world in desires. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And this same also &#8212; all diligence having brought in  besides, superadd in your faith the worthiness, and in the  worthiness the knowledge, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and in the knowledge the temperance, and in the temperance  the endurance, and in the endurance the piety, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and in the piety the brotherly kindness, and in the  brotherly kindness the love; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>for these things being to you and abounding, do make [you]  neither inert nor unfruitful in regard to the acknowledging of  our Lord Jesus Christ, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>for he with whom these things are not present is blind,  dim-sighted, having become forgetful of the cleansing of his  old sins; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>wherefore, the rather, brethren, be diligent to make  stedfast your calling and choice, for these things doing, ye  may never stumble, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>for so, richly shall be superadded to you the entrance into  the age-during reign of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="hdg">Remember These Things</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Wherefore, I will not be careless always to remind you  concerning these things, though, having known them, and having  been established in the present truth, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>and I think right, so long as I am in this tabernacle, to  stir you up in reminding [you], 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>having known that soon is the laying aside of my  tabernacle, even as also our Lord Jesus Christ did shew to me, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and I will be diligent that also at every time ye have,  after my outgoing, power to make to yourselves the remembrance  of these things.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>for having received from God the Father honour and glory,  such a voice being borne to him by the excellent glory: &#8216;This  is My Son &#8212; the beloved, in whom I was well pleased;&#8217;

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>this first knowing, that no prophecy of the Writing doth  come of private exposition, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>for not by will of man did ever prophecy come, but by the  Holy Spirit borne on holy men of God spake.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
