<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>to be mindful of the sayings said before by the holy  prophets, and of the command of us the apostles of the Lord  and Saviour,</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and saying, &#8216;Where is the promise of his presence? for since  the fathers did fall asleep, all things so remain from the  beginning of the creation;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>for this is unobserved by them willingly, that the heavens  were of old, and the earth out of water and through water  standing together by the word of God, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>through which the then world, by water having been deluged,  was destroyed; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and the present heavens and the earth, by the same word are  treasured, for fire being kept to a day of judgment and  destruction of the impious men.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And this one thing let not be unobserved by you, beloved,  that one day with the Lord [is] as a thousand years, and a  thousand years as one day;

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>All these, then, being dissolved, what kind of persons doth  it behove you to be in holy behaviours and pious acts? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>waiting for and hasting to the presence of the day of God,  by which the heavens, being on fire, shall be dissolved, and  the elements with burning heat shall melt;

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and increase ye in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord  and Saviour Jesus Christ; to him [is] the glory both now, and  to the day of the age! Amen. </p></div></div><div id="botbox">
