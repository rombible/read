<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and many shall follow out their destructive ways, because of  whom the way of the truth shall be evil spoken of, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and in covetousness, with moulded words, of you they shall  make merchandise, whose judgment of old is not idle, and their  destruction doth not slumber.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For if God messengers who sinned did not spare, but with  chains of thick gloom, having cast [them] down to Tartarus, did  deliver [them] to judgment, having been reserved, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and the old world did not spare, but the eighth person,  Noah, of righteousness a preacher, did keep, a flood on the  world of the impious having brought,
