<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>of one another the burdens bear ye, and so fill up the law  of the Christ, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>for if any one doth think [himself] to be something &#8212; being  nothing &#8212; himself he doth deceive; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and his own work let each one prove, and then in regard to  himself alone the glorying he shall have, and not in regard to  the other, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>for each one his own burden shall bear.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And let him who is instructed in the word share with him who  is instructing &#8212; in all good things. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Be not led astray; God is not mocked; for what a man may sow  &#8212; that also he shall reap, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>because he who is sowing to his own flesh, of the flesh  shall reap corruption; and he who is sowing to the Spirit, of  the Spirit shall reap life age-during; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and in the doing good we may not be faint-hearted, for at  the proper time we shall reap &#8212; not desponding; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>therefore, then, as we have opportunity, may we work the  good to all, and especially unto those of the household of the  faith.</p>
<p class="hdg">Paul's Final Warning</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Ye see in how large letters I have written to you with my  own hand; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>as many as are willing to make a good appearance in the  flesh, these constrain you to be circumcised &#8212; only that for  the cross of the Christ they may not be persecuted, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>for neither do those circumcised themselves keep the law,  but they wish you to be circumcised, that in your flesh they  may glory. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And for me, let it not be &#8212; to glory, except in the cross  of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which to me the world hath  been crucified, and I to the world; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything,  nor uncircumcision, but a new creation;</p>
<p class="hdg">Benediction</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and as many as by this rule do walk &#8212; peace upon them, and  kindness, and on the Israel of God!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Henceforth, let no one give me trouble, for I the scars of  the Lord Jesus in my body do bear.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [is] with your spirit,  brethren! Amen.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
