<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>lo, I Paul do say to you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ  shall profit you nothing; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and I testify again to every man circumcised, that he is a  debtor to do the whole law; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>ye were freed from the Christ, ye who in law are declared  righteous; from the grace ye fell away; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>for we by the Spirit, by faith, a hope of righteousness do  wait for, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything,  nor uncircumcision, but faith through love working.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Ye were running well; who did hinder you &#8212; not to obey the  truth? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>the obedience [is] not of him who is calling you! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>a little leaven the whole lump doth leaven; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>I have confidence in regard to you in the Lord, that ye  will be none otherwise minded; and he who is troubling you  shall bear the judgment, whoever he may be. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And I, brethren, if uncircumcision I yet preach, why yet am  I persecuted? then hath the stumbling-block of the cross been  done away; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>O that even they would cut themselves off who are  unsettling you!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For ye &#8212; to freedom ye were called, brethren, only not the  freedom for an occasion to the flesh, but through the love  serve ye one another, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>for all the law in one word is fulfilled &#8212; in this: &#8216;Thou  shalt love thy neighbor as thyself;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and if one another ye do bite and devour, see &#8212; that ye  may not by one another be consumed.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>for the flesh doth desire contrary to the Spirit, and the  Spirit contrary to the flesh, and these are opposed one to  another, that the things that ye may will &#8212; these ye may not  do; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and if by the Spirit ye are led, ye are not under law.
