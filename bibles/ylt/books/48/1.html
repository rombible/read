<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and all the brethren with me, to the assemblies of Galatia:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Grace to you, and peace from God the Father, and our Lord  Jesus Christ, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>who did give himself for our sins, that he might deliver us  out of the present evil age, according to the will of God even  our Father, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>to whom [is] the glory to the ages of the ages. Amen.</p>
<p class="hdg">No Other Gospel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>I wonder that ye are so quickly removed from Him who did  call you in the grace of Christ to another good news; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>that is not another, except there be certain who are  troubling you, and wishing to pervert the good news of the  Christ; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>but even if we or a messenger out of heaven may proclaim  good news to you different from what we did proclaim to you &#8212;  anathema let him be! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>as we have said before, and now say again, If any one to you  may proclaim good news different from what ye did receive &#8212;  anathema let him be!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>for now men do I persuade, or God? or do I seek to please  men? for if yet men I did please &#8212; Christ&#8217;s servant I should  not be.</p>
<p class="hdg">Paul Defends his Ministry</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And I make known to you, brethren, the good news that were  proclaimed by me, that it is not according to man, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>for neither did I from man receive it, nor was I taught  [it], but through a revelation of Jesus Christ,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>for ye did hear of my behaviour once in Judaism, that  exceedingly I was persecuting the assembly of God, and wasting  it, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and I was advancing in Judaism above many equals in age in  mine own race, being more abundantly zealous of my fathers&#8217;  deliverances, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and when God was well pleased &#8212; having separated me from  the womb of my mother, and having called [me] through His  grace &#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>to reveal His Son in me, that I might proclaim him good  news among the nations, immediately I conferred not with flesh  and blood, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>nor did I go up to Jerusalem unto those who were apostles  before me, but I went away to Arabia, and again returned to  Damascus,</p>
<p class="hdg">Paul Accepted by Apostles and Others</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>then, after three years I went up to Jerusalem to enquire  about Peter, and remained with him fifteen days, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>and other of the apostles I did not see, except James, the  brother of the Lord. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And the things that I write to you, lo, before God &#8212; I lie  not; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>then I came to the regions of Syria and of Cilicia, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>and was unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea, that  [are] in Christ, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>and only they were hearing, that &#8216;he who is persecuting us  then, doth now proclaim good news &#8212; the faith that then he was  wasting;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>and they were glorifying God in me.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
