<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>but is under tutors and stewards till the time appointed of  the father, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>so also we, when we were babes, under the elements of the  world were in servitude, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and when the fulness of time did come, God sent forth His  Son, come of a woman, come under law,

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and because ye are sons, God did send forth the spirit of  His Son into your hearts, crying, &#8216;Abba, Father!&#8217;

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>days ye observe, and months, and times, and years!

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>which things are allegorized, for these are the two  covenants: one, indeed, from mount Sinai, to servitude bringing  forth, which is Hagar; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>for this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and doth  correspond to the Jerusalem that now [is], and is in servitude  with her children,
