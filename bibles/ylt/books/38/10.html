To each &#8212; the herb in the field.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Because the teraphim did speak iniquity, And the diviners  have seen a falsehood, And dreams of the vanity they speak,  [With] vanity they give comfort, Therefore they have journeyed  as a flock, They are afflicted, for there is no shepherd.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Against the shepherds did Mine anger burn, And against the  he-goats I lay a charge, For inspected hath Jehovah of Hosts  His flock, the house of Judah, And set them as His beauteous  horse in battle.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>From him [is] a corner-stone, From him a nail, from him a  battle-bow, From him goeth forth every exactor together.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And they have been as heroes, Treading in mire of  out-places in battle, And they have fought, for Jehovah [is]  with them, And have put to shame riders of horses.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And I have made mighty the house of Judah, And the house of  Joseph I do save, And I have caused them to dwell, for I have  loved them, And they have been as [if] I had not cast them off,  For I [am] Jehovah their God, And I answer them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And Ephraim hath been as a hero, And rejoiced hath their  heart as wine, And their sons see, and they have rejoiced,  Rejoice doth their heart in Jehovah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>I hist for them, and I gather them, For I have redeemed  them, And they have multiplied as they did multiply.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And I sow them among peoples, And in far-off places they  remember Me, And they have lived with their sons, And they have  turned back.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And I have brought them back from the land of Egypt, And  from Asshur I do gather them, And unto the land of Gilead and  Lebanon I do bring them in, And there is not found for them  [space].</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And I have made them mighty in Jehovah, And in His name  they walk up and down, An affirmation of Jehovah!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
