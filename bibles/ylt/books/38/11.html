<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For I have pity no more on inhabitants of the land, An  affirmation of Jehovah, And lo, I am causing man to come forth,  Each into the hand of his neighbour, And into the hand of his  king, And they have beaten down the land, And I do not deliver  out of their hand.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And I feed the flock of slaughter, even you, ye afflicted  of the flock; and I take to me two staves, the one I have  called Pleasantness, and the other I have called Bands, and I  feed the flock.
