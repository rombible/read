<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary: &#8216;Jehovah doth push  against thee, O Adversary, Yea, push against thee doth Jehovah,  Who is fixing on Jerusalem, Is not this a brand delivered from  fire?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and is standing  before the messenger. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And he answereth and speaketh unto those standing before  him, saying: &#8216;Turn aside the filthy garments from off him.&#8217; And  he saith unto him, &#8216;See, I have caused thine iniquity to pass  away from off thee, so as to clothe thee with costly apparel.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>He also said, &#8216;Let them set a pure diadem on his head. And  they set the pure diadem on his head, and clothe him with  garments. And the messenger of Jehovah is standing,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and the messenger of Jehovah doth protest to Joshua, saying: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8216;Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: If in My ways thou dost walk,  And if My charge thou dost keep, Then also thou dost judge My  house, And also thou dost keep My courts, And I have given to  thee conductors among these standing by.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Hear, I pray thee, Joshua, the high priest, Thou and thy  companions sitting before thee, (For men of type [are] they,)  For lo, I am bringing in My servant &#8212; a Shoot. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For lo, the stone that I put before Joshua, On one stone  [are] seven eyes, Lo, I am graving its graving, An affirmation  of Jehovah of Hosts, And I have removed the iniquity of that  land in one day. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>In that day &#8212; an affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts, Ye do  call, each unto his neighbour, Unto the place of the vine, And  unto the place of the fig-tree!&#8217;</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
