An affirmation  of Jehovah, Stretching out heaven, and founding earth, And  forming the spirit of man in his midst.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Lo, I am making Jerusalem a cup of reeling To all the  peoples round about, And also against Judah it is, In the siege  against Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And it hath come to pass, in that day, I make Jerusalem a  burdensome stone to all the peoples, All loading it are  completely pressed down, And gathered against it have been all  nations of the earth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>In that day &#8212; an affirmation of Jehovah, I do smite every  horse with astonishment, And its rider with madness, And on the  house of Judah I open My eyes, And every horse of the peoples I  smite with blindness. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And leaders of Judah have said in their heart, &#8216;Strength to  me [are] the inhabitants of Jerusalem, In Jehovah of Hosts  their God.&#8217;</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And it hath come to pass, in that day, I seek to destroy  all the nations Who are coming in against Jerusalem,</p>
