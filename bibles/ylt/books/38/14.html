<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And gone forth hath Jehovah, And He hath fought against  those nations, As in the day of His fighting in a day of  conflict. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And stood have His feet, in that day, On the mount of  Olives, That [is] before Jerusalem eastward, And cleft hath  been the mount of Olives at its midst, To the east, and to the  west, a very great valley, And removed hath the half of the  mount towards the north. And its half towards the south.
