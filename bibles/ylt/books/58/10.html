<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>since, would they not have ceased to be offered, because of  those serving having no more conscience of sins, having once  been purified?

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and testify to us also doth the Holy Spirit, for after  that He hath said before,</p>
