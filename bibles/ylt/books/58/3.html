<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>for of more glory than Moses hath this one been counted  worthy, inasmuch as more honour than the house hath he who doth  build it, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>for every house is builded by some one, and He who the all  things did build [is] God, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and Moses indeed [was] stedfast in all his house, as an  attendant, for a testimony of those things that were to be  spoken,

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>for certain having heard did provoke, but not all who did  come out of Egypt through Moses; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>but with whom was He grieved forty years? was it not with  those who did sin, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and to whom did He swear that they shall not enter into His  rest, except to those who did not believe? &#8212;
