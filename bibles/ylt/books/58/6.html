<div class="chap"><p class="hdg">A Call to Maturity</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Wherefore, having left the word of the beginning of the  Christ, unto the perfection we may advance, not again a  foundation laying of reformation from dead works, and of faith  on God, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>of the teaching of baptisms, of laying on also of hands, of  rising again also of the dead, and of judgment age-during, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and this we will do, if God may permit, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>for [it is] impossible for those once enlightened, having  tasted also of the heavenly gift, and partakers having became  of the Holy Spirit, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and did taste the good saying of God, the powers also of the  coming age, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and having fallen away, again to renew [them] to  reformation, having crucified again to themselves the Son of  God, and exposed to public shame. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For earth, that is drinking in the rain many times coming  upon it, and is bringing forth herbs fit for those because of  whom also it is dressed, doth partake of blessing from God, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and that which is bearing thorns and briers [is] disapproved  of, and nigh to cursing, whose end [is] for burning;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and we are persuaded, concerning you, beloved, the things  that are better, and accompanying salvation, though even thus  we speak, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>for God is not unrighteous to forget your work, and the  labour of the love, that ye shewed to His name, having  ministered to the saints and ministering; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and we desire each one of you the same diligence to shew,  unto the full assurance of the hope unto the end, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>that ye may not become slothful, but followers of those who  through faith and patient endurance are inheriting the  promises.</p>
<p class="hdg">God's Promise is Certain</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For to Abraham God, having made promise, seeing He was able  to swear by no greater, did swear by Himself, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>saying, &#8216;Blessing indeed I will bless thee, and multiplying  I will multiply thee;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and so, having patiently endured, he did obtain the  promise; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>for men indeed do swear by the greater, and an end of all  controversy to them for confirmation [is] the oath, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>in which God, more abundantly willing to shew to the heirs  of the promise the immutability of his counsel, did interpose  by an oath, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>that through two immutable things, in which [it is]  impossible for God to lie, a strong comfort we may have who  did flee for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before [us], 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>which we have, as an anchor of the soul, both sure and  stedfast, and entering into that within the vail, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>whither a forerunner for us did enter &#8212; Jesus, after the  order of Melchisedek chief priest having become &#8212; to the age.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
