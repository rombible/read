<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>to whom also a tenth of all did Abraham divide, (first,  indeed, being interpreted, &#8216;King of righteousness,&#8217; and then  also, King of Salem, which is, King of Peace,) 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>without father, without mother, without genealogy, having  neither beginning of days nor end of life, and being made like  to the Son of God, doth remain a priest continually.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And see how great this one [is], to whom also a tenth  Abraham the patriarch did give out of the best of the spoils, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and those, indeed, out of the sons of Levi receiving the  priesthood, a command have to take tithes from the people  according to the law, that is, their brethren, even though  they came forth out of the loins of Abraham; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and he who was not reckoned by genealogy of them, received  tithes from Abraham, and him having the promises he hath  blessed, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and apart from all controversy, the less by the better is  blessed &#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and here, indeed, men who die do receive tithes, and there  [he], who is testified to that he was living, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and so to speak, through Abraham even Levi who is receiving  tithes, hath paid tithes, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>for he was yet in the loins of the father when Melchisedek  met him.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus a Priest Like Melchizedek</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>If indeed, then, perfection were through the Levitical  priesthood &#8212; for the people under it had received law &#8212; what  further need, according to the order of Melchisedek, for  another priest to arise, and not to be called according to the  order of Aaron? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>for the priesthood being changed, of necessity also, of the  law a change doth come, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>for he of whom these things are said in another tribe hath  had part, of whom no one gave attendance at the altar, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>for [it is] evident that out of Judah hath arisen our Lord,  in regard to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning  priesthood. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And it is yet more abundantly most evident, if according to  the similitude of Melchisedek there doth arise another priest, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>who came not according to the law of a fleshly command, but  according to the power of an endless life,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>for He doth testify &#8212; &#8216;Thou [art] a priest &#8212; to the age,  according to the order of Melchisedek;&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>for a disannulling indeed doth come of the command going  before because of its weakness, and unprofitableness, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>(for nothing did the law perfect) and the bringing in of a  better hope, through which we draw nigh to God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And inasmuch as [it is] not apart from oath, (for those  indeed apart from oath are become priests,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>and he with an oath through Him who is saying unto him,  &#8216;The Lord sware, and will not repent, Thou [art] a priest &#8212; to  the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;&#8217;)</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>by so much of a better covenant hath Jesus become surety,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>and those indeed are many who have become priests, because  by death they are hindered from remaining; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>and he, because of his remaining &#8212; to the age, hath the  priesthood not transient, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>whence also he is able to save to the very end, those  coming through him unto God &#8212; ever living to make intercession  for them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>For such a chief priest did become us &#8212; kind, harmless,  undefiled, separate from the sinners, and become higher than  the heavens, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>who hath no necessity daily, as the chief priests, first  for his own sins to offer up sacrifice, then for those of the  people; for this he did once, having offered up himself; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>for the law doth appoint men chief priests, having  infirmity, but the word of the oath that [is] after the law  [appointeth] the Son &#8212; to the age having been perfected.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
