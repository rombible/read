<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>for consider again him who endured such gainsaying from the  sinners to himself, that ye may not be wearied in your souls  &#8212; being faint.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>if chastening ye endure, as to sons God beareth Himself to  you, for who is a son whom a father doth not chasten? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and if ye are apart from chastening, of which all have  become partakers, then bastards are ye, and not sons. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then, indeed, fathers of our flesh we have had, chastising  [us], and we were reverencing [them]; shall we not much rather  be subject to the Father of the spirits, and live? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>for they, indeed, for a few days, according to what seemed  good to them, were chastening, but He for profit, to be  partakers of His separation; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and all chastening for the present, indeed, doth not seem  to be of joy, but of sorrow, yet afterward the peaceable fruit  of righteousness to those exercised through it &#8212; it doth  yield.</p>
