<div class="chap"><p class="hdg">Pay Attention to Salvation</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Because of this it behoveth [us] more abundantly to take  heed to the things heard, lest we may glide aside, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>for if the word being spoken through messengers did become  stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience did receive  a just recompense, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>how shall we escape, having neglected so great salvation?  which a beginning receiving &#8212; to be spoken through the Lord  &#8212; by those having heard was confirmed to us, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>God also bearing joint-witness both with signs and wonders,  and manifold powers, and distributions of the Holy Spirit,  according to His will.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Made Like His Brothers</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For not to messengers did He subject the coming world,  concerning which we speak,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and one in a certain place did testify fully, saying, &#8216;What  is man, that Thou art mindful of him, or a son of man, that  Thou dost look after him?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Thou didst make him some little less than messengers, with  glory and honour Thou didst crown him, and didst set him over  the works of Thy hands,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>all things Thou didst put in subjection under his feet,&#8217; for  in the subjecting to him the all things, nothing did He leave  to him unsubjected, and now not yet do we see the all things  subjected to him,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and him who was made some little less than messengers we see  &#8212; Jesus &#8212; because of the suffering of the death, with glory  and honour having been crowned, that by the grace of God for  every one he might taste of death.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For it was becoming to Him, because of whom [are] the all  things, and through whom [are] the all things, many sons to  glory bringing, the author of their salvation through  sufferings to make perfect, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>for both he who is sanctifying and those sanctified [are]  all of one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them  brethren,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>saying, &#8216;I will declare Thy name to my brethren, in the  midst of an assembly I will sing praise to Thee;&#8217; and again,  &#8216;I will be trusting on Him;&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>and again, &#8216;Behold I and the children that God did give to  me.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Seeing, then, the children have partaken of flesh and  blood, he himself also in like manner did take part of the  same, that through death he might destroy him having the power  of death &#8212; that is, the devil &#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and might deliver those, whoever, with fear of death,  throughout all their life, were subjects of bondage, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>for, doubtless, of messengers it doth not lay hold, but of  seed of Abraham it layeth hold, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>wherefore it did behove him in all things to be made like  to the brethren, that he might become a kind and stedfast  chief-priest in the things with God, to make propitiation for  the sins of the people, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>for in that he suffered, himself being tempted, he is able  to help those who are tempted.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
