<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>for we also are having good news proclaimed, even as they,  but the word heard did not profit them, not being mixed with  faith in those who heard,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>for we do enter into the rest &#8212; we who did believe, as He  said, &#8216;So I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest  &#8212; ;&#8217; and yet the works were done from the foundation of the  world,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>for He spake in a certain place concerning the seventh [day]  thus: &#8216;And God did rest in the seventh day from all His works;&#8217;

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>for if Joshua had given them rest, He would not concerning  another day have spoken after these things; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>there doth remain, then, a sabbatic rest to the people of  God, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>for he who did enter into his rest, he also rested from his  works, as God from His own. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>May we be diligent, then, to enter into that rest, that no  one in the same example of the unbelief may fall,</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>and there is not a created thing not manifest before Him,  but all things [are] naked and open to His eyes &#8212; with whom  is our reckoning.</p>
