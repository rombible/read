<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For turned back hath Jehovah to the excellency of Jacob, As  [to] the excellency of Israel, For emptied them out have  emptiers, And their branches they have marred.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>The shield of his mighty ones is become red, Men of might  [are in] scarlet, With fiery torches [is] the chariot in a day  of his preparation, And the firs have been caused to tremble.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>In out-places shine do the chariots, They go to and fro in  broad places, Their appearances [are] like torches, As  lightnings they run.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>He doth remember his honourable ones, They stumble in their  goings, They hasten [to] its wall, and prepared is the  covering.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Gates of the rivers have been opened, And the palace is  dissolved.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And it is established &#8212; she hath removed, She hath been  brought up, And her handmaids are leading as the voice of  doves, Tabering on their hearts.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Nineveh [is] as a pool of waters, From of old it [is] &#8212;  and they are fleeing! &#8216;Stand ye, stand;&#8217; and none is turning!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Seize ye silver, seize ye gold, And there is no end to the  prepared things, [To] the abundance of all desirable vessels.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>She is empty, yea, emptiness and waste, And the heart hath  melted, And the knees have smitten together, And great pain  [is] in all loins, And the faces of all of them have gathered  paleness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Where [is] the habitation of lionesses? And a feeding-place  it [is] for young lions Where walked hath a lion, an old lion,  A lion&#8217;s whelp, and there is none troubling.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>The lion is tearing parts [for] his whelps, And is  strangling for his lionesses, And he doth fill [with] prey his  holes, And his habitations [with] rapine.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Lo, I [am] against thee, An affirmation of Jehovah of  Hosts, And I have burned in smoke its chariot, And thy young  lions consume doth a sword, And I have cut off from the land  thy prey, And not heard any more is the voice of thy  messengers!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
