<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>A God zealous and avenging [is] Jehovah, An avenger [is]  Jehovah, and possessing fury. An avenger [is] Jehovah on His  adversaries, And He is watching for His enemies.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Jehovah [is] slow to anger, and great in power, And Jehovah  doth not entirely acquit, In a hurricane and in a tempest [is]  His way, And a cloud [is] the dust of His feet.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>He is pushing against a sea, and drieth it up, Yea, all the  floods He hath made dry, Languishing [are] Bashan and Carmel,  Yea, the flower of Lebanon [is] languishing.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Mountains have shaken because of Him, And the hills have  been melted; And lifted up [is] the earth at His presence, And  the world and all dwelling in it.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>What do we devise against Jehovah? An end He is making,  arise not twice doth distress.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For while princes [are] perplexed, And with their drink are  drunken, They have been consumed as stubble fully dried.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Lo, on the mountains the feet of one proclaiming tidings,  sounding peace! Celebrate, O Judah, thy festivals, complete thy  vows, For add no more to pass over into thee doth the  worthless, He hath been completely cut off!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
