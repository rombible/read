The turnings of thy sides  [are] as ornaments, Work of the hands of an artificer.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Thy waist [is] a basin of roundness, It lacketh not the  mixture, Thy body a heap of wheat, fenced with lilies,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Thy two breasts as two young ones, twins of a roe,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Thy neck as a tower of the ivory, Thine eyes pools in  Heshbon, near the gate of Bath-Rabbim, Thy face as a tower of  Lebanon looking to Damascus,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Thy head upon thee as Carmel, And the locks of thy head as  purple, The king is bound with the flowings!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>How fair and how pleasant hast thou been, O love, in  delights.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>This thy stature hath been like to a palm, And thy breasts  to clusters.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>I said, &#8216;Let me go up on the palm, Let me lay hold on its  boughs, Yea, let thy breasts be, I pray thee, as clusters of  the vine, And the fragrance of thy face as citrons,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And thy palate as the good wine &#8212;&#8217; Flowing to my beloved  in uprightness, Strengthening the lips of the aged!</p>
<p class="hdg">The Bride Promises Her Love</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>I [am] my beloved&#8217;s, and on me [is] his desire.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Come, my beloved, we go forth to the field,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>We lodge in the villages, we go early to the vineyards, We  see if the vine hath flourished, The sweet smelling-flower hath  opened. The pomegranates have blossomed, There do I give to  thee my loves;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The mandrakes have given fragrance, And at our openings all  pleasant things, New, yea, old, my beloved, I laid up for thee!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
