I find thee without, I kiss thee, Yea, they do  not despise me,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>I lead thee, I bring thee in unto my mother&#8217;s house, She  doth teach me, I cause thee to drink of the perfumed wine, Of  the juice of my pomegranate,</p>
