<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>so that the sons of Israel do bring in their sacrifices  which they are sacrificing on the face of the field, yea, they  have brought them in to Jehovah, unto the opening of the tent  of meeting, unto the priest, and they have sacrificed  sacrifices of peace-offerings to Jehovah with them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8216;And the priest hath sprinkled the blood upon the altar of  Jehovah, at the opening of the tent of meeting, and hath made  perfume with the fat for sweet fragrance to Jehovah;
