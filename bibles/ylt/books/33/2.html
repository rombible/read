<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And they have desired fields, And they have taken violently,  And houses, and they have taken away, And have oppressed a man  and his house, Even a man and his inheritance.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Therefore, thus said Jehovah: Lo, I am devising against this  family evil, From which ye do not remove your necks, Nor walk  loftily, for a time of evil it [is].</p>
