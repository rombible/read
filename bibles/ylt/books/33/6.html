<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Hear, O mountains, the strife of Jehovah, Ye strong ones &#8212;  foundations of earth! For a strife [is] to Jehovah, with His  people, And with Israel He doth reason.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>O My people, what have I done to thee? And what &#8212; have I  wearied thee? Testify against Me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For I brought thee up from the land of Egypt, And from the  house of servants I have ransomed thee, And I send before thee  Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>O My people, remember, I pray you, What counsel did Balak  king of Moab, What answer him did Balaam son of Beor, (From  Shittim unto Gilgal,) In order to know the righteous acts of  Jehovah.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>With what do I come before Jehovah? Do I bow to God Most  High? Do I come before Him with burnt-offerings? With calves &#8212;  sons of a year?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Is Jehovah pleased with thousands of rams? With myriads of  streams of oil? Do I give my first-born [for] my transgression?  The fruit of my body [for] the sin of my soul?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>He hath declared to thee, O man, what [is] good; Yea, what  is Jehovah requiring of thee, Except &#8212; to do judgment, and  love kindness, And lowly to walk with thy God?</p>
<p class="hdg">The Punishment of Israel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>A voice of Jehovah to the city calleth, And wisdom doth fear  Thy name, Hear ye the rod, and Him who appointed it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Are there yet [in] the house of the wicked Treasures of  wickedness, And the abhorred scanty ephah?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Do I reckon [it] pure with balances of wickedness? And with  a bag of deceitful stones?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Whose rich ones have been full of violence, And its  inhabitants have spoken falsehood, And their tongue [is]  deceitful in their mouth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And I also, I have begun to smite thee, To make desolate,  because of thy sins.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Thou &#8212; thou eatest, and thou art not satisfied, And thy  pit [is] in thy midst, And thou removest, and dost not deliver,  And that which thou deliverest, to a sword I give.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Thou &#8212; thou sowest, and thou dost not reap, Thou &#8212; thou  treadest the olive, And thou pourest not out oil, And new wine  &#8212; and thou drinkest not wine.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And kept habitually are the statutes of Omri, And all the  work of the house of Ahab, And ye do walk in their counsels,  For My giving thee for a desolation, And its inhabitants for a  hissing, And the reproach of My people ye do bear!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
