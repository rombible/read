<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Hear, O peoples, all of them! Attend, O earth, and its  fulness, And the Lord Jehovah is against you for a witness, The  Lord from His holy temple.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For lo, Jehovah is going out from His place, And He hath  come down, And hath trodden on high places of earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Melted have been the mountains under Him, And the valleys do  rend themselves, As wax from the presence of fire, As waters  cast down by a slope.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For the transgression of Jacob [is] all this, And for the  sins of the house of Israel. What [is] the transgression of  Jacob? Is it not Samaria? And what the high places of Judah? Is  it not Jerusalem?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And I have set Samaria for a heap of the field, For  plantations of a vineyard, And poured out into a valley her  stones, And her foundations I uncover.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And all her graven images are beaten down, And all her gifts  are burnt with fire, And all her idols I make a desolation,  For, from the hire of a harlot she gathered, and unto the hire  of a harlot they return.</p>
<p class="hdg">Weeping and Mourning</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For this I lament and howl, I go spoiled and naked, I make a  lamentation like dragons, And a mourning like daughters of an  ostrich.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For mortal [are] her wounds, For it hath come unto Judah, It  hath come to a gate of My people &#8212; to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>In Gath tell ye not &#8212; in Acco weep not, In Beth-Aphrah, in  dust roll thyself.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Pass over for thee, O inhabitant of Shaphir, Naked one of  shame. Not gone out hath the inhabitant of Zaanan, The  lamentation of Beth-Ezel doth take from you its standing.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For stayed for good hath the inhabitant of Maroth, For evil  hath come down from Jehovah to the gate of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Bind the chariot to a swift beast, O inhabitant of Lachish,  The beginning of sin [is] she to the daughter of Zion, For in  thee have been found the transgressions of Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Therefore thou givest presents to Moresheth-Gath, The  houses of Achzib become a lying thing to the kings of Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Yet the possessor I do bring in to thee, O inhabitant of  Mareshah, To Adullam come in doth the honour of Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Make bald and shave, for thy delightful sons, Enlarge thy  baldness as an eagle, For they have removed from thee!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
