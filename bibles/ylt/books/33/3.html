<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Ye who are hating good, and loving evil, Taking violently  their skin from off them, And their flesh from off their bones,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And who have eaten the flesh of My people, And their skin  from off them have stript, And their bones they have broken,  And they have spread [them] out as in a pot, And as flesh in  the midst of a caldron.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then do they cry unto Jehovah, And He doth not answer them,  And hideth His face from them at that time, As they have made  evil their doings.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Thus said Jehovah concerning the prophets Who are causing My  people to err, Who are biting with their teeth, And have cried  &#8216;Peace,&#8217; And he who doth not give unto their mouth, They have  sanctified against him war.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Therefore a night ye have without vision, And darkness ye  have without divination, And gone in hath the sun on the  prophets, And black over them hath been the day.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And ashamed have been the seers, And confounded have been  the diviners, And covered their lip have all of them, For their  is no answer, O God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And yet I have been full of power by the Spirit of Jehovah,  And of judgment, and of might, To declare to Jacob his  transgression, And to Israel his sin.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Hear this, I pray you, heads of the house of Jacob, And ye  judges of the house of Israel, Who are making judgment  abominable, And all uprightness do pervert.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Building up Zion with blood, And Jerusalem with iniquity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Her heads for a bribe do judge, And her priests for hire do  teach, And her prophets for silver divine, And on Jehovah they  lean, saying, &#8216;Is not Jehovah in our midst? Evil doth not come  in upon us.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore, for your sake, Zion is ploughed a field, and  Jerusalem is heaps, And the mount of the house [is] for high  places of a forest!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
