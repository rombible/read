<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and immediately I was in the Spirit, and lo, a throne was  set in the heaven, and upon the throne is [one] sitting, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and He who is sitting was in sight like a stone, jasper and  sardine: and a rainbow was round the throne in sight like an  emerald. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And around the throne [are] thrones twenty and four, and  upon the thrones I saw the twenty and four elders sitting,  clothed in white garments, and they had upon their heads crowns  of gold;</p>
