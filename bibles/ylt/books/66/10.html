<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and he had in his hand a little scroll opened, and he did  place his right foot upon the sea, and the left upon the land, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and he cried with a great voice, as a lion doth roar, and  when he cried, speak out did the seven thunders their voices; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and when the seven thunders spake their voices, I was about  to write, and I heard a voice out of the heaven saying to me,  &#8216;Seal the things that the seven thunders spake,&#8217; and, &#8216;Thou  mayest not write these things.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the messenger whom I saw standing upon the sea, and  upon the land, did lift up his hand to the heaven,

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>but in the days of the voice of the seventh messenger, when  he may be about to sound, and the secret of God may be  finished, as He did declare to His own servants, to the  prophets.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and I went away unto the messenger, saying to him, &#8216;Give me  the little scroll;&#8217; and he saith to me, &#8216;Take, and eat it up,  and it shall make thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth it shall  be sweet &#8212; as honey.&#8217;
