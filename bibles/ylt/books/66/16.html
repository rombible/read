<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and the first did go away, and did pour out his vial upon  the land, and there came a sore &#8212; bad and grievous &#8212; to men,  those having the mark of the beast, and those bowing to his  image.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the second messenger did pour out his vial to the sea,  and there came blood as of [one] dead, and every living soul  died in the sea.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the third messenger did pour out his vial to the  rivers, and to the fountains of the waters, and there came  blood,

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and men were scorched with great heat, and they did speak  evil of the name of God, who hath authority over these  plagues, and they did not reform &#8212; to give to Him glory.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the fifth messenger did pour out his vial upon the  throne of the beast, and his kingdom did become darkened, and  they were gnawing their tongues from the pain,
