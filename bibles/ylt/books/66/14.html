<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and I heard a voice out of the heaven, as a voice of many  waters, and as a voice of great thunder, and a voice I heard of  harpers harping with their harps, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and they sing, as it were, a new song before the throne,  and before the four living creatures, and the elders, and no  one was able to learn the song except the hundred forty-four  thousands, who have been bought from the earth; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>these are they who with women were not defiled, for they  are virgin; these are they who are following the Lamb  whithersoever he may go; these were bought from among men &#8212; a  first-fruit to God and to the Lamb &#8212;

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And a third messenger did follow them, saying in a great  voice, &#8216;If any one the beast doth bow before, and his image,  and doth receive a mark upon his forehead, or upon his hand,
