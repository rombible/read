<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and the court that is without the sanctuary leave out, and  thou mayest not measure it, because it was given to the  nations, and the holy city they shall tread down forty-two  months; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and I will give to My two witnesses, and they shall  prophesy days, a thousand, two hundred, sixty, arrayed with  sackcloth; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>these are the two olive [trees], and the two lamp-stands  that before the God of the earth do stand; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and if any one may will to injure them, fire doth proceed  out of their mouth, and doth devour their enemies, and if any  one may will to injure them, thus it behoveth him to be killed. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>These have authority to shut the heaven, that it may not  rain rain in the days of their prophecy, and authority they  have over the waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the  land with every plague, as often as they may will.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Witnesses Killed and Raised</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8216;And when they may finish their testimony, the beast that  is coming up out of the abyss shall make war with them, and  overcome them, and kill them, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and their dead bodies [are] upon the broad-place of the  great city (that is called spiritually Sodom, and Egypt, where  also our Lord was crucified,) 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and they shall behold &#8212; they of the peoples, and tribes,  and tongues, and nations &#8212; their dead bodies three days and a  half, and their dead bodies they shall not suffer to be put  into tombs, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and those dwelling upon the land shall rejoice over them,  and shall make merry, and gifts they shall send to one another,  because these &#8212; the two prophets &#8212; did torment those dwelling  upon the land.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And after the three days and a half, a spirit of life from  God did enter into them, and they stood upon their feet, and  great fear fell upon those beholding them, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and they heard a great voice out of the heaven saying to  them, &#8216;Come up hither;&#8217; and they went up to the heaven in the  cloud, and their enemies beheld them; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>and in that hour came a great earthquake, and the tenth of  the city did fall, and killed in the earthquake were names of  men &#8212; seven thousands, and the rest became affrighted, and  they gave glory to the God of the heaven.</p>

<p class="hdg">The Seventh Trumpet</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And the seventh messenger did sound, and there came great  voices in the heaven, saying, &#8216;The kingdoms of the world did  become [those] of our Lord and of His Christ, and he shall  reign to the ages of the ages!&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and the twenty and four elders, who before God are sitting  upon their thrones, did fall upon their faces, and did bow  before God, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>saying, &#8216;We give thanks to Thee, O Lord God, the Almighty,  who art, and who wast, and who art coming, because Thou hast  taken Thy great power and didst reign; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and the nations were angry, and Thine anger did come, and  the time of the dead, to be judged, and to give the reward to  Thy servants, to the prophets, and to the saints, and to those  fearing Thy name, to the small and to the great, and to  destroy those who are destroying the land.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And opened was the sanctuary of God in the heaven, and  there was seen the ark of His covenant in His sanctuary, and  there did come lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an  earthquake, and great hail.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
