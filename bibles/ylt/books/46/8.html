<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and if any one doth think to know anything, he hath not yet  known anything according as it behoveth [him] to know;

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Concerning the eating then of the things sacrificed to  idols, we have known that an idol [is] nothing in the world,  and that there is no other God except one; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>for even if there are those called gods, whether in heaven,  whether upon earth &#8212; as there are gods many and lords many &#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>yet to us [is] one God, the Father, of whom [are] the all  things, and we to Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through  whom [are] the all things, and we through Him;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>but not in all men [is] the knowledge, and certain with  conscience of the idol, till now, as a thing sacrificed to an  idol do eat [it], and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But victuals do not commend us to God, for neither if we may  eat are we in advance; nor if we may not eat, are we behind; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>but see, lest this privilege of yours may become a  stumbling-block to the infirm, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>for if any one may see thee that hast knowledge in an  idol&#8217;s temple reclining at meat &#8212; shall not his conscience &#8212;  he being infirm &#8212; be emboldened to eat the things sacrificed  to idols, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and the brother who is infirm shall perish by thy  knowledge, because of whom Christ died? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and thus sinning in regard to the brethren, and smiting  their weak conscience &#8212; in regard to Christ ye sin; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>wherefore, if victuals cause my brother to stumble, I may  eat no flesh &#8212; to the age &#8212; that my brother I may not cause  to stumble.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
