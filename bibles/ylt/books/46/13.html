<div class="chap"><p class="hdg">Love</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>If with the tongues of men and of messengers I speak, and  have not love, I have become brass sounding, or a cymbal  tinkling; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and if I have prophecy, and know all the secrets, and all  the knowledge, and if I have all the faith, so as to remove  mountains, and have not love, I am nothing; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and if I give away to feed others all my goods, and if I  give up my body that I may be burned, and have not love, I am  profited nothing.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The love is long-suffering, it is kind, the love doth not  envy, the love doth not vaunt itself, is not puffed up, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>doth not act unseemly, doth not seek its own things, is not  provoked, doth not impute evil, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>rejoiceth not over the unrighteousness, and rejoiceth with  the truth; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>all things it beareth, all it believeth, all it hopeth, all  it endureth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The love doth never fail; and whether [there be]  prophecies, they shall become useless; whether tongues, they  shall cease; whether knowledge, it shall become useless; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>for in part we know, and in part we prophecy; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and when that which is perfect may come, then that which  [is] in part shall become useless. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>When I was a babe, as a babe I was speaking, as a babe I  was thinking, as a babe I was reasoning, and when I have become  a man, I have made useless the things of the babe; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>for we see now through a mirror obscurely, and then face  to face; now I know in part, and then I shall fully know, as  also I was known; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>and now there doth remain faith, hope, love &#8212; these  three; and the greatest of these [is] love.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
