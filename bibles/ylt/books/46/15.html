<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>through which also ye are being saved, in what words I  proclaimed good news to you, if ye hold fast, except ye did  believe in vain,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>for I delivered to you first, what also I did receive, that  Christ died for our sins, according to the Writings, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and that he was buried, and that he hath risen on the third  day, according to the Writings, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>afterwards he appeared to above five hundred brethren at  once, of whom the greater part remain till now, and certain  also did fall asleep; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>afterwards he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And last of all &#8212; as to the untimely birth &#8212; he appeared  also to me, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>for I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be  called an apostle, because I did persecute the assembly of God, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace that  [is] towards me came not in vain, but more abundantly than they  all did I labour, yet not I, but the grace of God that [is]  with me;

<p class="hdg">The Resurrection of the Dead</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And if Christ is preached, that out of the dead he hath  risen, how say certain among you, that there is no rising again  of dead persons? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>and if there be no rising again of dead persons, neither  hath Christ risen; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and if Christ hath not risen, then void [is] our  preaching, and void also your faith, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and we also are found false witnesses of God, because we  did testify of God that He raised up the Christ, whom He did  not raise if then dead persons do not rise; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>for if dead persons do not rise, neither hath Christ  risen, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>and if Christ hath not risen, vain is your faith, ye are  yet in your sins; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>then, also, those having fallen asleep in Christ did  perish; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>if in this life we have hope in Christ only, of all men we  are most to be pitied.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Order of Resurrection</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And now, Christ hath risen out of the dead &#8212; the  first-fruits of those sleeping he became, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>for since through man [is] the death, also through man  [is] a rising again of the dead, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>for even as in Adam all die, so also in the Christ all  shall be made alive, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>and each in his proper order, a first-fruit Christ,  afterwards those who are the Christ&#8217;s, in his presence, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>then &#8212; the end, when he may deliver up the reign to God,  even the Father, when he may have made useless all rule, and  all authority and power &#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>for it behoveth him to reign till he may have put all the  enemies under his feet &#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>the last enemy is done away &#8212; death; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>for all things He did put under his feet, and, when one  may say that all things have been subjected, [it is] evident  that He is excepted who did subject the all things to him, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>and when the all things may be subjected to him, then the  Son also himself shall be subject to Him, who did subject to  him the all things, that God may be the all in all.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Seeing what shall they do who are baptized for the dead,  if the dead do not rise at all? why also are they baptized for  the dead? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>why also do we stand in peril every hour? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Every day do I die, by the glorying of you that I have in  Christ Jesus our Lord: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>if after the manner of a man with wild beasts I fought in  Ephesus, what the advantage to me if the dead do not rise? let  us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Be not led astray; evil communications corrupt good  manners; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>awake up, as is right, and sin not; for certain have an  ignorance of God; for shame to you I say [it].</p>
<p class="hdg">The Resurrection Body</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>But some one will say, &#8216;How do the dead rise? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>unwise! thou &#8212; what thou dost sow is not quickened except  it may die;

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>and God doth give to it a body according as He willed, and  to each of the seeds its proper body. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>All flesh [is] not the same flesh, but there is one flesh  of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another of fishes, and  another of birds; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>and [there are] heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies; but  one [is] the glory of the heavenly, and another that of the  earthly; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>one glory of sun, and another glory of moon, and another  glory of stars, for star from star doth differ in glory.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>So also [is] the rising again of the dead: it is sown in  corruption, it is raised in incorruption; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>it is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory; it is sown  in weakness, it is raised in power;
