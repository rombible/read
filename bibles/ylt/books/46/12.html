<div class="chap"><p class="hdg">Spiritual Gifts Bestowed</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>And concerning the spiritual things, brethren, I do not  wish you to be ignorant; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>ye have known that ye were nations, unto the dumb idols &#8212;  as ye were led &#8212; being carried away; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>wherefore, I give you to understand that no one, in the  Spirit of God speaking, saith Jesus [is] anathema, and no one  is able to say Jesus [is] Lord, except in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And there are diversities of gifts, and the same Spirit; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and there are diversities of ministrations, and the same  Lord; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and there are diversities of workings, and it is the same  God &#8212; who is working the all in all. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And to each hath been given the manifestation of the Spirit  for profit; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>for to one through the Spirit hath been given a word of  wisdom, and to another a word of knowledge, according to the  same Spirit; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and to another faith in the same Spirit, and to another  gifts of healings in the same Spirit; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and to another in-workings of mighty deeds; and to another  prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits; and to another  [divers] kinds of tongues; and to another interpretation of  tongues: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and all these doth work the one and the same Spirit,  dividing to each severally as he intendeth.</p>
<p class="hdg">Many Members, One Body</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For, even as the body is one, and hath many members, and  all the members of the one body, being many, are one body, so  also [is] the Christ, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>for also in one Spirit we all to one body were baptized,  whether Jews or Greeks, whether servants or freemen, and all  into one Spirit were made to drink,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>for also the body is not one member, but many; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>if the foot may say, &#8216;Because I am not a hand, I am not  of the body;&#8217; it is not, because of this, not of the body; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and if the ear may say, &#8216;Because I am not an eye, I am not  of the body;&#8217; it is not, because of this, not of the body? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>If the whole body [were] an eye, where the hearing? if  the whole hearing, where the smelling? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and now, God did set the members each one of them in the  body, according as He willed, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>and if all were one member, where the body? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and now, indeed, [are] many members, and one body; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>and an eye is not able to say to the hand, &#8216;I have no need  of thee;&#8217; nor again the head to the feet, &#8216;I have no need of  you.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But much more the members of the body which seem to be  more infirm are necessary, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>and those that we think to be less honourable of the body,  around these we put more abundant honour, and our unseemly  things have seemliness more abundant, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>and our seemly things have no need; but God did temper the  body together, to the lacking part having given more abundant  honour, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>that there may be no division in the body, but that the  members may have the same anxiety for one another, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>and whether one member doth suffer, suffer with [it] do  all the members, or one member is glorified, rejoice with [it]  do all the members;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>and ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.</p>
<p class="hdg">Spiritual Gifts</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And some, indeed, did God set in the assembly, first  apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, afterwards  powers, afterwards gifts of healings, helpings, governings,  divers kinds of tongues; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>[are] all apostles? [are] all prophets? [are] all  teachers? [are] all powers? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do  all interpret? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>and desire earnestly the better gifts; and yet a far  excelling way do I shew to you:</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
