Jesus Christ our Lord  have I not seen? my work are not ye in the Lord? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>if to others I am not an apostle &#8212; yet doubtless to you I  am; for the seal of my apostleship are ye in the Lord.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>My defence to those who examine me in this; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>have we not authority to eat and to drink? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>have we not authority a sister &#8212; a wife &#8212; to lead about,  as also the other apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and  Cephas? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>or only I and Barnabas, have we not authority &#8212; not to  work? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>who doth serve as a soldier at his own charges at any time?  who doth plant a vineyard, and of its fruit doth not eat? or  who doth feed a flock, and of the milk of the flock doth not  eat?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>According to man do I speak these things? or doth not also  the law say these things? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>for in the law of Moses it hath been written, &#8216;thou shalt  not muzzle an ox treading out corn;&#8217; for the oxen doth God  care? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>or because of us by all means doth He say [it]? yes,  because of us it was written, because in hope ought the plower  to plow, and he who is treading [ought] of his hope to partake  in hope. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>If we to you the spiritual things did sow &#8212; great [is it]  if we your fleshly things do reap? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>if others do partake of the authority over you &#8212; not we  more? but we did not use this authority, but all things we  bear, that we may give no hindrance to the good news of the  Christ. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Have ye not known that those working about the things of  the temple &#8212; of the temple do eat, and those waiting at the  altar &#8212; with the altar are partakers? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>so also did the Lord direct to those proclaiming the good  news: of the good news to live.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And I have used none of these things; neither did I write  these things that it may be so done in my case, for [it is]  good for me rather to die, than that any one may make my  glorying void; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>for if I may proclaim good news, it is no glorying for me,  for necessity is laid upon me, and wo is to me if I may not  proclaim good news; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>for if willing I do this, I have a reward; and if  unwillingly &#8212; with a stewardship I have been entrusted! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>What, then, is my reward? &#8212; that proclaiming good news,  without charge I shall make the good news of the Christ, not to  abuse my authority in the good news;</p>
<p class="hdg">Paul a Servant to All</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>for being free from all men, to all men I made myself  servant, that the more I might gain; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and I became to the Jews as a Jew, that Jews I might gain;  to those under law as under law, that those under law I might  gain; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>to those without law, as without law &#8212; (not being without  law to God, but within law to Christ) &#8212; that I might gain  those without law; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>I became to the infirm as infirm, that the infirm I might  gain; to all men I have become all things, that by all means I  may save some. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And this I do because of the good news, that a  fellow-partaker of it I may become;</p>
<p class="hdg">Run Your Race to Win</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>have ye not known that those running in a race &#8212; all  indeed run, but one doth receive the prize? so run ye, that ye  may obtain; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>and every one who is striving, is in all things temperate;  these, indeed, then, that a corruptible crown they may receive,  but we an incorruptible; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>I, therefore, thus run, not as uncertainly, thus I fight,  as not beating air; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>but I chastise my body, and bring [it] into servitude, lest  by any means, having preached to others &#8212; I myself may become  disapproved.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
