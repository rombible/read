<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And I praise you, brethren, that in all things ye remember  me, and according as I did deliver to you, the deliverances ye  keep, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and I wish you to know that of every man the head is the  Christ, and the head of a woman is the husband, and the head of  Christ is God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Every man praying or prophesying, having the head covered,  doth dishonour his head, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and every woman praying or prophesying with the head  uncovered, doth dishonour her own head, for it is one and the  same thing with her being shaven, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>for if a woman is not covered &#8212; then let her be shorn, and  if [it is] a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven &#8212; let her  be covered; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>for a man, indeed, ought not to cover the head, being the  image and glory of God, and a woman is the glory of a man, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>for a man is not of a woman, but a woman [is] of a man, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>for a man also was not created because of the woman, but a  woman because of the man; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>because of this the woman ought to have [a token of]  authority upon the head, because of the messengers; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>but neither [is] a man apart from a woman, nor a woman  apart from a man, in the Lord, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>for as the woman [is] of the man, so also the man [is]  through the woman, and the all things [are] of God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>In your own selves judge ye; is it seemly for a woman  uncovered to pray to God? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>doth not even nature itself teach you, that if a man  indeed have long hair, a dishonour it is to him? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and a woman, if she have long hair, a glory it is to her,  because the hair instead of a covering hath been given to her; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and if any one doth think to be contentious, we have no  such custom, neither the assemblies of God.</p>
<a name="17" id="17"></a><p class="hdg">Observing the Lord's Supper<br /><p class="cross">(<a href="../matthew/26.html#26">Matthew 26:26-30</a>; <a href="../mark/14.html#22">Mark 14:22-26</a>; <a href="../luke/22.html#14">Luke 22:14-23</a>)</p></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And this declaring, I give no praise, because not for the  better, but for the worse ye come together; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>for first, indeed, ye coming together in an assembly, I  hear of divisions being among you, and partly I believe [it], 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>for it behoveth sects also to be among you, that those  approved may become manifest among you; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>ye, then, coming together at the same place &#8212; it is not  to eat the Lord&#8217;s supper; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>for each his own supper doth take before in the eating,  and one is hungry, and another is drunk; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>why, have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or the  assembly of God do ye despise, and shame those not having? what  may I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I do not praise!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>For I &#8212; I received from the Lord that which also I did  deliver to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he  was delivered up, took bread, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>and having given thanks, he brake, and said, &#8216;Take ye, eat  ye, this is my body, that for you is being broken; this do ye  &#8212; to the remembrance of me.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>In like manner also the cup after the supping, saying,  &#8216;This cup is the new covenant in my blood; this do ye, as often  as ye may drink [it] &#8212; to the remembrance of me;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>for as often as ye may eat this bread, and this cup may  drink, the death of the Lord ye do shew forth &#8212; till he may  come;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>so that whoever may eat this bread or may drink the cup of  the Lord unworthily, guilty he shall be of the body and blood  of the Lord: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>and let a man be proving himself, and so of the bread let  him eat, and of the cup let him drink; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>for he who is eating and drinking unworthily, judgment to  himself he doth eat and drink &#8212; not discerning the body of the  Lord. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Because of this, among you many [are] weak and sickly, and  sleep do many; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>for if ourselves we were discerning, we would not be being  judged, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>and being judged by the Lord, we are chastened, that with  the world we may not be condemned;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>so then, my brethren, coming together to eat, for one  another wait ye; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>and if any one is hungry, at home let him eat, that to  judgment ye may not come together; and the rest, whenever I  may come, I shall arrange.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
