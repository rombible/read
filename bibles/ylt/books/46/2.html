<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>for I decided not to know any thing among you, except Jesus  Christ, and him crucified; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and I, in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling, was  with you; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and my word and my preaching was not in persuasive words of  human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power  &#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>that your faith may not be in the wisdom of men, but in the  power of God.</p>
<p class="hdg">Wisdom from the Spirit of God</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And wisdom we speak among the perfect, and wisdom not of  this age, nor of the rulers of this age &#8212; of those becoming  useless, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>but we speak the hidden wisdom of God in a secret, that God  foreordained before the ages to our glory, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>which no one of the rulers of this age did know, for if they  had known, the Lord of the glory they would not have crucified;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>but, according as it hath been written, &#8216;What eye did not  see, and ear did not hear, and upon the heart of man came not  up, what God did prepare for those loving Him &#8212;&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>but to us did God reveal [them] through His Spirit, for the  Spirit all things doth search, even the depths of God, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>for who of men hath known the things of the man, except the  spirit of the man that [is] in him? so also the things of God  no one hath known, except the Spirit of God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And we the spirit of the world did not receive, but the  Spirit that [is] of God, that we may know the things conferred  by God on us, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>which things also we speak, not in words taught by human  wisdom, but in those taught by the Holy Spirit, with spiritual  things spiritual things comparing,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and the natural man doth not receive the things of the  Spirit of God, for to him they are foolishness, and he is not  able to know [them], because spiritually they are discerned; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and he who is spiritual, doth discern indeed all things,  and he himself is by no one discerned; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>for who did know the mind of the Lord that he shall  instruct Him? and we &#8212; we have the mind of Christ.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
