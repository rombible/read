<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>for I have known your readiness of mind, which in your  behalf I boast of to Macedonians, that Achaia hath been  prepared a year ago, and the zeal of you did stir up the more  part, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and I sent the brethren, that our boasting on your behalf  may not be made vain in this respect; that, according as I  said, ye may be ready, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>lest if Macedonians may come with me, and find you  unprepared, we &#8212; we may be put to shame (that we say not &#8212;  ye) in this same confidence of boasting. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Necessary, therefore, I thought [it] to exhort the brethren,  that they may go before to you, and may make up before your  formerly announced blessing, that this be ready, as a blessing,  and not as covetousness.</p>
</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And this: He who is sowing sparingly, sparingly also shall  reap; and he who is sowing in blessings, in blessings also  shall reap; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>each one, according as he doth purpose in heart, not out of  sorrow or out of necessity, for a cheerful giver doth God love, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and God [is] able all grace to cause to abound to you, that  in every thing always all sufficiency having, ye may abound to  every good work,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>(according as it hath been written, &#8216;He dispersed abroad, he  gave to the poor, his righteousness doth remain to the age,&#8217;)</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and may He who is supplying seed to the sower, and bread  for food, supply and multiply your seed sown, and increase the  fruits of your righteousness, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>in every thing being enriched to all liberality, which doth  work through us thanksgiving to God, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>because the ministration of this service not only is  supplying the wants of the saints, but is also abounding  through many thanksgivings to God, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>through the proof of this ministration glorifying God for  the subjection of your confession to the good news of the  Christ, and [for] the liberality of the fellowship to them and  to all, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and by their supplication in your behalf, longing after you  because of the exceeding grace of God upon you; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>thanks also to God for His unspeakable gift!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
