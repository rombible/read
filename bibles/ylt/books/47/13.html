<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>I have said before, and I say [it] before, as being  present, the second time, and being absent, now, do I write to  those having sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come  again, I will not spare, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>since a proof ye seek of the Christ speaking in me, who to  you is not infirm, but is powerful in you, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>for even if he was crucified from infirmity, yet he doth  live from the power of God; for we also are weak in him, but we  shall live with him from the power of God toward you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Your ownselves try ye, if ye are in the faith; your  ownselves prove ye; do ye not know your ownselves, that Jesus  Christ is in you, if ye be not in some respect disapproved of? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and I hope that ye shall know that we &#8212; we are not  disapproved of; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and I pray before God that ye do no evil, not that we may  appear approved, but that ye may do that which is right, and we  may be as disapproved; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>for we are not able to do anything against the truth, but  for the truth; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>for we rejoice when we may be infirm, and ye may be  powerful; and this also we pray for &#8212; your perfection! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>because of this, these things &#8212; being absent &#8212; I write,  that being present, I may not treat [any] sharply, according to  the authority that the Lord did give me for building up, and  not for casting down.</p>
<p class="hdg">Final Greetings and Blessing</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Henceforth, brethren, rejoice; be made perfect, be  comforted, be of the same mind, be at peace, and the God of the  love and peace shall be with you; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>salute one another in an holy kiss; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>salute you do all the saints;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God,  and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, [is] with you all! Amen. </p></div></div><div id="botbox">
