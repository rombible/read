<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>receive us; no one did we wrong; no one did we waste; no one  did we defraud; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>not to condemn you do I say [it], for I have said before  that in our hearts ye are to die with and to live with; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>great [is] my freedom of speech unto you, great my glory on  your behalf; I have been filled with the comfort, I overabound  with the joy on all our tribulation,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>for also we, having come to Macedonia, no relaxation hath  our flesh had, but on every side we are in tribulation, without  [are] fightings, within &#8212; fears; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>but He who is comforting the cast-down &#8212; God &#8212; He did  comfort us in the presence of Titus; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and not only in his presence, but also in the comfort with  which he was comforted over you, declaring to us your longing  desire, your lamentation, your zeal for me, so that the more I  did rejoice, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>because even if I made you sorry in the letter, I do not  repent &#8212; if even I did repent &#8212; for I perceive that the  letter, even if for an hour, did make you sorry. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>I now do rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye  were made sorry to reformation, for ye were made sorry toward  God, that in nothing ye might receive damage from us; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>for the sorrow toward God reformation to salvation not to  be repented of doth work, and the sorrow of the world doth work  death, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>for, lo, this same thing &#8212; your being made sorry toward  God &#8212; how much diligence it doth work in you! but defence, but  displeasure, but fear, but longing desire, but zeal, but  revenge; in every thing ye did approve yourselves to be pure in  the matter. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>If, then, I also wrote to you &#8212; not for his cause who did  wrong, nor for his cause who did suffer wrong, but for our  diligence in your behalf being manifested unto you before God  &#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>because of this we have been comforted in your comfort, and  more abundantly the more did we rejoice in the joy of Titus,  that his spirit hath been refreshed from you all; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>because if anything to him in your behalf I have boasted, I  was not put to shame; but as all things in truth we did speak  to you, so also our boasting before Titus became truth, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and his tender affection is more abundantly toward you,  remembering the obedience of you all, how with fear and  trembling ye did receive him; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>I rejoice, therefore, that in everything I have courage in  you.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
