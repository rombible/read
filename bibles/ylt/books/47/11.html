<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>for I am zealous for you with zeal of God, for I did  betroth you to one husband, a pure virgin, to present to  Christ, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and I fear, lest, as the serpent did beguile Eve in his  subtilty, so your minds may be corrupted from the simplicity  that [is] in the Christ; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>for if, indeed, he who is coming doth preach another Jesus  whom we did not preach, or another Spirit ye receive which ye  did not receive, or other good news which ye did not accept &#8212;  well were ye bearing [it], 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>for I reckon that I have been nothing behind the very  chiefest apostles, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and even if unlearned in word &#8212; yet not in knowledge, but  in every thing we were made manifest in all things to you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The sin did I do &#8212; myself humbling that ye might be  exalted, because freely the good news of God I did proclaim to  you? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>other assemblies I did rob, having taken wages, for your  ministration; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and being present with you, and having been in want, I was  chargeable to no one, for my lack did the brethren supply &#8212;  having come from Macedonia &#8212; and in everything burdenless to  you I did keep myself, and will keep. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The truth of Christ is in me, because this boasting shall  not be stopped in regard to me in the regions of Achaia; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>wherefore? because I do not love you? God hath known!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and what I do, I also will do, that I may cut off the  occasion of those wishing an occasion, that in that which they  boast they may be found according as we also; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>for those such [are] false apostles, deceitful workers,  transforming themselves into apostles of Christ, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and no wonder &#8212; for even the Adversary doth transform  himself into a messenger of light; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>no great thing, then, if also his ministrants do transform  themselves as ministrants of righteousness &#8212; whose end shall  be according to their works.</p>
