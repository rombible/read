<div class="chap"><p class="hdg">Reaffirm Your Love</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>And I decided this to myself, not again to come in sorrow  unto you, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>for if I make you sorry, then who is he who is making me  glad, except he who is made sorry by me? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and I wrote to you this same thing, that having come, I may  not have sorrow from them of whom it behoved me to have joy,  having confidence in you all, that my joy is of you all, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>for out of much tribulation and pressure of heart I wrote to  you through many tears, not that ye might be made sorry, but  that ye might know the love that I have more abundantly toward  you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And if any one hath caused sorrow, he hath not caused sorrow  to me, but in part, that I may not burden you all; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>sufficient to such a one is this punishment, that [is] by  the more part, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>so that, on the contrary, [it is] rather for you to forgive  and to comfort, lest by over abundant sorrow such a one may be  swallowed up; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>wherefore, I call upon you to confirm love to him, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>for, for this also did I write, that I might know the proof  of you, whether in regard to all things ye are obedient. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And to whom ye forgive anything &#8212; I also; for I also, if I  have forgiven anything, to whom I have forgiven [it], because  of you &#8212; in the person of Christ &#8212; [I forgive it,] 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>that we may not be over-reached by the Adversary, for of  his devices we are not ignorant.</p>
<p class="hdg">Triumph in Christ</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And having come to Troas for the good news of the Christ,  and a door to me having been opened in the Lord, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>I have not had rest to my spirit, on my not finding Titus  my brother, but having taken leave of them, I went forth to  Macedonia;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and to God [are] thanks, who at all times is leading us in  triumph in the Christ, and the fragrance of His knowledge He is  manifesting through us in every place, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>because of Christ a sweet fragrance we are to God, in those  being saved, and in those being lost; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>to the one, indeed, a fragrance of death to death, and to  the other, a fragrance of life to life; and for these things  who is sufficient? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>for we are not as the many, adulterating the word of God, but  as of sincerity &#8212; but as of God; in the presence of God, in  Christ we do speak.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
