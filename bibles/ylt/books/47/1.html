<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord  Jesus Christ!</p>
<p class="hdg">The God of All Comfort</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Blessed [is] God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,  the Father of the mercies, and God of all comfort, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>who is comforting us in all our tribulation, for our being  able to comfort those in any tribulation through the comfort  with which we are comforted ourselves by God; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>because, as the sufferings of the Christ do abound to us, so  through the Christ doth abound also our comfort; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and whether we be in tribulation, [it is] for your comfort  and salvation, that is wrought in the enduring of the same  sufferings that we also suffer; whether we are comforted, [it  is] for your comfort and salvation; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and our hope [is] stedfast for you, knowing that even as ye  are partakers of the sufferings &#8212; so also of the comfort.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For we do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, of our  tribulation that happened to us in Asia, that we were  exceedingly burdened above [our] power, so that we despaired  even of life; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>but we ourselves in ourselves the sentence of the death have  had, that we may not be trusting on ourselves, but on God, who  is raising the dead, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>who out of so great a death did deliver us, and doth  deliver, in whom we have hoped that even yet He will deliver; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>ye working together also for us by your supplication, that  the gift through many persons to us, through many may be  thankfully acknowledged for us.</p>
<p class="hdg">Paul's Change of Plans</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For our glorying is this: the testimony of our conscience,  that in simplicity and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom,  but in the grace of God, we did conduct ourselves in the world,  and more abundantly toward you; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>for no other things do we write to you, but what ye either  do read or also acknowledge, and I hope that also unto the end  ye shall acknowledge, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>according as also ye did acknowledge us in part, that your  glory we are, even as also ye [are] ours, in the day of the  Lord Jesus;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and in this confidence I was purposing to come unto you  before, that a second favour ye might have, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and through you to pass to Macedonia, and again from  Macedonia to come unto you, and by you to be sent forward to  Judea. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>This, therefore, counselling, did I then use the lightness;  or the things that I counsel, according to the flesh do I  counsel, that it may be with me Yes, yes, and No, no? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and God [is] faithful, that our word unto you became not  Yes and No, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>for the Son of God, Jesus Christ, among you through us  having been preached &#8212; through me and Silvanus and Timotheus &#8212;  did not become Yes and No, but in him it hath become Yes; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>for as many as [are] promises of God, in him [are] the Yes,  and in him the Amen, for glory to God through us; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>and He who is confirming you with us into Christ, and did  anoint us, [is] God, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>who also sealed us, and gave the earnest of the Spirit in  our hearts.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And I for a witness on God do call upon my soul, that  sparing you, I came not yet to Corinth; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>not that we are lords over your faith, but we are workers  together with your joy, for by the faith ye stand.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
