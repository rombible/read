<div class="chap"><p class="hdg">Generosity Commended</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>And we make known to you, brethren, the grace of God, that  hath been given in the assemblies of Macedonia, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>because in much trial of tribulation the abundance of their  joy, and their deep poverty, did abound to the riches of their  liberality; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>because, according to [their] power, I testify, and above  [their] power, they were willing of themselves, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>with much entreaty calling on us to receive the favour and  the fellowship of the ministration to the saints, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and not according as we expected, but themselves they did  give first to the Lord, and to us, through the will of God, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>so that we exhorted Titus, that, according as he did begin  before, so also he may finish to you also this favour,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>but even as in every thing ye do abound, in faith, and word,  and knowledge, and all diligence, and in your love to us, that  also in this grace ye may abound; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>not according to command do I speak, but because of the  diligence of others, and of your love proving the genuineness,</p>
<p class="hdg">Christ's Example</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>for ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that because  of you he became poor &#8212; being rich, that ye by that poverty  may become rich. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and an opinion in this do I give: for this to you [is]  expedient, who not only to do, but also to will, did begin  before &#8212; a year ago, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and now also finish doing [it], that even as [there is] the  readiness of the will, so also the finishing, out of that which  ye have, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>for if the willing mind is present, according to that which  any one may have it is well-accepted, not according to that  which he hath not; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>for not that for others release, and ye pressured, [do I  speak,] 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>but by equality, at the present time your abundance &#8212; for  their want, that also their abundance may be for your want,  that there may be equality, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>according as it hath been written, &#8216;He who [did gather]  much, had nothing over; and he who [did gather] little, had no  lack.&#8217;</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>because indeed the exhortation he accepted, and being more  diligent, of his own accord he went forth unto you, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and we sent with him the brother, whose praise in the good  news [is] through all the assemblies,

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>and we sent with them our brother, whom we proved in many  things many times being diligent, and now much more diligent,  by the great confidence that is toward you,
