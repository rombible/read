<div class="chap"><p class="hdg">Paul's Revelation</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>To boast, really, is not profitable for me, for I will come  to visions and revelations of the Lord. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>I have known a man in Christ, fourteen years ago &#8212; whether  in the body I have not known, whether out of the body I have  not known, God hath known &#8212; such an one being caught away unto  the third heaven; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and I have known such a man &#8212; whether in the body, whether  out of the body, I have not known, God hath known, &#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>that he was caught away to the paradise, and heard  unutterable sayings, that it is not possible for man to speak. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Of such an one I will boast, and of myself I will not  boast, except in my infirmities, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>for if I may wish to boast, I shall not be a fool, for  truth I will say; but I forebear, lest any one in regard to me  may think anything above what he doth see me, or doth hear  anything of me;</p>
<p class="hdg">Paul's Thorn and God's Grace</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and that by the exceeding greatness of the revelations I  might not be exalted overmuch, there was given to me a thorn in  the flesh, a messenger of the Adversary, that he might buffet  me, that I might not be exalted overmuch. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Concerning this thing thrice the Lord did I call upon, that  it might depart from me, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and He said to me, &#8216;Sufficient for thee is My grace, for My  power in infirmity is perfected;&#8217; most gladly, therefore, will  I rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of the Christ  may rest on me: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>wherefore I am well pleased in infirmities, in damages, in  necessities, in persecutions, in distresses &#8212; for Christ; for  whenever I am infirm, then I am powerful;</p>
<p class="hdg">Concern for the Corinthian Church</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>I have become a fool &#8212; boasting; ye &#8212; ye did compel me;  for I ought by you to have been commended, for in nothing was I  behind the very chiefest apostles &#8212; even if I am nothing. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>The signs, indeed, of the apostle were wrought among you  in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>for what is there in which ye were inferior to the rest of  the assemblies, except that I myself was not a burden to you?  forgive me this injustice!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Lo, a third time I am ready to come unto you, and I will  not be a burden to you, for I seek not yours, but you, for the  children ought not for the parents to lay up, but the parents  for the children, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and I most gladly will spend and be entirely spent for  your souls, even if, more abundantly loving you, less I am  loved. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And be it [so], I &#8212; I did not burden you, but being  crafty, with guile I did take you; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>any one of those whom I have sent unto you &#8212; by him did I  take advantage of you? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>I entreated Titus, and did send with [him] the brother;  did Titus take advantage of you? in the same spirit did we not  walk? &#8212; did we not in the same steps?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Again, think ye that to you we are making defence? before  God in Christ do we speak; and the all things, beloved, [are]  for your up-building, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>for I fear lest, having come, not such as I wish I may  find you, and I &#8212; I may be found by you such as ye do not  wish, lest there be strifes, envyings, wraths, revelries,  evil-speakings, whisperings, puffings up, insurrections, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>lest again having come, my God may humble me in regard to  you, and I may bewail many of those having sinned before, and  not having reformed concerning the uncleanness, and whoredom,  and lasciviousness, that they did practise.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
