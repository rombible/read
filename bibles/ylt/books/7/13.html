<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And there is a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the  Danite, and his name [is] Manoah, his wife [is] barren, and hath  not borne; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and a messenger of Jehovah appeareth unto the woman, and  saith unto her, &#8216;Lo, I pray thee, thou [art] barren, and hast  not borne; when thou hast conceived, then thou hast borne a  son. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And, now, take heed, I pray thee, and do not drink wine,  and strong drink, and do not eat any unclean thing, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>for, lo, thou art conceiving and bearing a son, and a razor  doth not go up on his head, for a Nazarite to God is the youth  from the womb, and he doth begin to save Israel out of the hand  of the Philistines.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the woman cometh and speaketh to her husband, saying,  &#8216;A man of God hath come unto me, and his appearance [is] as the  appearance of a messenger of God, very fearful, and I have not  asked him whence he [is], and his name he hath not declared to  me; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and he saith to me, Lo, thou art pregnant, and bearing a  son, and now do not drink wine and strong drink, and do not eat  any unclean thing, for a Nazarite to God is the youth from the  womb till the day of his death.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Manoah maketh entreaty unto Jehovah, and saith, &#8216;O, my  Lord, the man of God whom Thou didst send, let him come in, I  pray thee, again unto us, and direct us what we do to the youth  who is born.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And God hearkeneth to the voice of Manoah, and the  messenger of God cometh again unto the woman, and she [is]  sitting in a field, and Manoah her husband is not with her, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and the woman hasteth, and runneth, and declareth to her  husband, and saith unto him, &#8216;Lo, he hath appeared unto me &#8212; the  man who came on [that] day unto me.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And Manoah riseth, and goeth after his wife, and cometh  unto the man, and saith to him, &#8216;Art thou the man who spake  unto the woman?&#8217; and he saith, &#8216;I [am].&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And Manoah saith, &#8216;Now let thy words come to pass; what is  the custom of the youth &#8212; and his work?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And the messenger of Jehovah saith unto Manoah, &#8216;Of all  that I said unto the woman let her take heed; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>of anything which cometh out from the wine-vine she doth  not eat, and wine and strong drink she doth not drink, and any  unclean thing she doth not eat; all that I have commanded her  she doth observe.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And Manoah saith unto the messenger of Jehovah, &#8216;Let us  detain thee, we pray thee, and prepare before thee a kid of the  goats.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And the messenger of Jehovah saith unto Manoah, &#8216;If thou  detain me &#8212; I do not eat of thy bread; and if thou prepare a  burnt-offering &#8212; to Jehovah thou dost offer it;&#8217; for Manoah hath  not known that He [is] a messenger of Jehovah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And Manoah saith unto the messenger of Jehovah, &#8216;What [is]  thy name? when thy words come to pass, then we have honoured  thee.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And the messenger of Jehovah saith to him, &#8216;Why [is]  this &#8212; thou dost ask for My name? &#8212; and it [is] Wonderful.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And Manoah taketh the kid of the goats, and the present,  and offereth on the rock to Jehovah, and He is doing  wonderfully, and Manoah and his wife are looking on, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and it cometh to pass, in the going up of the flame from  off the altar toward the heavens, that the messenger of Jehovah  goeth up in the flame of the altar, and Manoah and his wife are  looking on, and they fall on their faces to the earth,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>and the messenger of Jehovah hath not added again to  appear unto Manoah, and unto his wife, then hath Manoah known  that He [is] a messenger of Jehovah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And Manoah saith unto his wife, &#8216;We certainly die, for we  have seen God.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And his wife saith to him, &#8216;If Jehovah were desirous to  put us to death, He had not received from our hands  burnt-offering and present, nor shewed us all these things, nor  as [at this] time caused us to hear [anything] like this.&#8217;</p>
