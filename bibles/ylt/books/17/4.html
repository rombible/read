<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And in every province and province, the place where the word  of the king, even his law, is coming, a great mourning have the  Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and lamenting: sackcloth and  ashes are spread for many.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And young women of Esther come in and her eunuchs, and  declare [it] to her, and the queen is exceedingly pained, and  sendeth garments to clothe Mordecai, and to turn aside his  sackcloth from off him, and he hath not received [them].
