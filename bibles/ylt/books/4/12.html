<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and they say, &#8216;Only by Moses hath Jehovah spoken? also by  us hath he not spoken?&#8217; and Jehovah heareth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the man Moses [is] very humble, more than any of the  men who [are] on the face of the ground. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And Jehovah saith suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and  unto Miriam, &#8216;Come out ye three unto the tent of meeting;&#8217; and  they three come out.

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and the cloud hath turned aside from off the tent, and lo,  Miriam [is] leprous as snow; and Aaron turneth unto Miriam, and  lo, leprous! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And Aaron saith unto Moses, &#8216;O, my lord, I pray thee, lay  not upon us sin [in] which we have been foolish, and [in] which  we have sinned;
