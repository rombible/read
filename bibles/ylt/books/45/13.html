<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>so that he who is setting himself against the authority,  against God&#8217;s ordinance hath resisted; and those resisting, to  themselves shall receive judgment. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For those ruling are not a terror to the good works, but to  the evil; and dost thou wish not to be afraid of the  authority? that which is good be doing, and thou shalt have  praise from it, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>for of God it is a ministrant to thee for good; and if that  which is evil thou mayest do, be fearing, for not in vain doth  it bear the sword; for of God it is a ministrant, an avenger  for wrath to him who is doing that which is evil. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Wherefore it is necessary to be subject, not only because  of the wrath, but also because of the conscience, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>for because of this also pay ye tribute; for servants of  God they are, on this very thing attending continually;
