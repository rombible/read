<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>one doth believe that he may eat all things &#8212; and he who  is weak doth eat herbs; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>let not him who is eating despise him who is not eating:  and let not him who is not eating judge him who is eating, for  God did receive him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Thou &#8212; who art thou that art judging another&#8217;s domestic?  to his own master he doth stand or fall; and he shall be made  to stand, for God is able to make him stand.</p>

He who is eating, to the Lord he doth eat,  for he doth give thanks to God; and he who is not eating, to  the Lord he doth not eat, and doth give thanks to God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For none of us to himself doth live, and none to himself  doth die; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>for both, if we may live, to the Lord we live; if also we  may die, to the Lord we die; both then if we may live, also if  we may die, we are the Lord&#8217;s; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>for because of this Christ both died and rose again, and  lived again, that both of dead and of living he may be Lord.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>I have known, and am persuaded, in the Lord Jesus, that  nothing [is] unclean of itself, except to him who is reckoning  anything to be unclean &#8212; to that one [it is] unclean;
