<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>let it not be! we who died to the sin &#8212; how shall we still  live in it? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>are ye ignorant that we, as many as were baptized to Christ  Jesus, to his death were baptized? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>we were buried together, then, with him through the baptism  to the death, that even as Christ was raised up out of the  dead through the glory of the Father, so also we in newness of  life might walk. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For, if we have become planted together to the likeness of  his death, [so] also we shall be of the rising again; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>this knowing, that our old man was crucified with [him],  that the body of the sin may be made useless, for our no  longer serving the sin; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>for he who hath died hath been set free from the sin.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And if we died with Christ, we believe that we also shall  live with him, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>knowing that Christ, having been raised up out of the dead,  doth no more die, death over him hath no more lordship; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>for in that he died, to the sin he died once, and in that  he liveth, he liveth to God; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>so also ye, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to the sin,  and living to God in Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Let not then the sin reign in your mortal body, to obey it  in its desires; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>neither present ye your members instruments of  unrighteousness to the sin, but present yourselves to God as  living out of the dead, and your members instruments of  righteousness to God;

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>and thanks to God, that ye were servants of the sin, and &#8212;  were obedient from the heart to the form of teaching to which  ye were delivered up; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and having been freed from the sin, ye became servants to  the righteousness.
