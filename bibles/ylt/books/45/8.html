<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>for the law of the Spirit of the life in Christ Jesus did  set me free from the law of the sin and of the death; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>for what the law was not able to do, in that it was weak  through the flesh, God, His own Son having sent in the  likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, did condemn the sin in  the flesh, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>that the righteousness of the law may be fulfilled in us,  who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the  Spirit. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For those who are according to the flesh, the things of the  flesh do mind; and those according to the Spirit, the things of  the Spirit; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>for the mind of the flesh [is] death, and the mind of the  Spirit &#8212; life and peace; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>because the mind of the flesh [is] enmity to God, for to the  law of God it doth not subject itself,
