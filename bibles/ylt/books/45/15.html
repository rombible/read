<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>for let each one of us please the neighbor for good, unto  edification, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>for even the Christ did not please himself, but, according  as it hath been written, &#8216;The reproaches of those reproaching  Thee fell upon me;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>for, as many things as were written before, for our  instruction were written before, that through the endurance,  and the exhortation of the Writings, we might have the hope.

<p class="hdg">Paul the Minister to the Gentiles</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And I am persuaded, my brethren &#8212; I myself also &#8212;  concerning you, that ye yourselves also are full of goodness,  having been filled with all knowledge, able also one another to  admonish; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and the more boldly I did write to you, brethren, in part,  as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to  me by God, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>for my being a servant of Jesus Christ to the nations,  acting as priest in the good news of God, that the offering up  of the nations may become acceptable, sanctified by the Holy  Spirit. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>I have, then, a boasting in Christ Jesus, in the things  pertaining to God,

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>in power of signs and wonders, in power of the Spirit of  God; so that I, from Jerusalem, and in a circle as far as  Illyricum, have fully preached the good news of the Christ; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and so counting it honour to proclaim good news, not where  Christ was named &#8212; that upon another&#8217;s foundation I might not  build &#8212;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>but according as it hath been written, &#8216;To whom it was not  told concerning him, they shall see; and they who have not  heard, shall understand.&#8217;</p>
