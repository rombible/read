<div class="chap"><p class="hdg">The Word Brings Salvation</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Brethren, the pleasure indeed of my heart, and my  supplication that [is] to God for Israel, is &#8212; for salvation; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>for I bear them testimony that they have a zeal of God, but  not according to knowledge, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>for not knowing the righteousness of God, and their own  righteousness seeking to establish, to the righteousness of God  they did not submit. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For Christ is an end of law for righteousness to every one  who is believing,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>for Moses doth describe the righteousness that [is] of the  law, that, &#8216;The man who did them shall live in them,&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and the righteousness of faith doth thus speak: &#8216;Thou  mayest not say in thine heart, Who shall go up to the heaven,&#8217;  that is, Christ to bring down? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>or, &#8216;Who shall go down to the abyss,&#8217; that is, Christ out  of the dead to bring up. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But what doth it say? &#8216;Nigh thee is the saying &#8212; in thy  mouth, and in thy heart:&#8217; that is, the saying of the faith,  that we preach; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>that if thou mayest confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus,  and mayest believe in thy heart that God did raise him out of  the dead, thou shalt be saved, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>for with the heart doth [one] believe to righteousness,  and with the mouth is confession made to salvation; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>for the Writing saith, &#8216;Every one who is believing on him  shall not be ashamed,&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>for there is no difference between Jew and Greek, for the  same Lord of all [is] rich to all those calling upon Him, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>for every one &#8212; whoever shall call upon the name of the  Lord, he shall be saved.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>How then shall they call upon [him] in whom they did not  believe? and how shall they believe [on him] of whom they did  not hear? and how shall they hear apart from one preaching? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and how shall they preach, if they may not be sent?  according as it hath been written, &#8216;How beautiful the feet of  those proclaiming good tidings of peace, of those proclaiming  good tidings of the good things!&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But they were not all obedient to the good tidings, for  Isaiah saith, &#8216;Lord, who did give credence to our report?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>so then the faith [is] by a report, and the report through  a saying of God,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>but I say, Did they not hear? yes, indeed &#8212; &#8216;to all the  earth their voice went forth, and to the ends of the habitable  world their sayings.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But I say, Did not Israel know? first Moses saith, &#8216;I will  provoke you to jealousy by [that which is] not a nation; by an  unintelligent nation I will anger you,&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and Isaiah is very bold, and saith, &#8216;I was found by those  not seeking Me; I became manifest to those not inquiring after  Me;&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>and unto Israel He saith, &#8216;All the day I did stretch out  My hands unto a people unbelieving and gainsaying.&#8217;</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
