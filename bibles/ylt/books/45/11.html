<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>God did not cast away His people whom He knew before; have  ye not known &#8212; in Elijah &#8212; what the Writing saith? how he  doth plead with God concerning Israel, saying, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8216;Lord, Thy prophets they did kill, and Thy altars they dug  down, and I was left alone, and they seek my life;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>but what saith the divine answer to him? &#8216;I left to Myself  seven thousand men, who did not bow a knee to Baal.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So then also in the present time a remnant according to the  choice of grace there hath been; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and if by grace, no more of works, otherwise the grace  becometh no more grace; and if of works, it is no more grace,  otherwise the work is no more work.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>What then? What Israel doth seek after, this it did not  obtain, and the chosen did obtain, and the rest were hardened,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>according as it hath been written, &#8216;God gave to them a  spirit of deep sleep, eyes not to see, and ears not to hear,&#8217;  &#8212; unto this very day,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and David saith, &#8216;Let their table become for a snare, and  for a trap, and for a stumbling-block, and for a recompense to  them;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>let their eyes be darkened &#8212; not to behold, and their  back do Thou always bow down.&#8217;</p>
<p class="hdg">The Ingrafting of the Gentiles</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>I say, then, Did they stumble that they might fall? let it  not be! but by their fall the salvation [is] to the nations,  to arouse them to jealousy; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and if the fall of them [is] the riches of a world, and  the diminution of them the riches of nations, how much more  the fulness of them? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For to you I speak &#8212; to the nations &#8212; inasmuch as I am  indeed an apostle of nations, my ministration I do glorify; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>if by any means I shall arouse to jealousy mine own flesh,  and shall save some of them, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>for if the casting away of them [is] a reconciliation of  the world, what the reception &#8212; if not life out of the dead? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and if the first-fruit [is] holy, the lump also; and if  the root [is] holy, the branches also.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And if certain of the branches were broken off, and thou,  being a wild olive tree, wast graffed in among them, and a  fellow-partaker of the root and of the fatness of the olive  tree didst become &#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>do not boast against the branches; and if thou dost boast,  thou dost not bear the root, but the root thee! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Thou wilt say, then, &#8216;The branches were broken off, that I  might be graffed in;&#8217; right! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>by unbelief they were broken off, and thou hast stood by  faith; be not high-minded, but be fearing; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>for if God the natural branches did not spare &#8212; lest  perhaps He also shall not spare thee. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Lo, then, goodness and severity of God &#8212; upon those  indeed who fell, severity; and upon thee, goodness, if thou  mayest remain in the goodness, otherwise, thou also shalt be  cut off. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And those also, if they may not remain in unbelief, shall  be graffed in, for God is able again to graff them in; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>for if thou, out of the olive tree, wild by nature, wast  cut out, and, contrary to nature, wast graffed into a good  olive tree, how much rather shall they, who [are] according to  nature, be graffed into their own olive tree?</p>
<p class="hdg">All Israel Shall Be Saved</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>For I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, of this  secret &#8212; that ye may not be wise in your own conceits &#8212; that  hardness in part to Israel hath happened till the fulness of  the nations may come in;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>and so all Israel shall be saved, according as it hath  been written, &#8216;There shall come forth out of Sion he who is  delivering, and he shall turn away impiety from Jacob,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>and this to them [is] the covenant from Me, when I may  take away their sins.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>As regards, indeed, the good tidings, [they are] enemies  on your account; and as regards the choice &#8212; beloved on  account of the fathers; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>for unrepented of [are] the gifts and the calling of God; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>for as ye also once did not believe in God, and now did  find kindness by the unbelief of these: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>so also these now did not believe, that in your kindness  they also may find kindness; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>for God did shut up together the whole to unbelief, that  to the whole He might do kindness.</p>
