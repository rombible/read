<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>for God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the good  news of His Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>always in my prayers beseeching, if by any means now at  length I shall have a prosperous journey, by the will of God,  to come unto you, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>for I long to see you, that I may impart to you some  spiritual gift, that ye may be established; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and that is, that I may be comforted together among you,  through the faith in one another, both yours and mine. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, that many  times I did purpose to come unto you &#8212; and was hindered till  the present time &#8212; that some fruit I might have also among  you, even as also among the other nations. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Both to Greeks and to foreigners, both to wise and to  thoughtless, I am a debtor, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>so, as much as in me is, I am ready also to you who [are]  in Rome to proclaim good news,</p>
<p class="hdg">I am Not Ashamed of the Gospel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>for I am not ashamed of the good news of the Christ, for it  is the power of God to salvation to every one who is believing,  both to Jew first, and to Greek. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For the righteousness of God in it is revealed from faith  to faith, according as it hath been written, &#8216;And the righteous  one by faith shall live,&#8217;</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>for the invisible things of Him from the creation of the  world, by the things made being understood, are plainly seen,  both His eternal power and Godhead &#8212; to their being  inexcusable; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>because, having known God they did not glorify [Him] as  God, nor gave thanks, but were made vain in their reasonings,  and their unintelligent heart was darkened, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>professing to be wise, they were made fools,

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Because of this did God give them up to dishonourable  affections, for even their females did change the natural use  into that against nature; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>and in like manner also the males having left the natural  use of the female, did burn in their longing toward one  another; males with males working shame, and the recompense of  their error that was fit, in themselves receiving.</p>
