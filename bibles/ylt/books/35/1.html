<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Till when, O Jehovah, have I cried, And Thou dost not hear?  I cry unto Thee &#8212; &#8216;Violence,&#8217; and Thou dost not save.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Why dost Thou shew me iniquity, And perversity dost cause to  behold? And spoiling and violence [are] before me, And there is  strife, and contention doth lift [itself] up,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Therefore doth law cease, And judgment doth not go forth for  ever, For the wicked is compassing the righteous, Therefore  wrong judgment goeth forth.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For, lo, I am raising up the Chaldeans, The bitter and hasty  nation, That is going to the broad places of earth, To occupy  tabernacles not its own.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Terrible and fearful it [is], From itself its judgment and  its excellency go forth.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Wholly for violence it doth come in, Their faces swallowing  up the east wind, And it doth gather as the sand a captivity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And at kings it doth scoff, And princes [are] a laughter to  it, At every fenced place it doth laugh, And it heapeth up  dust, and captureth it.</p>
