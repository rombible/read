<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Lo, little I have made thee among nations, Despised [art]  thou exceedingly.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>The pride of thy heart hath lifted thee up, O dweller in  clifts of a rock, (A high place [is] his habitation, He is  saying in his heart, &#8216;Who doth bring me down [to] earth?&#8217;)</p>
