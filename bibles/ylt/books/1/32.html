<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and Jacob saith, when he hath seen them, &#8216;This [is] the  camp of God;&#8217; and he calleth the name of that place &#8216;Two  Camps.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Jacob sendeth messengers before him unto Esau his  brother, towards the land of Seir, the field of Edom, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and commandeth them, saying, &#8216;Thus do ye say to my lord, to  Esau: Thus said thy servant Jacob, With Laban I have sojourned,  and I tarry until now; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and I have ox, and ass, flock, and man-servant, and  maid-servant, and I send to declare to my lord, to find grace  in his eyes.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the messengers turn back unto Jacob, saying, &#8216;We came  in unto thy brother, unto Esau, and he also is coming to meet  thee, and four hundred men with him;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and Jacob feareth exceedingly, and is distressed, and he  divideth the people who [are] with him, and the flock, and the  herd, and the camels, into two camps, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and saith, &#8216;If Esau come in unto the one camp, and have  smitten it &#8212; then the camp which is left hath been for an  escape.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And Jacob saith, &#8216;God of my father Abraham, and God of my  father Isaac, Jehovah who saith unto me, Turn back to thy land,  and to thy kindred, and I do good with thee: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>I have been unworthy of all the kind acts, and of all the  truth which Thou hast done with thy servant &#8212; for, with my  staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I have become two  camps. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8216;Deliver me, I pray Thee, from the hand of my brother,  from the hand of Esau: for I am fearing him, less he come and  have smitten me &#8212; mother beside sons; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and Thou &#8212; Thou hast said, I certainly do good with thee,  and have set thy seed as the sand of the sea, which is not  numbered because of the multitude.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And he lodgeth there during that night, and taketh from  that which is coming into his hand, a present for Esau his  brother: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>she-goats two hundred, and he-goats twenty, ewes two  hundred, and rams twenty, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>suckling camels and their young ones thirty, cows forty,  and bullocks ten, she-asses twenty, and foals ten; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and he giveth into the hand of his servants, every drove  by itself, and saith unto his servants, &#8216;Pass over before me,  and a space ye do put between drove and drove.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And he commandeth the first, saying, &#8216;When Esau my brother  meeteth thee, and hath asked thee, saying, Whose [art] thou?  and whither goest thou? and whose [are] these before thee? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>then thou hast said, Thy servant Jacob&#8217;s: it [is] a  present sent to my lord, to Esau; and lo, he also [is] behind  us.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And he commandeth also the second, also the third, also  all who are going after the droves, saying, &#8216;According to this  manner do ye speak unto Esau in your finding him, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and ye have said also, Lo, thy servant Jacob [is] behind  us;&#8217; for he said, &#8216;I pacify his face with the present which is  going before me, and afterwards I see his face; it may be he  lifteth up my face;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>and the present passeth over before his face, and he hath  lodged during that night in the camp.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jacob Wrestles with God</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And he riseth in that night, and taketh his two wives, and  his two maid-servants, and his eleven children, and passeth  over the passage of Jabbok; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>and he taketh them, and causeth them to pass over the  brook, and he causeth that which he hath to pass over.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And Jacob is left alone, and one wrestleth with him till  the ascending of the dawn; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>and he seeth that he is not able for him, and he cometh  against the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob&#8217;s  thigh is disjointed in his wrestling with him; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>and he saith, &#8216;Send me away, for the dawn hath ascended:&#8217;  and he saith, &#8216;I send thee not away, except thou hast blessed  me.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And he saith unto him, &#8216;What [is] thy name?&#8217; and he saith,  &#8216;Jacob.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And he saith, &#8216;Thy name is no more called Jacob, but  Israel; for thou hast been a prince with God and with men, and  dost prevail.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And Jacob asketh, and saith, &#8216;Declare, I pray thee, thy  name;&#8217; and he saith, &#8216;Why [is] this, thou askest for My name?&#8217;  and He blesseth him there. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And Jacob calleth the name of the place Peniel: for &#8216;I  have seen God face unto face, and my life is delivered;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>and the sun riseth on him when he hath passed over Penuel,  and he is halting on his thigh; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>therefore the sons of Israel do not eat the sinew which  shrank, which [is] on the hollow of the thigh, unto this day,  because He came against the hollow of Jacob&#8217;s thigh, against  the sinew which shrank.</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
