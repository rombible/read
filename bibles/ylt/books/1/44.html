<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and my cup, the silver cup, thou dost put in the mouth of  the bag of the young one, and his corn-money;&#8217; and he doth  according to the word of Joseph which he hath spoken. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>The morning is bright, and the men have been sent away,  they and their asses &#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>they have gone out of the city &#8212; they have not gone far  off &#8212; and Joseph hath said to him who [is] over his house,  &#8216;Rise, pursue after the men; and thou hast overtaken them, and  thou hast said unto them, Why have ye recompensed evil for  good? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Is not this that with which my lord drinketh? and he  observeth diligently with it; ye have done evil [in] that which  ye have done.&#8217;</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>lo, the money which we found in the mouth of our bags we  brought back unto thee from the land of Canaan, and how do we  steal from the house of thy lord silver or gold? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>with whomsoever of thy servants it is found, he hath died,  and we also are to my lord for servants.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And he saith, &#8216;Now, also, according to your words, so it  [is]; he with whom it is found becometh my servant, and ye are  acquitted;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and they hasten and take down each his bag to the earth,  and each openeth his bag;

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And Judah &#8212; his brethren also &#8212; cometh in unto the house  of Joseph, and he is yet there, and they fall before him to the  earth; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and Joseph saith to them, &#8216;What [is] this deed that ye  have done? have ye not known that a man like me doth diligently  observe?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And Judah saith, &#8216;What do we say to my lord? what do we  speak? and what &#8212; do we justify ourselves? God hath found out  the iniquity of thy servants; lo, we [are] servants to my lord,  both we, and he in whose hand the cup hath been found;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>and he saith, &#8216;Far be it from me to do this; the man in  whose hand the cup hath been found, he becometh my servant; and  ye, go ye up in peace unto your father.&#8217;</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>My lord hath asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father  or brother? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and we say unto my lord, We have a father, an aged one,  and a child of old age, a little one; and his brother died, and  he is left alone of his mother, and his father hath loved him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>&#8216;And thou sayest unto thy servants, Bring him down unto  me, and I set mine eye upon him; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>and we say unto my lord, The youth is not able to leave  his father, when he hath left his father, then he hath died;

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>&#8216;And it cometh to pass, that we have come up unto thy  servant my father, that we declare to him the words of my lord; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>and our father saith, Turn back, buy for us a little food, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>and we say, We are not able to go down; if our young  brother is with us, then we have gone down; for we are not able  to see the man&#8217;s face, and our young brother not with us. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>&#8216;And thy servant my father saith unto us, Ye &#8212; ye have  known that two did my wife bare to me, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>and the one goeth out from me, and I say, Surely he is  torn &#8212; torn! and I have not seen him since; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>when ye have taken also this from my presence, and  mischief hath met him, then ye have brought down my grey hairs  with evil to sheol. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>&#8216;And now, at my coming in unto thy servant my father, and  the youth not with us (and his soul is bound up in his soul),

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>for thy servant obtained the youth by surety from my  father, saying, If I bring him not in unto thee &#8212; then I have  sinned against my father all the days.
