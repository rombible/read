<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and Pharaoh is wroth against his two eunuchs, against the  chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and giveth them in charge in the house of the chief of the  executioners, unto the round-house, the place where Joseph [is]  a prisoner, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and the chief of the executioners chargeth Joseph with  them, and he serveth them; and they are days in charge. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And they dream a dream both of them, each his dream in one  night, each according to the interpretation of his dream, the  butler and the baker whom the king of Egypt hath, who [are]  prisoners in the round-house. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And Joseph cometh in unto them in the morning, and seeth  them, and lo, they [are] morose; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and he asketh Pharaoh&#8217;s eunuchs who [are] with him in  charge in the house of his lord, saying, &#8216;Wherefore [are] your  faces sad to-day?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And they say unto him, &#8216;A dream we have dreamed, and there  is no interpreter of it;&#8217; and Joseph saith unto them, &#8216;Are not  interpretations with God? recount, I pray you, to me.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And the chief of the butlers recounteth his dream to  Joseph, and saith to him, &#8216;In my dream, then lo, a vine [is]  before me! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and in the vine [are] three branches, and it [is] as it  were flourishing; gone up hath its blossom, its clusters have  ripened grapes; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and Pharaoh&#8217;s cup [is] in my hand, and I take the grapes  and press them into the cup of Pharaoh, and I give the cup into  the hand of Pharaoh.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And Joseph saith to him, &#8216;This [is] its interpretation:  the three branches are three days; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>yet, within three days doth Pharaoh lift up thy head, and  hath put thee back on thy station, and thou hast given the cup  of Pharaoh into his hand, according to the former custom when  thou wast his butler. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8216;Surely if thou hast remembered me with thee, when it is  well with thee, and hast done (I pray thee) kindness with me,  and hast made mention of me unto Pharaoh, then hast thou  brought me out from this house, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>for I was really stolen from the land of the Hebrews; and  here also have I done nothing that they have put me in the  pit.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And the chief of the bakers seeth that he hath interpreted  good, and he saith unto Joseph, &#8216;I also [am] in a dream, and  lo, three baskets of white bread [are] on my head, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>and in the uppermost basket [are] of all [kinds] of  Pharaoh&#8217;s food, work of a baker; and the birds are eating them  out of the basket, from off my head.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And Joseph answereth and saith, &#8216;This [is] its  interpretation: the three baskets are three days;
