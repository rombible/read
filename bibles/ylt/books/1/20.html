<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and Abraham saith concerning Sarah his wife, &#8216;She is my  sister;&#8217; and Abimelech king of Gerar sendeth and taketh Sarah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And God cometh in unto Abimelech in a dream of the night,  and saith to him, &#8216;Lo, thou [art] a dead man, because of the  woman whom thou hast taken &#8212; and she married to a husband.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And Abimelech hath not drawn near unto her, and he saith,  &#8216;Lord, also a righteous nation dost thou slay? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>hath not he himself said to me, She [is] my sister! and  she, even she herself, said, He [is] my brother; in the  integrity of my heart, and in the innocency of my hands, I have  done this.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And God saith unto him in the dream, &#8216;Yea, I &#8212; I have  known that in the integrity of thy heart thou hast done this,  and I withhold thee, even I, from sinning against Me, therefore  I have not suffered thee to come against her; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and now send back the man&#8217;s wife, for he [is] inspired, and  he doth pray for thee, and live thou; and if thou do not send  back, know that dying thou dost die, thou, and all that thou  hast.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Abimelech riseth early in the morning, and calleth for  all his servants, and speaketh all these words in their ears;  and the men fear exceedingly; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and Abimelech calleth for Abraham, and saith to him, &#8216;What  hast thou done to us? and what have I sinned against thee, that  thou hast brought upon me, and upon my kingdom, a great sin?  works which are not done thou hast done with me.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Abimelech also saith unto Abraham, &#8216;What hast thou seen  that thou hast done this thing?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And Abraham saith, &#8216;Because I said, &#8216;Surely the fear of  God is not in this place, and they have slain me for the sake  of my wife; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and also, truly she is my sister, daughter of my father,  only not daughter of my mother, and she becometh my wife; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>and it cometh to pass, when God hath caused me to wander  from my father&#8217;s house, that I say to her, This [is] thy  kindness which thou dost with me: at every place whither we  come, say of me, He [is] my brother.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And Abimelech taketh sheep and oxen, and servants and  handmaids, and giveth to Abraham, and sendeth back to him Sarah  his wife; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and Abimelech saith, &#8216;Lo, my land [is] before thee, where  it is good in thine eyes, dwell;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and to Sarah he hath said, &#8216;Lo, I have given a thousand  silverlings to thy brother; lo, it is to thee a covering of  eyes, to all who are with thee;&#8217; and by all this she is  reasoned with. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And Abraham prayeth unto God, and God healeth Abimelech  and his wife, and his handmaids, and they bear:
