<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>These [are] births of Jacob: Joseph, a son of seventeen  years, hath been enjoying himself with his brethren among the  flock, (and he [is] a youth,) with the sons of Bilhah, and with  the sons of Zilpah, his father&#8217;s wives, and Joseph bringeth in  an account of their evil unto their father. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Israel hath loved Joseph more than any of his sons, for  he [is] a son of his old age, and hath made for him a long  coat; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and his brethren see that their father hath loved him more  than any of his brethren, and they hate him, and have not been  able to speak [to] him peaceably.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And Joseph dreameth a dream, and declareth to his brethren,  and they add still more to hate him.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And he dreameth yet another dream, and recounteth it to his  brethren, and saith, &#8216;Lo, I have dreamed a dream again, and lo,  the sun and the moon, and eleven stars, are bowing themselves  to me.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And he recounteth unto his father, and unto his brethren;  and his father pusheth against him, and saith to him, &#8216;What  [is] this dream which thou hast dreamt? do we certainly come &#8212;  I, and thy mother, and thy brethren &#8212; to bow ourselves to  thee, to the earth?&#8217;
