<p class="hdg">Warning against False Teaching</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>according as I did exhort thee to remain in Ephesus &#8212; I  going on to Macedonia &#8212; that thou mightest charge certain not  to teach any other thing, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>nor to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, that  cause questions rather than the building up of God that is in  faith: &#8212;
