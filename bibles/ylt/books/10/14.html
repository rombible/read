<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and Joab sendeth to Tekoah, and taketh thence a wise woman,  and saith unto her, &#8216;Feign thyself a mourner, I pray thee, and  put on, I pray thee, garments of mourning, and anoint not  thyself with oil, and thou hast been as a woman these many days  mourning for the dead, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and thou hast gone unto the king, and spoken unto him,  according to this word;&#8217; and Joab putteth the words into her  mouth.</p>
