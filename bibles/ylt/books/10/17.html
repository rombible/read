<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and come upon him, and he weary and feeble-handed, and I  have caused him to tremble, and all the people have fled who  [are] with him, and I have smitten the king by himself, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and I bring back all the people unto thee &#8212; as the turning  back of the whole [is] the man whom thou art seeking &#8212; all the  people are peace. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the thing is right in the eyes of Absalom, and in the  eyes of all the elders of Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And Absalom saith, &#8216;Call, I pray thee, also for Hushai the  Archite, and we hear what [is] in his mouth &#8212; even he.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And Hushai cometh in unto Absalom, and Absalom speaketh  unto him, saying, &#8216;According to this word hath Ahithophel  spoken; do we do his word? if not, thou &#8212; speak thou.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And Hushai saith unto Absalom, &#8216;Not good [is] the counsel  that Ahithophel hath counselled at this time.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Hushai saith, &#8216;Thou hast known thy father and his men,  that they [are] heroes, and they are bitter in soul as a  bereaved bear in a field, and thy father [is] a man of war, and  doth not lodge with the people; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>lo, now, he is hidden in one of the pits, or in one of the  places, and it hath been, at the falling among them at the  commencement, that the hearer hath heard, and said, There hath  been a slaughter among the people who [are] after Absalom; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and he also, the son of valour, whose heart [is] as the  heart of the lion, doth utterly melt, for all Israel doth know  that thy father is a hero, and sons of valour [are] those with  him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8216;So that I have counselled: Let all Israel be diligently  gathered unto thee, from Dan even unto Beer-Sheba, as the sand  that [is] by the sea for multitude, and thou thyself art going  in the midst; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and we have come in unto him in one of the places where he  is found, and we [are] upon him as the dew falleth on the  ground, and there hath not been left of him and of all the men  who [are] with him even one. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And if unto a city he is gathered, then they have caused  all Israel to bear unto that city ropes, and we have drawn it  unto the brook till that there hath not been found there even a  stone.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And Absalom saith &#8212; and all the men of Israel &#8212; &#8216;Better [is]  the counsel of Hushai the Archite than the counsel of  Ahithophel;&#8217; and Jehovah willed to make void the good counsel  of Ahithophel for the sake of Jehovah&#8217;s bringing unto Absalom  the evil.</p>
