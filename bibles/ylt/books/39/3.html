<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And who is bearing the day of his coming? And who is  standing in his appearing? For he [is] as fire of a refiner,  And as soap of a fuller. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And he hath sat, a refiner and purifier of silver, And he  hath purified the sons of Levi, And hath refined them as gold  and as silver, And they have been to Jehovah bringing nigh a  present in righteousness. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And sweet to Jehovah hath been the present of Judah and  Jerusalem, As in days of old, and as in former years.</p>
