<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8216;Son of man, prophesy, and thou hast said: Thus said the  Lord Jehovah: Howl ye, ha! for the day!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For near [is] a day, near [is] a day to Jehovah! A day of  clouds, the time of nations it is.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And come in hath a sword to Egypt, And there hath been  great pain in Cush, In the falling of the wounded in Egypt, And  they have taken its store, And broken down have been its  foundations.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Cush, and Phut, and Lud, and all the mixture, and Chub, And  the sons of the land of the covenant with them by sword do  fall,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Thus said Jehovah: And &#8212; fallen have supporters of Egypt,  And come down hath the arrogance of her strength, From Migdol  to Syene, by sword they fall in her, An affirmation of the Lord  Jehovah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And they have been desolated in the midst of desolate  lands, And its cities are in the midst of wasted cities.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And they have known that I [am] Jehovah, In My giving fire  against Egypt, And broken have been all her helpers.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>In that day go forth do messengers from before Me in ships,  To trouble confident Cush, And there hath been great pain among  them, As the day of Egypt, for lo, it hath come.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Thus said the Lord Jehovah: I have caused the multitude of  Egypt to cease, By the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>He and his people with him &#8212; the terrible of nations, Are  brought in to destroy the land, And they have drawn their  swords against Egypt, And have filled the land [with] the  wounded.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And I have made floods a dry place, And I have sold the  land into the hand of evil doers, And I have made desolate the  land, And its fulness, by the hand of strangers, I, Jehovah,  have spoken.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Thus said the Lord Jehovah: And &#8212; I have destroyed idols,  And caused vain things to cease from Noph, And a prince of the  land of Egypt there is no more, And I give fear in the land of  Egypt.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And I have made Pathros desolate, And I have given fire  against Zoan, And I have done judgments in No,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And I have poured out My fury on Sin, the stronghold of  Egypt, And I have cut off the multitude of No.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And I have given fire against Egypt, Greatly pained is  Sin, and No is to be rent, And Noph hath daily distresses.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>The youths of Aven and Pi-Beseth by sword do fall, And  these into captivity do go.</p>
