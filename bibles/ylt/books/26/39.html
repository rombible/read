<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And have turned thee back, and enticed thee, And caused  thee to come up from the sides of the north, And brought thee  in against mountains of Israel, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And have smitten thy bow out of thy left hand, Yea, thine  arrows out of thy right I cause to fall. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>On mountains of Israel thou fallest, Thou, and all thy  bands, and the peoples who [are] with thee, To ravenous fowl &#8212;  a bird of every wing, And [to] a beast of the field, I have  given thee for food.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And gone out have the inhabitants of cities of Israel, And  they have burned and kindled [a fire], With armour, and shield,  and buckler, With bow, and with arrows, And with hand-staves,  and with javelins, And they have caused a fire to burn with  them seven years, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And they do not take wood out of the field, Nor do they  hew out of the forests, For with armour they cause the fire to  burn, And they have spoiled their spoilers, And they have  plundered their plunderers, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And it hath come to pass, in that day, I give to Gog a  place there &#8212; a grave in Israel, the valley of those passing  by, east of the sea, and it is stopping those passing by, and  they have buried there Gog, and all his multitude, and have  cried, O valley of the multitude of Gog! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And the house of Israel have buried them &#8212; in order to  cleanse the land &#8212; seven months.
