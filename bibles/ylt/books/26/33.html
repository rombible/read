<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8216;Son of man, speak unto the sons of thy people, and thou  hast said unto them: A land &#8212; when I bring in against it a  sword, And the people of the land have taken one man out of  their borders, And made him to them for a watchman. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And he hath seen the sword coming against the land, And  hath blown with a trumpet, and hath warned the people,

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Say unto them, I live &#8212; an affirmation of the Lord  Jehovah, I delight not in the death of the wicked, But &#8212; in  the turning of the wicked from his way, And he hath lived, Turn  back, turn back, from your evil ways, Yea, why do ye die, O  house of Israel? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And thou, son of man, say unto the sons of thy people: The  righteousness of the righteous doth not deliver him in the day  of his transgression, And the wickedness of the wicked, He doth  not stumble for it in the day of his turning from his  wickedness, And the righteous is not able to live in it in the  day of his sinning. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>In My saying of the righteous: He surely liveth, And &#8212; he  hath trusted on his righteousness, And he hath done perversity,  All his righteous acts are not remembered, And for his  perversity that he hath done, For it he doth die. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And in My saying to the wicked: Thou surely diest, And &#8212;  he hath turned back from his sin, And hath done judgment and  righteousness, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>(The pledge the wicked restoreth, plunder he repayeth,) In  the statutes of life he hath walked, So as not to do  perversity, He surely liveth &#8212; he doth not die.

<p class="hdg">Explanation of Jerusalem's Fall</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And it cometh to pass, in the twelfth year &#8212; in the tenth  [month], in the fifth of the month &#8212; of our removal, come in  unto me doth one who is escaped from Jerusalem, saying, &#8216;The  city hath been smitten.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And the hand of Jehovah hath been unto me in the evening,  before the coming in of the escaped one, and He openeth my  mouth till the coming in unto me in the morning, and opened is  my mouth, and I have not been silent again.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>&#8216;Son of man, the inhabitants of these wastes on the ground  of Israel are speaking, saying: Alone hath been Abraham &#8212; and  he possesseth the land, and we [are] many &#8212; to us hath the  land been given for a possession. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Therefore say unto them: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: With  the blood ye do eat, And your eyes ye lift up unto your idols,  And blood ye shed, and the land ye inherit! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Ye have stood on your sword, Ye have done abomination,  Each the wife of his neighbour ye have defiled, And the land ye  possess! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Thus dost thou say unto them: Thus said the Lord Jehovah:  I live &#8212; do not they who [are] in the wastes by the sword  fall? And they who [are] on the face of the field, To the beast  I have given for food, And they who are in strongholds and in  caves by pestilence die. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And I have made the land a desolation and an astonishment,  And ceased hath the excellency of its strength, And desolated  have been mountains of Israel, Without any one passing through. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And they have known that I [am] Jehovah, In My making the  land a desolation and an astonishment, For all their  abominations that they have done.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And thou, son of man, the sons of thy people who are  speaking about thee, By the walls, and in openings of the  houses, Have spoken one with another, each with his brother,  Saying: Come in, I pray you, And hear what [is] the word that  cometh out from Jehovah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And they come in unto thee as the coming in of a people,  And they sit before thee &#8212; My people, And have heard thy  words, and they do them not, For doting loves with their mouth  they are making, After their dishonest gain their heart is  going. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And lo, thou [art] to them as a singer of doting loves, A  pleasant voice, and playing well on an instrument, And they  have heard thy words, and they are not doing them.
