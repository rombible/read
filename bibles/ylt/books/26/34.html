<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8216;Son of man, prophesy concerning shepherds of Israel,  prophesy, and thou hast said unto them: To the shepherds, thus  said the Lord Jehovah: Wo [to] the shepherds of Israel, Who  have been feeding themselves! The flock do not the shepherds  feed? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>The fat ye do eat, and the wool ye put on, The fed one ye  slaughter, the flock ye feed not. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The weak ye have not strengthened, And the sick one ye have  not healed, And the broken ye have not bound up, And the driven  away have not brought back, And the lost ye have not sought,  And with might ye have ruled them and with rigour. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And they are scattered from want of a shepherd, And are for  food to every beast of the field, Yea, they are scattered. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Go astray do My flock on all the mountains, And on every  high hill, And on all the face of the land have My flock been  scattered, And there is none inquiring, and none seeking.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Therefore, shepherds, hear a word of Jehovah: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>I live &#8212; an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah, If not,  because of My flock being for a prey, Yea, My flock is for food  to every beast of the field, Because there is no shepherd, And  My shepherds have not sought My flock, And the shepherds do  feed themselves, And My flock they have not fed. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Therefore, O shepherds, hear a word of Jehovah: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I [am] against the  shepherds, And have required My flock from their hand, And  caused them to cease from feeding the flock, And no more do the  shepherds feed themselves, And I have delivered My flock from  their mouth, And they are not to them for food.</p>
