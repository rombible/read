<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8216;Son of man, What is the vine-tree more than any tree? The  vine-branch that hath been, Among trees of the forest? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Is wood taken from it to use for work? Do they take of it a  pin to hang any vessel on it? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Lo, to the fire it hath been given for fuel, Its two ends  hath the fire eaten, And its midst hath been scorched! Is it  profitable for work? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Lo, in its being perfect it is not used for work, How much  less, when fire hath eaten of it, And it is scorched, Hath it  been used yet for work? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: As the vine-tree  among trees of the forest, That I have given to the fire for  fuel, So I have given the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And I have set My face against them, From the fire they  have gone forth, And the fire doth consume them, And ye have  known that I [am] Jehovah, In My setting My face against them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And I have made the land a desolation, Because they have  committed a trespass, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah!&#8217;</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
