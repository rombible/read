<div class="chap"><p class="hdg">The Hour of Doom</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying, &#8216;And thou,  son of man, Thus said the Lord Jehovah to the ground of Israel: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>An end, come hath the end on the four corners of the land. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now [is] the end unto thee, And I have sent Mine anger upon  thee, And judged thee according to thy ways, And set against  thee all thine abominations. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And no pity on thee hath Mine eye, nor do I spare, For thy  ways against thee I do set, And thine abominations are in thy  midst, And ye have known that I [am] Jehovah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Evil, a single evil, lo, it hath  come. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>An end hath come, come hath the end, It hath waked for thee,  lo, it hath come. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Come hath the morning unto thee, O inhabitant of the land!  Come hath the time, near [is] a day of trouble, And not the  shouting of mountains. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now, shortly I pour out My fury on thee, And have completed  Mine anger against thee, And judged thee according to thy ways,  And set against thee all thine abominations. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And not pity doth Mine eye, nor do I spare, According to thy  ways unto thee I give, And thine abominations are in thy midst,  And ye have known that I [am] Jehovah the smiter.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Lo, the day, lo, it hath come, Gone forth hath the morning,  Blossomed hath the rod, flourished the pride. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>The violence hath risen to a rod of wickedness, There is  none of them, nor of their multitude, Nor of their noise, nor  is there wailing for them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Come hath the time, arrived hath the day, The buyer doth  not rejoice, And the seller doth not become a mourner, For  wrath [is] unto all its multitude. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For the seller to the sold thing turneth not, And yet among  the living [is] their life, For the vision [is] unto all its  multitude, It doth not turn back, And none by his iniquity doth  strengthen his life.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Desolation of Israel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>They have blown with a trumpet to prepare the whole, And  none is going to battle, For My wrath [is] unto all its  multitude. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The sword [is] without, And the pestilence and the famine  within, He who is in a field by sword dieth, And he who is in a  city, Famine and pestilence devour him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And escaped away have their fugitives, And they have been  on the mountains As doves of the valleys, All of them make a  noising &#8212; each for his iniquity. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>All the hands are feeble, and all knees go &#8212; waters. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And they have girded on sackcloth, And covered them hath  trembling, And unto all faces [is] shame, And on all their  heads &#8212; baldness. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Their silver into out-places they cast, And their gold  impurity becometh. Their silver and their gold is not able to  deliver them, In a day of the wrath of Jehovah, Their soul they  do not satisfy, And their bowels they do not fill, For the  stumbling-block of their iniquity it hath been.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>As to the beauty of his ornament, For excellency He set it,  And the images of their abominations, Their detestable things  &#8212; they made in it, Therefore I have given it to them for  impurity, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And I have given it into the hand of the strangers for a  prey, And to the wicked of the land for a spoil, And they have  polluted it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And I have turned My face from them, And they have polluted  My hidden place, Yea, come into it have destroyers, and  polluted it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Make the chain; for the land Hath been full of bloody  judgments, And the city hath been full of violence. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And I have brought in the wicked of the nations, And they  have possessed their houses, And I have caused to cease the  excellency of the strong, And polluted have been those  sanctifying them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Destruction hath come, And they have sought peace, and  there is none. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Mischief on mischief cometh, and report is on report, And  they have sought a vision from a prophet, And law doth perish  from the priest, And counsel from the elders, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>The king doth become a mourner, And a prince putteth on  desolation, And the hands of the people of the land are  troubled, From their own way I deal with them, And with their  own judgments I judge them, And they have known that I [am]  Jehovah!&#8217;</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
