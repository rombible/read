<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8216;Son of man, lift up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of  Egypt, and thou hast said unto him: A young lion of nations  thou hast been like, And thou [art] as a dragon in the seas,  And thou comest forth with thy flowings, And dost trouble the  waters with thy feet, And thou dost foul their flowings.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Thus said the Lord Jehovah: And &#8212; I have spread out for  thee My net, With an assembly of many peoples, And they have  brought thee up in My net.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And I have left thee in the land, On the face of the field  I do cast thee out, And have caused to dwell upon thee every  fowl of the heavens, And have satisfied out of thee the beasts  of the whole earth.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>All luminaries of light in the heavens, I make black over  thee, And I have given darkness over thy land, An affirmation  of the Lord Jehovah,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And I have vexed the heart of many peoples, In My bringing  in thy destruction among nations, Unto lands that thou hast not  known. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And I have made many peoples astonished at thee, And their  kings are afraid at thee with trembling, In My brandishing My  sword before their faces, And they have trembled every moment,  Each for his life &#8212; in the day of thy fall.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For thus said the Lord Jehovah: A sword of the king of  Babylon entereth thee,</p>
