<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and He causeth me to pass over by them, all round about,  and lo, very many [are] on the face of the valley, and lo, very  dry. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And He saith unto me, &#8216;Son of man, do these bones live?&#8217;  And I say, &#8216;O Lord Jehovah, Thou &#8212; Thou hast known.&#8217;
