<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8216;Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy  against it,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and thou hast said to it: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I  [am] against thee, O mount Seir, And have stretched out My hand  against thee, And made thee a desolation and an astonishment.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Thy cities a waste I make, and thou art a desolation, And  thou hast known that I [am] Jehovah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Because of thy having an enmity age-during, And thou dost  saw the sons of Israel, By the hands of the sword, In the time  of their calamity, In the time of the iniquity of the end: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Therefore, I live &#8212; an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah,  Surely for blood I do appoint thee, And blood doth pursue thee,  If blood thou hast not hated, Blood also doth pursue thee. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And I have given mount Seir for a desolation and an  astonishment, And have cut off from it him who is passing over  and him who is returning, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And filled his mountains with his wounded, Thy hills, and  thy valleys, and all thy streams, The pierced of the sword fall  into them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Desolations age-during I make thee, And thy cities do not  return, And ye have known that I [am] Jehovah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Because of thy saying: The two nations and the two lands  are mine, and we have possessed it, And Jehovah hath been there; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Therefore, I live &#8212; an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah,  And I have done according to thine anger, And according to  thine envy, With which thou hast wrought, Because of thy hatred  against them, And I have been known among them when I judge  thee. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And thou hast known that I &#8212; Jehovah, I have heard all  thy despisings that thou hast spoken Against mountains of  Israel, saying: A desolation, to us they were given for food. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And ye magnify yourselves against Me with your mouth, And  have made abundant against Me your words, I &#8212; I have heard. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Thus said the Lord Jehovah: According to the rejoicing of  the whole land, A desolation I make of thee. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>According to thy joy at the inheritance of the house of  Israel because of desolation, So I do to thee &#8212; a desolation  thou art, O mount Seir, and all Edom &#8212; all of it, And they  have known that I [am] Jehovah!</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
