<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and come in hath the prince the way of the porch of the  gate at the outside, and he hath stood by the post of the gate,  and the priests have made his burnt-offering, and his  peace-offerings, and he hath bowed himself by the opening of  the gate, and hath gone forth, and the gate is not shut till  the evening. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And bowed themselves have the people of the land at the  opening of that gate, on sabbaths, and on new moons, before  Jehovah.

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And when the prince maketh a free-will burnt-offering, or  free-will peace-offerings, to Jehovah, then he hath opened for  himself the gate that is looking eastward, and he hath made his  burnt-offering and his peace-offerings as he doth in the day of  rest, and he hath gone out, and he hath shut the gate after his  going out.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8216;And a lamb, son of a year, a perfect one, thou dost make  a burnt-offering daily to Jehovah; morning by morning thou dost  make it.
