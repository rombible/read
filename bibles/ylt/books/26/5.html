<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>A third part with fire thou dost burn in the midst of the  city, at the fulness of the days of the siege; and thou hast  taken the third part, thou dost smite with a weapon round about  it; and the third part thou dost scatter to the wind, and a  weapon I draw out after them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And thou hast taken thence a few in number &#8212; and hast bound  them in thy skirts; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and of them thou dost take again, and hast cast them unto  the midst of the fire, and hast burned them in the fire &#8212; out  of it cometh forth a fire unto all the house of Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Thus said the Lord Jehovah: this [is] Jerusalem, In the  midst of the nations I have set her, And round about her [are]  the lands. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And she changeth My judgments into wickedness more than the  nations, And My statutes more than the lands that [are] round  about her, For against My judgments they have kicked, And My  statutes &#8212; they have not walked in them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of your  multiplying above the nations that [are] around you, In My  statutes ye have not walked, And My judgments ye have not done,  According to the judgments of the nations That [are] round about  you ye have not done. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I [am] against  thee, even I, And I have done in thy midst judgments, Before  the eyes of the nations. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And I have done in thee that which I have not done, And that  which I do not its like again, Because of all thine  abominations. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Therefore fathers do eat sons in thy midst, And sons eat  their fathers, And I have done in thee judgments, And have  scattered all thy remnant to every wind. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Therefore, I live &#8212; an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah:  Because My sanctuary thou hast defiled, With all thy detestable  things, And with all thine abominations, Mine eye pitieth not,  and I also spare not. Do not even I also diminish?</p>
<p class="hdg">Famine, Sword, and Dispersion</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Thy third part &#8212; by pestilence they die, And by famine are  consumed in thy midst, And the third part, by sword they fall  round about thee, And the third part, to every wind I scatter,  And a sword I draw out after them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And completed hath been Mine anger, And I have caused My  fury to rest on them, And I have been comforted, And they have  known that I, Jehovah, have spoken in My zeal, In My completing  My fury on them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And I give thee for a waste, And for a reproach among  nations that [are] round about thee, Before the eyes of every  passer by. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And it hath been a reproach and a reviling, An instruction  and an astonishment, To nations that [are] round about thee, In  My doing in thee judgments, In anger and fury, and in furious  reproofs, I, Jehovah, have spoken. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>In My sending the evil arrows of famine among them, That  have been for destruction, That I send to destroy you, And  famine I am adding upon you, And I have broken to you the staff  of bread. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And I have sent on you famine and evil beasts, And they  have bereaved thee, And pestilence and blood pass over on thee,  And a sword I do bring in against thee, I, Jehovah, have  spoken!&#8217;</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
