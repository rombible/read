<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and he who is entering through the door is shepherd of the  sheep; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>to this one the doorkeeper doth open, and the sheep hear  his voice, and his own sheep he doth call by name, and doth  lead them forth;

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>This similitude spake Jesus to them, and they knew not what  the things were that he was speaking to them;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Jesus said therefore again to them, &#8216;Verily, verily, I say  to you &#8212; I am the door of the sheep; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>all, as many as came before me, are thieves and robbers,  but the sheep did not hear them; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>I am the door, through me if any one may come in, he shall  be saved, and he shall come in, and go out, and find pasture. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8216;The thief doth not come, except that he may steal, and  kill, and destroy; I came that they may have life, and may have  [it] abundantly.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8216;I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd his life layeth  down for the sheep; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and the hireling, and not being a shepherd, whose own the  sheep are not, doth behold the wolf coming, and doth leave the  sheep, and doth flee; and the wolf catcheth them, and  scattereth the sheep; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>and the hireling doth flee because he is an hireling, and  is not caring for the sheep. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8216;I am the good shepherd, and I know my [sheep], and am  known by mine, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>according as the Father doth know me, and I know the  Father, and my life I lay down for the sheep, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and other sheep I have that are not of this fold, these  also it behoveth me to bring, and my voice they will hear, and  there shall become one flock &#8212; one shepherd. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8216;Because of this doth the Father love me, because I lay  down my life, that again I may take it;

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Therefore, again, there came a division among the Jews,  because of these words, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and many of them said, &#8216;He hath a demon, and is mad, why  do ye hear him?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>others said, &#8216;These sayings are not those of a demoniac;  is a demon able blind men&#8217;s eyes to open?&#8217;</p>
<p class="hdg">The Unbelief of the Jews</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And the dedication in Jerusalem came, and it was winter, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the porch of  Solomon, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>the Jews, therefore, came round about him, and said to  him, &#8216;Till when our soul dost thou hold in suspense? if thou  art the Christ, tell us freely.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Jesus answered them, &#8216;I told you, and ye do not believe;  the works that I do in the name of my Father, these testify  concerning me; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>but ye do not believe, for ye are not of my sheep, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>according as I said to you: My sheep my voice do hear, and  I know them, and they follow me, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>and life age-during I give to them, and they shall not  perish &#8212; to the age, and no one shall pluck them out of my  hand; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>my Father, who hath given to me, is greater than all, and  no one is able to pluck out of the hand of my Father;

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Therefore, again, did the Jews take up stones that they  may stone him; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Jesus answered them, &#8216;Many good works did I shew you from  my Father; because of which work of them do ye stone me?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>The Jews answered him, saying, &#8216;For a good work we do not  stone thee, but for evil speaking, and because thou, being a  man, dost make thyself God.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Jesus answered them, &#8216;Is it not having been written in  your law: I said, ye are gods? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>if them he did call gods unto whom the word of God came,  (and the Writing is not able to be broken,) 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>of him whom the Father did sanctify, and send to the  world, do ye say &#8212; Thou speakest evil, because I said, Son of  God I am? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>if I do not the works of my Father, do not believe me;

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>Therefore were they seeking again to seize him, and he  went forth out of their hand,</p>
<p class="hdg">Many across the Jordan Believe</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>and went away again to the other side of the Jordan, to  the place where John was at first baptizing, and remained  there,
