<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And as the director of the apartment tasted the water become  wine, and knew not whence it is, (but the ministrants knew, who  have drawn the water,) the director of the feast doth call the  bridegroom, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and saith to him, &#8216;Every man, at first, the good wine doth  set forth; and when they may have drunk freely, then the  inferior; thou didst keep the good wine till now.&#8217;

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And the passover of the Jews was nigh, and Jesus went up to  Jerusalem, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and he found in the temple those selling oxen, and sheep,  and doves, and the money-changers sitting, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and having made a whip of small cords, he put all forth out  of the temple, also the sheep, and the oxen; and of the  money-changers he poured out the coins, and the tables he  overthrew,
