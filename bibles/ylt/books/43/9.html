<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and his disciples asked him, saying, &#8216;Rabbi, who did sin,  this one or his parents, that he should be born blind?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Jesus answered, &#8216;Neither did this one sin nor his parents,  but that the works of God may be manifested in him; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>it behoveth me to be working the works of Him who sent me  while it is day; night doth come, when no one is able to work:  &#8212;

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>These things saying, he spat on the ground, and made clay of  the spittle, and rubbed the clay on the eyes of the blind man,  and said to him,

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>the neighbours, therefore, and those seeing him before, that  he was blind, said, &#8216;Is not this he who is sitting and  begging?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>others said &#8212; &#8216;This is he;&#8217; and others &#8212; &#8216;He is like to  him;&#8217; he himself said, &#8212; &#8216;I am [he].&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>They said, therefore, to him, &#8216;How were thine eyes opened?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>he answered and said, &#8216;A man called Jesus made clay, and  rubbed my eyes, and said to me, Go away to the pool of Siloam,  and wash; and having gone away and having washed, I received  sight;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>they said, therefore, to him, &#8216;Where is that one?&#8217; he  saith, &#8216;I have not known.&#8217;</p>
<p class="hdg">The Pharisees Investigate</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>They bring him to the Pharisees who once [was] blind, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and it was a sabbath when Jesus made the clay, and opened  his eyes. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Again, therefore, the Pharisees also were asking him how he  received sight, and he said to them, &#8216;Clay he did put upon my  eyes, and I did wash &#8212; and I see.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Of the Pharisees, therefore, certain said, &#8216;This man is not  from God, because the sabbath he doth not keep;&#8217; others said,  &#8216;How is a man &#8212; a sinful one &#8212; able to do such signs?&#8217; and  there was a division among them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>They said to the blind man again, &#8216;Thou &#8212; what dost thou  say of him &#8212; that he opened thine eyes?&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and he said &#8212; &#8216;He is a prophet.&#8217; The Jews, therefore, did  not believe concerning him that he was blind and did receive  sight, till that they called the parents of him who received  sight, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>and they asked them, saying, &#8216;Is your son, of whom ye say  that he was born blind? how then now doth he see?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>His parents answered them and said, &#8216;We have known that  this is our son, and that he was born blind; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>and how he now seeth, we have not known; or who opened his  eyes, we have not known; himself is of age, ask him; he  himself shall speak concerning himself.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>These things said his parents, because they were afraid of  the Jews, for already had the Jews agreed together, that if  any one may confess him &#8212; Christ, he may be put out of the  synagogue; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>because of this his parents said &#8212; &#8216;He is of age, ask  him.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>They called, therefore, a second time the man who was  blind, and they said to him, &#8216;Give glory to God, we have known  that this man is a sinner;&#8217;

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And they said to him again, &#8216;What did he to thee? how did  he open thine eyes?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>He answered them, &#8216;I told you already, and ye did not hear;  why again do ye wish to hear? do ye also wish to become his  disciples?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>They reviled him, therefore, and said, &#8216;Thou art his  disciple, and we are Moses&#8217; disciples;

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>and we have known that God doth not hear sinners, but, if  any one may be a worshipper of God, and may do His will, him  He doth hear; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>from the age it was not heard, that any one did open eyes  of one who hath been born blind;

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>They answered and said to him, &#8216;In sins thou wast born  altogether, and thou dost teach us!&#8217; and they cast him forth  without.</p>
