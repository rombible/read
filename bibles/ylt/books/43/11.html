<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and it was Mary who did anoint the Lord with ointment, and  did wipe his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was  ailing &#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>therefore sent the sisters unto him, saying, &#8216;Sir, lo, he  whom thou dost love is ailing;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and Jesus having heard, said, &#8216;This ailment is not unto  death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be  glorified through it.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And Jesus was loving Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>when, therefore, he heard that he is ailing, then indeed he  remained in the place in which he was two days, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>then after this, he saith to the disciples, &#8216;We may go to  Judea again;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>the disciples say to him, &#8216;Rabbi, now were the Jews seeking  to stone thee, and again thou dost go thither!&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Jesus answered, &#8216;Are there not twelve hours in the day? if  any one may walk in the day, he doth not stumble, because the  light of this world he doth see; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and if any one may walk in the night, he stumbleth,  because the light is not in him.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>These things he said, and after this he saith to them,  &#8216;Lazarus our friend hath fallen asleep, but I go on that I may  awake him;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>therefore said his disciples, &#8216;Sir, if he hath fallen  asleep, he will be saved;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>but Jesus had spoken about his death, but they thought  that about the repose of sleep he speaketh. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then, therefore, Jesus said to them freely, &#8216;Lazarus hath  died; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and I rejoice, for your sake, (that ye may believe,) that  I was not there; but we may go to him;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>therefore said Thomas, who is called Didymus, to the  fellow-disciples, &#8216;We may go &#8212; we also, that we may die with  him,&#8217;</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Mary, therefore, when she came where Jesus was, having  seen him, fell at his feet, saying to him, &#8216;Sir, if thou hadst  been here, my brother had not died;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Jesus, therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews  who came with her weeping, did groan in the spirit, and  troubled himself, and he said,
