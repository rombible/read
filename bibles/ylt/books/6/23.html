<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and Joshua calleth for all Israel, for its elders, and for  its heads, and for its judges, and for its authorities, and  saith unto them, &#8216;I have become old; I have entered into days; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and ye &#8212; ye have seen all that Jehovah your God hath done  to all these nations because of you, for Jehovah your God [is]  He who is fighting for you; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>see, I have caused to fall to you these nations who are  left for an inheritance to your tribes, from the Jordan, (and  all the nations which I cut off), and the great sea, the going  in of the sun. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8216;As to Jehovah your God, He doth thrust them from your  presence, and hath dispossessed them from before you, and ye  have possessed their land, as Jehovah your God hath spoken to  you, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and ye have been very strong to keep and to do the whole that  is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, so as not to turn  aside from it right or left, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>so as not to go in among these nations, these who are left  with you; and of the name of their gods ye do not make mention,  nor do ye swear, nor do ye serve them, nor do ye bow yourselves  to them; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>but to Jehovah your God ye do cleave, as ye have done till  this day. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And Jehovah is dispossessing from before you nations great  and mighty; as for you, none hath stood in your presence till  this day; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>one man of you doth pursue a thousand, for Jehovah your  God [is] He who is fighting for you, as He hath spoken to you; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and ye have been very watchful for yourselves to love  Jehovah your God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8216;But &#8212; if ye at all turn back and have cleaved to the  remnant of these nations, these who are left with you, and  intermarried with them, and gone in to them, and they to you, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>know certainly that Jehovah your God is not continuing to  dispossess these nations from before you, and they have been to  you for a gin, and for a snare, and for a scourge, in your  sides, and for thorns in your eyes, till ye perish from off  this good ground which Jehovah your God hath given to you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8216;And lo, I am going, to-day, in the way of all the earth,  and ye have known &#8212; with all your heart, and with all your  soul &#8212; that there hath not fallen one thing of all the good  things which Jehovah your God hath spoken concerning you; the  whole have come to you; there hath not failed of it one thing. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8216;And it hath been, as there hath come upon you all the  good thing which Jehovah your God hath spoken unto you, so doth  Jehovah bring upon you the whole of the evil thing, till His  destroying you from off this good ground which Jehovah your God  hath given to you; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>in your transgressing the covenant of Jehovah your God  which He commanded you, and ye have gone and served other gods,  and bowed yourselves to them, then hath the anger of Jehovah  burned against you, and ye have perished hastily from off the  good land which He hath given to you.&#8217;</p></div></div><div id="botbox">
