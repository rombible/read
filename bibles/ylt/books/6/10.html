<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>that they are greatly afraid, because Gibeon [is] a great  city, as one of the royal cities, and because it [is] greater  than Ai, and all its men &#8212; heroes. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sendeth unto Hoham king  of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king  of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And five kings of the Amorite (the king of Jerusalem, the  king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the  king of Eglon) are gathered together, and go up, they and all  their camps, and encamp against Gibeon, and fight against it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the men of Gibeon send unto Joshua, unto the camp at  Gilgal, saying, &#8216;Let not thy hand cease from thy servants; come  up unto us [with] haste, and give safety to us, and help us;  for all the kings of the Amorite, dwelling in the hill-country,  have been assembled against us.&#8217;
