<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>a son of forty years [am] I in Moses, servant of Jehovah,  sending me from Kadesh-Barnea, to spy the land, and I bring him  back word as with my heart; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and my brethren who have gone up with me have caused the  heart of the people to melt, and I have been fully after  Jehovah my God; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and Moses sweareth in that day, saying, If not &#8212; the land  on which thy foot hath trodden, to thee it is for inheritance,  and to thy sons &#8212; to the age, for thou hast been fully after  Jehovah my God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8216;And, now, lo, Jehovah hath kept me alive, as He hath  spoken, these forty and five years, since Jehovah spake this  word unto Moses, when Israel went in the wilderness; and now,  lo, I [am] to-day a son of five and eighty years; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>yet [am] I to-day strong as in the day of Moses&#8217; sending  me; as my power then, so [is] my power now, for battle, and to  go out, and to come in. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8216;And now, give to me this hill-country, of which Jehovah  spake in that day, for thou didst hear in that day, for Anakim  [are] there, and cities, great, fenced; if so be Jehovah [is]  with me, then I have dispossessed them, as Jehovah hath  spoken.&#8217;</p>
