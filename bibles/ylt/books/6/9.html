<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>that they gather themselves together to fight with Joshua,  and with Israel &#8212; one mouth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the inhabitants of Gibeon have heard that which Joshua  hath done to Jericho and to Ai, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and they work, even they, with subtilty, and go, and feign  to be ambassadors, and take old sacks for their asses, and  wine-bottles, old, and rent, and bound up,

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and the men of Israel say unto the Hivite, &#8216;It may be in our  midst ye are dwelling, and how do we make with thee a  covenant?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and they say unto Joshua, &#8216;Thy servants we [are].&#8217; And  Joshua saith unto them, &#8216;Who [are] ye? and whence come ye?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And they say unto him, &#8216;From a land very far off have thy  servants come, for the name of Jehovah thy God, for we have  heard His fame, and all that He hath done in Egypt,

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8216;And our elders, and all the inhabitants of our land speak  unto us, saying, Take in your hand provision for the way, and  go to meet them, and ye have said unto them, Your servants we  [are], and now, make with us a covenant; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>this our bread &#8212; hot we provided ourselves with it out of  our houses, on the day of our coming out to go unto you, and  now, lo, it is dry, and hath been crumbs;

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And all the princes say unto all the company, &#8216;We &#8212; we  have sworn to them by Jehovah, God of Israel; and now, we are  not able to come against them;
