<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8216;Take for you out of the people twelve men, one man &#8212; one  man out of a tribe; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and command ye them, saying, Take up for you from this  [place], from the midst of the Jordan, from the established  standing-place of the feet of the priests, twelve stones, and  ye have removed them over with you, and placed them in the  lodging-place in which ye lodge to-night.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And Joshua calleth unto the twelve men whom he prepared out  of the sons of Israel, one man &#8212; one man out of a tribe; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and Joshua saith to them, &#8216;Pass over before the ark of  Jehovah your God unto the midst of the Jordan and lift up for  you each, one stone on his shoulder, according to the number of  the tribes of the sons of Israel, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>so that this is a sign in your midst, when your children ask  hereafter, saying, What [are] these stones to you? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>that ye have said to them, Because the waters of the Jordan  were cut off, at the presence of the ark of the covenant of  Jehovah; in its passing over into the Jordan were the waters  of the Jordan cut off; and these stones have been for a  memorial to the sons of Israel &#8212; to the age.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the sons of Israel do so as Joshua commanded, and take  up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as Jehovah  hath spoken unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes  of the sons of Israel, and remove them over with them unto the  lodging-place, and place them there, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>even the twelve stones hath Joshua raised up out of the  midst of the Jordan, the place of the standing of the feet of  the priests bearing the ark of the covenant, and they are there  unto this day. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the priests bearing the ark are standing in the midst  of the Jordan till the completion of the whole thing which  Jehovah commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to  all that Moses commanded Joshua, and the people haste and pass  over. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And it cometh to pass when all the people have completed to  pass over, that the ark of Jehovah passeth over, and the  priests, in the presence of the people; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half  of the tribe of Manasseh, pass over, by fifties, before the  sons of Israel, as Moses had spoken unto them; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>about forty thousand, armed ones of the host, passed over  before Jehovah for battle, unto the plains of Jericho.</p>

<p class="hdg">The Camp at Gilgal</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And the people have come up out of the Jordan on the tenth  of the first month, and encamp in Gilgal, in the extremity east  of Jericho;
