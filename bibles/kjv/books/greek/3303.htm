Owing to this its original meaning it adds a certain force to the terms and phrases with which it is connected, and thus contrasts them with or distinguishes them from others. Accordingly, it takes on the character of a concessive and very often of a merely distinctive particle, which stands related to a following <span class="greek2">δέ</span> or other adversative conjunction, either expressed or understood, and in a sentence composed of several members is so placed as to point out the first member, to which a second, marked by an adversative particle, is added or opposed. It corresponds to the Latin<span class="latin">quidem</span>, <span class="accented">indeed,</span> German <span class="foreign">zwar</span> (i. e. properly,<span class="latin">zu Wahre</span>, i. e. in Wahrheit (in truth)); but often its force cannot be reproduced. Its use in classic Greek is exhibited by Devarius i., p. 122ff, and Klotz on the same ii. 2, p. 656ff; Viger i., p. 531ff, and Hermann on the same, p. 824f; others; <span class="abbreviation">Matthiae</span>, § 622; Kühner, ii., p. 806ff, § 527ff; p. 691ff; § 503; (<span class="abbreviation">Jelf</span>, § 729, 1, 2; § 764ff); <span class="abbreviation">Passow</span>, and <span class="abbreviation">Pape</span> (and Liddell and Scott), under the word. <p><span class="lexheading">I.</span> Examples in which the particle <span class="greek2">μέν</span> is followed in another member by an adversative particle expressed.
