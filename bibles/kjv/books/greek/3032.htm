Some suppose these libertini (<span class="abbreviation">A. V.</span> <span class="accented">Libertines</span>) to have been manumitted Roman slaves, who having embraced Judaism had their synagogue at Jerusalem; and they gather as much from <span class="abbreviation">Tacitus</span>, Ann. 2, 85, where it is related that four thousand libertini, infected with the Jewish superstition, were sent into Sardinia. Others, owing to the names <span class="greek2">Κυρηναίων</span> <span class="greek2">καί</span> <span class="greek2">Ἀλλεξανδρεων</span> that follow, think that a geographical meaning is demanded for <span class="greek2">Λιβερτινοι</span>, and suppose that Jews are spoken of, the dwellers in Libertum, a city or region of proconsular Africa. But the existence of a city or region called Libertum is a conjecture which has nothing to rest on but the mention of a bishop with the prefix <span class="accented">libertinensis</span> at the synod of Carthage <DATE_RANGE:411><span class="date">A.D. 411</span>. Others with far greater probability appeal to <span class="abbreviation">Philo</span>, leg. ad Gaium § 23, and understand the word as denoting Jews who had been made captives by the Romans under Pompey but were afterward set free; and who, although they had fixed their abode at Rome, had built at their own expense a synagogue at Jerusalem which they frequented when in that city. The name <span class="accented">Libertines</span> adhered to them to distinguish them from the free-born Jews who had subsequently taken up their residence at Rome. Cf. <span class="abbreviation">Winer</span>s RWB under the word Libertiner; Hausrath in <span class="abbreviation">Schenkel</span> iv., 38f; (<span class="abbreviation">B. D.</span> under the word <REFERENCE_WORK:Smith's Bible Dictionary><TOPIC:Libertines>. Evidence seems to have been discovered of the existence of a <span class="accented">synagogue of the libertines</span> at Pompeii; cf. De Rossi, Bullet. di Arch.
