Biblical Wissensch. viii., p. 255f; Bädeker, Palestine, pp. 328, 337; (Lieut. Conder in the Palest. Explor.

The name does not seem to differ from <span class="hebrew">סוכר</span>, a place mentioned by the Talmudists in <span class="hebrew">סוכר</span> <span class="hebrew">עין</span> 'the fountain Sucar' and <span class="hebrew">סוכר</span> <span class="hebrew">עין</span> <span class="hebrew">בקעת</span> 'the valley of the fountain Sucar'; cf. Delitzsch in the Zeitschr. f. d. luth. Theol. for 1856, p. 240ff Most interpreters, however, think that <span class="greek2">Συχάρ</span> is the same as <span class="greek2">Συχέμ</span> (which see 2), and explain the form as due to a softening of the harsh vulgar pronunciation (cf. Credner; Einl. in d. N. T. vol. i., p. 264f), or conjecture that it was fabricated by way of reproach by those who wished to suggest the noun <span class="hebrew">שֶׁקֶר</span>, 'falsehood', and thereby brand the city as given up to idolatry (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/habakkuk/2-18.htm">Habakkuk 2:18</a>), or the word <span class="hebrew">שִׁכֹּר</span>, 'drunken' (on account of <a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/isaiah/28-1.htm">Isaiah 28:1</a>), and thus call it the abode of <span class="greek2">μωροί</span>, see Sir. 50:26, where the Shechemites are called <span class="greek2">λαός</span> <span class="greek2">μωρός</span>; cf. <span class="abbreviation">Test xii.

To these latter opinions there is this objection, among others, that the place mentioned by the Evangelist was very near Jacob's well, from which Shechem, or Flavia Neapolis, was distant about a mile and a half.
