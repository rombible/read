This opinion is opposed by the circumstance that John is not accustomed to add a Greek interpretation except to the Hebrew names of fixed Jewish localities, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/john/5-2.htm">John 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/john/9-7.htm">John 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/john/19-17.htm">John 19:17</a>; and that this is so in the present case is evident from the fact that he has said <span class="greek2">εἰς</span> <span class="greek2">τόπον</span>, i. e. in a definite locality which had that name. Besides, it cannot be proved that that custom of the military commanders was followed also by the governors of provinces residing in cities. Doubtless the Chaldaic name was given to the spot from its shape, the Greek name from the nature of its pavement.
