Now since by a new affirmation not infrequently the reason and nature of something previously mentioned are set forth, it comes to pass that, by the use of this particle, either the reason and cause of a foregoing statement is added, whence arises the causal or argumentative force of the particle, for (Latin<span class="latin">nam</span>,<span class="latin">enim</span>; German <span class="foreign">denn</span>); or some previous declaration is explained, whence <span class="greek2">γάρ</span> takes on an explicative force: <span class="accented">for, the fact is, namely</span> (Latin<span class="latin">videlicet</span>, German <span class="foreign">nämlich</span>). Thus the force of the particle is either conclusive, or demonstrative, or explicative and declaratory; cf. Rost in <span class="abbreviation">Passow</span>'s Lexicon, i., p. 535ff; Kühner, ii., pp. 724ff, 852ff; (cf. Liddell and Scott, under the word). The use of the particle in the N.

The particle is everywhere used in reference to something expressly stated.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/romans/8-18.htm">Romans 8:18</a> some have supplied 'do not shrink from this suffering with Christ'; but on the use of <span class="greek2">γάρ</span> here, see III. <p><span class="emphasized">a.</span> below.
