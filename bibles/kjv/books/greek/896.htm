This was the name of the supreme heavenly divinity worshipped by the Shemitic nations (the Phoenicians, Canaanites, Babylonians, Assyrians), often also by the Israelites themselves, and represented by the Sun: <span class="greek2">τῇ</span> <span class="greek2">Βάαλ</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/romans/11-4.htm">Romans 11:4</a>. Cf. <span class="abbreviation">Winer</span>s RWB (and <span class="abbreviation">BB. DD.</span>) under the word and J. G. Müller in <span class="abbreviation">Herzog</span> i., p. 637ff; Merx in <span class="abbreviation">Schenkel</span> i., 322ff; Schlottmann in <span class="abbreviation">Riehm</span>, p. 126f. Since in this form the supreme power of nature generating all things, and consequently a male deity, was worshipped, with which the female deity Astarte was associated, it is hard to explain why the <span class="manuref">Sept.</span> in some places say <span class="greek2">ὁ</span> <span class="greek2">Βάαλ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/numbers/22-41.htm">Numbers 22:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/judges/2-13.htm">Judges 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/1_kings/16-1.htm">1 Kings 16:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>, etc.), in others <span class="greek2">ἡ</span> <span class="greek2">Βάαλ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/hosea/2-8.htm">Hosea 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/1_samuel/7-4.htm">1 Samuel 7:4</a>, etc. (yet see Dillmann, as below, p. 617)). Among the various conjectures on tiffs subject the easiest is this: that the <span class="manuref">Sept.</span> called the deity <span class="greek2">ἡ</span> <span class="greek2">Βάαλ</span> in derision, as weak and impotent, just as the Arabs call idols goddesses and the rabbis <span class="hebrew">אֱלֹהות</span>; so Gesenius in Rosenmüller's Repert. i., p. 139 and Tholuck on Romans, the passage cited; (yet cf. Dillmann, as below, p. 602; for other opinions and references see Meyer at the passage; cf. <span class="abbreviation">Winer</span>'s Grammar, § 27, 6 N. 1. But Prof. Dillmann shows (in the Monatsbericht d. Akad. zu Berlin, 16 Juni 1881, p. 601ff), that the Jews (just as they abstained from pronouncing the word Jehovah) avoided uttering the abhorred name of <span class="greek2">Βάαλ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/exodus/23-13.htm">Exodus 23:13</a>). As a substitute in Aramaic they read <span class="aramaic">טעות</span>, <span class="aramaic">דחלא</span> or <span class="aramaic">פתכרא</span>, and in Greek <span class="greek2">αἰσχύνη</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/1_kings/18-19.htm">1 Kings 18:19, 25</a>). This substitute in Greek was suggested by the use of the feminine article. Hence, we find in the <span class="manuref">Sept.</span>, <span class="greek2">ἡ</span> <span class="greek2">Βάαλ</span> everywhere in the prophetic books Jeremiah, Zephaniah, Hosea, etc., while in the Pentateuch it does not prevail, nor even in Judges, Samuel, Kings (except <a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/1_samuel/7-4.htm">1 Samuel 7:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>). It disappears, too (when the worship of Baal had died out) in the later versions of <span class="manuref">Aq.</span>, <span class="manuref">Symm.</span>, etc. The apostle's use in Romans, the passage cited accords with the sacred custom; cf. the substitution of the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">בֹּשֶׁת</span> in Ish-bosheth, Mephi-bosheth, etc. <a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/2_samuel/4-4.htm">2 Samuel 4:4</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/1_chronicles/8-33.htm">1 Chronicles 8:33, 34</a>, also <a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/2_samuel/11-21.htm">2 Samuel 11:21</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/judges/6-32.htm">Judges 6:32</a>; etc.)<FOOTNOTE:1>   <br><br><div class="vheading2">Strong's Exhaustive Concordance</div>Baal. <p>Of Hebrew origin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/1168.htm">Ba'al</a>); Baal, a Phoenician deity (used as a symbol of idolatry) -- Baal. <p>see HEBREW <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/1168.htm">Ba'al</a> <div class="vheading2">Forms and Transliterations</div>Βααλ Βάαλ βααλτάμ Baal Báal<div class="vheading2">Links</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/matthew/1-1.htm">Interlinear Greek</a> • <a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/1-1.htm">Interlinear Hebrew</a> • <a href="https://biblehub.com/strongs.htm">Strong's Numbers</a> • <a href="https://biblehub.com/englishmans_greek.htm">Englishman's Greek Concordance</a> • <a href="https://biblehub.com/englishmans_hebrew.htm">Englishman's Hebrew Concordance</a> • <a href="https://biblehub.com/texts/matthew/1-1.htm">Parallel Texts</a></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Englishman's Concordance</div><b><a href="https://biblehub.com/text/romans/11-4.htm" title="Biblos Lexicon">Romans 11:4</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/abbrev.htm" title="Noun">N</a></b><br><a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/romans/11.htm" title="Greek">GRK:</a> <span class="greek3">γόνυ τῇ <b>Βάαλ</b> </span><br><a href="http://biblehub.com/nas/romans/11.htm" title="New American Standard Bible">NAS:</a>  HAVE NOT BOWED THE KNEE <span class="itali">TO BAAL.</span><br><a href="https://biblehub.com/kjvs/romans/11.htm" title="King James Bible with Strong's">KJV:</a>  bowed the knee <span class="itali">to [the image of] Baal.</span><br><a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/romans/11-4.htm" title="Biblos Interlinear Bible">INT:</a> a knee <span class="itali">to Baal</span><p><b><a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/896.htm">Strong's Greek 896</a><br><a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/strongs_896.htm">1 Occurrence</a></b><br><br><a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/baal_896.htm">Βάαλ &#8212; 1 Occ.</a><br><br><br /></body></html>
