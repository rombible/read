Among the regions assigned by the emperors Caligula and Claudius to Herod Agrippa I. and Herod Agrippa II., <span class="abbreviation">Josephus</span> mentions <span class="greek2">ἡ</span> <span class="greek2">Λυσανίου</span> <span class="greek2">τετραρχία</span> (Antiquities 18, 6, 10, cf. 20, 7, 1), <span class="greek2">βασιλεία</span> <span class="greek2">ἡ</span> <span class="greek2">τοῦ</span> <span class="greek2">Λυσανίου</span> <span class="greek2">καλουμένῃ</span> (b. j. 2, 11, 5), <span class="greek2">Ἀβιλα</span> <span class="greek2">ἡ</span> <span class="greek2">Λυσανίου</span> (antt. 19, 5, 1); accordingly, some have supposed that in these passages Lysanias the son of Ptolemy must be meant, and that the region which he governed continued to bear his name even after his death. Others (as Credher, Strauss, Gfrörer, Weisse), denying that there ever was a second Lysanias, contend that Luke was led into error by that designation of Abilene (derived from Lysanias and retained for a long time afterward), so that he imagined that Lysanias was tetrarch in the time of Christ. This opinion, however, is directly opposed by the fact that <span class="abbreviation">Josephus</span>, in Antiquities 20, 7, 1 and <span class="abbreviation">b. j.</span> 2, 12, 8, expressly distinguishes Chalcis from the tetrarchy of Lysanias; nor is it probable that the region which Lysanias the son of Ptolemy governed for only six years took its name from him ever after. Therefore it is more correct to conclude that in the passages of <span class="abbreviation">Josephus</span> where the tetrarchy of Lysanias is mentioned a second Lysanias, perhaps the grandson of the former, must be meant; and that he is identical with the one spoken of by Luke.
