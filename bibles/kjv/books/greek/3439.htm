Westcott on Epistles of John, pp. 162ff).

He is so spoken of by John not because <span class="greek2">ὁ</span> <span class="greek2">λόγος</span> which was <span class="greek2">ἐνσαρκωθεις</span> in him was eternally generated by God the Father (the orthodox interpretation), or came forth from the being of God just before the beginning of the world (Subordinationism), but because by the incarnation (<span class="greek2">ἐνσαρκωσις</span>) of the <span class="greek2">λόγος</span> in him he is of nature or essentially Son of God, and so in a very different sense from that in which men are made by him <span class="greek2">τέκνα</span> <span class="greek2">τοῦ</span> <span class="greek2">Θεοῦ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/john/1-13.htm">John 1:13</a>). For since in the writings of John the title <span class="greek2">ὁ</span> <span class="greek2">ἱυος</span> <span class="greek2">τοῦ</span> <span class="greek2">Θεοῦ</span> is given only to the historic Christ so called, neither the Logos alone, nor Jesus alone, but <span class="greek2">ὁ</span> <span class="greek2">λόγος</span> <span class="greek2">ὁ</span> <span class="greek2">ἐνσαρκωθεις</span> or Jesus through the <span class="greek2">λόγος</span> united with God, is <span class="greek2">ὁ</span> <span class="greek2">μονογενής</span> <span class="greek2">υἱός</span> <span class="greek2">τοῦ</span> <span class="greek2">Θεοῦ</span>. The reading <span class="greek2">μονογενής</span> <span class="greek2">Θεός</span> (without the article before <span class="greek2">μονογενής</span>) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>, — which is supported by no inconsiderable weight of ancient testimony, received into the text by Tregelles, and Westcott and Hort, defended with much learning by Dr. Hort ("On <span class="greek2">μονογενής</span> <span class="greek2">Θεός</span> in Scripture and Tradition<span class="accented"> in his </span>Two Dissertations" Camb. and Lond. 1876), and seems not improbable to Harnack (in the Theol. Lit.-Zeit. for 1876, p. 541ff) (and Weiss (in Meyer 6te Aufl. at the passage)), but is foreign to John's mode of thought and speech (<a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/1_john/4-9.htm">1 John 4:9</a>), dissonant and harsh — appears to owe its origin to a dogmatic zeal which broke out soon after the early days of the church; (see articles on the reading by Prof. Abbot in the Bib. Sacr. for Oct. 1861 and in the Unitarian Rev. for June 1875 (in the latter copious references to other discussions of the same passage are given); see also Prof. Drummond in the Theol. Rev. for Oct. 1871). Further, see Grimm, Exgt.
