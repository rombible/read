It hardens into little white pellucid grains, and is collected before sunrise by the inhabitants of those countries and used as an article of food very sweet like honey. The Israelites in their journey through the wilderness met with a great quantity of food of this kind; and tradition, which the biblical writers follow, regarded it as bread sent down in profusion from heaven, and in various ways gave the occurrence the dignity of an illustrious miracle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/exodus/16-12.htm">Exodus 16:12</a>ff; <a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/psalms/77-24.htm">Psalm 77:24</a><FOOTNOTE:10> (<BIBLE/CHAPTER_VERSE:Ps. 78:24>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/psalms/104-40.htm">Psalm 104:40</a><FOOTNOTE:10> (<BIBLE/CHAPTER_VERSE:Ps. 105:40>); Wis. 16:20); cf. <span class="abbreviation">Winer</span>s RWB, under the word Manna; Knobel on Exodus, p. 171ff; Furrer in <span class="abbreviation">Schenkel</span> iv. 109f; (Robinson as above, and, p. 590; Tischendorf, Aus dem heil.
