Many commentators, as Beza, Kuinoel, Tholuck, Ewald, Bleek, <span class="abbreviation">Keim</span>, <span class="abbreviation">Cremer</span>, following <span class="abbreviation">Origen</span>, <span class="abbreviation">Jerome</span> (who in Matt. only translates by the barbarous phrase<span class="latin">panis</span><span class="latin">supersubstantialis</span>), <span class="abbreviation">Theophylact</span>, <span class="abbreviation">Euthymius Zigabenus</span>, explain the word by <span class="accented">bread for sustenance, which serves to sustain life,</span> deriving the word from <span class="greek2">οὐσία</span>, after the analogy of <span class="greek2">ἐξουσιος</span>, <span class="greek2">ἐνουσιος</span>. But <span class="greek2">οὐσία</span> very rarely, and only in philosophic language, is equivalent to <span class="greek2">ὕπαρξις</span>, as in <span class="abbreviation">Plato</span>, Theact., p. 185 c. (app. to <span class="greek2">τό</span> <span class="greek2">μή</span> <span class="greek2">εἶναι</span>), <span class="abbreviation">Aristotle</span>, de part. anim. i. 1 (<span class="greek2">ἡ</span> <span class="greek2">γάρ</span> <span class="greek2">γένεσις</span> <span class="greek2">ἕνεκα</span> <span class="greek2">τῆς</span> <span class="greek2">οὐσίας</span> <span class="greek2">ἐστιν</span>, <span class="greek2">ἀλλ'</span> <span class="greek2">οὐχ</span> <span class="greek2">ἡ</span> <span class="greek2">οὐσία</span> <span class="greek2">ἕνεκα</span> <span class="greek2">τῆς</span> <span class="greek2">γενέσεως</span>; for other examples see Bonitz's Index to <span class="abbreviation">Aristotle</span>, p. 544), and generally denotes either <span class="accented">essence, real nature, or substance, property, resources</span>. On this account Leo Meyer (in Kuhn, Zeitschr. f. vergleich. Sprachkunde, vii., pp. 401-430), Kamphausen (Gebet des Herrn, pp. 86-102), with whom <span class="abbreviation">Keim</span> (ii. 278f. (English translation, iii. 340)), Weiss (Matthew, the passage cited), Delitzsch (Zeitschr. f. d. luth. Theol. 1876, p. 402), agree, prefer to derive the word from <span class="greek2">ἐπειναι</span> (and in particular from the participle <span class="greek2">ἐπων</span>, <span class="greek2">ἐπουσιος</span> for <span class="greek2">ἐποντιος</span>, see below) <span class="accented">to be present,</span> and to understand it bread <span class="accented">which is ready at hand or suffices,</span> so that Christ is conjectured to have said in Chaldean <span class="hebrew">דְּחֻקָּנָא</span> <span class="hebrew">לַחְמָא</span> (cf. <span class="hebrew">חֻקִּי</span> <span class="hebrew">לֶחֶם</span> my allowance of bread, <a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/proverbs/30-8.htm">Proverbs 30:8</a>) or something of the sort. But this opinion, like the preceding, encounters the great objection (to mention no other) that, although the iota <span class="greek2">ἰ</span> in <span class="greek2">ἐπί</span> is retained before a vowel in certain words (as <span class="greek2">ἐπίορκος</span>, <span class="greek2">ἐπιορκέω</span>, <span class="greek2">ἐπιόσσομαι</span>, etc. (cf. <span class="abbreviation">Lightfoot</span>, as below, I. § 1)), yet in <span class="greek2">ἐπειναι</span> and words derived from it, <span class="greek2">ἐπουσια</span>, <span class="greek2">ἐπουσιωδης</span>, it is always elided. Therefore much more correctly do Grotius, Scaliger, <span class="abbreviation">Wetstein</span>, Fischer (De vitiis lexamples etc., p. 306ff), Valckenaer, Fritzsche (on Matthew, p. 267ff), <span class="abbreviation">Winer</span> (97 (92)), Bretschneider, Wahl, Meyer (<span class="abbreviation">Lightfoot</span> (Revision etc., Appendix)) and others, comparing the words <span class="greek2">ἑκούσιος</span>, <span class="greek2">ἐθελούσιος</span>, <span class="greek2">γερούσιος</span> (from <span class="greek2">ἑκών</span>, <span class="greek2">ἐθελων</span>, <span class="greek2">γέρων</span>, for <span class="greek2">ἑκοντιος</span>, <span class="greek2">ἐθελοντιος</span>, <span class="greek2">γεροντιος</span>, cf. Kühner, 1: § 63, 3 and § 334, 1 Anm. 2), conjecture that the adjective <span class="greek2">ἐπιούσιος</span> is formed from <span class="greek2">ἐπιών</span>, <span class="greek2">ἐπιοῦσα</span>, with reference to the familiar expression <span class="greek2">ἡ</span> <span class="greek2">ἐπιοῦσα</span> (see  <span class="greek2"><span class="lexref">ἄπειμι</span></span>), and <span class="greek2">ἄρτος</span> <span class="greek2">ἐπιούσιος</span> is equivalent to <span class="greek2">ἄρτος</span> <span class="greek2">τῆς</span> <span class="greek2">ἐπιουσης</span> <span class="greek2">ἡμέρας</span>, <span class="accented">food for the morrow,</span> i. e. <span class="accented">necessary or sufficient food</span>. Thus, <span class="greek2">ἐπιούσιον</span>, and <span class="greek2">σήμερον</span>, admirably answer to each other, and that state of mind is portrayed which, piously contented with <span class="accented">food sufficing from one day to the next,</span> in praying to God for sustenance does not go beyond the absolute necessity of the nearest future. This explanation is also recommended by the fact that in the Gospel according to the Hebrews, as <span class="abbreviation">Jerome</span> testifies, the word <span class="greek2">ἐπιούσιος</span> was represented by the Aramaic <span class="aramaic">מְחַר</span>, <span class="accented">quod dicitur crastinus</span>; hence, it would seem that Christ himself used the Chaldaic expression <span class="hebrew">לִמְחַר</span> <span class="hebrew">דִי</span> <span class="hebrew">לַחְמָא</span>. Nor is the prayer, so understood, at variance with the mind of Christ as expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/matthew/6-34.htm">Matthew 6:34</a>, but on the contrary harmonizes with it finely; for his hearers are bidden to ask of God, in order that they may themselves be relieved of anxiety for the morrow.
