Appointed king of Judaea in <DATE_RANGE:40 B.C.> by the Roman senate at the suggestion of Antony and with the consent of Octavian, he at length overcame the great opposition which the country made to him and took possession of the kingdom in <DATE_RANGE:37 B.C.>; and, after the battle of Actium, he was confirmed in it by Octavian, whose favor he ever after enjoyed. He was brave and skilled in war, learned and sagacious; but also extremely suspicious and cruel. Hence, he destroyed the entire royal family of the Hasmonaeans, put to death many of the Jews that opposed his government, and proceeded to kill even his dearly beloved wife Mariamne of the Hasmonaean line and the two sons she had borne him. By these acts of bloodshed, and especially by his love and imitation of Roman customs and institutions and by the burdensome taxes imposed upon his subjects, he so alienated the Jews that he was unable to regain their favor by his splendid restoration of the temple and other acts of munificence. He died in the 70th year of his age, the 37th of his reign, the 4th before the Dionysian era. Cf. <span class="abbreviation">Josephus</span>, Antiquities 14, 14, 4; 15, 6, 7; 7, 4; 8, 1; 16, 5, 4; 11, 6, etc. In his closing years John the Baptist and Christ were born, <a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/matthew/2-1.htm">Matthew 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/luke/1-5.htm">Luke 1:5</a>; Matthew narrates in chapter 2 (cf. <span class="abbreviation">Macrobius</span>, sat. 2, 4) that he commanded the male children in Bethlehem from two years old and under to be slain. Cf. especially <span class="abbreviation">Keim</span> in <span class="abbreviation">Schenkel</span> 3:27ff; <span class="abbreviation">Schürer</span>, Neutest.

After the death of his father he was appointed by the Romans tetrach of Galilee and Peraea. His first wife was a daughter of Aretas, king of Arabia; but he subsequently repudiated her and took to himself Herodias, the wife of his brother Herod (see  <span class="greek2"><span class="lexref">Φίλιππος</span></span>, 1); and in consequence Aretas, his father-in-law, made war against him and conquered him. He cast John the Baptist into prison because John had rebuked him for this unlawful connection; and afterward, at the instigation of Herodias, he ordered him to be beheaded. Induced by her, too, he went to Rome to obtain from the emperor the title of king. But in consequence of accusations brought against him by Herod Agrippa I., Caligula banished him (<DATE_RANGE:39><span class="date">A.D. 39</span>) to Lugdunum in Gaul, where he seems to have died. (On the statement of <span class="abbreviation">Josephus</span> (b. j. 2, 9, 6) that he died in Spain see the conjecture in <span class="abbreviation">B.

After various changes of fortune, he gained the favor of the emperors Caligula and Claudius to such a degree that he gradually obtained the government of all Palestine, with the title of king. He died at Caesarea, <DATE_RANGE:44><span class="date">A.D. 44</span>, at the age of 54, in the seventh (or 4th, reckoning from the extension of his dominions by Claudius) year of his reign (<span class="abbreviation">Josephus</span>, Antiquities 17, 1, 2; 18, 6; 19, 4, 5; 6, 1; 7, 3; <span class="abbreviation">b. j.</span> 2, 11, 6), just after having ordered James the apostle, son of Zebedee, to be slain, and Peter to be cast into prison: <a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/acts/12-1.htm">Acts 12:1, 6, 11, 19-21</a>.

Four years later Claudius took from him Chalcis and gave him instead a larger dominion, viz. Batanaea, Trachonitis, and Gaulanitis, with the title of king. To these regions Nero, in <DATE_RANGE:53><span class="date">A.D. 53</span>, added Tiberias and Tarichaeae and the Peraean Julias, with fourteen neighboring villages. Cf. <span class="abbreviation">Josephus</span>, Antiquities 19, 9, 1f; 20, 1, 3; 5, 2; 7, 1; 8, 4; <span class="abbreviation">b. j.</span> 2, 12, 1 and 8. In the N.

In the Jewish war, although, he strove in vain to restrain the fury of the seditious and bellicose populace, he did not desert the Roman side. After the fall of Jerusalem, he was vested with praetorian rank and kept the kingdom entire until his death, which took place in the third year of the emperor Trajan (the 73rd of his life, and 52nd of his reign).
