This is more than all his other epistles combined. <p class="num"><span class="nm">7.</span> Galatians may have been the only book written personally by the apostle without the aid of a stenographer (see 6:11).<p class="num"><span class="nm">8.</span> Paul reveals more about his early Christian life activities in this book than in any other of his writings (1:13-2:14). Among these events is the account when he confronted Peter concerning Simon’s sinful legalism.<p class="num"><span class="nm">9.</span> Galatians is the first chronological New Testament book to quote Habakkuk 2:4: <i>“The just shall live by faith”</i> (Gal. 3:11). The other two instances are Rom. 1:17 and Heb. 10:38.<p class="num"><span class="nm">10.</span> The book contains the greatest contrast between the fruit of the flesh and that of the Spirit in all the Bible (see 5:19-23). <p class="num"><span class="nm">11.</span> For its size Galatians has more to say regarding the law than any other biblical book. The word “law” occurs 29 times.

Was the letter written to the churches in northern Galatia (where Paul visited during his second and third missionary trips) or to the churches in southern Galatia (where he reached during his first trip)?<p class="num"><span class="nm">16.</span> The Galatians themselves were an emotional and intense Celtic people. Caesar said: “They are fickle in their resolves, fond of change, and not to be trusted.” This is demonstrated during Paul’s first visit to them. In the morning they attempted to worship him, and in the afternoon to murder him (Acts 14). They were a branch of Gauls, originally from north of the Baltic Sea, who had split off from a main migration westward to France and had settled in Asia Minor during the third century B.C. Paul’s work in Galatia had been highly successful. Great multitudes of people, mostly Gentiles, had accepted Christ. But after he left, the Judaizers from Jerusalem (a group of legalistic gospel-perverting Jews) had come to Galatia, teaching that Gentiles must put themselves back under the bondage of the law to be saved. The Galatians had thus received their message with the same zeal that they had accepted Paul’s. There was then a general epidemic of circumcision among them.The Judaizers had not only attacked the message of Paul, but also his apostleship. <p class="num"><span class="nm">17.</span> J. Vernon McGee aptly summarizes Galatians: “It is a stern, severe and solemn message” (Gal. 1:6-9; 3:1-5). It does not correct conduct, as the Corinthian letters do, but it is corrective—the Galatian believers were in grave peril. Because the foundations were being attacked, everything was threatened. The epistle contains no word of commenda-tion, praise, or thanksgiving. There is no request for prayer, and there is no mention of their standing in Christ. No one with him is mentioned by name (1:2). Compare this with the other epistles of Paul. The heart of Paul the apostle is laid bare; there is deep emotion and strong feeling. This is his fighting epistle—he has on his war paint. He has no toleration for legalism. Someone has said that Romans comes from the head of Paul while Galatians comes from the heart of Paul. ‘Galatians takes up controversially what Romans puts systematically.’ It is the declaration of emancipation from legalism of any type. It is the strongest declaration and defense of the doctrine of justification by faith in or out of the scripture. It is God’s polemic on behalf of the most vital truth of the Christian faith against any attack. Not only is a sinner saved by grace through faith, but the saved sinner lives by grace. Grace is a way to life and a way of life” (<i>Through the Bible</i>, p. 108). <p class="num"><span class="nm">18.</span> Hymn writer Philip P.
