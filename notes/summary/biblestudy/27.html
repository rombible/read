He was of royal blood. While in captivity, without the slightest compromise, he faithfully served under the administration of three kings: Nebuchadnezzar, Belshazzar, and Darius.<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">He was himself ministered to by both of heaven’s recorded archangels, Gabriel and Michael (9:21; 10:13). He has more to say about the coming antichrist than any other Old Testament writer. One of his contemporaries, Ezekiel, refers to the righteousness of Daniel, comparing him with Noah and Job (Ezek. 14:14), and the wisdom of Daniel (Ezek. 28:3). Jesus quoted Daniel during his Mount Olivet discourse (Mt. 24:15).<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Facts Regarding the Author of this Book</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> Who? <b>Daniel.</b> He was a fearless prophet who also served as a full-time statesman and part-time prophet under Babylonian rulers Nebuchadnezzar (Dan. 2:48) and Darius (Dan. 6:1-3).<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> What?

It now resides in the Library of Congress.<p class="num"><span class="nm">8.</span> Dr. W. A. Criswell writes the following:<p class="spc"></p><p class="smallnum">“Tracing the Book of Daniel through the centuries, we find references to it in I Maccabees. I Maccabees 1:54 refers to Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11 in its reference to ‘the abomination of desolation,’ as Jesus does in Matt. 24:15. Again, I Maccabees 2:49-70 comprises one of the most striking, solemn passages in the book, the record of the dying words of the venerable priest Mattathias to his sons, especially to Judas Maccabaeus. In this dying charge the noble patriot turns to the example of Daniel and his three faithful friends, to encourage his sons to be true to the God of their fathers. This is a tremendous witness to the early and authentic date of Daniel. Josephus throughout his histories makes much of the Book of Daniel. The Jewish historian was a contemporary of Paul and John. In about A.D. 80 Josephus wrote the story of his people from Abraham down to the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70. One of the most moving and beautiful narratives in all literature is his story of the sparing of the holy city by Alexander the Great during the latter’s conquest of the Persian Empire. It is recounted in his <i>Antiquities of the Jews,</i> Book XI, Chapter 8, paragraphs 4, and 5. The conquering Alexander, during his siege of Tyre, had made appeal to the Jews for provisions for his army. Jaddua, the high priest, refused, saying that he had sworn to be faithful to Dairus, the Persian king. This made Alexander furious. After his destruction of Tyre and after his destruction of Gaza, Alexander turned the wrath of his invincible army against Jerusalem. Jaddua, the high priest, was terrified, but God told him in a dream how to save the city. Carrying out the instructions of the Lord, Jaddua dressed his priests in white. He, himself, put on his glorious garments with scarlet robe, breastplate and golden mitre. Followed by a procession of priests and people in white, he went out to meet Alexander, singing the songs of Zion. The Macedonian was overwhelmed, and especially so when Jaddua showed him Dan. 8:1-8 and Dan. 8:15-22, passages that foretold his coming and his victories. The narrative continues, saying that Alexander worshiped God and offered sacrifices in the Temple. Whatever we may believe about Josephus being the world’s greatest liar (yet he is one of the most significant historians of all time), the fact remains: namely, that while Alexander destroyed every city in Syria friendly to Darius, the Persian, yet he not only spared Jerusalem but greatly favored it. Why? There must be a reason. It is Josephus who tells us why and that ‘why’ included the prophecies of Daniel.” (<i>Expository Sermons on the Book of Daniel.</i> Zondervan Publishing, p. 45).<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">9.</span> The unusual feature of this book is that Daniel wrote the central portion (2:4-7:28) in the Aramaic language.<p class="num"><span class="nm">10.</span> Daniel may be compared to Joseph, for both men had the gift of interpreting dreams (compare Gen. 37:5, 9; 40:8; 41:25 with Dan. 2:24; 4:19).<p class="num"><span class="nm">11.</span> His book marks the third of four great periods of miracles in the Bible.
