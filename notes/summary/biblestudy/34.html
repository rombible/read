THIS TIME, NO MORE MERCY.<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">Some eight centuries B.C., a great revival took place in Nineveh under the preaching of Jonah. But 150 years had gone by and the city’s terrible sin was now terminal. It was thus Nahum’s mission to pronounce divine judgment. This book is therefore given over to the total destruction of the second greatest pagan city in the Old Testament (with Babylon being the first). In summary: Obadiah predicted the destruction of Edom. Nahum predicted the destruction of Nineveh. Zephaniah predicted the destruction of Judah. Jeremiah predicted the destruction of Babylon. Ezekiel predicted the destruction of Egypt and Russia. Daniel predicted the destruction of Persia.<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">The time span between the ministry of Jonah and that of Nahum is a classic example of Gen. 15:16. <i> “For the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.”</i><p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Facts Regarding the Author of this Book</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> Who? <b>Nahum.</b> He predicted the total destruction of Nineveh (Nahum 3:1-19).<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> What?

At the time of this prophecy, Nineveh appeared to be impregnable, with its walls 100 feet high and broad enough for chariots to drive upon them. It had a circumference of some 60 miles and was adorned by more than 1,200 towers. Nineveh fell in 612 B.C. (some 18 years after this prophecy), being completely destroyed by the Medes from the north and the Babylonians from the south.<p class="num"><span class="nm">4.</span> Nahum not only predicted the fall of Nineveh, but the very manner in which it would fall. (Note 1:8a: <i>“an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place.”</i>) History tells us that Nabopolassar, leader of the Babylonian invasion forces, besieged the city for three years, leading three massive attacks against it, and failing each time. Because of this, the Assyrians inside Nineveh rejoiced and began holding drunken parties. But suddenly the Tigris River overflowed its banks and sent its wildly churning waters against the walls of the city. Soon it had washed out a hole, into which gap rushed the Babylonians, and the proud city was destroyed.<p class="num"><span class="nm">5.</span> The destruction of Nineveh was so great that Alexander the Great marched his troops over the same desolate ground which had once given support to their mighty buildings and did not even know there had once been a city there. The city itself was not excavated until as recently as A.D. 1845.<p class="num"><span class="nm">6.</span> Nahum and Obadiah were the only Old Testament prophets who pronounced doom on a pagan nation without also mentioning the sins of Israel.<p class="num"><span class="nm">7.</span> Nahum documents the cruelty of Assyria which has been called the arch villain of the Old Testament, more ruthless by far than Israel’s other foes.<p class="num"><span class="nm">8.</span> Nahum’s description of Nineveh’s destruction is by far the most graphic in all the Bible (2, 3).<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Comparison with Other Bible Books</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg"><b>1.
