Peter also explains the purpose of suffering as related to this salvation, pointing to Jesus as the perfect example. The apostle concludes by exhorting both leaders and laymen alike to be prayerful and watchful, awaiting the return of the chief shepherd.<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Bottom Line Summary</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">SOME SOUND ADVICE TO SOME SUFFERING SAINTS!<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">This New Testament book is the Old Testament book of Job.<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Facts Regarding the Author of this Book</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> Who? <b>Peter.</b> He was a former fisherman (Lk. 5:1-9) and brother of Andrew (Jn. 1:40), who would become the unofficial spokesman for the twelve apostles.

There are two main theories concerning the location of Babylon.<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> It is literal Babylon on the Euphrates River: This would seem to be the natural interpretation of the passage. Furthermore, the list of countries in 1 Pet. 1:1 is from east to west, which suggests that the writer was in the east at the time of writing. J. Vernon McGee writes: “There was at this time a large colony of Jews in ancient Babylon who had fled Rome due to severe persecution under Claudius and at the time of writing bloody Nero was on the throne” (<i>Through the Bible,</i> p. 256). In addition to this, the descendants of those Jews taken captive by Nebuchadnezzar were still living in and around Babylon.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> It is Rome: Charles Ryrie writes: “The place of the writing was Babylon (5:13), a symbolic name for Rome much used by writers who wished to avoid trouble with Roman authorities…Peter was in Rome during the last decade of his life and wrote this epistle about A.D. 63, just before the outbreak of Nero’s persecution in 64. Peter was martyred about 67” (<i>The Ryrie Study Bible,</i> p. 425). Furthermore, it is argued that Peter states Mark (5:13) was with him at the time the epistle was written. However, just prior to this, Paul had written Timothy to bring Mark to Rome with him (2 Tim. 4:11).<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">13.</span> The church apparently was affected by worldliness in the pews (2:11) and materialism in the pulpit (5:1-3).<p class="num"><span class="nm">14.</span> Chapter 3 can be considered the marriage chapter (vv. 1-12) because of the advice Peter gives to both husbands and wives.
