The account also describes God’s special promise to the King (the Davidic Covenant), the birth of Solomon, the terrible moral failures of David and the tragic divine punishment that followed.<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Bottom Line Introduction</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">FINALLY!

In essence, Second Samuel records for us both the triumphs and the tragedies which will follow.

The ark of God is carried into Jerusalem, once during a celebration (chapter 6) and the other during a revolution (chapter 15).<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> Two of the Old Testament’s most significant events transpire in the early part of this book:<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> The city of Jerusalem becomes David’s capital (chapter 5).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> The ark of the covenant is found and brought into the city (chapter 6). These events would prepare the way for the building of the first temple in the days of King Solomon.<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> Several vital spiritual lessons may be learned from this book:<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> The law of harmonizing God’s way with God’s will: Both are equally important and must be understood by a believer doing a work for God. This is clearly seen in the way the ark came to Jerusalem.<p class="spc"></p><p class="letter"><span class="let">a.</span> God’s will was for David to bring the ark into the Holy City. This David did.<p class="letter"><span class="let">b.</span> God’s way was for the priests to carry it. At first David did not obey this, which resulted in sorrow and death (6:1-7).<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> The law of sowing and reaping. After David’s prayer of repentance (see Ps. 51), God graciously forgave him for his twin sins of adultery and murder (chapter 11), but the king still harvested the bitter fruits of his iniquity. These fruits were tragic indeed. They involved the death of an infant son, the rape of a daughter by her own brother, the murder of that brother by another brother, and the rebellion against David by his favorite son, who was himself later executed by David’s military commander.<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">4.</span> This book records the final two of three anointings of David.<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> The anointing in Bethlehem by Samuel (1 Sam. 16).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> The anointing in Hebron by two tribes (2:4)<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> The anointing in Hebron by all twelve tribes (5:1)<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">5.</span> We read of a victor sorrowing, not gloating over the death of his enemy (1:17-21). This attitude is in perfect harmony with that of God’s who once said, <i>“I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked”</i> (Ezek. 33:11).<p class="num"><span class="nm">6.</span> It gives us the second of three all-important biblical covenants.<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> The Abrahamic Covenant (Gen. 12:1-3). This has to do with a land (Canaan) and a people (Israel).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> The Davidic Covenant (7:4-16). This has to do with a king to rule in that land over that people.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> The new Covenant (Jer. 31:31). This has to do with changed hearts so that the people in the land will allow that king to rule over them.<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">7.</span> The book of Second Samuel also offers scripture’s most beautiful example of kindness of the heavenly Father for poor, lost, and crippled sinners. This is seen through the relationship between David and Mephibosheth, crippled son of his beloved friend. The lesson here is clear. God seeks to save and care for poor lost sinners because of his great love for Christ, who died to redeem them (9:6-13).<p class="num"><span class="nm">8.</span> It warns us to always be on guard, for often the brightest lights cast the darkest shadows! (11)<p class="num"><span class="nm">9.</span> We learn the sobering lesson on just how a father’s life style can serve either as a good or bad role model. David’s sins of adultery and murder were copied and compounded by rape, murder, and rebellion in the lives of his children! The law of sowing and reaping is nowhere more clearly illustrated than in the tragic (13-15) results of David’s sin with Bathsheba.<p class="num"><span class="nm">10.</span> We read that even the godliest counselor can, on occasion, unintentionally, give the wrong advice!
