His name means “embrace.” Habakkuk was the last of the minor prophets writing to the Southern Kingdom before the Babylonian Captivity in 606 B.C., just as Micah was the final prophet to the Northern Kingdom prior to the Assyrian Captivity in 721 B.C.<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">He was apparently one of the Levitical choristers in the temple. His closing statement, “for the chief musicians on my stringed instrument” reveals that this is actually a song. It is a book of deepest doubt. His doubts centered around two painful problems. How could God allow the sins of Israel to go unpunished? God then tells him Judah would indeed be punished by the Babylonians. How then, he asks, could God justify allowing a godless nation to punish Judah, which nation at least believed in God and had some good men left?<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Facts Regarding the Author of this Book</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> Who? <b>Habakkuk.</b> He was a Levitical musician who wrote an Old Testament book in song fashion to be sung (Hab. 3:19). His all-important phrase,<i> “The just shall live by his faith”</i> (Hab. 2:4) is repeated three times in the New Testament (Rom. 1:17; Gal. 3:11; Heb. 10:38).<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> What?

(Parts of Jonah, Job, and a few other books feature such dialogues.) All other prophetic books consist mainly of records of the prophets’ preaching.<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> Dr. J. Ronald Blue observes: “Habakkuk is a unique book. Unlike other prophets who declared God’s message to people this prophet dialogued with God about people. Most Old Testament prophets proclaimed divine judgment. Habakkuk pleaded for divine judgment.” (<i>The Bible Knowledge Commentary.</i> Victor Books, p. 1505)<p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> Habakkuk’s book begins with an interrogation of God but ends as an intercession to God. Worry is transformed into worship. Fear turns to faith. Terror becomes trust. Hang-ups are resolved with hope. Anguish melts into adoration. (ibid. p. 1507) <p class="num"><span class="nm">4.</span> Habakkuk’s great theological declaration, <i>“The just shall live by faith”</i> (2:4), is quoted no less than three times in the New Testament (see Rom. 1:17; Gal. 3:11; Heb. 10:38).<p class="num"><span class="nm">5.</span> It has been suggested that each of these three New Testament books emphasizes a different phase of Habakkuk’s statement. Thus:<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> “The just” is emphasized in Romans.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> “Shall live” is emphasized in Galatians.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> “By faith” is emphasized in Hebrews.<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">6.</span> In essence, Habakkuk functions more like a priest than a prophet. Instead of declaring God’s message and thus standing between God and the people, he pleads God’s mercy, and thus stands between the people and God.<p class="num"><span class="nm">7.</span> Habakkuk gives the final of five marvelous “bottom-line summaries” of the coming millennium. Note the similar language in each: <i>“But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord”</i> (Num. 14:21). <i> “And blessed be his glorious name forever, and let the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen, and Amen”</i> (Psa. 72:19). <i>“And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory”</i> (Isa. 6:3). “<i>They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea”</i> (Isa. 11:9). <i> “For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea”</i> (2:14).<p class="num"><span class="nm">8.</span> The everlasting <U>WHY</U> asked at the beginning of his book (1:2, 3, 12, 13) is answered at the end of his book by the everlasting <U>WHO</U> (3:18-19).<p class="num"><span class="nm">9.</span> Habakkuk sees one of the greatest manifestations of God’s glory and power in all the Bible (3:1-16). It is reminiscent of that at Mount Sinai as viewed by Moses (see Ex. 19).<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Comparison with Other Bible Books</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg"><b>Isaiah:</b><p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Both taunt the proud Babylonians (2:6-20; Isa. 14).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Both include “woes” (2:6, 9, 12, 15, 19; Isa. 5:8-23 and other scattered occurrences).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Both speak of the “righteous” or the “just” who trust in the Lord (2:4; Isa. 26:1-10).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Both record a theophany, a visible manifestation of God (3; Isa. 6).<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Titles for and Types of Jesus</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> The Holy and Mighty One (1:12)<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> The Lord of Hosts (2:13)<p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> The Coming King in all His Glory (3:3-15)<p class="spc"></p></body></html>
