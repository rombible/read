BUT IT ISN’T WHAT YOU THINK IT IS.<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">Almost everyone has heard the story of the huge sea creature that swallowed Jonah, and about Jonah’s pitiful prayer for deliverance while inside its stomach (ch. 1-2). But the real fish story takes place in chapter 3. To understand this, consider an event that would transpire some seven centuries later in northern Israel:<i> “And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men. And they straightway left their nets, and followed him”</i> (Mt. 4:18-20). In this passage Jesus taught that the “fish” God is looking to catch are sinful men, and the real “fishermen” are soul winners. In Jonah 3, after the prophet’s preaching, history’s greatest revival took place. In other words, Jonah caught more “fish” in his net than ever before – thus we have the greatest fish story of all time.<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Facts Regarding the Author of this Book</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> Who? <b>Jonah.</b> He was the most famous “foreign missionary” in the Old Testament, who once attempted to run from God (Jonah 1:1-3), was then swallowed by a great sea creature (Jonah 1:17), and later conducted history’s most successful revival campaigns (Jonah 3:1-10)!<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> What?
