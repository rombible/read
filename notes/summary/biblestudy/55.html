Vernon McGee writes: “In 2 Timothy Paul speaks of the ultimate outcome of gospel preaching. The final fruition will not be the total conversion of mankind, nor will it usher in the Millennium. On the contrary, there will come about an apostasy which will well-nigh blot out ‘the faith’ from the earth. This is in complete harmony with the startling word of Christ, ‘When the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?’ This is not in keeping, of course, with a social gospel which expects to transform the world by tinkering with the social system. These vain optimists have no patience with the doleful words of 2 Timothy. Nevertheless, the cold and hard facts of history and the events of the present have demonstrated the accuracy of Paul” (<i>Second Timothy,</i> p. 196.)<p class="num"><span class="nm">13.</span> At least six analogies depicting the Christian life are given here in this book.
