This priceless gift thus becomes ours when we acknowledge and act upon the fact of God’s presence in our lives and of His desire to exercise priority over our lives. Wisdom then seeks and provides our proper responses in all matters, including the domestic, the business, religious, and social world.<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Bottom Line Introduction</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">CONSIDER YOURSELF NOW ENROLLED IN THE S.A.B.I. (THE SOUND ADVICE BIBLE INSTITUTE). YOUR INSTRUCTOR IS SOLOMON AND THE SUBJECT IS WISDOM.<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">Most of this book was written by King Solomon, the world’s wisest man (1 Kings 3:12). In it he condenses the vast reservoir of knowledge and wisdom found within his mind into factual nuggets for his readers. Although he is said to have composed 3,000 proverbs (1 Kings 4:32), only 800 bearing his name appear in the book of Proverbs. But these are the best. There are other biblical proverbs not found in this book (see 1 Sam. 24:13; Ezek. 18:1-2; Mt. 23:24; Lk. 4:23; Jn. 16:25; 2 Peter 2:22).<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">A proverb is a short sentence drawn from long experience. It is a proper mixture of horse sense and holy sense. It is characterized by shortness, sense, and salt. It is the wisdom of many and the wit of one. It is, in essence, the ability to see ourselves and the world as God sees it. Solomon may have headed up a school of wisdom (1 Kings 10:8; Ecc. 1:1; 12:9), as Samuel headed up a school of the prophets (1 Sam. 19:20).<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">The book mentions the words knowledge and wisdom many times. Knowledge is the ability to acquire facts. Wisdom is the ability to rightfully apply those facts. The book of Proverbs tells a story. It is a picture of a young man starting out in life. Two schools bid for him and both send out their literature. One is the school of wisdom and the other the school of fools.<p class="spc"></p><p class="capletter"><span class="cap">A.</span> At least four kinds of fools are mentioned in Proverbs:<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> The simple fool (1:4, 22; 7:7; 21:11)<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> The hardened fool (1:7; 10:23; 12:23; 17:10; 20:3; 27:22)<p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> The arrogant fool (3:34; 21:24; 22:10; 29:8)<p class="num"><span class="nm">4.</span> The brutish fool (17:21; 26:3; 30:22)<p class="spc"></p><p class="capletter"><span class="cap">B.</span> But how different are the graduates from the school of wisdom:<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> Wisdom will protect her students (2:8)<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> Wisdom will direct her students (3:5-6)<p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> Wisdom will perfect her students (4:18)<p class="spc"></p><p class="capletter"><span class="cap">C.</span> At least four chapters are noteworthy in Proverbs:<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> The terrible price for rejecting wisdom (1:24-28)<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> The snare of the harlot (7:6-27)<p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> The pre-creation activities of Christ (8:22-31)<p class="num"><span class="nm">4.</span> The virtuous woman (31)<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Facts Regarding the Author(s) of this Book</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg"><u>First Author</u><p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> Who? <b>Solomon.</b> He was the son of David and Bathsheba (2 Sam. 12:24), Israel’s third king (1 Kings 1:39), and the world’s wisest man (1 Kings 3:5-12).<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> What?

In essence, it is an extended commentary on Mt. 7:24-27: <i>“Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.”</i><p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> The book of Proverbs is like medicine. You cannot live on medicine alone, but few of us go through life without some medicine now and then. At least we take a vitamin. Likewise, a spiritual diet of Proverbs alone would be most unbalanced, but how sick a person might be that didn’t occasionally ingest some of these potions and antidotes for the sake of his mental, spiritual, and even financial well-being. The book of Proverbs is the kind of Biblical fare you should indulge in often, but not in large doses. The “stuff” of Proverbs has already been distilled so that its advice comes to us in highly concentrated form. These sage tidbits have been boiled down, trimmed, honed, polished, and sharpened to where a little goes a long way. (<i>Proverbs.</i> Robert Alden. Baker Book House, p. 9)<p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> For a time Jewish scholars questioned the canonicity of Proverbs, partly because of the apparent contradiction of 26:4 and 5, and partly due to the explicitness of anti-adultery passages. (Ibid., p. 13)<p class="num"><span class="nm">4.</span> Proverbs contains a number of words which appear only once in the Bible and it is these words which usually cause problems in translation, especially if the word is integral to the meaning of the text. On the other hand, we are helped by the widely used semitic device of parallelism in Proverbs. When two halves of a verse are parallel (either synonymous or antithetical), we can usually guess the meaning of an unknown word by its counterpart which is known. (Ibid., p. 14)<p class="num"><span class="nm">5.</span> One of the ancient rabbis, Rabbi Bar Kappara once said the following two verses summarize the entire Old Testament! <i>“Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths”</i> (Prov. 3:5, 6). <p class="num"><span class="nm">6.</span> Many of our modern day sayings have their root in the book of Proverbs.
