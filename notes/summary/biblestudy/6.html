THE MOST EXCITING OLD TESTAMENT BOOK, AS SUMMARIZED BY THE MOST EXICITING OLD TESTAMENT VERSE :<p class="spc"></p><p class="ita"><i>“Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it”</i> (1:11).<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">Think of it. In just three short days Israel would accomplish that goal which had eluded the nation for nearly 40 long years. The book of Joshua is the counterpart of Exodus. Exodus records how God led his people out of the land of bondage, while Joshua tells us how God led his people into the land of blessing. Moses summarizes both books in Deut. 6:23: <i>“And he brought us out … that he might bring us in.”</i><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">God had in Exodus parted the waters of the Red Sea to bring his people out of Egypt. He will now part the waters of the Jordan River to bring his people into Canaan. God performs whatever is necessary to assure both the exit and entrance for his people.<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">These two Old Testament books review God’s basic plan for all Christians. He brings us out of spiritual death by way of salvation, that he might bring us into abundant life by way of sanctification. In the Bible, Canaan is not a type or symbol for heaven, but rather speaks of that overcoming life when we walk in God’s perfect will (see Heb. 4:9-11).<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Facts Regarding the Author of this Book</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> Who? <b>Joshua.</b> He was the son of Nun (Ex. 33:11) and Moses’ successor (Num. 27:18) who led his people Israel across the Jordan River into the Promised Land (Josh. 1-4).<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> What? <b>The book of Joshua.</b><p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> When and where? 1390 B.C., probably near Mt.
