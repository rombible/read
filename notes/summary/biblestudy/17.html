The other is the book of Ruth. Note the contrasts between Ruth and Esther.<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Ruth was a Gentile who lived among Jews. Esther was a Jewess who lived among Gentiles.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Ruth married a Jew.

This vicious henchman was the Adolf Hitler of the Old Testament. The subsequent hanging of wicked Haman also offers the most vivid object lesson fulfillment of the prophecy in Gen. 12:3: <i>“And I will … curse him that curseth thee.”</i><p class="num"><span class="nm">6.</span> Esther is one of two biblical books in which the name of God is not mentioned (the other is Song of Solomon). Why is this? One reason may be to illustrate the hidden but providential care of God in spite of outward appearances. There is no other book in all the Bible in which God is more evident, working behind the scenes, than in this book. Providence may be defined as follows: “It is that continuous agency of God by which He makes original design with which He created it” (A. Strong). It can also be thought of as the hand of God in the glove of history. Providence is the last of three great facts which make up the sovereignty of God as witnessed by man. These are:<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Creation: which accounts for the existence of this universe (Gen. 1:1).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Preservation: which accounts for the progress and development of this universe (Psa. 135:6-10; Dan. 4:35).<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">7.</span> One may with full justification write the words of three tremendous verses across the book of Esther.<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Gen. 50:20: <i>“But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.”</i><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Psa. 76:10: <i>“Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee …”</i><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Rom. 8:28: <i>“And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.”</i><p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">8.</span> The name of God, however, may be secretly included in Esther. His great title YHWH does appear in acrostic form four times in the Hebrew text of the book (Esth. 1:20; 5:4, 13; 7:7).<p class="num"><span class="nm">9.</span> Esther records the only mention of the Feast of Purim (4:14), an observance to celebrate the deliverance of the Jews from Haman.<p class="num"><span class="nm">10.</span> The longest verse in the Bible is found in Esther (8:9), and contains 90 words.<p class="num"><span class="nm">11.</span> Esther records the only nationwide beauty pageant in scripture (2:1-4).<p class="num"><span class="nm">12.</span> It describes the most famous and far reaching divorce in the Bible (1:19).<p class="num"><span class="nm">13.</span> Perhaps no other verse in all of God’s Word explains for us more clearly in regards to the reason for the why and when of our birth than does the one in 4:14: <i>“And who knoweth whether thou are come to the kingdom for such a time as this?”</i><p class="num"><span class="nm">14.</span> It illustrates most vividly that eternal truth which says you reap what you sow. This is seen:<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In the case of Jacob, who deceived his father by the skin of a young goat (Gen. 27:16), only to be himself deceived by his sons by the blood of a young goat (Gen. 37:31).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In the case of Daniel’s enemies who plotted to have the prophet killed by lions, only to be themselves killed in this manner (Dan. 6).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In the case of Haman who built a gallows to hang Mordecai, only to be himself hanged upon that same gallows (Esth. 5:14; 6:10). <p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">15.</span> Finally, it provides the third of three instances where a wife gave her husband some fatal advice! <p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> As seen in the case of Adam and Eve (Gen. 3:6)<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> As seen in the case of Ahab and Jezebel (1 Kings 21:5-7)<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> As seen in the case of Haman and Zeresh (Esth. 5:14)<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Comparison with Other Bible Books</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg"><b>Exodus:</b><p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Both books record two divinely instituted feasts to be observed as a reminder of how He saved His people from destruction.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> The Passover Feast, signifying their deliverance from Egypt (Exod. 12-14).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> The Feast of Purim, signifying their deliverance from Haman.<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Titles for and Types of Jesus</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg"><b>The God of Providence:</b><p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> In the Salvation of Esther (2:17)<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> In the Insomnia of the King (6:1)<p class="spc"></p></body></html>
