In it he warns both Israel and surrounding Gentile nations of soon and severe divine judgment because of their sin, concluding his book with a glowing prediction of Israel’s eventual restoration in the millennial kingdom.<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Bottom Line Introduction</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">FIRE AND BRIMSTONE PREACHING – THE BETHEL CRUSADE.<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">The book of Amos was named after the prophet Amos, the “Billy Sunday” of the Old Testament. The name Amos means “burden.” As Middle Eastern names are usually meaningful, this name may have referred to his unwelcome birth, or been given as a prophecy of his future ministry to describe his burdened heart over Judah and Israel’s sin.<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">He was from the little town of Tekoa, some five miles from Bethlehem in Judea. Amos was a herdsman (1:1; 7:14-15) and a gatherer of sycamore fruit (7:14). He had not graduated from the school of the prophets, but was called by God to become a lay evangelist.<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">He was called to be a prophet to the whole house of Jacob (3:1, 13), but chiefly to the Northern Kingdom (7:14-15) at the main sanctuary at Bethel (7:10). Here he conducted his “Greater Samaritan Revival Campaign” and thundered away on the subjects of sin, separation, and sanctification.<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">Amos ministered during the reigns of Uzziah (king of Judah) and Jeroboam II (king of Israel), beginning his ministry some two years before a mighty earthquake had struck Palestine (1:1). This earthquake was so severe that Zechariah (a later Hebrew prophet) referred to it some 250 years later (see Zech. 14:5). Josephus, the Jewish historian, tells us the earthquake happened at the time when God punished King Uzziah with leprosy for his intrusion into the office of the priesthood (see 2 Chron. 26:16-21).<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">At the time of Amos’ ministry, Israel, under powerful King Jeroboam II, was at its zenith of success (see 2 Kings 14:25). But along with the nation’s prosperity had come religious perversion.<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Facts Regarding the Author of this Book</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> Who? <b>Amos.</b> This theologically untrained herdsman and gatherer of sycamore fruit (Amos 1:1; 7:14, 15) would become the “Billy Sunday” of the Old Testament!<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> What?

A. Ironside observes: “It is ever God’s way to prepare His servants in secret for the work they are afterwards to accomplish in public. Moses at the backside of the desert; Gideon on the threshing-floor; David with his “few sheep” out upon the hillside; Daniel refusing to be defiled with the king’s meat; John the Baptist in the desert; Peter in his fishing boat; Paul in Arabia; and Amos following the flock and herding the cattle in the wilderness of Tekoa—all alike attest this fact. It is important to observe that only he who has thus learned of God in the school of obscurity is likely to shine in the blaze of publicity.” (<i>Notes on the Minor Prophets.</i> Loizeaux Brothers, p. 141)<p class="num"><span class="nm">4.</span> Amos is the only biblical book to employ poetic expression, “for three transgressions … and for four” (used eight times – 1:3, 6, 9, 11, 13; 2:1, 4, 6) which phrase may be better translated, “for three sins of . . . <u>even</u> for four,” thus Amos may have intended to express the number seven in poetic fashion, i.e., God complete judgment upon these nations (seven being the number of completeness).<p class="num"><span class="nm">5.</span> His book is the second of two referring to the “seven stars and orion” (5:8). Orion was the southern constellation, seen in November. Thus Amos, like Job (9:9; 38:31) must have often gazed in awe at this heavenly sight.<p class="num"><span class="nm">6.</span> This book gives one of the most chilling descriptions of judgment upon sin by the omniscient and omnipotent God as can be found in all the Bible (see 9:2-3).<p class="num"><span class="nm">7.</span> It also provides us with one of the saddest predictions in the scriptures concerning Israel’s tragic wanderings (see 8:11-12).<p class="num"><span class="nm">8.</span> Amos contains a passage which helped the Jerusalem council some seven centuries later to make its great decision.
