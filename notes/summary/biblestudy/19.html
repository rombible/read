Note some examples from each of these stages:<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Psalms 1-41 (corresponds to Genesis). The key word is man. <i>“Blessed is the man who walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly”</i> (Psa. 1:1). <i> “What is man, that thou art mindful of him?”</i> (8:4). <i> “The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men”</i> (14:2). <i> “Verily, every man at his best state is altogether vanity”</i> (39:5).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Psalms 42-72 (corresponds to Exodus). The key word is deliverance. <i>“Thou art my king, O God; command deliverances for Jacob”</i> (44:4). <i> “For he hath delivered me out of all trouble”</i> (54:7). <i>“For thou hast delivered my soul from death”</i> (56:13). <i>“Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God”</i> (59:1). “<i>For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth”</i> (72:12).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Psalms 73-89 (corresponds to Leviticus). The key word is sanctuary. <i>“For I was envious . . . when I saw the prosperity of the wicked … until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end”</i> (73:3, 17). <i>“Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary”</i> (77:13). <i> “And he built his sanctuary … which he hath established forever”</i> (78:69).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Psalms 90-106 (corresponds to Numbers). The key words are unrest and wandering. Especially to be noted under this section are two entire psalms which are given over to Israel’s failures as recorded in the book of Numbers. These are Psalms 90 and 106.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Psalms 107-150 (corresponds to Deuteronomy). The key word is the Word of God. <i>“He sent his word and healed them”</i> (107:20). <i>“I waited for the LORD … and in his word do I hope”</i> (130:5). <i>“Thou has magnified thy word”</i> (138:2). In addition to these verses this final section contains the 119th Psalm, scripture’s longest chapter. It is totally given over to the Word of God. It is mentioned in 171 of the 176 verses in the chapter. The author gives the Bible nine titles in this psalm and ascribes some 12 ministries to it.<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> <b>Attributes of God Psalms:</b> The following are just a few of the Psalms’ descriptions of God:<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Eternality (90;
