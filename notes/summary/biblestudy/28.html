The second of these troubled marriages however will someday have a happy ending, for the repentant wife is to be divinely cleansed and restored, as hopefully was the case of Hosea and Gomer.<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Bottom Line Introduction</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">IS IT REALLY TRUE? DID GOD ACTUALLY COMMAND A PROPHET TO MARRY A PROSTITUTE?<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">Hosea’s name means “salvation.” He was a prophet to the Northern Kingdom, and wept over their sins, as Jeremiah later wept over Judah’s sins.<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">Hosea is perhaps the strangest book in all the Bible, for God instructed his prophet to “take unto thee a wife of whoredoms.” There are several reasons why God did this.<p class="spc"></p><p class="capletter"><span class="cap">A.</span> The experiential reason: By marrying an unfaithful wife, Hosea could, as perhaps no other single prophet, understand somewhat the anguish in God’s own heart over the Northern Kingdom, whose people were constantly committing spiritual fornication and adultery against Jehovah. God had often compared his relationship to Israel to that of a marriage (See Isa. 62:5; Hosea 2:19; Jer. 3:14).<p class="capletter"><span class="cap">B.</span> The illustrative reason: His own marriage would become a walking and visible example of his message to Israel.<p class="capletter"><span class="cap">C.</span> The prophetical reason: God would command him to name his children by those titles which would describe the future punishment and eventual restoration of all Israel. He may have ministered longer than any other prophet.<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Facts Regarding the Author of this Book</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> Who? <b>Hosea.</b> He was the broken hearted husband of an unfaithful wife. The sin of his wife Gomer (Hos. 1:2; 2:1), and the very names of his three children, Jezreel (meaning “scattered,” Hos. 1:4), Lo-ruha-mah (“unpitied,” Hos. 1:6), and Lo-ammi (“not my people,” Hos. 1:9) serve to illustrate two tragic facts:<p class="spc"></p><p class="letter"><span class="let">a.</span> The perversion of the nation Israel<p class="letter"><span class="let">b.</span> The punishment of the nation Israel<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> What?

He has been called “the deathbed prophet of Israel.”<p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> His book is the second most lengthy of the twelve minor prophets. Only Zechariah is larger.<p class="num"><span class="nm">4.</span> Hosea predicted the Assyrian invasion, and later lived to see these prophecies fulfilled in 721 B.C. In his book he refers constantly to the Northern Kingdom as Ephraim. Ephraim was the first of the 12 tribes of Israel to backslide.<p class="num"><span class="nm">5.</span> Hosea is the only Old Testament prophet, apart from Moses, to have included in his life’s writings the names of his father, wife, and children (1:3, 4, 6, 9).<p class="num"><span class="nm">6.</span> His book includes some of the greatest Old Testament passages on the future and experiences of Israel from the destruction of the first Temple in 586 B.C. to the millennium (3:4, 5; 5:15; 6:1; 8:8; 9:17). This book contains one of the very few biblical verses which has a double reference. The verse is 11:1: <i>“When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.”</i> The historical reference is seen in Deut. 7:7-8; the prophetical is seen in Mt. 2:15.<p class="num"><span class="nm">7.</span> Hosea contains seven key passages describing Israel’s temporary rejection, eventual repentance and restoration by God. These are:<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> <i>“For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim: Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days”</i> (3:4, 5).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> <i>“I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early”</i> (5:15).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> <i>“Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.
