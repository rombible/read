He both lashed out against and wept bitterly over the sins of his people Judah, before, during, and after the Babylonian invasion. Following the destruction of Solomon’s temple, Jeremiah attempted to minister to the surviving Jews in Jerusalem and, by way of letters, to comfort those already taken to Babylon.<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Bottom Line Introduction</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">“THE HARVEST IS PAST, THE SUMMER IS ENDED, AND WE ARE NOT SAVED.”<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">These are the sad words of a persecuted prophet, Jeremiah by name, who witnessed to and wept over Judah during her final days.
