And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes. And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates”</i> (6:6-9).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> God’s ministry to Israel: <i>“And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers”</i> (6:23). In the next chapter, God explains the reason behind his gracious ministry to Israel. <i>“The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all people: But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt”</i> (7:7-8).<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> Deuteronomy was one of the first books to be attacked under the guise of higher criticism at the end of the nineteenth century.<p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> Deuteronomy is far more than a mere repetition of the Law of Moses. It is rather a rehearsal and reminder of that Law, for many of the younger Israelites had never heard it before, having been born since Mount Sinai. In summary:<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In Genesis we read of Israel’s election<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In Exodus, of her redemption<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In Leviticus, of her sanctification<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In Numbers, of her direction<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In Deuteronomy, of her instruction<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">4.</span> Another major theme in Deuteronomy is the importance attached to the Word of God (see 4:1-2, 7, 9; 6:7-9; 11:18-21; 27:1-4; 30:11-14; 31:11-12; 32:46-47).<p class="num"><span class="nm">5.</span> Deuteronomy includes the second of two important conditional covenants in the Bible given by God to man. The first was the Edenic, which promised Adam fruitfulness for obedience, and death for disobedience (Gen. 1:26-31; 2:15-17). The second was the Palestinian Covenant, which promised Israel permanent status in the land for obedience, and captivity for disobedience (Deut. 28:1-30).<p class="num"><span class="nm">6.</span> Deuteronomy lists four key prophecies:<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> The victorious entrance of Israel under Joshua into Canaan (7:2; 9:1-3; 31:3, 5).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> The sin of Israel while in the land (31:16-18, 20, 29)<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> The exile from the land (4:26-28; 7:4; 8:19-20; 28:36, 41, 49-50, 53, 64)<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> The return of Israel back to the land (4:29; 30:1-3, 10)<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">7.</span> This book contains a song that may be sung during the great tribulation. (Compare Deut. 31:30-32:45 with Rev. 15:3-4).<p class="num"><span class="nm">8.</span> Here we also read of the first official promise by God to provide kings to rule over Israel (17:14-20). Furthermore, in the next chapter (18:15-19) the first prediction of Christ’s prophetic ministry is given. Previous to this, both his kingship (Gen. 49:10) and priesthood (Gen. 14:18-20) had been alluded to.<p class="num"><span class="nm">9.</span> The three words <i>do, keep,</i> and <i>observe,</i> are found 177 times in Deuteronomy. Moses, like James, desired that Israel: <i>“lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls. But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves”</i> (James 1:21-22).<p class="num"><span class="nm">10.</span> Deuteronomy tells us what was the first part of the Bible to be completed and where it was kept (31:9, 24-26).<p class="num"><span class="nm">11.</span> It records the only funeral conducted by God Himself (34:5, 6).<p class="num"><span class="nm">12.</span> The book of Deuteronomy says, in effect, to Israel, look back, look in, look up, look forward, and (lest you sin), look out!<p class="num"><span class="nm">13.</span> The book closes with the second of two great prophetical blessings upon each of the 12 tribes of Israel.
