It also overviews the death of King Saul, the 40-year reign of David and his extensive preparation in gathering the necessary materials to be used in constructing the first temple.<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Bottom Line Introduction</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">AN ISRAELITE WHO’S WHO. AND A PRIESTLY OVERVIEW!<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">General Introduction: Although there is much related material in the New Testament Gospel accounts of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, each is different and unique, written to accomplish a specific task. So it is with the Old Testament books of Second Samuel, the Kings, and the Chronicles. In spite of the many similarities in these parallel accounts, each is written for a specific purpose. Thus:<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">In Second Samuel and First and Second Kings we get a detailed religious history of Judah only. The books of Second Samuel and First and Second Kings emphasize the rulers and prophets, while First and Second Chronicles zero in on the priests and temple. In essence, then, Second Samuel and First and Second Kings viewed the events of the day from an earthly perspective, while First and Second Chronicles saw them through the eyes of heaven. However, both viewpoints are equally inspired, in that Second Samuel parallels First Chronicles; and First and Second Samuel parallel Second Chronicles.<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Facts Regarding the Author of this Book</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> Who? <b>Ezra.</b> He was a gifted Bible teacher, priest and scribe (Ezra 7:1-6, 10) who led the second of three Jewish returns from Persia to Jerusalem (Ezra 7:27, 28).<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> What?
