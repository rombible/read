Although he personally never visited the city (see Col. 2:1), he did spend two years teaching the Word of God in Ephesus at the house of Tyrannus (see Acts 19:9-10). Colosse was only 90 miles east of Ephesus. It is therefore suggested that one of his students during this time was a man from Colosse named Epaphras. After graduating from the two-year T.B.I. (Tyrannus Bible Institute), Epaphras may have gone back to evangelize the entire Lycus Valley. This valley, some ten miles long, contained three important cities: Laodicea, Hierapolis, and Colosse. Laodicea was only 12 miles from Colosse.<p class="num"><span class="nm">14.</span> It is therefore possible that Paul’s zealous young student started both the church in Colosse and the one in Laodicea. (See also Col. 4:16 and Rev. 3:14-22.) The Colossian church was composed mainly of Gentile membership (see Col. 2:13). Paul intended to visit it upon his release from prison (Philem. 22). The church in Colosse may have met in the home of Philemon, for he lived at Colosse with one of his slaves, Onesimus (Col. 4:9 and the book of Philemon). Sometime after its beginning, the church at Colosse was infected by a deadly virus known as Judaistic Gnosticism. This represented the worst of both the Jewish and Greek world of thought. The “J-G virus” consisted of the following:<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Salvation could be obtained only through knowledge. This meant only those with superior intellects could hope to achieve salvation. Faith (belief without materialistic proof) was silly and useless.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Matter itself was evil. The J-G virus taught that the world was created by a series of angelic emanations. In other words, God (the original source) created an angel who in turn created another angel, who created yet a third, etc. Finally the last of these angels created the world as we know it today.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> While this philosophy admitted to the <i>transcendence</i> of God (that he is above everything), it denied his <i>immanence</i> (that he is also in everything). This view immediately ruled out the incarnation of Christ, special divine creation, prayer, faith, miracles, the second coming, and the accuracy of the Bible.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> The goal of human life was either morbid <i>asceticism</i> (avoiding all joys of life, and abusing the body for the spirit’s sake) or that of unrestrained <i>licentiousness</i> (if it feels good, do it). The first was known as Stoicism and the second view Epicureanism. Scofield once observed: “Pure Christianity lives between two dangers ever present: the danger that it will evaporate into a philosophy … and the danger that it will freeze into a form.”<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In conclusion, it may be said that the J-G virus error included dietary and Sabbath observations, circumcision rites, worship of angels, and the practice of asceticism. (See Col. 2:11, 16; 2:18; 2:21-23.)<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">15.</span> Epaphras was apparently unable to deal properly with this vicious strain and thus makes the dangerous and wearisome thousand-mile trip from Colosse to Rome to seek Paul’s advice.<p class="num"><span class="nm">16.</span> When he left Colosse, Archippus assumed the pastorate (Col. 4:17). Archippus may have been the son of Philemon (Philem. 2). Upon reaching Rome and informing Paul, Epaphras was evidently also imprisoned (Philem. 23). This was doubtless because of bold preaching.<p class="num"><span class="nm">17.</span> Paul writes the Colossian epistle to deal with the disease and sends it back by one of his trusted top lieutenants named Tychicus (Col. 4:7; cf. Acts 20:4; Eph. 6:21; 2 Tim. 4:12; Titus 3:12).<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Comparison with Other Bible Books</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> <b>Ephesians:</b><p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Colossians in a sense concludes that which Ephesians introduces. In Ephesians Paul dwells upon the body of the church, while in Colossians he writes of the head of that body. Because of this, both books are somewhat similar.
