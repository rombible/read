Vernon McGee’s introduction to this book of Ephesians: “A quartet of men left Rome in the year A.D. 62, bound for the province of Asia, which was located in what is currently designated as Asia Minor. These men had on their persons four of the most sublime compositions of the Christian faith. These precious documents would be invaluable if they were in existence today. Rome did not comprehend the significance of the writings of an unknown prisoner. If she had, these men would have been apprehended and the documents seized. When they bade farewell to the Apostle Paul, each was given an epistle to bear to his particular constituency. These four letters are designated <i>‘The Prison Epistles of Paul’</i> since he wrote them while imprisoned in Rome, awaiting a hearing before Nero, the Caesar at that time, to whom Paul, as a Roman citizen, had appealed his case.” This quartet of men and their respective places of abode can be identified as:<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Epaphroditus from Philippi (Phil. 4:18) had the epistle to the Philippians.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Tychicus from Ephesus (Eph. 6:21) had the epistle to the Ephesians.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Epaphras from Colosse (Col. 4:12) had the epistle to the Colossians.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Onesimus, a slave from Colosse (Philem. 10) had the epistle to Philemon (who was his master).<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">“These epistles present a composite picture of Christ, the Church, the Christian life, and the interrelationship and functioning of all. These different facets present the Christian life on the highest plane. Ephesians presents the church ‘which is his body’ (Eph. 1:22-23)—this is the invisible church, of which Christ is the Head. Colossians presents Christ, ‘the head of the body, the church’ (Col. 1:18). The emphasis is upon Christ, rather than on the church. Philippians presents Christian living with Christ as the dynamic—<i>‘I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me’</i> (Phil. 4:13). Philemon presents Christian living in action in a pagan society: <i>‘If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself. If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account’</i> (Philem. 17-18). The gospel walked in shoe leather in the first century—it worked” (<i>Exploring Through Ephesians,</i> p. 3). <p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Comparison with Other Bible Books</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> <b>Joshua:</b> Joshua deals with the conquest and possession of the Promised Land, the “earthly realms;” Ephesians deals with our taking possession of our promised “heavenly realms.” <p class="spc"></p><p class="reg"><p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> <b>Colossians:</b><p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> The content of 78 of the 155 verses in Ephesians is repeated in Colossians with only slight differences; 78 out of the 95 verses in Colossians resemble Ephesians.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Both were written by the same author—Paul.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Both were written during the same period of time.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Both are prison epistles.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Ephesians emphasizes the body of Christ, which is the church.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Colossians emphasizes the head of that body, which is Christ himself.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Both exhort the believer to offer up songs of praise (5:19, 20; Col. 3:16, 17).<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> <b>Second Timothy:</b><p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Ephesians was written during Paul’s first Roman imprisonment.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Second Timothy was written during Paul’s final Roman imprisonment.<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Titles for and Types of Jesus</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> Jesus Christ (1:1a)<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> Christ Jesus (1:1b)<p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> Lord Jesus Christ (1:2)<p class="num"><span class="nm">4.</span> The name above all names (1:21)<p class="num"><span class="nm">5.</span> Son of God (4:13)<p class="num"><span class="nm">6.</span> Head of the church (5:23)<p class="num"><span class="nm">7.</span> Loving bridegroom (5:25-33)<p class="num"><span class="nm">8.</span> Master (6:9)<p class="spc"></p></body></html>
