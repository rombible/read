As the book closes Israel has arrived at the eastern bank of the Jordan River overlooking the city of Jericho.<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Bottom Line Introduction</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">THIS IS THE SAD, STRANGE STORY OF A LOST GENERATION.<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">It is sad, for all spiritual failures are tragic.

It is vital to note that the first (wilderness event) was all a part of God’s perfect will for Israel, but decidedly not the second. This fact is strongly emphasized in at least four New Testament books (see Rom. 15:4; 1 Cor. 10:1-13; Heb. 3:7-19; Jude 5).<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> Israel’s actions as recorded in Numbers are aptly summarized in Galatians 5:7: <i>“Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?”</i><p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> In spite of Israel’s terrible sin, God’s grace and love shine throughout Numbers. It is estimated that it would have taken at least 50 railway boxcars of food per day and over 12 million gallons of water per day to provide food and drink for the multitudes. This was faithfully performed for the entire 40-year duration.<p class="num"><span class="nm">4.</span> Numbers records the second of three biblical examples where a brute creature speaks.<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> A serpent speaks in Genesis 3:1<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> A donkey speaks in Numbers 22:28<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> An eagle speaks in Revelation 8:13<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">5.</span> One of the prophecies uttered in Numbers probably brought the wise men to Bethlehem over 13 centuries later.
