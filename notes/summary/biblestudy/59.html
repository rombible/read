The synagogue is mentioned as the place of meeting, rather than the church (see 2:2). It was thus written when the church was still in the circle of Judaism.<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> It is the most Jewish book in the New Testament. M. F. Unger writes: “If the several passages referring to Christ were eliminated, the whole epistle would be as proper in the canon of the Old Testament as it is in the New Testament. In fact, the epistle could be described as an interpretation of the Old Testament law and the Sermon on the Mount in the light of the Gospel of Christ” (<i>Unger’s Bible Handbook,</i> p. 783).<p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> The Greek language of James is of the highest quality.<p class="num"><span class="nm">4.</span> It is the only New Testament book specifically addressed to the 12 tribes (1:1).<p class="num"><span class="nm">5.</span> James gives God’s present-day plan for healing (5:13-18).<p class="num"><span class="nm">6.</span> The epistle provides the most graphic discussion regarding the power of the tongue for good or evil in all the Bible (chapter 3).<p class="num"><span class="nm">7.</span> The absence of key great doctrines in James such as the death and resurrection of Christ caused some to question its right to the canon for a while. Martin Luther referred to it as “a right strawy epistle.”<p class="num"><span class="nm">8.</span> James condemns the greedy rich in some of the most scathing terms found in the Bible (1:10, 11; 5:1-6).<p class="num"><span class="nm">9.</span> He also warns concerning<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> The uncertainty of this life (4:13-15)<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Partiality (2:1-13)<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">10.</span> James, like Jesus, loved to use Old Testament characters and the realm of nature as illustrations.

Martin Luther believed this, and referred to the book as “a right strawy epistle!” James wrote: <i>“Ye see, then, that by works a man is justified and not by faith only”</i> (2:24). Paul wrote: <i>“For by grace are ye saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God; not of works: lest any man should boast”</i> (Eph. 2:8-9). Luther and others were, of course, wrong on this conclusion. There is no contradiction here.

It is said that he spent so much time on his knees in prayer that they became hard and callused like a camel’s knees. He is thought to have been married” (1 Cor. 9:5). (<i>Halley’s Bible Handbook,</i> p. 657).<p class="num"><span class="nm">18.</span> Like Jude, James does not “pull his rank” by pointing out the physical relationship between himself and Christ.
