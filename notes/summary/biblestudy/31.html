Both peoples were the descendants of Esau (Edom) and Jacob (Israel).<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Bottom Line Introduction</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">THE NATION EDOM – SCRIPTURE’S ARROGANT HUMPTY DUMPTY WHO SAT ON A WALL.<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">The book of Obadiah has but one theme, and that is predicting the great fall of Edom. In this case the wall was the lofty mountainous city of Petra. But fall it would, and all of the devil’s men could not put it together again.<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">Edom’s sin was two-fold: pride and treachery. The pride was against God, and the treachery against Israel. On several occasions the nation of Edom had sided with Israel’s enemies in spite of the fact that its people were related to Israel by blood: the Edomites through Esau, and the Israelites through Jacob.<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">Thus, the animosity which began in Rebekah’s womb (Gen. 25:22) is described and denounced by Obadiah. It would reach its high water mark centuries later when a (partial) descendant of Esau would attempt to kill a descendant of Jacob.<p class="spc"></p><p class="ita"><i>“And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him”</i> (Mt. 2:13).<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Facts Regarding the Author of this Book</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> Who? <b>Obadiah.</b> He authored the shortest Old Testament book.<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> What?
