In no other biblical book do we find the intimacy and intensity of love’s language as employed here.<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Bottom Line Introduction</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">HOW DO I LOVE THEE? LET ME COUNT THE WAYS.<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">This book is the most intimate one in the entire Bible. Of the 1,005 songs composed by Solomon (1 Kings 4:32) this was his “song of songs” (1:1). Jewish tradition says that Solomon wrote the song in his youth, the book of Proverbs in his middle years, and Ecclesiastes during his final years.<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">As with the book of Esther, the name of God does not appear in the Song of Solomon. The Song is the only biblical book that includes a chorus, somewhat similar to the style used by the ancient Greek dramas at a later date.<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">As in all other biblical writings, there is only one correct interpretation, with several possible applications. Most would interpret this as the literal account of the wooing and winning of a peasant girl by King Solomon. However, the applications are several.<p class="spc"></p><p class="capletter"><span class="cap">A.</span> It serves to show God’s love for Israel.<p class="spc"></p><p class="ita"><i>“And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt”</i> (Deut. 4:37).<p class="spc"></p><p class="capletter"><span class="cap">B.</span> It provides a model for that quality of love God desires to see between a man and his wife.<p class="spc"></p><p class="ita"><i>“Husbands, love your wives …”</i> (Eph. 5:25a).<p class="ita"><i>“So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies.

Gillow writes the following regarding the Song of Solomon:<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">“Amid the current deluge of marriage manuals and sensational guides to liberated lovemaking, one small, beautiful book deserves all the attention the others are clamoring for, but it lies misunderstood and largely neglected. Few people realize the One who created us male and female also provided us with specific instructions as to how we best respond as men and women.<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">“Solomon’s writing takes the form of a lyric idyll, a kind of love song. In a lyric idyll, speeches and events don’t necessarily follow in chronological order. It’s like a movie with several flashbacks; the story remains temporarily suspended while the audience views a scene from the past. This explains the lack of chronological sequence in the song.<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">“Another feature of lyric idylls is the chorus. This is an imaginary group that interrupts certain scenes to make brief speeches or to give warnings. The writer uses the chorus as a literary device to make transitions from one scene to another or to emphasize a point.<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">“The book is a series of fifteen reflections of a married woman, Solomon’s queen, as she looks back at the events leading to the marriage, the wedding night, and their early years together. These ‘reflections’ are expressed in fifteen short love songs.” (<i>Solomon on Sex.</i> Nelson Publisher, pp. 7, 8)<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">4.</span> The Song of Solomon is one of only two Bible books that do not mention the name of God.
