Although they were not written as doctrinal treatises, nor primarily to present the author’s general theological views, they contain a well-rounded body of theological teaching. Paul and those who received his epistles believed in one living God (1 Thess. 1:9), the Father (2 Thess. 1:2), who has loved men and has chosen them to enjoy His salvation (2 Thess. 2:16; 1 Thess. 2:4). He has sent deliverance from wrath through Jesus Christ, His Son (1 Thess. 1:10), and has revealed this deliverance through the message of the gospel (1 Thess. 1:5; 2:9; 2 Thess. 2:14). This message has been confirmed and has been made real by the power of the Holy Spirit (1 Thess. 1:5; 4:8). The gospel concerns the Lord Jesus Christ, who was killed by the Jews (1 Thess. 2:15). He rose from the dead (1 Thess. 1:10; 4:14; 5:10). He is now in heaven (1 Thess. 1:10), but He will come again (1 Thess. 2:19; 4:15; 5:23; 2 Thess. 2:1). To Him is ascribed deity, for He is called Lord (1 Thess. 1:6), God’s Son (1 Thess. 1:10), and the Lord Jesus Christ (1 Thess. 1:1, 3; 5:28; 2 Thess. 1:1). Believers (1) receiving the word of God (1 Thess. 1:6), (2) turn from idols, serve God and wait for the return of Christ (1 Thess. 1:9-10). Their normal growth is in sanctification (1 Thess. 4:3, 7; 2 Thess. 2:13). In personal life they are to be clean (1 Thess. 4:4-6), industrious (1 Thess. 4:11-12), prayerful (1 Thess. 5:17), and cheerful (1 Thess. 5:16). Theoretically and practically the Thessalonian letters embody all the essentials of Christian truth” (<i>New Testament Survey,</i> p. 283).<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Comparison with Other Bible Books</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> <b>Second Thessalonians:</b><p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Paul wrote 1 Thessalonians to tell his converts they had not missed the rapture.
