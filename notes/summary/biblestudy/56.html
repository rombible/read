This island, southeast of Greece, was about 150 miles long and 35 miles wide, thus making it the largest of the Mediterranean islands. It was an island of 100 cities, consist-ing of mountains, but also very fertile valleys. The highest mountain, Mount Ida, was the traditional birthplace of the Greek god Zeus. The Cretans were relatives of the Philistines. They had a notorious reputation of being <i>“always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons”</i> (Titus 1:12, NASB). This testimony came from one of their own poets and prophets. <p class="num"><span class="nm">5.</span> This verse (1:12) marks the final of two occasions where Paul quotes from a non-biblical source (see Acts 17:28 for the other). <p class="num"><span class="nm">6.</span> Titus thus may have had the most challenging congregation in all the Bible!
