But sometime between the resurrection and ascension both men were gloriously saved. They were present (along with their mother Mary) in the Upper Room just prior to Pentecost (Acts 1:13).<p class="num"><span class="nm">4.</span> Jude was apparently married and was accompanied by his wife as he performed missionary work (1 Cor. 9:5).<p class="num"><span class="nm">5.</span> “The beginning of the age of the Church is described in the Acts of the Apostles. The end of the Church Age is set forth in the Epistle of Jude, which might well be called the Acts of the Apostates. Jude is the only book in all God’s Word entirely devoted to the great apostasy which is to come upon Christendom before the Lord Jesus Christ returns. This brief message of 25 verses is the vestibule to the Revelation … without Jude, the prophetic picture which begins with the teachings of Christ in the gospels and develops throughout the epistles would be incomplete. (See Lk. 18:8; 2 Thess. 2:3; 1 Tim. 4:1; 2 Tim. 4:3; 2 Pet. 2:1; 3:3). Jude brings the teachings of the entire Bible about apostasy to a tremendous climax. He takes us back to the very dawn of human history. We are reminded of apostasy at the gate of Eden and within God’s ancient people Israel. Our thoughts are turned to princes and prophets, to saints and sinners, to eternal fire and everlasting darkness, to the sea and to the stars, to past judgments and future glory” (Dr. S. Maxwell Coder, <i>Jude, the Acts of the Apostates,</i> pp. 3-4).<p class="num"><span class="nm">6.</span> Jude can be compared to 2 Peter. <p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Both epistles give the marks of false teachers.<p class="spc"></p><p class="letter"><span class="let">a.</span> See 2 Pet. 2:1-3, 10-22.<p class="letter"><span class="let">b.</span> See Jude 4, 10-19.<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Peter placed the ministry of false teachers in the future (2:1), whereas Jude saw them as already present (v. 4).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Both epistles refer to fallen angels (2 Pet. 2:4; Jude 6).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Both mention Sodom and Gomorrah (2 Pet. 2:6; Jude 7).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Both use Balaam as an example of apostasy (2 Pet. 2:15-16; Jude 11).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Both liken apostasy to waterless clouds (2 Pet. 2:17; Jude 12).<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">7.</span> Jude has been called the Judges of the New Testament.<p class="num"><span class="nm">8.</span> Jude refers to two non-canonical books.

It is a question now of how much worse it can become before genuine believers are taken out by the rapture” (J. Vernon McGee, <i>Through the Bible, </i>p. 293).<p class="num"><span class="nm">10.</span> It is the first of two New Testament books referring to Michael the archangel.
