They are Eli the priest, Samuel the prophet, Saul the king, and David the shepherd.<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> This book also serves as an encouragement and a warning to Christian parents to raise their children in the Lord. Note Hannah’s beautiful words of dedication as she gives her child to God: <i>“For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him: Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there”</i> (1:27-28).<p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> But not all God’s servants practiced such dedication. Both Eli and Samuel would raise up ungodly and worthless sons (see 2:12-17, 22-25; 8:1-5). In fact, scripture describes three tragic instances in which God himself stepped in and actually executed ungodly sons of godly fathers.<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> <i>First occasion:</i> The death of Judah’s boys, Er and Onan (Gen. 38:7-10)<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> <i>Second occasion:</i> The deaths of Aaron’s boys, Nadab and Abihu (Lev. 10:1-2)<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> <i>Third occasion:</i> The deaths of Eli’s boys, Hophni and Phinehas (2:34; 4:11)<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">4.</span> Much of Israel’s history centers around its three sacred buildings, the tabernacle of Moses, and the temples of Solomon and Herod. All three were eventually destroyed by its enemies.<p class="num"><span class="nm">5.</span> In First Samuel 4 we read of the destruction of the first building. The Philistines destroyed the tabernacle of Moses (chapter 4). The Babylonians destroyed the temple of Solomon (2 Kings 25). The Romans destroyed the temple of Herod (Mt. 24:1-2; Lk. 21:20-24).<p class="num"><span class="nm">6.</span> The book of First Samuel tells of a divine midnight visit and of a devilish midnight visit. The first occurred when God spoke to the young boy Samuel in the temple about the future (chapter 3). The second took place when Saul consulted with a witch in Endor about the future (chapter 28). This second account is probably the strangest story in all the Bible.<p class="num"><span class="nm">7.</span> First Samuel shows the dangers of making demands on God, specifically Israel’s desire to have a king just as their pagan neighbors had (8:4, 20). On the other hand, 1 Samuel records the fulfillment of the ancient prophecy that Israel’s kings would come from the tribe of Judah (Gen. 49:8-12).<p class="num"><span class="nm">8.</span> First Samuel records the awesome power of the Ark of the Covenant (5, 6).<p class="num"><span class="nm">9.</span> It illustrates the tragedy involved of asking for the right thing, but at the wrong time for the wrong reasons (8:1-9).<p class="num"><span class="nm">10.</span> It warns us just how God views prayerlessness (12:23).<p class="num"><span class="nm">11.</span> It demonstrates how far-reaching and devastating a believer’s sin can affect others (21:1-9; 22:6-19).<p class="num"><span class="nm">12.</span> It describes for us the fearful consequences involved in turning one’s back on God (28:5, 6). See also Prov. 1:24-31.<p class="num"><span class="nm">13.</span> In First Samuel we witness the agony of a dying mother and the ecstasy of a dedicated prophet. The agony is seen in the word <i>Ichabod. “And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her. And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it. And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband. And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken”</i> (4:19-22).<p class="num"><span class="nm">14.</span> The ecstasy is seen in the word <i>Ebenezer. “And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel. And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Bethcar. Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the LORD helped us”</i> (7:10-12).<p class="num"><span class="nm">15.</span> Samuel was history’s first circuit riding preacher, traveling yearly from Ramah, to Bethel, to Gilgal, to Mizpeh (see 7:15-17). At this time he established several “Bible schools” for Israel’s prophets. These were located at Gilgal, Jericho, and Bethel (see 1 Sam. 10:10; 1 Kings 18:13; 2 Kings 2:3, 5; 6:1-2).<p class="num"><span class="nm">16.</span> In First Samuel we find one of scripture’s greatest passages on obedience and true human worth.<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> On obedience: <i>“And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams”</i> (15:22).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> On true human worth:<i> “But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart”</i> (16:7).<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">17.</span> This book describes the world’s tallest man (Goliath, measuring ten feet in height, 17:4), and scripture’s most beautiful friendship (between Jonathan and David, 18:1). It also provides us with the first extended example of demon possession. Saul was the man possessed (see 16:14; 18:10).<p class="num"><span class="nm">18.</span> In First Samuel we have the first of several recorded conversations carried on by individuals who had previously left this earth in death (compare 28:15-19 with Lk. 16:23-31; Rev. 6:9-10; 7:9-10).<p class="num"><span class="nm">19.</span> Finally this is the first biblical book to quote from a noncanonical source (see 24:13).<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Comparison with Other Bible Books</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg"><b>The Saul of 1 Samuel and the Saul (Paul) of the New Testament:</b><p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Both were from the tribe of Benjamin (9:1-2; Phil. 3:5); the first was tall and impressive in appearance (9:2), while the second was probably unimpressive (2 Cor. 10:10).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> The first began as God’s friend and ended as God’s enemy (10:6-7; 28:6); the second began as God’s enemy and ended as God’s friend (Acts 9:1; 2 Tim. 4:18).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> The life of the first was characterized by disobedience (13:13; 15:22-23); the life of the second was characterized by obedience (Acts 26:13-19).<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg"><b>The Book of Acts:</b><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">As has been previously observed, First Samuel serves as a bridge book, linking the account with that of the monarchy.
