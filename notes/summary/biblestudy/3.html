It also describes details regarding the duties of the priests, the five Levitical offerings and the seven annual feasts.<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Bottom Line Introduction</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">HERE IT IS . . . HEAVEN’S HANDBOOK ON HOLINESS<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">Leviticus is a divine manual, or heavenly handbook on the subject of holiness. Note the appearance of the following words:<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Holy, and its root meaning, used over 100 times<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Sacrifice, 42 times<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Priest, 189 times<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Blood, used 86 times<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">This holiness is both vertical and horizontal. Thus:<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> The vertical message of chapters 1-10 is <i>I am Holy.</i><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> The horizontal message of chapters 11-27 is <i>Be Ye Holy.</i><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">Jesus may well have had the book of Leviticus in mind when he informed the Samaritan woman: <i>“God is a Spirit; and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth”</i> (Jn. 4:24). No other book in the Bible affirms divine inspiration so frequently as Leviticus. Some 50 times it records God speaking directly to Moses or Aaron.<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Facts Regarding the Author of this Book</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> Who? <b>Moses.</b> He was the younger brother of Aaron and Miriam (Ex. 6:20; Num. 26:59) who led his people Israel out of Egyptian bondage (Ex. 5-14) and gave them the law of God at Mt.

The first three celebrated God’s work in creation, while the final six spoke of his work in redemption. The last six in fact (Lev. 23) offer the most panoramic preview of New Testament prophecy found in the Old Testament. They speak of Calvary, the resurrection, Pentecost, the Second Coming, the great tribulation, and the glorious millennium.<p class="num"><span class="nm">4.</span> The phrase <i>the Lord said</i> appears more than 50 times in Leviticus—more than in any other Bible book.<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Comparison with Other Bible Books</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">Leviticus can be contrasted with Exodus. In Exodus we read how God got His people out of Egypt. In Leviticus we see the attempt of God to get Egypt out of His people! Leviticus stands in relationship to Exodus as the Epistles stand in relationship to the Gospels. In Exodus and the Gospels is seen the manifestation of the Passover Lamb! In Exodus we read of God’s approach to us, but in Leviticus of our approach to God!<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">In Exodus Christ is the Savior, but in Leviticus He is the sanctifier. In the former book he spoke from Sinai, but here from the sanctuary. Leviticus gives us the second of two great symbols for sin in the Old Testament. It is leprosy (13-14). The other is leaven, as described in Exodus 12:15-20. The triumph and tragedy of the book are closely related. The former was the divine consecration of Israel’s first high priest (8-9), while the latter was the divine destruction of his two boys for blasphemy (10).<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Titles for and Types of Jesus</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> The Burnt Offering (1:3-17; 6:8-13) signifies Jesus’ complete dedication to the Father (Mt. 26:39-44; Phil. 2:5-11; Heb. 10:4-7).<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> The Grain Offering (2:1-16; 6:14-18; 7:12, 13) signifies Jesus’ perfect humanity (Heb. 4:15; 1 Jn. 3:5).<p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> The Peace Offering (3:1-17; 7:11-21, 28-34) signifies the peace Jesus gives to the believer (Rom. 5:1; Col. 1:20).<p class="num"><span class="nm">4.</span> The Sin Offering (4:1-5:13; 6:24-30) signifies Jesus was made sin for us (2 Cor. 5:21).<p class="num"><span class="nm">5.</span> The Trespass Offering (5:14-6:7; 7:1-7) signifies Jesus also became our trespass offering (Col. 2:13).<p class="num"><span class="nm">6.</span> The Anointed High Priest (8:7-12).
