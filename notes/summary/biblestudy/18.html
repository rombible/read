Second, the unkind and untrue charges from Job’s friends, all of whom conclude his terrible ordeal is a direct result of personal sin. Third, the eventual and complete restoration of Job.<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Bottom Line Introduction</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">ARE YOUR EARS BURNING? GOD MAY HAVE MENTIONED YOUR NAME TO SATAN THIS MORNING.<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">Job is the story of what happened to a man when God did this very thing. The book of Job may be the oldest in the Bible. This is seen by the following:<p class="spc"></p><p class="capletter"><span class="cap">A.</span> The many ancient historical allusions, such as the pyramids (3:14), the cities of the plains (15:28), and the great flood (22:16).<p class="capletter"><span class="cap">B.</span> The omission of Israel’s history. There is no reference to the law, the Exodus of Israel, the Red Sea crossing, or any of the kings of Israel.<p class="capletter"><span class="cap">C.</span> The usage of the ancient patriarchal name for God, El Shaddai. It is used 31 times in Job (see 5:17; 6:4).<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Facts Regarding the Author of this Book</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> Who? <b>Job.</b> He was an historical person, mentioned by both Ezekiel (Ezek. 14:14, 20), and James (Jas. 5:11), falsely accused by both Satan and his friends, but vindicated by God (Job 1, 2, 42).<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> What?

The name Job literally means, “Where is the Father?” This is one of the two Old Testament books giving a brief glimpse of the confrontation activities going on in heaven. The other book is Zechariah. Compare Job 1-2 with Zechariah 2. The book deals with a great misconception, namely, that suffering is always caused by personal sin. Thus, Job’s three “friends” like the apostles in the New Testament (Jn. 9:2), mistakenly concluded (as have also some modern faith healers) that all sickness results from sinfulness. As this book brings out, nothing could be further from the truth. Job’s three friends and the young preacher boy who later appears in the book are interesting characters indeed.<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Eliphaz, a descendant of Esau (Gen. 36:11), was the theologian, basing his advice on observation and experience. His was the voice of philosophy (4:8; 5:17).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Bildad, a descendant of Abraham and Keturah (Gen. 25:2), was the historian and legalist, basing his advice on tradition. His was the voice of history (8:8).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Elihu, a descendant of Nahor, Abraham’s father (Gen. 22:21), was the intellectual, basing his advice on education. His was the voice of logic (37:23).<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> The statements from Job’s friends cannot be used for doctrinal purposes, for they were also wrong in calling Job a hypocrite (8:12; 15:34; 20:5; 34:30). God, however, had found no fault in Job (1:8; 2:3).<p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> Job was an historical character, mentioned later by both Ezekiel (Ezek. 14:14, 20) and James in the New Testament (James 5:11). His disease may have been leprosy, complicated with elephantiasis, one of the most loathsome and painful diseases known in the world of his time.<p class="num"><span class="nm">4.</span> This book may be the only biblical one to refer to ancient dinosaurs (see 40:15; 41:1). It also provides for us the most extended description of the world’s early history before man (see 38-39). Other scientific statements tell us the earth is suspended in space (26:7), and that it is a sphere (22:14).<p class="num"><span class="nm">5.</span> This book presents Satan as doing what he does best, namely, slandering Christians (compare Job 1:9-11; 2:4-5 with Zech. 3:1 and Rev. 12:10).<p class="num"><span class="nm">6.</span> Job also reveals a very precious truth, that Satan cannot tempt or afflict a believer without the express permission of God himself (1:12; 2:6). Furthermore, in the New Testament we are told God knows just how much we can bear, and will not let Satan go beyond that point (see 1 Cor. 10:13).<p class="num"><span class="nm">7.</span> One of the first (and finest) statements on future bodily resurrection of believers in the Word of God is found in Job: <i>“For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God”</i> (19:25-26). <p class="num"><span class="nm">8.</span> The book of Job records three questions which are asked by all generations, in all places, throughout all of human history!
