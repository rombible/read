He apparently wrote both letters from prison in Rome, though possibly from Ephesus (see <a href="../../../scholar-notes/niv-study-bible/intro-to-philippians/">Introduction to Philippians</a>: Author, Date and Place of Writing; see also chart, p. 2261).</p>

</div><h3 class="h-custom-headline h4"><span>Recipient, Background and Purpose</span></h3><div class="x-text"><p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2155" src="/wp-content/uploads/person.gif" alt="person" width="25" height="25" />Paul wrote this letter to Philemon, a believer in Colosse who, along with others, was a slave owner (cf.<a href="https://www.biblica.com/bible/?osis=NIV:Col.4.1">Col 4:1</a>; for slavery in the NT see note on <a href="https://www.biblica.com/bible/?osis=NIV:Eph.6.5">Eph 6:5</a>). One of his slaves, Onesimus, had apparently stolen from him (cf. <a href="https://www.biblica.com/bible/?osis=NIV:Phlm.1.18">v. 18</a>) and then run away, which under Roman law was punishable by death. But Onesimus met Paul and through his ministry became a Christian (see <a href="https://www.biblica.com/bible/?osis=NIV:Phlm.1.10">v. 10</a>). Now he was willing to return to his master, and Paul writes this personal appeal to ask that he be accepted as a Christian brother (see <a href="https://www.biblica.com/bible/?osis=NIV:Phlm.1.16">v. 16</a>).</p>

</div><h3 class="h-custom-headline h4"><span>Approach and Structure</span></h3><div class="x-text"><p>To win Philemon’s willing acceptance of Onesimus, Paul writes very tactfully and in a lighthearted tone, which he creates with a wordplay (see note on <a href="https://www.biblica.com/bible/?osis=NIV:Phlm.1.11">v. 11</a>). The appeal (vv. <a href="https://www.biblica.com/bible/?osis=NIV:Phlm.1.4-Phlm.1.21">4–21</a>) is organized in a way prescribed by ancient Greek and Roman teachers: to build rapport (vv. <a href="https://www.biblica.com/bible/?osis=NIV:Phlm.1.4-Phlm.1.10">4–10</a>), to persuade the mind (vv.<a href="https://www.biblica.com/bible/?osis=NIV:Phlm.1.11-Phlm.1.19">11–19</a>) and to move the emotions (vv. <a href="https://www.biblica.com/bible/?osis=NIV:Phlm.1.20-Phlm.1.21">20–21</a>). The name Onesimus is not mentioned until the rapport has been built (<a href="https://www.biblica.com/bible/?osis=NIV:Phlm.1.10">v. 10</a>), and the appeal itself is stated only near the end of the section to persuade the mind (<a href="https://www.biblica.com/bible/?osis=NIV:Phlm.1.17">v. 17</a>).</p>
