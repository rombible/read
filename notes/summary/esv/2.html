It also appears that some language and references were updated for later readers. There is no consensus among scholars as to the date when the events of the exodus took place. A common view is that the exodus occurred in c. 1446 <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">b.c.</span></span> This is based on the calculation of 480 years from Israel’s departure from Egypt to the fourth year of Solomon’s reign (c. 966 <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">b.c.</span></span>; see <a class="bible" href="/1+Kings+6%3A1/" title="1 Kings 6:1">1 Kings 6:1</a>). However, because <a class="bible" href="/Exodus+1%3A11/" title="Exodus 1:11">Exodus 1:11</a> depicts Israel working on a city called Raamses, some scholars believe that this would suggest that the exodus occurred during the reign of Raamses II in Egypt (c. 1279–1213 <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">b.c.</span></span>), possibly around 1260 <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">b.c.</span></span> (see note on <a class="bible" href="/1+Kings+6%3A1/" title="1 Kings 6:1">1 Kings 6:1</a>).</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-exodus-theme">Theme</h2> <p>The overarching theme of <a class="bible" href="/Exodus+1%3A1%E2%80%9340%3A38/" title="Exodus 1:1–40:38">Exodus</a> is the fulfillment of God’s promises to the patriarchs. The success of the exodus must be credited to the power and purpose of God, who remembers his promises, punishes sin, and forgives the repentant. The book highlights Moses’ faithfulness and prayerfulness.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-exodus-key-themes">Key Themes</h2> <ol><li class="key-themes"><em>Covenant promises.</em> The events and instructions in <a class="bible" href="/Exodus+1%3A1%E2%80%9340%3A38/" title="Exodus 1:1–40:38">Exodus</a> are described as the Lord remembering his covenant promises to Abraham (<a class="bible" href="/Exodus+2%3A24%2C+3%3A6%2C+3%3A14%E2%80%9317%2C+6%3A2%E2%80%938/" title="Exodus 2:24, 3:6, 3:14–17, 6:2–8">2:24; 3:6, 14–17; 6:2–8</a>).

They include land (which Israel will inhabit), numerous offspring (which will secure their ongoing identity), and blessing (God cares for them and other nations). The fulfillment of these promises is rooted in Israel’s covenant relationship with the Lord (<a class="bible" href="/Genesis+17%3A7%E2%80%938/" title="Genesis 17:7–8">Gen. 17:7–8</a>).</li> <li class="key-themes"><em>Covenant mediator.</em> Moses mediates between the Lord and his people.
