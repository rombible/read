During this time the Assyrians were occupied with matters elsewhere in the empire, allowing Jeroboam II to capture much of Syria for Israel. The Lord called Jonah to go to the great Assyrian city of Nineveh to pronounce judgment upon it. Jonah attempted to escape the Lord’s calling by sailing to Tarshish, which was probably in the western Mediterranean. Eventually he obeyed the Lord and went to Nineveh, at the heart of the Assyrian Empire.</p> <p class="image"> <a class="object-full" href="https://static.esvmedia.org/media/esv-global-study-bible/images/big/map_32_01.jpg"> <img src="https://static.esvmedia.org/media/esv-global-study-bible/images/medium/map_32_01.jpg" alt="The Setting of Jonah" width="700" height="536"/> </a> </p> </div> </div>
