He began his ministry in 520 <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">b.c.</span></span>, shortly after Haggai had begun his prophetic work.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-zechariah-background">Background</h2> <p>Nearly 20 years after returning from the Babylonian exile in the time of Cyrus (538 <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">b.c.</span></span>), God’s people were discouraged. The foundation of the temple had been laid shortly after the initial return, in 536 <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">b.c.</span></span>, but powerful opposition had prevented any further progress on rebuilding the temple. And, there was little evidence of the kind of spiritual renewal that the earlier prophets had anticipated. Jewish sovereignty had not been restored. A moral reformation of the people had not occurred. Jerusalem was still only partially rebuilt and had no significance among the surrounding nations. Under the circumstances, many people concluded that theirs was a “day of small things” (<a class="bible" href="/Zechariah+4%3A10/" title="Zechariah 4:10">4:10</a>) in which God was absent from his people. Many viewed faithful obedience as useless. It seemed to make more sense to forget God and to pursue the best life possible.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-zechariah-key-themes">Key Themes</h2> <ol><li class="key-themes">The need for turning to the Lord in repentance (<a class="bible" href="/Zechariah+1%3A1%E2%80%936/" title="Zechariah 1:1–6">1:1–6</a>) and serving him with sincerity (ch. <a class="bible" href="/Zechariah+7%3A1%E2%80%9314/" title="Zechariah 7:1–14">7</a>).</li> <li class="key-themes">The Lord’s concern and care for his people’s difficulties (<a class="bible" href="/Zechariah+1%3A8%E2%80%9317%2C+4%3A10/" title="Zechariah 1:8–17, 4:10">1:8–17; 4:10</a>).</li> <li class="key-themes">Jerusalem’s future expansion and blessing (<a class="bible" href="/Zechariah+2%3A4%2C+2%3A12%2C+8%3A1%E2%80%938%2C+14%3A16/" title="Zechariah 2:4, 2:12, 8:1–8, 14:16">2:4, 12; 8:1–8; 14:16</a>).</li> <li class="key-themes">The complete and permanent removal of the people’s sin (chs. <a class="bible" href="/Zechariah+3%3A1%E2%80%9310%2C+5%3A1%E2%80%9311/" title="Zechariah 3:1–10, 5:1–11">3; 5</a>), and the removal of false prophecy and idolatry from the land (<a class="bible" href="/Zechariah+13%3A2%E2%80%936/" title="Zechariah 13:2–6">13:2–6</a>).</li> <li class="key-themes">The importance of the temple as the source of God’s blessing (ch. <a class="bible" href="/Zechariah+4%3A1%E2%80%9314/" title="Zechariah 4:1–14">4</a>).</li> <li class="key-themes">The Lord’s wrath at the nations that plundered Judah and Jerusalem (<a class="bible" href="/Zechariah+1%3A18%E2%80%9321%2C+14%3A3%E2%80%935/" title="Zechariah 1:18–21, 14:3–5">1:18–21; 14:3–5</a>).</li> <li class="key-themes">The Divine Warrior’s return to terrorize Israel’s foes (<a class="bible" href="/Zechariah+9%3A1%E2%80%938/" title="Zechariah 9:1–8">9:1–8</a>), and the coming of the Branch, a Davidic ruler who will save his people, cleanse their sins, and establish peace (<a class="bible" href="/Zechariah+3%3A8%2C+6%3A9%E2%80%9315%2C+9%3A9%E2%80%9310/" title="Zechariah 3:8, 6:9–15, 9:9–10">3:8; 6:9–15; 9:9–10</a>).</li> <li class="key-themes">The pouring out of God’s Spirit, resulting in repentance and the opening of a fountain for the cleansing of sin (<a class="bible" href="/Zechariah+12%3A10%E2%80%9313%3A1/" title="Zechariah 12:10–13:1">12:10–13:1</a>).</li> <li class="key-themes">Judgment on the wicked shepherds of God’s people and their replacement by a good shepherd (<a class="bible" href="/Zechariah+11%3A1%E2%80%9317/" title="Zechariah 11:1–17">11:1–17</a>).</li> <li class="key-themes">The striking of the good shepherd and the scattering of the flock (<a class="bible" href="/Zechariah+13%3A7%E2%80%939/" title="Zechariah 13:7–9">13:7–9</a>).</li> <li class="key-themes">The Lord’s final triumph over the nations (ch. <a class="bible" href="/Zechariah+14%3A1%E2%80%9321/" title="Zechariah 14:1–21">14</a>).</li> </ol> <h2 id="introduction-to-zechariah-outline">Outline</h2> <ol><li class="outline">Oracles and Visions (<a class="bible" href="/Zechariah+1%3A1%E2%80%938%3A23/" title="Zechariah 1:1–8:23">1:1–8:23</a>) <ol><li class="outline">Introduction: return to me and I will return to you (<a class="bible" href="/Zechariah+1%3A1%E2%80%936/" title="Zechariah 1:1–6">1:1–6</a>)</li> <li class="outline">Eight night visions and a sign-act (<a class="bible" href="/Zechariah+1%3A7%E2%80%936%3A15/" title="Zechariah 1:7–6:15">1:7–6:15</a>)</li> <li class="outline">From fasts to feasts (<a class="bible" href="/Zechariah+7%3A1%E2%80%938%3A23/" title="Zechariah 7:1–8:23">7:1–8:23</a>)</li> </ol> </li> <li class="outline">The Return of the King (<a class="bible" href="/Zechariah+9%3A1%E2%80%9314%3A21/" title="Zechariah 9:1–14:21">9:1–14:21</a>) <ol><li class="outline">The first oracle: leaders and their people (<a class="bible" href="/Zechariah+9%3A1%E2%80%9311%3A17/" title="Zechariah 9:1–11:17">9:1–11:17</a>)</li> <li class="outline">The second oracle: the people and their leaders (<a class="bible" href="/Zechariah+12%3A1%E2%80%9314%3A21/" title="Zechariah 12:1–14:21">12:1–14:21</a>)</li> </ol> </li> </ol> <h2 id="introduction-to-zechariah-the-near-east-at-the-time-of-zechariah">The Near East at the Time of Zechariah</h2> <div class="object map" id="map-38-01-embedded"> <h4>c. 520 <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">b.c.</span></span></h4> <p>Zechariah prophesied to the people of Judah soon after they had returned from exile in Babylon.
