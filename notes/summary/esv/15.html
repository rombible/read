It is possible Ezra may have combined the other materials with his autobiographical writings to form the book. Or, a later historian may have collected all the portions to describe Israelite history from c. 538–433 <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">b.c.</span></span> Many scholars believe that the same author wrote Ezra, Nehemiah, and 1–<a class="bible" href="/2+Chronicles+1%3A1%E2%80%9336%3A23/" title="2 Chronicles 1:1–36:23">2 Chronicles</a>. In ancient times, Ezra and Nehemiah were counted as one book. The events narrated in Ezra–Nehemiah occur over a century: <a class="bible" href="/Ezra+1%3A1%E2%80%936%3A22/" title="Ezra 1:1–6:22">Ezra 1–6</a> covers 538–515 <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">b.c.</span></span>; <a class="bible" href="/Ezra+7%3A1%E2%80%9328/" title="Ezra 7:1–28">Ezra 7</a>–<a class="bible" href="/Nehemiah+13%3A1%E2%80%9331/" title="Nehemiah 13:1–31">Nehemiah 13</a> covers 458–433 <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">b.c.</span></span></p> <h2 id="introduction-to-ezra-theme">Theme</h2> <p>The theme of Ezra is faithfulness to the Lord, both in keeping the Mosaic law (<a class="bible" href="/Ezra+7%3A6/" title="Ezra 7:6">7:6</a>) and in worship. Because of his concern about worship, Ezra stresses the importance of rebuilding the temple.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-ezra-purpose-occasion-and-background">Purpose, Occasion, and Background</h2> <p>As the people return from exile in Babylon to the Promised Land, they are under threat from the non-Jews living there. Having been driven from the land previously because of their sin, they also need to learn once again how to live in covenant with God. The land must be restored through the physical presence of God’s people, and the people must revive a spiritual commitment to serve God alone. As the temple is rebuilt and more exiles come back to the land, the people start to reestablish the nation that God had promised Abraham. As the priests return and begin to teach the people how to love God and live according to his ways, the people recommit themselves to the Lord.</p> <p>The book of <a class="bible" href="/Ezra+1%3A1%E2%80%9310%3A44/" title="Ezra 1:1–10:44">Ezra</a> encourages the postexilic community toward pure worship and holy behavior. Ezra calls the people back to covenant loyalty and obedience to the Mosaic law. The book rejoices in God’s provision in returning them to the land, rebuilding the temple, and calling his people back to himself. The book also warns against falling away again through sin and against serving other gods. The remnant of Israel should persevere in hope, repent in humility, and live in obedience.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-ezra-key-themes">Key Themes</h2> <ol><li class="key-themes">The Lord is faithful to his promises, and his mercy is greater than his anger (<a class="bible" href="/Ezra+9%3A13/" title="Ezra 9:13">9:13</a>).</li> <li class="key-themes">The Lord works providentially by all means, especially through powerful rulers, to bring about his greater purposes (e.g., <a class="bible" href="/Ezra+6%3A22/" title="Ezra 6:22">6:22</a>).</li> <li class="key-themes">The exiles are the remnant of Israel, the “holy race” (<a class="bible" href="/Ezra+9%3A2%2C+9%3A8/" title="Ezra 9:2, 9:8">9:2, 8</a>).

In Ezra, this is shown especially in the rebuilding of the temple and in the proper ordering of its services.
