It was probably written about <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">a.d.</span></span> 40–45 to Jewish Christians living outside Palestine.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-james-theme">Theme</h2> <p>Christians must live out their faith. They should be doers, not just hearers, of God’s Word.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-james-purpose">Purpose</h2> <p>James’s readers were suffering persecution and living in poverty. They were in social and spiritual conflict. Many believers were living in a worldly manner. James corrects them and challenges them to seek God’s wisdom to work out these problems.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-james-key-themes">Key Themes</h2> <ol><li class="key-themes">God is a gracious giver, the unchanging Creator, and merciful and compassionate. He is also a Judge, the one and only God, a jealous God, a gracious God, and a healing God (<a class="bible" href="/James+1%3A5%2C+1%3A17%E2%80%9318%2C+2%3A5%2C+2%3A13%2C+2%3A19%2C+4%3A5%E2%80%936%2C+5%3A1%E2%80%933%2C+5%3A9%2C+5%3A15/" title="James 1:5, 1:17–18, 2:5, 2:13, 2:19, 4:5–6, 5:1–3, 5:9, 5:15">1:5, 17–18; 2:5, 13, 19; 4:5–6; 5:1–3, 9, 15</a>).</li> <li class="key-themes">Wisdom comes “from above.” It enables believers to withstand trials and to have peace rather than divisions among themselves (<a class="bible" href="/James+1%3A5%2C+3%3A13%2C+3%3A17/" title="James 1:5, 3:13, 3:17">1:5; 3:13, 17</a>).</li> <li class="key-themes">God allows tests and trials (<a class="bible" href="/James+1%3A2%E2%80%934/" title="James 1:2–4">1:2–4</a>), but temptation comes from self and Satan.

This would mean it was sent throughout most of the ancient Mediterranean world.
