If Judah repents and abandons its evil ways, “perhaps” God will forgive (<a class="bible" href="/Zephaniah+2%3A3/" title="Zephaniah 2:3">2:3</a>). Regardless, God’s judgment will lead to renewal for Judah and other peoples (<a class="bible" href="/Zephaniah+3%3A9%E2%80%9320/" title="Zephaniah 3:9–20">3:9–20</a>).</p> <p>The book declares judgment on many nations, all of which opposed God through opposition to his people. The last nation warned is Judah herself (<a class="bible" href="/Zephaniah+3%3A1%E2%80%937/" title="Zephaniah 3:1–7">3:1–7</a>).
