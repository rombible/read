No author is named, but the mention of David and his genealogy (<a class="bible" href="/Ruth+4%3A17%E2%80%9322/" title="Ruth 4:17–22">4:17–22</a>) places the writing sometime after David became king (<a class="bible" href="/2+Samuel+2%3A1%E2%80%9332/" title="2 Samuel 2:1–32">2 Samuel 2</a>) in c. 1010 <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">b.c.</span></span></p> <h2 id="introduction-to-ruth-theme">Theme</h2> <p>Ruth shows how God’s people can experience his sovereignty, wisdom, and covenant kindness. These often come in hard circumstances and are expressed through the kindness of others.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-ruth-key-themes">Key Themes</h2> <ol><li class="key-themes"><em>Kindness.</em> Ruth shows kindness to her mother-in-law, Naomi, by leaving her homeland to care for her (<a class="bible" href="/Ruth+1%3A16%E2%80%9317%2C+2%3A11%2C+2%3A18%2C+2%3A23/" title="Ruth 1:16–17, 2:11, 2:18, 2:23">1:16–17; 2:11, 18, 23</a>). Boaz shows kindness to Ruth as he welcomes her to Israel, acts as her kinsman-redeemer (<a class="bible" href="/Ruth+4%3A9%E2%80%9310/" title="Ruth 4:9–10">4:9–10</a>), and marries her (<a class="bible" href="/Ruth+4%3A13/" title="Ruth 4:13">4:13</a>). Human kindness reflects the Lord’s kindness toward his people (see <a class="bible" href="/Exodus+15%3A13/" title="Exodus 15:13">Ex. 15:13</a>; <a class="bible" href="/Deuteronomy+7%3A8%E2%80%939/" title="Deuteronomy 7:8–9">Deut. 7:8–9</a>; <a class="bible" href="/Psalms+136%3A1%E2%80%9326/" title="Psalms 136:1–26">Psalm 136</a>).</li> <li class="key-themes"><em>Redemption.</em> Redemption is linked to kindness and is at the heart of the story (<a class="bible" href="/Ruth+2%3A20/" title="Ruth 2:20">2:20</a>). The book of <a class="bible" href="/Ruth+1%3A1%E2%80%934%3A22/" title="Ruth 1:1–4:22">Ruth</a> describes two legal practices combined into one: property redemption by a near kinsman, and levirate marriage. Property redemption by a relative assured that land would not remain outside the family (see <a class="bible" href="/Leviticus+25%3A23%E2%80%9325/" title="Leviticus 25:23–25">Lev. 25:23–25</a>). Levirate marriage involved a childless widow marrying her husband’s brother to provide an heir for the deceased husband (<a class="bible" href="/Deuteronomy+25%3A5%E2%80%936/" title="Deuteronomy 25:5–6">Deut. 25:5–6</a>). Boaz, a close relative of Ruth, redeemed the family property for her (<a class="bible" href="/Ruth+4%3A9/" title="Ruth 4:9">Ruth 4:9</a>), married her (<a class="bible" href="/Ruth+4%3A10%2C+4%3A13/" title="Ruth 4:10, 4:13">4:10, 13</a>), and fathered Obed (<a class="bible" href="/Ruth+4%3A13%2C+4%3A17/" title="Ruth 4:13, 4:17">4:13, 17</a>), who became heir to the property of Ruth’s deceased first husband.</li> </ol> <p>Ruth and Naomi’s desperate conditions changed for the better (<a class="bible" href="/Ruth+4%3A13%E2%80%9317/" title="Ruth 4:13–17">4:13–17</a>) when Boaz agreed to be their kinsman-redeemer (<a class="bible" href="/Ruth+4%3A9%E2%80%9310/" title="Ruth 4:9–10">4:9–10</a>). This resulted in blessing for Ruth (marriage and motherhood; <a class="bible" href="/Ruth+4%3A13/" title="Ruth 4:13">4:13</a>) and for Naomi (happiness in her old age; <a class="bible" href="/Ruth+4%3A14%E2%80%9315/" title="Ruth 4:14–15">4:14–15</a>). Redemption also brought blessing to the community (<a class="bible" href="/Ruth+4%3A11%E2%80%9312/" title="Ruth 4:11–12">4:11–12</a>) and, through David, to the nation (<a class="bible" href="/Ruth+4%3A14%2C+4%3A17/" title="Ruth 4:14, 4:17">4:14, 17</a>). Ultimate redemption would finally come through David’s “son,” Jesus the Christ. In him, redeemed people of all nations, no longer strangers and aliens, become fellow citizens in God’s household (<a class="bible" href="/Ephesians+2%3A11%E2%80%9322/" title="Ephesians 2:11–22">Eph. 2:11–22</a>).</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-ruth-outline">Outline</h2> <ol><li class="outline">Introduction: Naomi’s Family Dies (<a class="bible" href="/Ruth+1%3A1%E2%80%935/" title="Ruth 1:1–5">1:1–5</a>)</li> <li class="outline">Scene 1: Naomi Returns to Bethlehem with Ruth (<a class="bible" href="/Ruth+1%3A6%E2%80%9322/" title="Ruth 1:6–22">1:6–22</a>)</li> <li class="outline">Scene 2: Ruth Gleans in Boaz’s Field (<a class="bible" href="/Ruth+2%3A1%E2%80%9323/" title="Ruth 2:1–23">2:1–23</a>)</li> <li class="outline">Scene 3: Ruth, at the Threshing Floor, Asks Boaz to Marry Her (<a class="bible" href="/Ruth+3%3A1%E2%80%9318/" title="Ruth 3:1–18">3:1–18</a>)</li> <li class="outline">Scene 4: Boaz Arranges Redemption at the Gate (<a class="bible" href="/Ruth+4%3A1%E2%80%9312/" title="Ruth 4:1–12">4:1–12</a>)</li> <li class="outline">Conclusion: Naomi Blessed with a New Family (<a class="bible" href="/Ruth+4%3A13%E2%80%9317/" title="Ruth 4:13–17">4:13–17</a>)</li> <li class="outline">Genealogy: Extended Blessing (<a class="bible" href="/Ruth+4%3A18%E2%80%9322/" title="Ruth 4:18–22">4:18–22</a>)</li> </ol> <h2 id="introduction-to-ruth-the-setting-of-ruth">The Setting of Ruth</h2> <div class="object map" id="map-08-01-embedded"> <p>A famine in Judah forces Naomi and her husband to leave Israel and move to Moab, where their sons marry Moabite women.
