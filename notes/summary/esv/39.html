He called the people to renewed covenant obedience.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-malachi-purpose-occasion-and-background">Purpose, Occasion, and Background</h2> <p>Malachi’s ministry took place nearly a hundred years after the decree of Cyrus in 538 <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">b.c.</span></span>, which ended the Babylonian captivity and allowed the Jews to return to their homeland and rebuild the temple (<a class="bible" href="/2+Chronicles+36%3A23/" title="2 Chronicles 36:23">2 Chron. 36:23</a>). This was some 80 years after Haggai and Zechariah encouraged the rebuilding of the temple. Those two earlier prophets had said that the rebuilding of the temple would result in peace, prosperity, the conversion of people from other nations, and the return of God’s own glorious presence (see <a class="bible" href="/Haggai+2%3A1%E2%80%9323/" title="Haggai 2:1–23">Haggai 2</a>; <a class="bible" href="/Zechariah+1%3A16%E2%80%9317%2C+2%3A1%E2%80%9313%2C+8%3A1%E2%80%939%3A17/" title="Zechariah 1:16–17, 2:1–13, 8:1–9:17">Zech. 1:16–17; 2:1–13; 8:1–9:17</a>). To the discouraged people of Malachi’s day, these predictions must have seemed a cruel mockery. In contrast to the glowing promises, they faced economic difficulties due to drought and crop failure (<a class="bible" href="/Malachi+3%3A11/" title="Malachi 3:11">Mal. 3:11</a>). They remained an insignificant territory, no longer an independent nation and no longer ruled by a Davidic king. Worst of all, despite the promise of God’s presence, they experienced only spiritual decline.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-malachi-the-setting-of-malachi">The Setting of Malachi</h2> <div class="object map" id="map-39-01-embedded"> <h4>c. 460 <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">b.c.</span></span></h4> <p>Malachi likely prophesied several decades after the first Jewish exiles had returned from Babylon to Judea and had rebuilt the temple. Edomites had migrated northwest from their traditional homeland just south of Moab into the area immediately south of Judea, which was now called Idumea. Territory that once belonged to the northern kingdom of Israel had been divided into several minor provinces, including Samaria.</p> <p class="image"> <a class="object-full" href="https://static.esvmedia.org/media/esv-global-study-bible/images/big/map_39_01.jpg"> <img src="https://static.esvmedia.org/media/esv-global-study-bible/images/medium/map_39_01.jpg" alt="The Setting of Malachi" width="688" height="700"/> </a> </p> </div> <h2 id="introduction-to-malachi-key-themes-and-outline-malachis-sixfold-wake-up-call-to-renewed-covenant-obedience">Key Themes and Outline: Malachi’s Sixfold Wake-up Call to Renewed Covenant Obedience</h2> <p>The book of <a class="bible" href="/Malachi+1%3A1%E2%80%934%3A6/" title="Malachi 1:1–4:6">Malachi</a> describes six disputations between God and Israel. There is a common pattern in each dispute: (<a class="bible" href="/Malachi+1%3A1%E2%80%9314/" title="Malachi 1:1–14">1</a>) God charges his people with bad behavior; (<a class="bible" href="/Malachi+2%3A1%E2%80%9317/" title="Malachi 2:1–17">2</a>) he then envisages the people’s response to the charge (“But you say”; <a class="bible" href="/Malachi+1%3A2%2C+1%3A6%2C+1%3A7%2C+1%3A13%2C+2%3A14%2C+2%3A17%2C+3%3A7%2C+3%3A8%2C+3%3A13/" title="Malachi 1:2, 1:6, 1:7, 1:13, 2:14, 2:17, 3:7, 3:8, 3:13">1:2, 6, 7, 13; 2:14, 17; 3:7, 8, 13</a>); (<a class="bible" href="/Malachi+3%3A1%E2%80%9318/" title="Malachi 3:1–18">3</a>) God then replies to their presumed response and expands the charge. The chart below shows the subject of each dispute and God’s response to it.</p> <p/> </div>
