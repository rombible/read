There are also two batches of sayings from a group called “the wise” (<a class="bible" href="/Proverbs+22%3A17%E2%80%9324%3A22%2C+24%3A23%E2%80%9334/" title="Proverbs 22:17–24:22, 24:23–34">22:17–24:22; 24:23–34</a>), and “oracles” from Agur (<a class="bible" href="/Proverbs+30%3A1%E2%80%9333/" title="Proverbs 30:1–33">30:1–33</a>) and Lemuel (<a class="bible" href="/Proverbs+31%3A1%E2%80%939/" title="Proverbs 31:1–9">31:1–9</a>). No author is named for the song in praise of the excellent wife that ends the book (<a class="bible" href="/Proverbs+31%3A10%E2%80%9331/" title="Proverbs 31:10–31">31:10–31</a>). Although <a class="bible" href="/Proverbs+1%3A1%E2%80%9331%3A31/" title="Proverbs 1:1–31:31">Proverbs</a> was begun in the time of Solomon, it probably was not in its present form until the time of Hezekiah (reigned c. 715–686 <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">b.c.</span></span>).</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-proverbs-theme">Theme</h2> <p>The goal of the book is stated right at the beginning (<a class="bible" href="/Proverbs+1%3A1%E2%80%937/" title="Proverbs 1:1–7">1:1–7</a>): to describe what wisdom is and to help God’s people become wise. Wisdom is founded in the “fear of the Lord,” and it enables believers to express their faith in the practical details of everyday life.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-proverbs-audience">Audience</h2> <p>The book is addressed to a young man. The situations he will face while he is young receive much attention. These situations supply concrete examples from which all readers can apply lessons to their own lives. Anyone who is wise and who pays attention will benefit (<a class="bible" href="/Proverbs+1%3A5/" title="Proverbs 1:5">1:5</a>) from this instruction.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-proverbs-reading-proverbs">Reading Proverbs</h2> <p>The reader of <a class="bible" href="/Proverbs+1%3A1%E2%80%9331%3A31/" title="Proverbs 1:1–31:31">Proverbs</a> must seek to understand the various types of people the book describes. The most obvious characters in the book are the wise, the fool, and the simple. <a class="bible" href="/Proverbs+1%3A1%E2%80%9331%3A31/" title="Proverbs 1:1–31:31">Proverbs</a> urges its readers to be wise, which means embracing God’s covenant and living out the covenant in everyday situations (compare <a class="bible" href="/Proverbs+2%3A2%2C+10%3A1/" title="Proverbs 2:2, 10:1">2:2; 10:1</a>). The fool is the person who constantly opposes God’s covenant (<a class="bible" href="/Proverbs+1%3A7/" title="Proverbs 1:7">1:7b</a>). The simple is the person who is not firmly committed, either to wisdom or to folly; he is easily misled (<a class="bible" href="/Proverbs+14%3A15/" title="Proverbs 14:15">14:15</a>).</p> <p>The first nine chapters of <a class="bible" href="/Proverbs+1%3A1%E2%80%9331%3A31/" title="Proverbs 1:1–31:31">Proverbs</a> are “wisdom poems” that urge the reader to pursue wisdom. The main section of <a class="bible" href="/Proverbs+1%3A1%E2%80%9331%3A31/" title="Proverbs 1:1–31:31">Proverbs</a>—the concise, memorable statements of two or three lines—begins in <a class="bible" href="/Proverbs+10%3A1/" title="Proverbs 10:1">10:1</a>. <a class="bible" href="/Proverbs+1%3A1%E2%80%9331%3A31/" title="Proverbs 1:1–31:31">Proverbs</a> often seem to be mere observations about life, but their deeper meanings will reveal themselves if the following questions are kept in mind: (<a class="bible" href="/Proverbs+1%3A1%E2%80%9333/" title="Proverbs 1:1–33">1</a>) What virtue does this proverb commend? (<a class="bible" href="/Proverbs+2%3A1%E2%80%9322/" title="Proverbs 2:1–22">2</a>) What vice does it disapprove of? (<a class="bible" href="/Proverbs+3%3A1%E2%80%9335/" title="Proverbs 3:1–35">3</a>) What value does it affirm?</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-proverbs-key-themes">Key Themes</h2> <p><a class="bible" href="/Proverbs+1%3A1%E2%80%9331%3A31/" title="Proverbs 1:1–31:31">Proverbs</a> offers wisdom on a wide array of topics from daily life: diligence and laziness (<a class="bible" href="/Proverbs+6%3A6%E2%80%9311/" title="Proverbs 6:6–11">6:6–11</a>); friendship (<a class="bible" href="/Proverbs+3%3A27%E2%80%9328%2C+18%3A24/" title="Proverbs 3:27–28, 18:24">3:27–28; 18:24</a>); speech (<a class="bible" href="/Proverbs+10%3A19%E2%80%9321/" title="Proverbs 10:19–21">10:19–21</a>); marriage (<a class="bible" href="/Proverbs+18%3A22%2C+19%3A14/" title="Proverbs 18:22, 19:14">18:22; 19:14</a>); child rearing (<a class="bible" href="/Proverbs+22%3A6/" title="Proverbs 22:6">22:6</a>); domestic peace (<a class="bible" href="/Proverbs+15%3A17%2C+17%3A1/" title="Proverbs 15:17, 17:1">15:17; 17:1</a>); work (<a class="bible" href="/Proverbs+11%3A1/" title="Proverbs 11:1">11:1</a>); getting along and good manners (<a class="bible" href="/Proverbs+23%3A1%E2%80%932%2C+25%3A16%E2%80%9317%2C+26%3A17%E2%80%9319%2C+27%3A14/" title="Proverbs 23:1–2, 25:16–17, 26:17–19, 27:14">23:1–2; 25:16–17; 26:17–19; 27:14</a>); eternity (<a class="bible" href="/Proverbs+14%3A32%2C+23%3A17%E2%80%9318/" title="Proverbs 14:32, 23:17–18">14:32; 23:17–18</a>); and much more.
