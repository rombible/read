It was probably written c. <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">a.d.</span></span> 62, while Paul was in prison in Rome (<a class="bible" href="/Acts+27%3A1%E2%80%9328%3A31/" title="Acts 27:1–28:31">Acts 27–28</a>). This was about the same time he wrote <a class="bible" href="/Ephesians+1%3A1%E2%80%936%3A24/" title="Ephesians 1:1–6:24">Ephesians</a> and Philemon. All three letters were sent with Tychicus and Onesimus.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-colossians-theme">Theme</h2> <p>Christ is Lord over all of creation, including the invisible realm. He has redeemed his people, enabling them to participate in his death, resurrection, and fullness.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-colossians-purpose-occasion-and-background">Purpose, Occasion, and Background</h2> <p>A dangerous teaching was threatening the church at Colossae, one that lessened Christ’s role and undermined the new identity of believers “in Christ” (<a class="bible" href="/Colossians+1%3A2%2C+1%3A28/" title="Colossians 1:2, 1:28">1:2, 28</a>). Paul wrote to warn against this false teaching and to encourage the believers in their growth toward Christian maturity. He emphasizes Christ’s authority over all evil powers. Christians are united with the risen Christ, and therefore they share in his power and authority. Paul also encourages these believers to fight against sin, pursue holiness, and live as distinctively Christian households.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-colossians-key-themes">Key Themes</h2> <ol><li class="key-themes">Jesus Christ is preeminent over all creation, Lord over all human rulers and cosmic powers (<a class="bible" href="/Colossians+1%3A15%E2%80%9320%2C+2%3A9%E2%80%9310%2C+3%3A1/" title="Colossians 1:15–20, 2:9–10, 3:1">1:15–20; 2:9–10; 3:1</a>).</li> <li class="key-themes">God has acted through Christ to secure redemption and reconciliation for all who put their faith in him (<a class="bible" href="/Colossians+1%3A13%E2%80%9314%2C+1%3A20%E2%80%9322/" title="Colossians 1:13–14, 1:20–22">1:13–14, 20–22</a>).</li> <li class="key-themes">Believers are in Christ, and so they share in Christ’s death, resurrection, new life, and his fullness (<a class="bible" href="/Colossians+2%3A9%E2%80%9314%2C+3%3A1%E2%80%934/" title="Colossians 2:9–14, 3:1–4">2:9–14; 3:1–4</a>).</li> <li class="key-themes">Christ has defeated the powers of darkness on the cross.

The church at Colossae was likely established during Paul’s third missionary journey as he ministered for three years in Ephesus. It appears that Paul did not personally plant the church there, but instead a Colossian named Epaphras traveled to Ephesus, responded to Paul’s gospel message, and returned to share the good news in Colossae.</p> <p class="image"> <a class="object-full" href="https://static.esvmedia.org/media/esv-global-study-bible/images/big/map_51_01.jpg"> <img src="https://static.esvmedia.org/media/esv-global-study-bible/images/medium/map_51_01.jpg" alt="The Setting of Colossians" width="700" height="658"/> </a> </p> </div> </div>
