He probably wrote in <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">a.d.</span></span> 49–51 from Corinth during his second missionary journey (<a class="bible" href="/Acts+18%3A1%E2%80%9318/" title="Acts 18:1–18">Acts 18:1–18</a>).</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-1-thessalonians-theme">Theme</h2> <p>The main theme is Jesus’ second coming. When he returns, the dead who have believed in Christ will rise and will join the living to meet the Lord in the air (<a class="bible" href="/1+Thessalonians+4%3A15%E2%80%9317/" title="1 Thessalonians 4:15–17">4:15–17</a>).

God, who is faithful, will produce in them the holiness he requires (<a class="bible" href="/1+Thessalonians+5%3A24/" title="1 Thessalonians 5:24">5:24</a>).</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-1-thessalonians-purpose">Purpose</h2> <p>Paul has received a report from Timothy about the Thessalonian church. Paul writes to them to restore their hope, which has been tested by unexpected deaths in the church. He reassures them that both the dead and the living believers will be safe at the second coming (<a class="bible" href="/1+Thessalonians+4%3A13%E2%80%935%3A11/" title="1 Thessalonians 4:13–5:11">4:13–5:11</a>).

Paul and his companions had established the church in Thessalonica but were forced to leave by opponents of the gospel. Later, Paul sent Timothy back to Thessalonica to check on the church there, and Timothy’s report led Paul to write this letter. Thessalonica enjoyed privileged status as the capital of Macedonia and was located on a natural harbor along the busy east-west Egnatian Way.</p> <p class="image"> <a class="object-full" href="https://static.esvmedia.org/media/esv-global-study-bible/images/big/map_52_01.jpg"> <img src="https://static.esvmedia.org/media/esv-global-study-bible/images/medium/map_52_01.jpg" alt="The Setting of 1 Thessalonians" width="669" height="700"/> </a> </p> </div> </div>
