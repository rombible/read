The letter was probably written in the mid-60s <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">a.d.</span></span> between Paul’s first imprisonment (<a class="bible" href="/Acts+28%3A1%E2%80%9331/" title="Acts 28:1–31">Acts 28</a>) and his second imprisonment, which is not mentioned in <a class="bible" href="/Acts+1%3A1%E2%80%9328%3A31/" title="Acts 1:1–28:31">Acts</a>.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-titus-theme">Theme</h2> <p>The letter’s theme is the unbreakable link between faith and practice, belief and behavior. This truth is the basis for Paul’s criticism of false teaching, his instruction in Christian living, and standards he sets for church leaders.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-titus-purpose">Purpose</h2> <p>Paul had recently completed a journey to Crete. He had left Titus there to teach the new church (see <a class="bible" href="/Acts+14%3A21%E2%80%9323/" title="Acts 14:21–23">Acts 14:21–23</a>).</p> <p>False teachers were already a problem in the church (<a class="bible" href="/Titus+1%3A10%E2%80%9316/" title="Titus 1:10–16">Titus 1:10–16</a>), and the letter focuses primarily on that issue. The description of elders (<a class="bible" href="/Titus+1%3A5%E2%80%939/" title="Titus 1:5–9">1:5–9</a>) and of proper Christian living (<a class="bible" href="/Titus+2%3A1%E2%80%9310%2C+3%3A1%E2%80%933/" title="Titus 2:1–10, 3:1–3">2:1–10; 3:1–3</a>) appear to be worded for intentional contrast with these false teachers. The content of the false teaching is not fully explained (as in <a class="bible" href="/1+Timothy+1%3A1%E2%80%936%3A21/" title="1 Timothy 1:1–6:21">1 Timothy</a>). There appears to be a significant Jewish element to the teaching. The opponents come from “the circumcision party” (<a class="bible" href="/Titus+1%3A10/" title="Titus 1:10">Titus 1:10</a>). They are interested in “Jewish myths” (<a class="bible" href="/Titus+1%3A14/" title="Titus 1:14">1:14</a>) and perhaps ritual purity (<a class="bible" href="/Titus+1%3A15/" title="Titus 1:15">1:15</a>). Paul’s primary concern, however, is with the practical effect of the false teaching. They taught ritual purity, but they lived in a way that proved they did not know God (<a class="bible" href="/Titus+1%3A16/" title="Titus 1:16">1:16</a>).</p> <p>This false teaching would have been welcome in Crete, which was known in the ancient world for immorality. But Paul expected the gospel to produce real godliness in everyday life, even in Crete.</p> <p>In dealing with the false teaching, Paul also provides Titus with a portrait of a healthy church. He describes proper leadership (<a class="bible" href="/Titus+1%3A5%E2%80%939/" title="Titus 1:5–9">1:5–9</a>), proper handling of error (<a class="bible" href="/Titus+1%3A10%E2%80%9316%2C+3%3A9%E2%80%9311/" title="Titus 1:10–16, 3:9–11">1:10–16; 3:9–11</a>), proper Christian living (especially important for new believers in an immoral setting; <a class="bible" href="/Titus+2%3A1%E2%80%9310%2C+3%3A1%E2%80%932/" title="Titus 2:1–10, 3:1–2">2:1–10; 3:1–2</a>), and the gospel as the source of godliness (<a class="bible" href="/Titus+2%3A11%E2%80%9314%2C+3%3A3%E2%80%937/" title="Titus 2:11–14, 3:3–7">2:11–14; 3:3–7</a>).</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-titus-key-themes">Key Themes</h2> <ol><li class="key-themes">The gospel produces godliness in the lives of believers.
