It contains some of his own records, but he is not the author of the entire book. The same author probably wrote Nehemiah and portions of Ezra. Nehemiah arrived in Jerusalem in 445 <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">b.c.</span></span>, 13 years after Ezra arrived. He returned for a further visit sometime between 433 and 423 <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">b.c.</span></span> He may have made several journeys between Persian capitals and Jerusalem in this period of 20 years (see <a class="object" href="/resources/esv-global-study-bible/chart-16-01/">chart</a>).</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-nehemiah-theme">Theme</h2> <p>The theme of Nehemiah is the Lord’s protection of his people and their need to be faithful in worship and in keeping the Mosaic law.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-nehemiah-purpose-and-background">Purpose and Background</h2> <p>The basic purpose and background of Nehemiah are the same as that for Ezra (see <a class="internal" href="/resources/esv-global-study-bible/introduction-to-ezra/#introduction-to-ezra">Introduction to Ezra</a>). Ezra, “a scribe skilled in the Law of Moses” (<a class="bible" href="/Ezra+7%3A6/" title="Ezra 7:6">Ezra 7:6</a>), called the returning exiles back to covenant loyalty and obedience to the law. Nehemiah rebuilt the city walls so that the community could be protected from enemies who might take advantage of them.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-nehemiah-key-themes">Key Themes</h2> <ol><li class="key-themes">The Lord hears prayer (<a class="bible" href="/Nehemiah+1%3A4%E2%80%936/" title="Nehemiah 1:4–6">1:4–6</a>).</li> <li class="key-themes">The Lord works providentially, especially through powerful rulers, to bring about his greater purposes (e.g., <a class="bible" href="/Nehemiah+2%3A8/" title="Nehemiah 2:8">2:8</a>).</li> <li class="key-themes">The Lord protects his people.
