He prophesied sometime between 793–739 <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">b.c.</span></span>, probably nearer the end of that period.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-amos-theme">Theme</h2> <p>The theme of Amos is the universal justice of God. The Israelites clearly expected a “day of the Lord” when all their enemies would be judged (<a class="bible" href="/Amos+1%3A2%E2%80%932%3A5/" title="Amos 1:2–2:5">1:2–2:5</a>). What they were not prepared for was that they too would be judged (<a class="bible" href="/Amos+2%3A6%E2%80%939%3A10/" title="Amos 2:6–9:10">2:6–9:10</a>). In fact, they would be held more accountable than their neighbors.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-amos-purpose-occasion-and-background">Purpose, Occasion, and Background</h2> <p>After about 780–745 <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">b.c.</span></span>, the Assyrian Empire was unable to continue the pressure it had put on the nations of the Canaanite coast during the previous century. At this same time, both Judah and Israel were blessed with fairly stable governments. As a result of these two factors, the two nations (especially Israel) were experiencing a time of wealth and prosperity. But what the Israelites saw as the beginning of a new “Golden Age” was really the end for them. It was Amos’s unhappy task to tell them of God’s coming judgment. Within just a few years Israel would no longer exist as a nation. They would continue to exist as a scattered people only by God’s unmerited grace (<a class="bible" href="/Amos+9%3A11%E2%80%9315/" title="Amos 9:11–15">9:11–15</a>). “The day of the Lord,” far from being a day of blessing, was going to be a day of darkness. By 722 <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">b.c.</span></span> Assyria would regain its strength, and the Israelites would be conquered and exiled.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-amos-key-themes">Key Themes</h2> <ol><li class="key-themes">The Lord is the Creator of the universe. Therefore his ethical norms are universal, and all people are subject to judgment in light of them.</li> <li class="key-themes">Justice and righteousness in the treatment of other people are the key evidences of a right relationship to the Lord.</li> <li class="key-themes">Religious observances in the absence of social justice are disgusting to God.</li> <li class="key-themes">Israel’s covenant with the Lord did not guarantee special protection for them when they broke that covenant. Rather, it meant that they would be held to a higher standard of obedience.</li> <li class="key-themes">Thus, the “day of the <span class="divine-name small-caps"><span class="small-caps-upper">L</span><span class="small-caps-lower">ord</span></span>” would not be a time of miraculous deliverance for unrepentant Israel. Rather, it would be a time of terrible destruction.</li> <li class="key-themes">A faithful remnant of Israel would be preserved and would someday see glorious restoration and blessing.</li> </ol> <h2 id="introduction-to-amos-outline">Outline</h2> <ol><li class="outline">Superscription (<a class="bible" href="/Amos+1%3A1/" title="Amos 1:1">1:1</a>)</li> <li class="outline">Oracles of Judgment (<a class="bible" href="/Amos+1%3A2%E2%80%936%3A14/" title="Amos 1:2–6:14">1:2–6:14</a>)</li> <li class="outline">Visions of Judgment (<a class="bible" href="/Amos+7%3A1%E2%80%939%3A15/" title="Amos 7:1–9:15">7:1–9:15</a>)</li> </ol> <h2 id="introduction-to-amos-the-near-east-at-the-time-of-amos">The Near East at the Time of Amos</h2> <div class="object map" id="map-30-01-embedded"> <h4>c. 750 <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">b.c.</span></span></h4> <p>Amos likely prophesied to Israel during the decades just before the fall of Samaria to the Assyrian Empire.
