Nothing is known of his genealogy. The specific mention of the “second year of Darius” (<a class="bible" href="/Haggai+1%3A1/" title="Haggai 1:1">1:1</a>) places the book in the year 520 <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">b.c.</span></span></p> <h2 id="introduction-to-haggai-historical-background">Historical Background</h2> <p>Haggai ministered among the Jews who had returned to Judea after some 70 years of exile in Babylon. The Persian ruler Cyrus the Great captured Babylon in 539 <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">b.c.</span></span> In 538 he permitted the Jews to return to Jerusalem so that they might rebuild the temple (<a class="bible" href="/Ezra+1%3A1%E2%80%932%3A70/" title="Ezra 1:1–2:70">Ezra 1–2</a>). The work of rebuilding stalled, however, when opposition arose (<a class="bible" href="/Ezra+3%3A1%E2%80%934%3A5/" title="Ezra 3:1–4:5">Ezra 3:1–4:5</a>). Haggai prophesied in an effort to motivate the people to renew their work of temple restoration.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-haggai-theme">Theme</h2> <p>The work of temple restoration highlights the Lord’s desire to renew a covenant relationship with his people (<a class="bible" href="/Haggai+1%3A13%2C+2%3A4%E2%80%935/" title="Haggai 1:13, 2:4–5">1:13; 2:4–5</a>).</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-haggai-key-themes">Key Themes</h2> <ol><li class="key-themes"><em>The restoration of God’s house</em>. A decaying temple signifies a decaying relationship with the Lord. It brings weakness rather than holiness to the people (<a class="bible" href="/Haggai+2%3A14/" title="Haggai 2:14">2:14</a>).</li> <li class="key-themes"><em>The prophetic word is the divine Word</em>. The prophecy is delivered “by the hand of Haggai” (<a class="bible" href="/Haggai+1%3A1%2C+1%3A3%2C+2%3A1%2C+2%3A10/" title="Haggai 1:1, 1:3, 2:1, 2:10">1:1, 3; 2:1, 10</a>; see <a class="bible" href="/Haggai+2%3A20/" title="Haggai 2:20">2:20</a>) but it is God’s word (e.g., <a class="bible" href="/Haggai+1%3A2%2C+1%3A9%2C+1%3A12%2C+1%3A13/" title="Haggai 1:2, 1:9, 1:12, 1:13">1:2, 9, 12, 13</a>).</li> <li class="key-themes"><em>The Lord is sovereign</em>. The phrase “<span class="divine-name small-caps"><span class="small-caps-upper">L</span><span class="small-caps-lower">ord</span></span> of hosts” occurs 14 times in the 38 verses of this short book (see <a class="bible" href="/Haggai+1%3A2/" title="Haggai 1:2">1:2</a>). The Lord gives the divine word, controls the fortunes of his people (<a class="bible" href="/Haggai+1%3A9%2C+2%3A17%2C+2%3A19/" title="Haggai 1:9, 2:17, 2:19">1:9; 2:17, 19</a>) and nations (<a class="bible" href="/Haggai+2%3A6%E2%80%938/" title="Haggai 2:6–8">2:6–8</a>), directs nature (<a class="bible" href="/Haggai+1%3A10/" title="Haggai 1:10">1:10</a>), motivates his people to action (<a class="bible" href="/Haggai+1%3A14%2C+2%3A4/" title="Haggai 1:14, 2:4">1:14; 2:4</a>), and establishes and removes kingdoms (<a class="bible" href="/Haggai+2%3A20%E2%80%9323/" title="Haggai 2:20–23">2:20–23</a>).</li> <li class="key-themes"><em>The people must work</em>. A restored house will bring pleasure and glory to the Lord (<a class="bible" href="/Haggai+1%3A8/" title="Haggai 1:8">1:8</a>) and blessing to the people (<a class="bible" href="/Haggai+2%3A19/" title="Haggai 2:19">2:19</a>), but there is work to be done. Physical labor is urged (<a class="bible" href="/Haggai+1%3A7%E2%80%938%2C+2%3A4%E2%80%935/" title="Haggai 1:7–8, 2:4–5">1:7–8; 2:4–5</a>). But there is also “heart” work to be done (<a class="bible" href="/Haggai+1%3A5%E2%80%937%2C+2%3A15%E2%80%9319/" title="Haggai 1:5–7, 2:15–19">1:5–7; 2:15–19</a>).</li> <li class="key-themes"><em>The restoration of David’s house</em>. Zerubbabel, the heir of David, is promised high status (<a class="bible" href="/Haggai+2%3A23/" title="Haggai 2:23">2:23</a>). The Lord, who removed the “ring” of the Davidic house (see <a class="bible" href="/Jeremiah+22%3A24%E2%80%9327/" title="Jeremiah 22:24–27">Jer. 22:24–27</a>), now promises that he will restore David’s house.
