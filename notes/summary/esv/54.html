This trip took place after the events described in <a class="bible" href="/Acts+1%3A1%E2%80%9328%3A31/" title="Acts 1:1–28:31">Acts</a>, between Paul’s first and final Roman imprisonments.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-1-timothy-theme">Theme</h2> <p>The letter’s theme is that the gospel leads to practical, visible change in believers’ lives. The true gospel, in contrast to false teaching, must and will always lead to godliness.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-1-timothy-purpose">Purpose</h2> <p>Paul wrote <a class="bible" href="/1+Timothy+1%3A1%E2%80%936%3A21/" title="1 Timothy 1:1–6:21">1 Timothy</a> to advise his coworker Timothy about issues in the church in Ephesus. False teachers are the main cause for the letter. Their teaching apparently involved incorrect assumptions about the law (<a class="bible" href="/1+Timothy+1%3A7%E2%80%9311/" title="1 Timothy 1:7–11">1:7–11</a>) and not allowing marriage and certain foods (<a class="bible" href="/1+Timothy+4%3A1%E2%80%935/" title="1 Timothy 4:1–5">4:1–5</a>). Paul’s real concern is with the results of the false teaching. For example, it promotes mere theories over solid truth (<a class="bible" href="/1+Timothy+1%3A4%2C+6%3A4/" title="1 Timothy 1:4, 6:4">1:4; 6:4</a>). It also leads to arrogance (<a class="bible" href="/1+Timothy+6%3A4/" title="1 Timothy 6:4">6:4</a>) and greed (<a class="bible" href="/1+Timothy+6%3A5%E2%80%9310/" title="1 Timothy 6:5–10">6:5–10</a>). Paul focuses on the fact that true Christianity is shown in lifestyles shaped by the gospel. Those whose lives are not shaped by the gospel have turned away from the faith (<a class="bible" href="/1+Timothy+1%3A6%2C+1%3A19%E2%80%9320%2C+4%3A1%2C+5%3A6%2C+5%3A8%2C+5%3A11%E2%80%9312%2C+5%3A15%2C+6%3A9%E2%80%9310/" title="1 Timothy 1:6, 1:19–20, 4:1, 5:6, 5:8, 5:11–12, 5:15, 6:9–10">1:6, 19–20; 4:1; 5:6, 8, 11–12, 15; 6:9–10</a>).</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-1-timothy-key-themes">Key Themes</h2> <ol><li class="key-themes">The gospel produces holiness in the lives of believers.
