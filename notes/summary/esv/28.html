This period was an extremely difficult time in Israel’s history, just before the northern kingdom went into exile.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-hosea-audience-and-purpose">Audience and Purpose</h2> <p>Hosea’s primary audience was Ephraim (another name for the northern kingdom, Israel), which is mentioned 35 times in the book. Hosea wanted to see Israel turn back to God.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-hosea-background-and-overview">Background and Overview</h2> <p>Israel is the Lord’s bride, but Israel has instead joined itself to Baal, the false god worshiped in Syria-Palestine. Worshiping Baal violates the first of the Ten Com­mandments (<a class="bible" href="/Exodus+20%3A3/" title="Exodus 20:3">Ex. 20:3</a>). It is also a betrayal of God’s intimate union with his people. Therefore Hosea describes it as spiritual adultery, an offense against the marriage between the Lord and Israel. He compares Israel’s spiritual unfaithfulness to the ingratitude of a wayward wife. Such unfaithfulness justifies the Lord’s coming judgment. But punishment is not ultimately what the Lord wants for his people. He desires that they leave their sin. He wants them to return to the One who first loved them and who can provide what is best for them.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-hosea-key-themes">Key Themes</h2> <ol><li class="key-themes">Hosea frequently refers to the Pentateuch, the foundation of Israel’s relationship to God (e.g., <a class="bible" href="/Hosea+1%3A10%2C+6%3A7%2C+7%3A13%2C+9%3A6%E2%80%9310%2C+11%3A1%E2%80%934%2C+12%3A2%E2%80%935%2C+12%3A9%E2%80%9310%2C+12%3A12%E2%80%9313%2C+13%3A4%E2%80%936/" title="Hosea 1:10, 6:7, 7:13, 9:6–10, 11:1–4, 12:2–5, 12:9–10, 12:12–13, 13:4–6">1:10; 6:7; 7:13; 9:6–10; 11:1–4; 12:2–5, 9–10, 12–13; 13:4–6</a>).</li> <li class="key-themes">Hosea stresses divine sovereignty.
