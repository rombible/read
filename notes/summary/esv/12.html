As the titles of the books indicate, 1–<a class="bible" href="/2+Kings+1%3A1%E2%80%9325%3A30/" title="2 Kings 1:1–25:30">2 Kings</a> describe the period of the monarchy in ancient Israel (970–586 <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">b.c.</span></span>), concentrating on the kings who ruled after David.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-1-2-kings-theme">Theme</h2> <p>The books show that Israel suffers again and again because of its great sinfulness (<a class="bible" href="/2+Kings+17%3A7%E2%80%9323%2C+24%3A1%E2%80%934/" title="2 Kings 17:7–23, 24:1–4">2 Kings 17:7–23; 24:1–4</a>). Yet there is still hope for the nation, because God’s chosen family of kings has not come to an end (<a class="bible" href="/2+Kings+25%3A27%E2%80%9330/" title="2 Kings 25:27–30">2 Kings 25:27–30</a>), and God remains ready to forgive those who repent (<a class="bible" href="/1+Kings+8%3A22%E2%80%9361/" title="1 Kings 8:22–61">1 Kings 8:22–61</a>).</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-1-2-kings-purpose-occasion-and-background">Purpose, Occasion, and Background</h2> <p>The fall of Jerusalem to Babylon in 586 <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">b.c.</span></span> raised several questions: Was Israel’s God not in fact in control of history, as Moses had claimed? If the God of Moses did exist, and was good and all-powerful, how was it that God’s chosen city and temple had been destroyed, and his chosen royal family had all but come to its end?</p> <p>The books of Kings respond to such questions, explaining why Israel was defeated. Israel’s God is indeed in control of nature and history. There are no other true gods anywhere. It is this good and all-powerful God who has overseen the destruction of his chosen city and his temple, and Israel’s exile to Babylon. Israel’s sin has caused these punishments.</p> <p>After the division of the kingdom, the northern kingdom of Israel lasted slightly more than 200 years (931–722 <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">b.c.</span></span>), with 19 different kings, all of whom were wicked. The southern kingdom of Judah had the same number of kings, but many of them were good, and Judah lasted almost 150 years longer (931–586 <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">b.c.</span></span>). Toward the end of Judah’s monarchy came two of its best kings: Hezekiah (<a class="bible" href="/2+Kings+18%3A1%E2%80%9320%3A21/" title="2 Kings 18:1–20:21">2 Kings 18:1–20:21</a>) and Josiah (<a class="bible" href="/2+Kings+22%3A1%E2%80%9323%3A30/" title="2 Kings 22:1–23:30">2 Kings 22:1–23:30</a>). Yet the people still rebelled against the Lord, and Judah, like Israel, eventually went into exile as punishment for its sin. But hope remained, for God’s chosen royal line had not come to a complete end (<a class="bible" href="/2+Kings+25%3A27%E2%80%9330/" title="2 Kings 25:27–30">2 Kings 25:27–30</a>), and God remained ready to forgive those who repented.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-1-2-kings-key-themes">Key Themes</h2> <ol><li class="key-themes"><em>Yahweh is the only true God, and he controls nature.</em> There is only one living God, and he is the Lord.
