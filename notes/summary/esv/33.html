This was about the same time as Hosea and Isaiah, though Micah may have served somewhat later. The length of Micah’s public activity may have been about 20 to 25 years.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-micah-theme">Theme</h2> <p>The theme of Micah is judgment and forgiveness. The Lord, the Judge who scatters his people for their sins, is also the Shepherd-King who in covenant faithfulness gathers, protects, and forgives them.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-micah-purpose-and-background">Purpose and Background</h2> <p>Micah writes to bring God’s “lawsuit” against his people (<a class="bible" href="/Micah+3%3A8/" title="Micah 3:8">3:8</a>). He indicts Samaria and Jerusalem for their sins (<a class="bible" href="/Micah+1%3A2%E2%80%937/" title="Micah 1:2–7">1:2–7</a>). Both Assyria (<a class="bible" href="/Micah+5%3A5%E2%80%936/" title="Micah 5:5–6">5:5–6</a>) and Babylon (<a class="bible" href="/Micah+4%3A10/" title="Micah 4:10">4:10</a>) stand ready to carry out God’s judgment. The reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, along with the increasing threat of Assyria, provide the broad background for Micah.</p> <p>Micah lists specific sins of both the northern and southern kingdoms. These sins include idolatry (<a class="bible" href="/Micah+1%3A7%2C+5%3A12%E2%80%9314/" title="Micah 1:7, 5:12–14">1:7; 5:12–14</a>); the seizure of property (<a class="bible" href="/Micah+2%3A2%2C+2%3A9/" title="Micah 2:2, 2:9">2:2, 9</a>); the failure of civil leadership (<a class="bible" href="/Micah+3%3A1%E2%80%933%2C+3%3A9%E2%80%9310%2C+7%3A3/" title="Micah 3:1–3, 3:9–10, 7:3">3:1–3, 9–10; 7:3</a>), religious leadership (<a class="bible" href="/Micah+3%3A11/" title="Micah 3:11">3:11</a>), and prophetic leadership (<a class="bible" href="/Micah+3%3A5%E2%80%937%2C+3%3A11/" title="Micah 3:5–7, 3:11">3:5–7, 11</a>); offering sacrifice without truly repenting (<a class="bible" href="/Micah+6%3A6%E2%80%937/" title="Micah 6:6–7">6:6–7</a>); and corrupt business practices and violence (<a class="bible" href="/Micah+6%3A10%E2%80%9312/" title="Micah 6:10–12">6:10–12</a>).</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-micah-key-themes">Key Themes</h2> <ol><li class="key-themes">The Lord’s character and the people’s sins demand judgment (<a class="bible" href="/Micah+1%3A2%E2%80%935%2C+2%3A3%2C+6%3A1%E2%80%932%2C+6%3A9%E2%80%9311/" title="Micah 1:2–5, 2:3, 6:1–2, 6:9–11">1:2–5; 2:3; 6:1–2, 9–11</a>).
