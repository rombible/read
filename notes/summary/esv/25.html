It was likely written between 586 and 516 <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">b.c.</span></span>, with an early date being more probable.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-lamentations-theme">Theme</h2> <p>The key passage in <a class="bible" href="/Lamentations+1%3A1%E2%80%935%3A22/" title="Lamentations 1:1–5:22">Lamentations</a> is <a class="bible" href="/Lamentations+3%3A19%E2%80%9324/" title="Lamentations 3:19–24">3:19–24</a>, which affirms that belief in God’s mercy and faithfulness is the key to a restored relationship with God. Forgiveness is possible even for people who have deserved God’s judgment (<a class="bible" href="/Lamentations+1%3A18/" title="Lamentations 1:18">1:18</a>). Hope, not despair, is the central theme in <a class="bible" href="/Lamentations+1%3A1%E2%80%935%3A22/" title="Lamentations 1:1–5:22">Lamentations</a>.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-lamentations-purpose">Purpose</h2> <p><a class="bible" href="/Lamentations+1%3A1%E2%80%935%3A22/" title="Lamentations 1:1–5:22">Lamentations</a> was most likely written to be prayed or sung in worship services devoted to asking God’s forgiveness. Such services began as early as the months after the temple’s destruction in 586 <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">b.c.</span></span> (<a class="bible" href="/Jeremiah+41%3A4%E2%80%935/" title="Jeremiah 41:4–5">Jer. 41:4–5</a>).

In later years, <a class="bible" href="/Lamentations+1%3A1%E2%80%935%3A22/" title="Lamentations 1:1–5:22">Lamentations</a> was read and sung as part of annual observances marking the temple’s destruction.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-lamentations-key-themes">Key Themes</h2> <p><a class="bible" href="/Lamentations+1%3A1%E2%80%935%3A22/" title="Lamentations 1:1–5:22">Lamentations</a> presents many key theological realities from an important era in Israel’s history:</p> <ol><li class="key-themes">It includes memorable prayers that confess sin, express renewed hope, and declare total dependence on God’s grace.</li> <li class="key-themes">It is the only book in the Bible written by a person who actually lived through the divine judgment the Bible often refers to as “the day of the Lord” (see <a class="bible" href="/Joel+2%3A1%E2%80%932/" title="Joel 2:1–2">Joel 2:1–2</a>; <a class="bible" href="/Amos+5%3A18/" title="Amos 5:18">Amos 5:18</a>; <a class="bible" href="/Zephaniah+1%3A14%E2%80%9316/" title="Zephaniah 1:14–16">Zeph. 1:14–16</a>).</li> <li class="key-themes">It provides great insight into the nature of pain, sin, and redemption.</li> <li class="key-themes">Like so many other OT passages, <a class="bible" href="/Lamentations+1%3A1%E2%80%935%3A22/" title="Lamentations 1:1–5:22">Lamentations</a> teaches that Jerusalem fell:</li> </ol> <p> a. because of the people’s sins (<a class="bible" href="/Lamentations+1%3A18/" title="Lamentations 1:18">1:18</a>);</p> <p> b. because they rejected God’s word sent through the prophets (<a class="bible" href="/Lamentations+2%3A8%2C+2%3A14%2C+2%3A17/" title="Lamentations 2:8, 2:14, 2:17">2:8, 14, 17</a>);</p> <p> c. because their leaders led them astray (<a class="bible" href="/Lamentations+4%3A13/" title="Lamentations 4:13">4:13</a>).</p> <ol><li class="key-themes">It affirms God’s never-ceasing mercy (<a class="bible" href="/Lamentations+3%3A19%E2%80%9324/" title="Lamentations 3:19–24">3:19–24</a>; compare <a class="bible" href="/Deuteronomy+30%3A1%E2%80%9310/" title="Deuteronomy 30:1–10">Deut. 30:1–10</a>).
