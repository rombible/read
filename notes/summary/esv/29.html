Most scholars date the book after the exile to Babylon (586 <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">b.c.</span></span>).</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-joel-background">Background</h2> <p>Joel calls the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem to lament and return to the Lord during a time of national disaster. A locust plague has destroyed both wine (<a class="bible" href="/Joel+1%3A5%2C+1%3A7%2C+1%3A12/" title="Joel 1:5, 1:7, 1:12">1:5, 7, 12</a>) and grain (<a class="bible" href="/Joel+1%3A10/" title="Joel 1:10">1:10</a>). This threatens the people’s ability to present offerings in the temple (<a class="bible" href="/Joel+1%3A9%2C+1%3A13%2C+1%3A16/" title="Joel 1:9, 1:13, 1:16">1:9, 13, 16</a>).</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-joel-key-themes">Key Themes</h2> <ol><li class="key-themes"><em>Day of the Lord</em>. The dominant theme of the book is the “day of the Lord.” This describes a time when the presence of the Lord brings judgment and/or deliverance and blessing, depending on the circumstances. Therefore, although the “day” results in destruction for the nations, it can also be seen as a time of salvation for God’s people. The Lord remains a refuge in the chaos of judgment (<a class="bible" href="/Joel+3%3A15%E2%80%9316/" title="Joel 3:15–16">3:15–16</a>).</li> <li class="key-themes"><em>Repentance</em>. If the whole community would cry out to the Lord (<a class="bible" href="/Joel+1%3A13%E2%80%9320/" title="Joel 1:13–20">1:13–20</a>) and look to him—not merely with external actions but in sincerity and commitment (<a class="bible" href="/Joel+2%3A12%E2%80%9313/" title="Joel 2:12–13">2:12–13</a>)—then judgment may be prevented. However, the Lord is not bound by the acts of the community (<a class="bible" href="/Joel+2%3A14/" title="Joel 2:14">2:14</a>). It is his decision to either send or withhold the destruction by the locusts (<a class="bible" href="/Joel+1%3A15/" title="Joel 1:15">1:15</a>), just as the army is his to command (<a class="bible" href="/Joel+2%3A11/" title="Joel 2:11">2:11</a>).</li> <li class="key-themes"><em>The Lord in their midst</em>. The reason the Lord will turn from judgment to blessing is to express his covenant-keeping character (<a class="bible" href="/Joel+2%3A13%2C+2%3A18%E2%80%9326%2C+3%3A18/" title="Joel 2:13, 2:18–26, 3:18">2:13, 18–26; 3:18</a>). His promise to dwell in the midst of his people is prominent not only in <a class="bible" href="/Joel+1%3A1%E2%80%933%3A21/" title="Joel 1:1–3:21">Joel</a> (<a class="bible" href="/Joel+2%3A27%2C+3%3A17%2C+3%3A21/" title="Joel 2:27, 3:17, 3:21">2:27; 3:17, 21</a>) but also throughout the OT (<a class="bible" href="/Numbers+35%3A34/" title="Numbers 35:34">Num. 35:34</a>; <a class="bible" href="/Isaiah+12%3A6/" title="Isaiah 12:6">Isa. 12:6</a>; <a class="bible" href="/Zephaniah+3%3A15%2C+3%3A17/" title="Zephaniah 3:15, 3:17">Zeph. 3:15, 17</a>; <a class="bible" href="/Zechariah+2%3A10%E2%80%9311/" title="Zechariah 2:10–11">Zech. 2:10–11</a>). God restores what the locusts have destroyed (<a class="bible" href="/Joel+2%3A27/" title="Joel 2:27">Joel 2:27</a>) and protects Israel as the world crumbles (<a class="bible" href="/Joel+3%3A16%E2%80%9317/" title="Joel 3:16–17">3:16–17</a>) so that the people will know his presence. This theme is restated at the end of the book (<a class="bible" href="/Joel+3%3A21/" title="Joel 3:21">3:21</a>), showing how important it was for Joel.</li> <li class="key-themes">These three themes come together in the <em>promise of the future outpouring of the Spirit </em>(<a class="bible" href="/Joel+2%3A28%E2%80%9332/" title="Joel 2:28–32">2:28–32</a>). This outpouring is associated with the day of the Lord (<a class="bible" href="/Joel+2%3A31/" title="Joel 2:31">2:31</a>) in both its judgmental (<a class="bible" href="/Joel+2%3A30%E2%80%9331/" title="Joel 2:30–31">2:30–31</a>; see <a class="bible" href="/Joel+2%3A10%2C+3%3A15/" title="Joel 2:10, 3:15">2:10; 3:15</a>) and its saving (<a class="bible" href="/Joel+2%3A32/" title="Joel 2:32">2:32</a>) roles. The outpouring of the Spirit is also related to repentance: those who are saved call “on the name of the <span class="divine-name small-caps"><span class="small-caps-upper">L</span><span class="small-caps-lower">ord</span></span>” (<a class="bible" href="/Joel+2%3A32/" title="Joel 2:32">2:32</a>). The giving of the Spirit is the ultimate evidence of God “in the midst of” his people (<a class="bible" href="/Isaiah+63%3A11/" title="Isaiah 63:11">Isa. 63:11</a>; see <a class="bible" href="/Haggai+2%3A5/" title="Haggai 2:5">Hag. 2:5</a>).</li> </ol> <h2 id="introduction-to-joel-outline">Outline</h2> <ol><li class="outline">The Judgment against Judah and the Day of the Lord (<a class="bible" href="/Joel+1%3A1%E2%80%932%3A17/" title="Joel 1:1–2:17">1:1–2:17</a>) <ol><li class="outline">Locust invasion: forerunner of the day of the Lord (<a class="bible" href="/Joel+1%3A1%E2%80%9320/" title="Joel 1:1–20">1:1–20</a>)</li> <li class="outline">Army invasion: the arrival of the day of the Lord (<a class="bible" href="/Joel+2%3A1%E2%80%9317/" title="Joel 2:1–17">2:1–17</a>)</li> </ol> </li> <li class="outline">The Mercy of the Lord and Judgment against the Nations (<a class="bible" href="/Joel+2%3A18%E2%80%933%3A21/" title="Joel 2:18–3:21">2:18–3:21</a>) <ol><li class="outline">Mercy: the Lord responds by restoring his people (<a class="bible" href="/Joel+2%3A18%E2%80%9332/" title="Joel 2:18–32">2:18–32</a>)</li> <li class="outline">Judgment: the Lord’s judgment against the nations and his dwelling with his people (<a class="bible" href="/Joel+3%3A1%E2%80%9321/" title="Joel 3:1–21">3:1–21</a>)</li> </ol> </li> </ol> <h2 id="introduction-to-joel-the-setting-of-joel">The Setting of Joel</h2> <div class="object map" id="map-29-01-embedded"> <h4>c. 500 <span class="time small-caps"><span class="small-caps-lower">b.c.</span></span>?</h4> <p>Though there is much debate about the date of Joel’s prophecies, it is likely that they occurred during a national calamity sometime after Judah returned from exile in Babylon.</p> <p class="image"> <a class="object-full" href="https://static.esvmedia.org/media/esv-global-study-bible/images/big/map_29_01.jpg"> <img src="https://static.esvmedia.org/media/esv-global-study-bible/images/medium/map_29_01.jpg" alt="The Setting of Joel" width="657" height="700"/> </a> </p> </div> </div>
