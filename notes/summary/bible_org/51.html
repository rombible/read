<h2>I. AUTHOR: THE APOSTLE PAUL<a name="_ftnref2"></a><a href="#_ftn2"><sup>2</sup></a></h2>
<p class="taba">A. External Evidence: Paul is strongly affirmed to be the author of Colossians</p>
<p class="tabb">1. Colossians was undisputedly Pauline until the nineteenth century</p>
<p class="tabc">a. The Later Church Fathers accepted it<a name="_ftnref3"></a><a href="#_ftn3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p class="tabc">b. It was not disputed in the later decades:</p>
<p class="tabd">1) It was probably used as early Justin<a name="_ftnref4"></a><a href="#_ftn4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p class="tabd">2) It was included in Marcion’s canonical list (c. 140) and in the Muratorian canon (c. 170)</p>
<p class="tabb">2. This letter is included in the Chester Beatty papyri (P<span style="font-size:8pt; vertical-align:super">46</span>)<a name="_ftnref5"></a><a href="#_ftn5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p class="taba">B. Internal Evidence:<a name="_ftnref6"></a><a href="#_ftn6"><sup>6</sup></a> Even though there are concerns by modern, critical scholars about Pauline authorship, the evidence for Pauline authorship is not overturned:</p>
<p class="tabb">1. The primary objections to Pauline authorship are the divergence in literary style, vocabulary, and syntax from Paul’s other writings.<a name="_ftnref7"></a><a href="#_ftn7"><sup>7</sup></a> Also it was believed that Paul was combating the heresy of second-century Gnosticism<br /><br />But literary differences can be explained by appealing to the new content of the letter, the heresy which he is addressing, and Paul’s adaptation of traditional material. Also, there is no need to understand the heresy as a second-century Gnosticism (see below)</p>
<p class="tabb">2. There are close links between Colossians and Philemon (the latter of which is generally unquestioned as a genuine work of Paul):</p>
<p class="tabc">a. Both include Paul and Timothy’s name in the opening greeting (Col. 1:1; Phm. 1)</p>
<p class="tabc">b. Both include greetings from those with Paul at this time, namely, Aristarchus, Mark, Epaphras, Luke, and Demas (Col. 4:10-14; Phm. 23,24)</p>
<p class="tabc">c. Archippus is called a “fellow-soldier” in Philemon 2 and directed to fulfill his ministry in Colossians 4:17</p>
<p class="tabc">d. Onesimus, concerning whom Philemon is written, is mentioned in Colossians 4:9 as being sent with Tychicus and as bring “one of you”</p>
<p class="tabb">3. Paul is specifically identified in the letter to the Colossians:</p>
<p class="tabc">a. The mention of Timothy along with Paul in the prescript is customary in the undisputed letters of Paul<a name="_ftnref8"></a><a href="#_ftn8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p class="tabc">b. The author follows the Pauline practice of conveying his personal greetings from his fellow workers to the congregation by means of a dispatched message (4:8)</p>
<p class="tabc">c. The author follows the Pauline practice of closing the letter with his personal signature, as well as, making mention of his own situation as prisoner<a name="_ftnref9"></a><a href="#_ftn9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p class="tabc">d. Paul is identified in the body of the letter (1:23ff)</p>
<p class="tabc">e. Paul ties his apostleship to the same tradition of Jesus Christ (1:23ff; 2:6)</p>
<p class="tabc">f. The expression, “I, Paul” is typical in the Pauline corpus to render his <em>persona</em><a name="_ftnref10"></a><a href="#_ftn10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h2>II. LOCATION AND DATE: FROM ROME IN AD 60-61.</h2>
<p class="taba">A. Location:<a name="_ftnref11"></a><a href="#_ftn11"><sup>11</sup></a> Paul’s (first) Roman Imprisonment:</p>
<p class="tabb">1. Until recently, Rome was considered by most to be the location from which Paul wrote<a name="_ftnref12"></a><a href="#_ftn12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p class="tabb">2. Caesarea: Some<a name="_ftnref13"></a><a href="#_ftn13"><sup>13</sup></a> understand Caesarea to be the location of writing, but this is unlikely for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="tabc">a. It is unlikely that a runaway slave (Philemon) would have fled to Caesarea to escape detection and would have found access to Paul like he would have in Rome (where Paul was under house-arrest)</p>
<p class="tabc">b. Paul expects to be released in the near future since he requests Philemon to prepare him lodging (Phm. 22) and this probably would not have been the case at Caesarea where Paul knew that his only hope was to appeal to Caesar</p>
<p class="tabc">c. It is unlikely that Caesarea was the home of active missionary work requiring such a large staff of Paul’s co-workers of Gentile origin for Philemon to seek refuge, and it does not seem that this small harbor city was the center of vigorous propaganda suggested in Colossians 4:3,4<a name="_ftnref14"></a><a href="#_ftn14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p class="tabb">3. Ephesus:<a name="_ftnref15"></a><a href="#_ftn15"><sup>15</sup></a> Some<a name="_ftnref16"></a><a href="#_ftn16"><sup>16</sup></a> understand Ephesus to be the location of writing, but this is unlikely for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="tabc">a. No evidence exists to affirm that Paul was imprisoned in Ephesus (Acts 19)<a name="_ftnref17"></a><a href="#_ftn17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p class="tabc">b. It is unlikely that a runaway slave (Philemon) would have fled to Ephesus and remained there long enough to know Paul since it was no more than 100 miles away from Colossae</p>
<p class="tabc">c. The “we” sections of Acts do not allow for Luke to have been with Paul while he was in Ephesus (Acts 16:10ff; 20:6,13ff; cf. Col. 4:14)</p>
<p class="tabb">4. Rome:<a name="_ftnref18"></a><a href="#_ftn18"><sup>18</sup></a> The most probably location of writing was probably Rome for the following reasons</p>
<p class="tabc">a. This is a known imprisonment of Paul’s which allows for the events reflected in Colossians and Philemon</p>
<p class="tabc">b. Acts supports Luke’s presence in Rome with Paul (the “we” sections; Acts 27:2ff)</p>
<p class="tabc">c. Paul was under house-arrest in Rome which would have allowed him visitors such as co-workers and Onesimus</p>
<p class="tabc">d. The imperial capital would have allowed the run-away slave Onesimus to seek anonymity and then asylum in Paul’s presence there</p>
<p class="tabc">e. No other imprisonment in Acts seems to be a real alternative (Philippi in Acts 16:23-40; Caesarea in Acts 24:27)</p>
<p class="tabc">f. Travel between Rome and the east was frequent and not too formidable a task to make the communications between the prison epistles possible</p>
<p class="tabc">g. Although not determinative, the doctrinal outlook of Colossians seems to belong to a later rather than to an earlier period supporting a Roman origin over one in Ephesus<a name="_ftnref19"></a><a href="#_ftn19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p class="tabc">h. It is very probable that Aristarchus accompanied Paul to Rome (Acts 27:2; cf. Col. 4:10) and thus shared in his imprisonment</p>
<p class="tabc">i. Even though Paul intended to go on to Spain from Rome (Rom. 1:10ff; 15:19ff) it is not possible to know with certainty what he did upon his release. He could have changed his mind, or at least changed his immediate plans and thus gone to Colossae</p>
<p class="taba">B. Date: If the Roman hypothesis is accepted, then it is likely that Paul wrote Colossians early<a name="_ftnref20"></a><a href="#_ftn20"><sup>20</sup></a> in his (first) Roman imprisonment (i.e., AD 60-61)</p>
<h2>III. THE COLOSSIAN HERESY<a name="_ftnref21"></a><a href="#_ftn21"><sup>21</sup></a></h2>
<p class="taba">A. The Nature of the Heresy--Explicit and Implicit Indications about the Colossian Problem:<a name="_ftnref22"></a><a href="#_ftn22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p class="tabb">1. Explicit Teaching of the Opponents:</p>
<p class="tabc">a. It emphasized abstinence from certain foods and some types of drink 2:16,22</p>
<p class="tabc">b. It required the observance of Jewish feasts and sabbaths at different intervals 2:16</p>
<p class="tabc">c. It stressed “self-abasement” and visions 2:18,23</p>
<p class="tabc">d. It involved angelic worship--either as the object of worship <em>or</em> as the subject of worship (i.e., doing worship) 2:18</p>
<p class="tabc">e. It taught the need for some kind of worship which was human in origin, a “self-made religion-worship 2:23</p>
<p class="tabc">f. It praised the value of treating the body severely 2:23<a name="_ftnref23"></a><a href="#_ftn23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p class="tabc">g. It was depicted by Paul as “Philosophy and empty deceit” espousing the “elementary principles of the world” (2:8)</p>
<p class="tabb">2. Implicit References in the Book:</p>
<p class="tabc">a. It demoted Christ from his supreme place 1:13-20; 2:9ff</p>
<p class="tabc">b. It seems to have as a catchword the term/phrase “fullness” [of deity] 1:19; 2:9</p>
<p class="tabc">c. It claimed to promote higher spirituality. Paul counters with the argument that they are spiritually complete in Christ (2:10) and warns that the rules and regulations of this religious system only promote the indulgence of the flesh 2:23</p>
<p class="tabc">d. It probably required circumcision of adherents 2:11; cf. 3:11</p>
<p class="tabc">e. It may have misconstrued the death-burial-resurrection motif 2:12,13,20; 3:1-5</p>
<p class="tabc">f. It cast doubt on the completeness of forgiveness in Christ 1:14; 2:13-14; 3:13</p>
<p class="taba">B. Possible Sources of the Heresy:<a name="_ftnref24"></a><a href="#_ftn24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p class="tabb">1. Essenism:</p>
<p class="tabc">a. B. Lightfoot was the major proponent of this position affirming many parallels between the Heresy and the asceticism of this Jewish group<a name="_ftnref25"></a><a href="#_ftn25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p class="tabc">b. Even though there are some parallels, there is no evidence that they lived in the western portions of Asia Minor</p>
<p class="tabc">c. While this explains the emphasis on higher knowledge and special revelation, it fails to explain the mystical experiences which are apparent in the epistle</p>
<p class="tabb">2. Greek Pagan Cults:</p>
<p class="tabc">a. There are many theories along this line of thinking: Neopythagoreanism, mystery religions, pre-Christian Gnosticism, the Iranian Redemption myth, the initiation into the Isis mysteries</p>
<p class="tabc">b. This is an attempt to emphasize the Hellenism on the church at the time</p>
<p class="tabc">c. While some of these “cults” actually fight against one another, there is no doubt that the Heresy in Colossae was influenced by the Hellenism of their day; it is difficult to be even more specific</p>
<p class="tabb">3. Gnosticism:</p>
<p class="tabc">a. Gnosticism was a “religious movement that proclaimed a mystical esotericism for the elect based on illumination and the acquisition of a higher knowledge of things heavenly and divine”<a name="_ftnref26"></a><a href="#_ftn26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p class="tabc">b. However, there was not a pre-Christian Gnosticism and it is doubtful that the biblical writers were fighting a known foe called Gnosticism</p>
<p class="tabc">c. There may well have be roots of a Christian Gnosticism (incipient Gnosticism) which later became the Gnosticism of the second and third centuries AD</p>
<p class="tabb">4. Syncretistic Religion:</p>
<p class="tabc">a. The heresy contains a combination of parts of many of the above views wherein Jews and Gentiles are attempting to advance beyond apostolic Christianity</p>
<p class="tabc">b. This view is very possible and perhaps even diplomatic</p>
<p class="tabb">5. Jewish Mysticism--the <em>Merkabah</em> Mysticism<a name="_ftnref27"></a><a href="#_ftn27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p class="tabc">a. The <em>merkabah</em> mysticism consisted of “religious exercises designed to facilitate entry into the vision of the heavenly chariot (hb*K*r+m#) with God visibly enthroned above it--the vision granted to Ezekiel when he was called to his prophetic ministry (Ezek. 1:15-28)”<a name="_ftnref28"></a><a href="#_ftn28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p class="tabc">b. In order to obtain such a vision it was necessary to observe:</p>
<p class="tabd">1) The Mosaic Law concerning purification</p>
<p class="tabd">2) A period of asceticism of 12 to 40 days</p>
<p class="tabd">3) The mediatorial role of angels when the heavenly ascent was attempted</p>
<p class="tabc">c. There are possible parallels to this concept in rabbinic experience, Paul’s experience (2 Cor. 12), other Jewish writings like 1 Enoch 14:8-23, Daniel 7:9-10, and later Gnostocism<a name="_ftnref29"></a><a href="#_ftn29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p class="tabb">6. Conclusion:</p>
<p class="tabc">a. A definitive conclusion about the source of the heresy is not possible since so many possibilities exist</p>
<p class="tabc">b. It is very possible, however, that the view of Jewish mysticism is more closely tied to the heresy in view of the Jewish elements which are certainly involved</p>
<p class="tabc">c. Perhaps this Jewish mysticism became a later expression of Gnosticism</p> 
<h2>IV. ORIGIN OF THE CHURCH:</h2>
<p class="taba">A. The City of Colossae:</p>
<p class="tabb">1. Was in the Lycus valley</p>
<p class="tabb">2. Was about 100 miles east (inland) of Ephesus</p>
<p class="tabb">3. Had the important cities of Laodicea and Hierapolis as its neighbors where Christian churches had been established (Col. 4:13)</p>
<p class="taba">B. The Founding of the Church:</p>
<p class="tabb">1. It seems that Paul had never visited the church (Col. 1:4; 2:1)</p>
<p class="tabb">2. It seems that Epaphras acquainted Paul with the Colossians’ ‘love in the Spirit’ (Col. 1:8; 4:12-13)</p>
<p class="tabb">3. It seems reasonable to assume that the church originated as a result of Paul’s ministry among those at Ephesus (Acts 19:10)</p>
<p class="tabc">a. Perhaps this was actually accomplished through Ephahras who instructed those in Colossae (Col. 1:12-13)</p>
<p class="tabc">b. Therefore, perhaps Ephahras was converted through Paul’s ministry in Ephesus</p>
<h2>V. PURPOSES FOR COLOSSIANS:</h2>
<p class="taba">A. To provide advice about the dangerous heresy which had arisen in Colossae and was threatening the security of the church in all of the Lycus valley (cf. 4:16)</p>
<p class="taba">B. To answer the heretical issues by asserting the absolute, direct, and continuing supremacy of Christ over all of creation (1:15--3:4)</p>
<p class="taba">C. To encourage his readers to live life (personally, within the church, in the home, and in their relationships) in view of Christ as supreme over all of creation (3:5--4:6)</p>
<p class="taba">D. To encourage the churches in the Lycus valley to maintain their orderly Christian lives as well as their stability in the faith in the face of the threat of the false teachers 2:2-5<a name="_ftnref30"></a><a href="#_ftn30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

Although Bruce once held to an “early and simple form of gnosticism” (<em>Paul: Apostle of the Heart Set Free</em>, p. 413), he later changed to a defense of a form of Jewish Mysticism which he identifies as “<em>Merkabah</em> Mysticism” in “Colossian Problems Part 3: The Colossian Heresy,” <em>Bib.

Lindars and S. S. Smalley (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1973), pp. 315-331. However, Bruce seems to be correct when he affirms that “Yes, there were false teachers in Colossae” (“The Colossian Heresy,” <em>Bib Sac</em> 141 [1984]: 195; see also <em>Paul: Apostle of the Heart Set Free</em>, p. 413).</p>

The false teachers were threatening unified living under the work of Christ (in the home and toward outsiders).
