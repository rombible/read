<h3>I. AUTHOR--MOSES: Particular internal evidence argues that Moses was the author of most of Deuteronomy. There was also an editor who concluded the book after Moses&#8217; death</h3>


<p class=bodyblock>A. Moses was the author of most of Deuteronomy:</p>


<p class=taba>1. These are the words Moses spoke at the Transjordan (1:1-5)  across from the Jordan in the valley opposite Beth-peor in the land of Sihon (4:44-49), in the land of Moab (29:1)</p>


<p class=taba>2. &#8220;Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel ... I am 121 years old ... no longer able to come and go ...&#8221; and not allowed to cross the Jordan (31:1-2)</p>


<p class=taba>3. 40 years after what should have been an 11 day journey Moses spoke to the children of Israel according to all that YHWH had commanded him to give to them 1:2-3</p>


<p class=taba>4. Moses says, &#8220;The LORD our God&#8221; 1:6</p>


<p class=taba>5. All throughout chapters 1-4 Moses refers to himself as among the people:  &#8220;<b>we</b>&#8221; (1:19; 2:1,8; 3:1,4,6,7,12), &#8220;<b>I and you</b>&#8221; (1:9,13,15,16,20,24,29,43; 3:13,15,16,18,19,20,21,23; 4:1,2,5,8ff; 5:5; 6:2; 8:1,19; 9:9,15-21,25-26; 10:2-3,5,10; 12:32; 13:18; 30:15,18,19; 31:2 ), &#8220;<b>me</b>&#8221;(1:14,17,22,23,37,41,42; 2:1,9 17; 3:2; 4:5; 6:1; 10:11; 18:15 ), &#8220;<b>our</b>&#8221; (1:6,19,20,25; 3:3; 5:2,3; 9:10), &#8220;<b>us</b>&#8221; (1:20,25; 3:1; 5:2), <b>to this day</b> (8:18)</p>


<p class=bodyblock>B. Someone beyond Moses concluded the book of Deuteronomy:</p>


<p class=taba>1. The parenthetical discussion of the need for Israel not to take the land The Lord has given to another just as the nation will take the land of thier possession is presented in the past tense indicating that it was written after Israel had already taken the land and thus after Moses died: &#8220;just as Israel did to the land of their possession which the LORD gave to them&#8221; (2:10-12)</p>


<p class=taba>2. &#8220;As it is to this day&#8221; (3:14) seems to imply a later editor.</p>


<p class=taba>3. The settings are written from a 3rd person perspective &#8220;this is the ... which Moses ....&#8221; (1:1-5; 4:41-43,44--5:1a; 27:1; 29:1; 31:1,30; 32:48; 33:1).  This could have been done by Moses as well as an &#8220;editor.&#8221;</p>


<p class=taba>4. The final chapter is written in the the 3rd person (except for 34:4 which is a direct discourse of the Lord with Moses from Mt. Nebo).  This could have been added by Joshua with the Lord&#8217;s words communicated by Moses to him just before he died or communicated by the Lord to him.  However one phrase, &#8220;since then no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses&#8221; sounds as though it goes beyond Joshua to a time when Israel was an established nation in the land.  Beyond that one can not be certain of the timing of this last chapter</p>


<h3>II. DATE: The internal record of the chronology from Egypt to Moab is helpful in a reconstruction of the date of 1406 B.C. (or following) for the writing of Deuteronomy:</h3>


<p class=bodyblock>A. The people departed from Egypt on the fifteenth day of the first month--March/April [Nisan] 15, 1446 (Num 33:3; cf. Ex. 12:2 ,5)</p>


<p class=bodyblock>B. The people reached the wilderness of Sinai on the first day of the third month--May/June [Sivan] 1, 1446 (Ex 19:1)</p>


<p class=bodyblock>C. The tabernacle was erected on the first day of the first month of the second year--March/April [Nisan] 1, 1445 (Ex. 40:17)</p>


<p class=bodyblock>D. Leviticus is given during the one month interval immediately following the filling of the Tabernacle by the glory of YHWH and before the people prepared to leave Sinai for the promised land--March/April [Nisan] 1-30, 1445 (Num 1:1; cf. Ex 40:17)</p>


<p class=bodyblock>E. Numbers opens with a census taken on the first day of the second month in the second year--April/May [Iyyar or Ziv] 1, 1445 (Num 1:1)</p>


<p class=bodyblock>F. The cloud is taken up to begin to lead the people to the promised land from the wilderness of Sinai on the twentieth day of the second month of the second year--April/May [Iyyar or Ziv] 20, 1445 (Num 10:11)</p>


<p class=bodyblock>G. The people sin at Kadesh=Barnea (Num 13--14) and are sentenced to wander 40 years in the wilderness (Num 14:33). Numbers covers 38 years and nine months (cf. Num 1:1 with Deut 1:3)</p>


<p class=bodyblock>H. Aaron dies on Mount Hor on the first day of the fifth month in the fortieth year--July/August [Ab] 1, 1406 (Num 33:38)</p>


<p class=bodyblock>I. Deuteronomy opens on the Transjordan on the first day or the eleventh month of the fortieth year after what should have been an eleven day journey--January/February [Shebat] 1, 1406 (Deut 1:1-3</p>


<p class=bodyblock>J. Therefore, a more precise date for the giving of the book of Deuteronomy would be January or February 1, 1406 B.C.</p>
