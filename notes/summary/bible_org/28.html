<h3>I. AUTHOR: Hosea</h3>


<p class=bodyblock>A. His name, <font face="Hebrew">u^<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e492a48b8c">[email&#160;protected]</a></font>, means &#8220;salvation&#8221; and should be spelled &#8220;Hoshea&#8221; but has come down in English as Hosea.  This does distinguish him from the last king of Israel (Hoshea c. 732-722)</p>


<p class=bodyblock>B. He is the son of Beeri</p>


<p class=bodyblock>C. Unlike Amos, Hosea preached to his own people in Israel</p>


<p class=bodyblock>D. He may have been among the priests in his station in view of his knowledge concerning religious affairs, but this is not certain</p>


<p class=bodyblock>E. He had three children who played a vital part in his message to the nation of Israel :</p>


<p class=taba>1. Jezreel (<font face="Hebrew"> laurzy </font>) &#8220;God sows&#8221; (1:4)</p>


<p class=taba>2. Lo-ruhamah ( <font face="Hebrew">hmjr al </font>) &#8220;No compassion&#8221; (1:6f)</p>


<p class=taba>3. Lo-ammi ( <font face="Hebrew">ymu al </font>) &#8220;Not my people&#8221; (1:8ff)<br>[In 2:4 there is the suggestion that the second and third child may not have been Hosea&#8217;s, but from an adulterous relationship]</p>


<p class=bodyblock>F. Chapters one and three provide little biographical information since they primarily teach about Israel</p>


<h3>II. DATE :790-686 B.C.</h3>


<p class=bodyblock>A. The first verse of chapter one provides a historical setting:</p>


<p class=taba>1. During the following kings of Judah:</p>


<p class=tabb>a. Uzziah 790-739</p>


<p class=tabb>b. Jotham 750-731</p>


<p class=tabb>c. Ahaz  735-715</p>


<p class=tabb>d. Hezekiah 729-686</p>


<p class=taba>2. During the reign of Jeroboam II the son of Joash (793-753) in Israel</p>


<p class=taba>3. It seems that Hosea lived beyond the captivity of Israel in 722 since Hezekiah&#8217;s reign is mentioned</p>


<p class=bodyblock>B. The Kings of Assyria which span this time are:</p>


<p class=taba>1. Tiglath-Pileser III (745-727)</p>


<p class=taba>2. Shalmaneser V (727-722)</p>


<p class=taba>3. Sargon II (722-705)</p>


<p class=taba>4. Sennacherib (705-681)</p>


<h3>III. HISTORICAL SETTING:</h3>


<p class=bodyblock>A. Even though the latter part of Jeroboam&#8217;s reign brought about prosperity (see discussion in Amos outline) it ended with chaos as four kings reigned in one year (753 B.C.: Jeroboam, Zechariah, Shallum and Menahem)</p>


<p class=bodyblock>B. Tiglath-Pileser forced Menahem into submission</p>


<p class=bodyblock>C. Tiglath-Pileser defeated Pekah and placed Hoshea on the throne</p>


<p class=bodyblock>D. Hoshea rebelled and was defeated by Shalmaneser V in his taking of Samaria and the deportation of the people in 722 B.C. </p>


<p class=bodyblock>E. Hosea may have begun his ministry during the end of Jeroboam II&#8217;s reign and on through that of Zechariah, Shallum, Menanhem, Pekahiah, Pekah, and Hoshea:</p>


<p class=taba>1. In 1:4 the assumption is that Hosea began his ministry while Jeroboam was alive (cf. 1:1 with 1:4)</p>


<p class=taba>2. The list of the kings of Judah implies that his ministry continued through (past) the times of the kings of Israel (1:1)</p>


<p class=taba>3. If the time of Amos was one of inner crumbling for Israel, the time of Hosea was characterized by a steady decline as the stability of the kingly line fell and Assyria increased her grip and ultimate defeat of the nation</p>


<h3>IV. AUDIENCE: Primarily to the people of the northern kingdom, Israel, but also to the southern kingdom of Judah (southern Kings in 1:1)</h3>


<h3>V. PURPOSES FOR THE BOOK:</h3>


<p class=bodyblock>A. To call Israel and Judah to repentance in Yahweh, the God of loyal love</p>


<p class=bodyblock>B. To reveal the faithlessness of the nation toward their covenant with Yahweh</p>


<p class=bodyblock>C. To indict the nation of its lack of knowledge, loyal love, and faithfulness</p>
