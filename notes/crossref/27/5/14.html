In the days of your father he was found to have insight, intelligence, and wisdom like that of the gods. Your father, King Nebuchadnezzar, appointed him chief of the magicians, enchanters, astrologers, and diviners. Your own father, the king,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-12.htm">Daniel 5:12</a></span><br />did this because Daniel, the one he named Belteshazzar, was found to have an extraordinary spirit, as well as knowledge, understanding, and the ability to interpret dreams, explain riddles, and solve difficult problems. Summon Daniel, therefore, and he will give you the interpretation."<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-13.htm">Daniel 5:13</a></span><br />So Daniel was brought before the king, who asked him, "Are you Daniel, one of the exiles my father the king brought from Judah?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-15.htm">Daniel 5:15</a></span><br />Now the wise men and enchanters were brought before me to read this inscription and interpret it for me, but they could not give its interpretation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-3.htm">Daniel 6:3</a></span><br />Soon, by his extraordinary spirit, Daniel distinguished himself among the administrators and satraps.
