She has become a lair for demons and a haunt for every unclean spirit, every unclean bird, and every detestable beast.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-13.htm">Isaiah 23:13</a></span><br />Look at the land of the Chaldeans--a people now of no account. The Assyrians destined it for the desert creatures; they set up their siege towers and stripped its palaces. They brought it to ruin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-14.htm">Isaiah 32:14</a></span><br />For the palace will be forsaken, the busy city abandoned. The hill and the watchtower will become caves forever--the delight of wild donkeys and a pasture for flocks--<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-11.htm">Isaiah 34:11</a></span><br />The desert owl and screech owl will possess it, and the great owl and raven will dwell in it.
