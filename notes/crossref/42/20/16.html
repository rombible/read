He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-27.htm">Luke 19:27</a></span><br />And these enemies of mine who were unwilling for me to rule over them, bring them here and slay them in front of me.'"<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-15.htm">Luke 20:15</a></span><br />So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-4.htm">Romans 3:4</a></span><br />Absolutely not! Let God be true and every man a liar. As it is written: "So that You may be justified in Your words, and prevail in Your judgments."<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-6.htm">Romans 3:6</a></span><br />By no means! In that case, how could God judge the world?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-31.htm">Romans 3:31</a></span><br />Do we, then, nullify the Law by this faith? By no means! Instead, we uphold the Law.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-2.htm">Romans 6:2</a></span><br />By no means! How can we who died to sin live in it any longer?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-15.htm">Romans 6:15</a></span><br />What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law, but under grace? By no means!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7</a></span><br />What then shall we say? Is the Law sin? By no means! Indeed, I would not have been mindful of sin if not for the Law. For I would not have been aware of coveting if the Law had not said, "Do not covet."<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-13.htm">Romans 7:13</a></span><br />Did that which is good, then, become death to me? Certainly not! But in order that sin might be exposed as sin, it produced death in me through what was good, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-14.htm">Romans 9:14</a></span><br />What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Absolutely not!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-1.htm">Romans 11:1</a></span><br />I ask then, did God reject His people? Certainly not! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11</a></span><br />I ask then, did they stumble so as to lose their share? Absolutely not! However, because of their trespass, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel jealous.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-15.htm">1 Corinthians 6:15</a></span><br />Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute? Never!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-17.htm">Galatians 2:17</a></span><br />But if, while we seek to be justified in Christ, we ourselves are found to be sinners, does that make Christ a minister of sin? Absolutely not!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-21.htm">Galatians 3:21</a></span><br />Is the Law, then, opposed to the promises of God? Not at all! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come from the Law.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-14.htm">Galatians 6:14</a></span><br />But as for me, may I never boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Chapter Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-1.htm">Jesus confirms his authority by a question of John's baptism.</a></span><br><span class="reftext">9. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-9.htm">The parable of the vineyard.</a></span><br><span class="reftext">19. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-19.htm">Of giving tribute to Caesar.</a></span><br><span class="reftext">27. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-27.htm">He instructs the Sadducees, who denied the resurrection.</a></span><br><span class="reftext">41. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-41.htm">How Jesus is the Son of David.</a></span><br><span class="reftext">45. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-45.htm">He warns his disciples to beware of the scribes.</a></span><br><div class="vheading2">Jump to Previous</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-15.htm">Death</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-47.htm">Destroy</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-29.htm">Destruction</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-41.htm">Exclaimed</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-14.htm">Farmers</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-16.htm">Forbid</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-15.htm">Garden</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-11.htm">Heard</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-26.htm">Hearers</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-14.htm">Husbandmen</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-14.htm">Kill</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-24.htm">Others</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-14.htm">Tenants</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-14.htm">Vine-Dressers</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-14.htm">Vine-Growers</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-15.htm">Vineyard</a><div class="vheading2">Jump to Next</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-36.htm">Death</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-2.htm">Destroy</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-18.htm">Destruction</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-38.htm">Exclaimed</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-6.htm">Farmers</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-47.htm">Forbid</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-1.htm">Garden</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-71.htm">Heard</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-21.htm">Hearers</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-6.htm">Husbandmen</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-2.htm">Kill</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-47.htm">Others</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-23.htm">Tenants</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-12.htm">Vine-Dressers</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-33.htm">Vine-Growers</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-7.htm">Vineyard</a></div></div></td></tr></table><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="combox"><div class="padcom"><div class="vheading">Treasury of Scripture Knowledge</div><p class="hdg">destroy.</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-27.htm">Luke 19:27</a><br />And these enemies of mine who were unwilling for me to rule over them, bring them here and slay them in front of me.'"</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-8.htm">Psalm 2:8, 9</a><br />Ask Me, and I will make the nations Your inheritance, the ends of the earth Your possession. . . . </p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-8.htm">Psalm 21:8-10</a><br />Your hand will apprehend all your enemies; Your right hand will seize those who hate you. . . . </p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-41.htm">Matthew 21:41</a><br />"He will bring those wretches to a wretched end, " they declared, "and will rent out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him his fruits in their seasons."</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-7.htm">Matthew 22:7</a><br />The king was enraged.
