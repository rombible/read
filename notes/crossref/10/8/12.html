He measured off with two lengths those to be put to death, and with one length those to be spared. So the Moabites became subject to David and brought him tribute.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-14.htm">2 Samuel 10:14</a></span><br />When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans had fled, they too fled before Abishai, and they entered the city.
