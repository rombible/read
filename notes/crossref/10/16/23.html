So the conspiracy gained strength, and Absalom's following kept increasing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-31.htm">2 Samuel 15:31</a></span><br />Now someone told David: "Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom." So David pleaded, "O LORD, please turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness!"<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-1.htm">2 Samuel 17:1</a></span><br />Furthermore, Ahithophel said to Absalom, "Let me choose twelve thousand men and set out tonight in pursuit of David.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-14.htm">2 Samuel 17:14</a></span><br />Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, "The advice of Hushai the Archite is better than that of Ahithophel." For the LORD had purposed to thwart the good counsel of Ahithophel, in order to bring disaster on Absalom.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-23.htm">2 Samuel 17:23</a></span><br />When Ahithophel saw that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey and set out for his house in his hometown. He put his affairs in order and hanged himself. So he died and was buried in his father's tomb.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="vheading">Chapter Outline</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-1.htm">Ziba, by presents and false suggestions, obtains his master's inheritance</a></span><br><span class="reftext">5. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-5.htm">At Bahurim, Shimei curses David</a></span><br><span class="reftext">9. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-9.htm">David with patience abstains, and restrains others, from revenge</a></span><br><span class="reftext">15. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-15.htm">Hushai insinuates himself into Absalom's counsel</a></span><br><span class="reftext">20. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-20.htm">Ahithophel's counsel</a></span><br><div class="vheading2">Jump to Previous</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-22.htm">Absalom</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-22.htm">Ab'salom</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-20.htm">Advice</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-21.htm">Ahithophel</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-21.htm">Ahith'ophel</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-34.htm">Ahithophel's</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-23.htm">Consulted</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-20.htm">Counsel</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-37.htm">Counseled</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-14.htm">Counselled</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-13.htm">David</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-34.htm">Direction</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-22.htm">Esteemed</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-25.htm">Highly</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-16.htm">Inquired</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-20.htm">Inquires</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-11.htm">Inquireth</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-8.htm">Opinions</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-23.htm">Oracle</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-13.htm">Regarded</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-24.htm">Valued</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-36.htm">Word</a><div class="vheading2">Jump to Next</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-1.htm">Absalom</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-1.htm">Ab'salom</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-4.htm">Advice</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-1.htm">Ahithophel</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-1.htm">Ahith'ophel</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-7.htm">Ahithophel's</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-6.htm">Consulted</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-7.htm">Counsel</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-15.htm">Counseled</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-7.htm">Counselled</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-1.htm">David</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-26.htm">Direction</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-12.htm">Esteemed</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-9.htm">Highly</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-1.htm">Inquired</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-6.htm">Inquires</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-9.htm">Inquireth</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-21.htm">Opinions</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-1.htm">Oracle</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-29.htm">Regarded</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-27.htm">Valued</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-6.htm">Word</a></div></div></td></tr></table><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="combox"><div class="padcom"><div class="vheading">Treasury of Scripture Knowledge</div><p class="hdg">as if</p><p class="tskverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a><br />He shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who will seek counsel for him before the LORD by the judgment of the Urim.
