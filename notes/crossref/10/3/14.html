But Saul intended to cause David's death at the hands of the Philistines.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-27.htm">1 Samuel 18:27</a></span><br />David and his men went out and killed two hundred Philistines. He brought their foreskins and presented them as payment in full to become the king's son-in-law. Then Saul gave his daughter Michal to David in marriage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-44.htm">1 Samuel 25:44</a></span><br />But
