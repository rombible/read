Why should I strike you to the ground? How could I show my face to your brother Joab?"<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-23.htm">2 Samuel 2:23</a></span><br />But Asahel refused to turn away; so Abner thrust the butt of his spear into his stomach, and it came out his back, and he fell dead on the spot. And every man paused when he came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-26.htm">2 Samuel 3:26</a></span><br />As soon as Joab had left David, he sent messengers after Abner, who brought him back from the well of Sirah; but David was unaware of it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-28.htm">2 Samuel 3:28</a></span><br />Afterward, David heard about this and said, "I and my kingdom are forever guiltless before the LORD concerning the blood of Abner son of Ner.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-1.htm">2 Samuel 4:1</a></span><br />Now when Ish-bosheth son of Saul heard that Abner had died in Hebron, he lost courage, and all Israel was dismayed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-26.htm">2 Samuel 13:26</a></span><br />"If not," said Absalom, "please let my brother Amnon go with us." "Why should he go with you?" the king asked.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-13.htm">2 Samuel 19:13</a></span><br />And say to Amasa, 'Aren't you my flesh and blood? May God punish me, and ever so severely, if from this time you are not the commander of my army in place of Joab!'"<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-9.htm">2 Samuel 20:9</a></span><br />"Are you well, my brother?" Joab asked Amasa.

And Joab did not need to strike him again, for Amasa was dead. Then Joab and his brother Abishai pursued Sheba son of Bichri.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-5.htm">1 Kings 2:5</a></span><br />Moreover, you know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me and what he did to Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether, the two commanders of the armies of Israel. He killed them in peacetime to avenge the blood of war. He stained with the blood of war the belt around his waist and the sandals on his feet.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-32.htm">1 Kings 2:32</a></span><br />The LORD will bring his bloodshed back upon his own head, for without the knowledge of my father David he struck down two men more righteous and better than he when he killed with the sword Abner son of Ner, commander of Israel's army, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of Judah's army.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="crossverse"><a
